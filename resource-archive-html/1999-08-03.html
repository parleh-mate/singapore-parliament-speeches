<div align="center"><b>ELECTED PRESIDENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Protection of reserves)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Prime Minister whether he

will give details of the list of problems with the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>



encountered by the first Elected President during

his term of office.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Prime Minister whether the

Net  Investment Income or income derived from past  reserves  is

defined  as  earnings for past reserves or current reserves  and

whether  there has been a change of definition since the Elected

President's office was created.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Prime Minister whether all

assets  belonging to the state have been accurately  identified,

accounted for and recorded and whether a list of assets  can  be

made available to Parliament.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will

direct  all  Ministries and key Statutory  Boards  to  not  only

maintain  a  complete  listing of  Physical  Assets,  which  are

defined as Reserves, but also ensure that these land parcels and

buildings are properly maintained so as to preserve and  protect

their value.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Prime Minister whether it

will  be possible for the Government to disclose annually, after

the  close  of  the fiscal year, (i) the amount of reserves,  if

any, accumulated during the year by the current Government; (ii)

the portion transferred to the official reserves (guarded by the

President);  and (iii) the remaining amount of cumulative  funds

useable to fund deficits, wherever applicable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will

respond  to  the  President's  comment  that  he  suspects  some

Ministers  may  find  him a nuisance and  that  public  officers

should  change their mindsets and see it as their constitutional

duty to help the Elected President protect the past reserves.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Prime Minister, with regard

to  Net Investment Income (income earned from past reserves), if

he will disclose (i) its magnitude in 1997 and 1998; (ii) the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>



rationale for the recent change  in  its  treatment

from  being  considered  as  part  of  past  reserves  to  being

considered  as  part of current reserves; (iii) whether  such  a

change  is temporary or permanent; and (iv) why it is  still  an

unresolved issue.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau) (for the</b>

<b>Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Questions 1 to 7 are all

related to remarks made by the President at his press conference

on  16th  July  1999.  The Government will  make  a  Ministerial

Statement  addressing fully the issues raised by the  President.

It  had planned to do so today, but in view of the demise of Mrs

Ong Teng Cheong, it has postponed the Statement to a sitting  of

Parliament scheduled for later this month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore request the Speaker's permission to defer

answering  these questions until after the Ministerial Statement

has  been  made, so that the issues can be seen in their  proper

context.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have my permission.

<div align="center"><b>CLOB ISSUE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Status)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister if he

will  give an update on the status of the Clob issue,  and  what

are  the  possible  solutions being considered  to  resolve  the

matter.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I last updated Parliament on the Clob issue in May

1999.    Since then, Mr Akbar Khan's cash offer has closed  with

359  investors out of more than 172,000 accepting.   Three  more

private  sector  offers  have  been  announced,  but  none  have

obtained  regulatory  approvals and been formally  made.   Akbar

Khan's  Straits Fund Sdn Bhd is offering units in  a  closed-end

investment fund in exchange for Clob investors' securities.   It

is  not  yet  known  at what price the Clob securities  will  be

valued  or how Clob investors are to trade these units.   Tungku

Abdullah's  Bintang Melewar Sdn Bhd is offering  Clob  investors

three  options, including units in a closed-end investment fund,

fund management services for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>



larger investors, and custodial services for non-accepting investors.  And the third private sector offer is for

Clob investors to swap their securities for an equal proportion

of shares in Telekom Malaysia and United Engineers of Malaysia

("UEM").  The two companies have said that they will purchase

the Clob securities at a discount to market prices, and sell

shares in Telekom Malaysia and UEM at a premium to market

prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any offeror intending to offer Clob investors shares or

units  in  investment funds for their Clob Malaysian  securities

will  need  to  issue  a  full  prospectus  in  Singapore.  This

prospectus must be approved and registered with the Registry  of

Companies  and  Businesses ("RCB").  The RCB verifies  that  the

prospectuses comply with the disclosure requirements set out  in

Singapore's Companies Act, and will register the documents if it

is  in  the public interest to do so.  In evaluating the  public

interest,  the  Registrar will take into  account  all  relevant

factors   and   considerations.    The   Securities   Investors'

Association of Singapore ("SIAS") has urged the Registrar not to

register  prospectuses of offers until a comprehensive  solution

is  in  place for all Clob investors.  The Registrar has  stated

that  it will take into account the views of the SIAS, which  is

the  only  body  representing investors,   together  with  other

information and views that it may receive regarding the offers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) has stated that it

will  not  stand in the way of private sector offers.   However,

there  should  be  clear  and reasonable arrangements  for  non-accepting investors to trade their shares on the KLSE.  When the

offers  are formally made, investors should study the  terms  of

each  offer  carefully before making a decision.  The  agreement

between  CDP and SCANS contains arrangements for Clob  investors

to  transfer  their securities to individual  account  with  the

Malaysian   Central  Depository,  and  thereafter  trade   these

securities on the KLSE.  SCANS continues to be in breach of this

agreement,   but  investors  should  not  feel  pressured   into

accepting  any  offers  if  they  are  not  satisfied  with  the

offerors' terms.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES is continuing to explore all means of

resolving the problem. It has been taking advice from lawyers on

the legal position.  The SIAS has also announced that it too is

consulting lawyers, as the legal position of the Clob investors

is different from that of the SES.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the SES has submitted a proposal of its own to

the  KLSE, suggesting a staggered release of the Clob securities

over  12 months, without prejudice to its rights under the  CDP-SCANS  Agreement.  The proposed mechanism will result in a daily

release  of Clob securities with the value of a mere  0.015%  of

KLSE's  total market capitalisation.  This effect on KLSE  stock

prices  should  be  negligible. This is a  fair  solution  which

directly addresses Malaysian concerns that any solution  to  the

Clob  issue  must  not disrupt the KL market, and  enables  Clob

investors to exercise their rights under Malaysian law to  trade

their   securities.   The  two  exchanges   are   currently   in

communication  on  the proposal.  And the SES will  inform  Clob

investors as and when progress is made.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he has any expectation  on

the  timeframe by which this issue could be resolved  since  the

CDP-SCANS Agreement would have to  do the transfer by the end of

the  year.  And if it is not done by the end of the year,  would

it  lead  to  some legal process being introduced to enable  the

Clob investors to get their shares transfered?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether the SES will assist in

special  cases  where there are rights issues or warrants  which

have  a  timeframe  expiry, for example, rights  issues  may  be

called  within a certain timeframe or warrants may expire within

this year, and whether the SES can approach the KLSE for special

considerations to allow the Singapore owners to either  exercise

their conversion rights for such issues.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the timeframe, it

is  not  the  case  that the end-of-the-year  is  the  deadline,

because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>



the agreement was settled last year (signed in

September 1998) and was meant to be implemented as soon as

possible. There is no specific timeframe.  The end-of-the-year

is not a deadline for the agreement between CDP and SCANS.

There have been some statements by one of the offerors, I

believe, that at the end of the year, if this matter is not

settled, the shares may be confiscated.  But the SES is taking

advice on that, and its advice so far is that even if the shares

are transferred to the Minister of Finance in Malaysia, the

titles still belong to the shareholders and they still have a

claim on those shares.  So they are not expropriated.  But we

are clarifying this position because it is an important point on

which I am sure Clob shareholders would want reassurance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the legal process, as I said in my statement, SES is

taking  legal advice and the shareholders' association  is  also

taking legal advice.  I do not think we should rule anything out

but neither are we seeing that as the only solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to when the whole package can be solved, as Members have

been  reading  in  the newspapers recently, the  Malaysians  are

gearing  up for elections and I think their minds are likely  to

be on other weightier matters for the time being.  So it will be

some time before the matter would be solved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On special cases like rights issues and warrants, I have to

ask  the Stock Exchange to look into the matter but we will have

to study the specific cases.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy

Prime  Minister  said  that to make Clob  legal,  the  Malaysian

authorities would have to go to Parliament, in other  words,  to

pass a resolution to make Clob illegal.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Clob is not illegal.

Even today, it is not illegal.  Clob is an offshore market.   It

operates  outside Malaysia, just like people trade in  Malaysian

shares  in  London or Hong Kong.  It does not require  Malaysian

law to make it legal.  It did require the cooperation of the  KL

Stock Exchange

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>



because Clob had to operate nominee accounts and

also investors had to buy additional shares, rights issues, and

so forth.  Indeed, it complied with all the rules and

regulations of the KL Stock Exchange all the many years it was

in existence.  In September last year, the KL Stock Exchange

changed its rules and Clob reassessed its position and decided

that it was no longer viable for it to operate under the new

rules.  But there is no question of Clob being illegal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, in view of the

difficulty   of  the  Clob  issue  so  far  and  the   so-called

unsatisfactory  result in the level of negotiation  between  the

Singapore  Stock Exchange and the Malaysia Stock Exchange,  does

the  Government  intend  to take up the  issue  with  the  Prime

Minister of Malaysia?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, the

Government  had  already  done so.   If  you  read  my  previous

statement in May 1999, I explained that after the matter reached

an  impasse  at  the  working level,  the  two  Prime  Ministers

discussed  it  in Hanoi when they met during the  ASEAN  Summit.

After the meeting, Dr Mahathir came out and told the press  that

Clob  would  be  part of the package of issues to be  negotiated

between the two governments, including water, railway land, CPF,

and   so   on,   and  he  mentioned  specifically  Clob.    But,

unfortunately, the Malaysian Government subsequently changed its

position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th May this year, Prime Minister Mahathir made a

different  statement and he said, "No.  Clob is not one  of  the

issues.    Clob  is  a  separate  matter."   But  the  Singapore

Government  has  said, in our negotiations with the  Malaysians,

that while this is something we can negotiate separately, by the

time  the main negotiations are settled, Clob should not  remain

outstanding.  So the two can proceed on parallel paths but  they

must reach a conclusion at the same time.  But both packages may

take  some  time  to  resolve because,  in  the  nature  of  our

relations  with  Malaysia, these are not easy problems.   So  we

will have to wait and see what happens.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Deputy Prime Minister say that he would not expect any form of

solution until after the Malaysian general elections?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I did not quite say that. I said that

they have their minds on other matters right now.  I am sure you

understand the psychology.  So I think it is more likely it will

be settled after, rather than before, the general elections.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>SUZHOU PROJECT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether   the   Government is still hopeful  of  recovering  all

monies invested in the Suzhou project.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam last

asked  about  investment of public monies in  Suzhou  Industrial

Park  (SIP)  in  January  1998.  In my reply,  I  explained  the

composition   of   SSTD,  that  is,  the  Singapore   consortium

participating  in the SIP project. I also provided  the  amounts

its  shareholders  had  invested.  I pointed  out  that  as  the

shareholders include publicly listed companies and MNCs, the SIP

project had to be viable.  Any losses sustained would have to be

made  public  and  available for scrutiny by  the  international

investment community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also explained the problems faced by the SIP as a result

of  aggressive  promotion by the Suzhou Government  of  a  rival

industrial park next door, the Suzhou New District (SND).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 1998, both sides have carried out

extensive consultations to resolve the problems. They thoroughly

evaluated  the progress of the SIP and the experience gained  so

far, and sought to work out jointly the best way to advance  the

project,   given   the  circumstances.   The  discussions   were

successful, and resulted in a memorandum of understanding  (MOU)

signed  by  the  two sides in Singapore on 28th June  1999,  and

published.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially the Singapore side suggested that SND, that is,

the  rival, suspended its marketing for five years, so that full

attention  could be given to accelerate SIP's development.   The

Chinese  side  explained why they could  not  suspend  SND,  but

expressed their commitment to SIP's priority status by  offering

to  coordinate  the marketing of the two parks.   The  Singapore

side  accepted  the  Chinese explanation of  their  constraints.

Hence, the need for a fundamental review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOU is a comprehensive package redefining the

objectives and structure of the project, and resolving many long

outstanding problems.  Its main points include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Refocusing the SIP project on completing the first 8

sq km by 1st January 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Transferring majority ownership and management control

of  CSSD,  the joint venture company from Singapore to China  on

1st January 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The Suzhou Government and the joint venture company to

continue  to  look  after  the  interests  of  SIP  tenants  and

investors.  They guarantee that the changes to the project  will

not affect their commitments to these tenants and investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) The Suzhou Government will respect SIP's priority

status  by  recommending  all  suitable  projects  to  the  SIP,

encouraging  investors  to  choose  SIP,  and  taking   concrete

measures to pre-empt disorderly competition between SIP and SND.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) The Suzhou Government will encourage

population from Suzhou old city to move to SIP so as to

accelerate SIP's development and growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Both sides will accelerate the adaptation of

Singapore's  experience.   Beyond  1st  January  2001,  software

transfer  will  continue  through attachments  and  training  of

Chinese officials in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) Both sides have also settled all the outstanding

commercial  issues, to enable the project to go forward  with  a

clean slate and the best chance of success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h) Both sides will jointly assist CSSD to enhance its

financial performance and to enable CSSD's early listing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will put the SIP project on a workable track

and  improve  the  joint venture company's financial  viability.

The  Chinese side have assured us that they will do their utmost

over the next 18 months to implement the agreements and make the

8 sq km area a success.  The Singapore side remains committed to

the  project  and  will  do all it can  to  achieve  a  positive

outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shareholders in the Singapore consortium have fully

endorsed  the MOU.  They include American, Japanese,  Dutch  and

Korean  corporations. The consortium has slightly increased  its

investments  in the joint venture companies since  January  last

year.   I have circulated an updated list of investments  (Cols.

1867-1870)  by  consortium members and  other  Government-linked

companies in the SIP project.  Members should have it  on  their

seats.   The total amount invested by statutory boards and  GLCs

in  the project so far is US$147 million.  In addition, as  part

of  the package deal in the MOU, Temasek has agreed to guarantee

a loan of up to US$65 million to the project, for a fixed period

up  to  31st December 2003, in return for a commercial fee  from

the   members   of  the  Singapore  consortium.   Beyond   these

commitments, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>



Singapore consortium does not expect to inject

further amounts into the SIP project.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1999/19990803/19990803-HA-0701867.htm">LIST - SSTD SHAREHOLDERS (Cols. 1867-1870)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategic objective of the SIP project was not just to

earn  a  profit for the joint venture, but to be a  vehicle  for

software   transfer.    But  shareholders   in   the   Singapore

consortium   decided  to  invest  in  CSSD  based  strictly   on

commercial considerations.  They have always emphasised that the

project  must  be commercially viable.  Unless  it  can  earn  a

reasonable return, the consortium cannot justify its investment,

and SIP cannot support the software transfer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shareholders in the Singapore consortium evaluated the

viability   of   the   project  critically   before   committing

themselves.   But  like any other project,  it  was  subject  to

normal  commercial risks.  There could not be any  certainty  of

profit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a combination of reasons, it has proved more difficult

for  SIP  to  become  profitable than the  Singapore  consortium

initially expected.  However, with the package of solutions  now

agreed  upon  by both parties, and the assurances given  by  the

Chinese,  the SIP project has a reasonable opportunity  to  turn

around  and  become profitable in the medium term, provided  the

external investment climate does not deteriorate.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask

the   Deputy   Prime   Minister  why  has  the   Memorandum   of

Understanding  not  been made public?   I  understand  from  the

librarian that it was not presented to Parliament.  May we  know

why?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Memorandum of

Understanding is a commercial document which was published  when

it was signed, and it was all over the newspapers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask

the  Deputy  Prime Minister whether it is true that  the  Suzhou

project  costs  the Government more than $30 billion  of  public

funds, and this was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



apparently alleged by Dr Chee Soon Juan in a speech

he made at Raffles Place in December last year.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no truth at

all.  I had already given Parliament a full update on the status

of  SIP  in January 1998, giving figures similar to what I  have

just  stated  again, which is $147 million.  Dr Chee  Soon  Juan

made  a speech last year at Raffles Place where he said that  if

we  continued  talking  about Suzhou, we were  bailing  out  $30

billion of public funds, not "his" money ("his" meaning  Mr  Lee

Kuan  Yew) but $30 billion of taxpayers' money.  I do  not  know

where he got his figure from, but Members will know that this is

Dr  Chee Soon Juan's statement and, with him, accuracy and facts

are matters of taste rather than morals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether it

is  reassuring to hear from the Deputy Prime Minister  that  the

Government hopes that it will show returns.  What I want to know

from  the Deputy Prime Minister is: is this a pious hope or  are

there  any realistic expectations and, if so, when do we  expect

any returns?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are commercial

propositions.   There  is a commercial  consortium.   They  have

spent 19 months negotiating the MOU, which they have signed.  It

is still not guaranteed that the project will become profitable.

But   they  have  to  make  the  best  of  the  project  in  the

circumstances,  and  we  will have to see  in  due  course  what

happens.  I think it is too early to speculate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I do not know whether the

Government  has sufficiently considered the Suzhou New  District

before  committing its investment which has resulted in  today's

position.  I understand that the Suzhou New District had been in

existence  before the Government decided to make an  investment.

Was  it  prudent  for the Government to make the investment  and

pulling in the commercial establishments which are now suffering

losses and facing an uncertain future?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, in retrospect,

obviously, we did not pay enough attention to it.  But there was

a reason. We were aware of it but there was a reason why we

started on a different area, and that is because we were not

just building an industrial estate, but building a township

complete with schools, houses, infrastructure, industrial park,

utilities, everything.  Therefore the idea was to look for a

fresh piece of ground and start in order to have a clean slate.

We believed that the Suzhou authorities would give clear

priority to the SIP project over SND and indeed this was so for

the first few years of the project.  But as time went on, the

competition and rivalry became a problem and finally came to a

head.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, I think in November 1997, one of the Vice

Mayors of Suzhou went to Germany to promote SND, the rival,  and

told  the German investors that they should come to SND  because

Jiang  Zemin did not support SIP, to the amazement of Chancellor

Helmut  Kohl's  special representative, who  was  in  charge  of

encouraging  German  businessmen to go to  China  together  with

Singapore.   And that is  what brought the matter to a head.  We

have  been  discussing it over these last 20 months and  it  has

been finally settled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should quote to the Member what one very senior Chinese

official told us.  He said that if he had been aware of SND,  he

would not have advised us to go to Suzhou.  Therefore, this  was

a  problem  which  we  did not fully appreciate  and  their  top

leaders were not aware of either.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. Is the Deputy

Prime  Minister  saying that even the adviser to  the  Singapore

Government  from  China was not aware of the  existence  of  the

Suzhou  New District at the point in time, and was the Singapore

Government  aware of the Suzhou New District  at  the  point  in

time?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say the

adviser  to  the Singapore Government.  I said a senior  Chinese

leader  who gave us advice told us that he would have  given  us

different advice had he been aware of SND. We were aware

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>



that SND existed. We did not know how big a problem

it would pose and we believe the problem was manageable, and we

were mistaken.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Deputy  Prime Minister that having learnt a lesson  of  the

problems that we face in Suzhou with the Chinese officials,  are

we  applying this lesson learnt in the other deals that we  have

in  the  other industrial parks?  Are we facing any problems  in

the  other  parks that we have in China, for example,  the  Wuxi

industrial park?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I am not aware of the details of the

Wuxi  industrial Park.  There is no G-to-G element in that. That

is  purely a commercial proposition.  It is much less ambitious.

They  are  not talking about 70 sq km with 8 sq km in  phase  I.

They  are going one sq km by one sq km, advancing as the project

develops. From my not very up-to-date knowledge, I believe  that

they  are  also  having some difficulties, not  because  of  the

Chinese  partners but because investments into  China  generally

are  down  this year and therefore they are finding it difficult

to get tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But certainly, from the lessons from SIP, we would have to

do  a  full post mortem and derive the full benefits from  them.

And  it is not just us who will do the post mortem but I am sure

Harvard Business School will take a very close interest  and  so

will the Europeans, Insead, and the others.  And they will write

it up because here was a very important project, given very high

level  support from both sides, including the Chinese side.   It

is  not  a  laughing matter, when the President of the  People's

Republic of China goes and provides calligraphy for a park.  And

yet,  there were these difficulties which finally could  not  be

properly  overcome and we have had to re-adjust our  project  in

order  to  accept these limitations.  It will be very  carefully

scrutinised  and  the lessons documented so that  everybody  who

goes to China will have it available.  It will be made into case

studies.  Therefore, we are trying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>



our best to make sure that it becomes as much of a

success as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether

a  comprehensive  agreement was drawn  up  between  the  Chinese

Government  and the Singapore Government before we  embarked  on

this  Suzhou  project, and if there was, whether any  provisions

were  made for the resolution of any disputes that may arise  by

reference to arbitration or to any other international tribunal?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Of course there were agreements.

There was a G-to-G agreement which governed the software transfer and there was a

commercial    agreement   which   governed   their    commercial

development.  And some of the items in the agreement were issues

which  were long in dispute and have taken us this long time  to

settle.  The commercial agreement would have been subject to the

investment  guarantee  agreement signed  between  Singapore  and

China  which provides that, in case of dispute, the matter would

be  referred  to arbitration.  And that was one of  the  options

which was considered seriously, but fortunately, the two parties

were  able to resolve their difficulties without having to refer

to arbitration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would

like  to  ask the Deputy Prime Minister, in view of our  reduced

role  and  stake in Suzhou, whether we would be able to  provide

the  same support and service level to these companies, many  of

whom  have  invested in Suzhou simply because of our involvement

and reputation and credibility there.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, that is one of our major concerns

in  negotiating the MOU, which is to make sure that  we  do  our

best to safeguard the interest of the tenants who have gone  in,

because  we have encouraged them.  They went in because we  gave

them  comfort.   We persuaded them. They went in  expecting  our

help  and  support  in navigating any unexpected  bumps  in  the

night.  Now, we will still be there but in a much lesser role.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>



We have taken some pains in making this agreement to

get the Chinese side to commit, which they have done so

publicly, that anything which has been settled with the tenants

before this will remain in force after this and will not be

changed by the signing.  At the same time, we have gone round

and explained to the tenants and reassured them what the

agreement consists of and what the arrangements are which we are

making over the next two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a transition period of two years to the 1st of

January  2001 before the shareholding structure changes  and  by

that time, Suzhou Industrial Park will be nearly seven years  in

existence.   It would have been in existence for a  considerable

length of time and companies which are tenants in our park would

have  been  able  to establish themselves.  We  could  not  have

expected this project to continue indefinitely.  At some  stage,

it  must  complete and the experiment must be declared either  a

success  or not.  There must be a graduation and then  probably,

if  it  is  of  a commercial success, there should be  a  public

listing of the company and the original shareholders would  exit

or  partially exit, and the structure will change.  So, when you

go in, it is for a reasonable expectation, but not indefinitely.

And  that  we have tried to explain to the investors.  Naturally

they  are still concerned but we would do our best to hold their

hands.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Government satisfied that the

senior  government official from China was honest when  he  said

that  he  was  not  aware of the existence  of  the  Suzhou  New

District   when  he  advised  the  Singapore  Government   about

investing in Suzhou?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I have no reason whatsoever to

doubt that.

<div align="center"><b>UNION REPRESENTATION FOR EXECUTIVES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether   he  will  consider  amending  legislation   to   allow

executives  the  right  to  union  representation  in  case   of

retrenchment, dismissal or other workplace problems.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker

Sir,  let me first explain the rationale behind existing  labour

legislation.   Executives,  regardless  of  seniority,  are  not

covered by the Employment Act.  It is assumed and our law  takes

the  position that executives should be able to look after their

own   interests,  as  they  are  usually  better  educated,  and

professionals  who can negotiate their terms and  conditions  of

employment.   They  can  negotiate  and  enter  into  employment

contracts  by themselves, and do not need to rely on  collective

bargaining by unions on their behalf.  To include them under the

Employment  Act will create unnecessary rigidity and hinder  the

free operation of the labour market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nevertheless, executives who need help to resolve

employment disputes with their employers can seek the assistance

from  the  Ministry  of  Manpower, which  provides  conciliation

service.  If their disputes cannot be resolved amicably  through

conciliation, they need to file a suit under the common  law  to

seek remedy, because employers are not legally obliged to accept

the Ministry's advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more employees becoming executives, and more jobs

being  classified  as  executive jobs, the assumption  that  all

executives are sufficiently well-informed and experienced not to

need any protection from the Employment Act may be questionable.

Indeed,   during  the  past  two  years,  for  example,  several

executives  have sought the help of my Ministry, the unions  and

MPs  at  their meet-the-people sessions.  We may need to  extend

part  of  the  provisions in the Employment Act  to  executives.

However, we should do so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>



only to the extent necessary.  The Government will

study this carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, current labour laws do not prevent executives from

forming or being represented by their unions.  However, they may

not be represented by trade unions whose membership consists  of

rank-and-file  employees.  Over the years, NTUC has  argued  for

both  executives and rank-and-file employees to  be  allowed  to

join  the  same  union  as it is better  for  team-work.   Thus,

frontline supervisors who were promoted from the ranks have been

allowed  to  join  rank-and-file  unions  under  the  Tripartite

Guidelines   on   Eligibility  to  Join  Rank-and-File   Unions,

introduced in 1992.  In addition, some employers have, on  their

own  accord,  allowed  their executives  to  join  rank-and-file

unions, but this is a voluntary arrangement.   Junior and middle

level executives can join rank-and-file unions as general branch

members,  but  only  to  enjoy the social  benefits  the  unions

provide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our trade unions have played a crucial role in maintaining

industrial  harmony,  and cooperating  with  employers  and  the

Government to promote economic development and workers' welfare.

The  growing  proportion of new entrants to  the  labour  market

joining  executive  ranks, rather than the  rank-and-file  posts

traditionally  represented by trade unions,  means  a  potential

shrinkage  of the unions' support base.  This would  have  major

implications for the NTUC and for the strength of our tripartite

relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should review the Industrial Relations Act, especially

section  16(3), to see how it can be amended to  suit  the  very

different  circumstances that prevail today. We should  consider

allowing the same union to represent both rank-and-file  workers

and  junior  and middle level executives, instead of having  the

two  groups  in  separate  unions.  We may, as  the  Member  has

suggested,  allow rank-and-file unions to represent  junior  and

middle  level  executives in some employment  matters,  such  as

retrenchment,   dismissal  and  grievances,  although   not   in

collective bargaining.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Employers' organisations have expressed to my

Ministry their concerns over the possible difficulties that such

a change may cause.  They are concerned with the potential for a

"conflict of interest" when executives become members of rank-and-file unions.  Employers are also concerned with the impact

on management's control, disciplinary and grievance procedures

and lawful termination of contracts of employment of executives.

In reviewing the Industrial Relations Act, we will take into

account not only the desirability of widening the membership

base for trade unions, but also employers' legitimate concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has called for a tripartite meeting with

the  NTUC  and  SNEF to discuss this issue.   We  will  table  a

preliminary  proposal to the meeting, for full  discussion  with

the  unions  and  employers.   I  look  forward  to  forging   a

tripartite  consensus  on how we can bring  our  laws  on  union

membership  up to date, strengthen harmonious labour  relations,

and create a more competitive workforce.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, as the Minister has said that he is

likely to accept my suggestion, will he set a  timeframe for the

tripartite  committee?  And would he agree that if  there  is  a

clear  disciplinary procedure in a company, there should  be  no

conflict  of interest for executive staff to join the  rank-and-file union of the company?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will try to resolve

this  matter  as soon as possible.  As I have said  in  my  main

answer,  my Ministry has already called for a meeting with  both

the  Singapore National Employers' Federation and the  NTUC.   I

hope  to achieve a consensus as soon as possible to resolve this

issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other point about grievance procedures,

I  think  this  is  an  issue that the committee  will  have  to

discuss.   I  understand the trade unions' perspective  on  this

issue  and their desire to be involved in some way, but  I  also

have to be aware of the employers' concerns.  The purpose of the

tripartite

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>



committee is for all three parties to sit down and

work out a consensus which can allow us to move forward from the

position today.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether the

Government will now consider bringing in an Unfair Dismissal Act

and  setting up a tribunal to hear any grievances or  complaints

that executives may have against their company?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, again, as I have said, we should let

the  tripartite committee explore this issue and find  which  is

the best way to deal with some of the problems that have cropped

up as a result of the changes in the profile of our workforce.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister aware that the Unfair

Dismissal  Act  exists in most enlightened countries?   Why  can

Singapore not have one?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, as I have said, we already have

procedures  where  executives  who  feel  that  they  have  been

unfairly  dismissed can appeal to my Ministry, and we  will  try

our  best to resolve the problems.  In most cases, we have  been

able  to  do  so.   As  to whether an Unfair  Dismissal  Act  is

required or is there another approach to tackle this problem,  I

believe  that the tripartite committee that we have convened  is

in  the  best  position to discuss this and look at the  problem

from  all angles.   And we can come up with a workable model  in

our context.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, having worked in a

multi-national  environment,  I do  know  that  some  MNCs  have

concerns  about  setting up unions in Singapore.   Part  of  the

reason  is that they operate in many countries and it may weaken

their  position.  That is why they refuse to set  up  unions  in

some  of these countries.  I believe that some of these feedback

have been given to the Economic Development Board.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Singh, no speeches. Please ask your

question.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, can the Minister comment on some of

these concerns that employers have, especially the MNCs?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, employers have many

concerns over unionisation of their executives.  We have to bear

in  mind that employers, especially the MNCs, operate throughout

the  world,  and  they may have very different  experience  with

trade  unions  elsewhere.   In some countries,  they  have  very

unpleasant  and unhappy experience with trade unions,  and  this

has in some way affected their mindset.  So, some MNCs operating

in  Singapore  see efforts to represent their  executives  as  a

failure on the part of management to look after the needs of the

executives in their employ.  Very often, when the union seeks to

represent  even their rank-and-file employees, the  head  office

will  question  the local management by saying, "Have  you  done

something wrong to cause the workers to be unhappy?"  These  are

some  of  the  examples  that have  been  given  to  us  in  our

discussions with employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers are also concerned that unionisation of their

executives would give rise to rigidities, because it is  natural

for  unions, once they start to organise the executives, to want

to  seek standardisation of rewards and benefits.  And many MNCs

operating  in  Singapore, like MNCs elsewhere,  take  a  totally

different  approach  in  the  remuneration  package  for   their

executives.   There  are  a lot more individual  components  and

there are different reward schemes for executives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other employers have given us feedback that they are

concerned with union representation of their executives  because

they fear that it would give rise to more workplace disputes and

could  also  affect  labour-management relations  at  management

level.   As  I  said, a number of such feedback arose  from  the

employers or the MNCs' prior experience or contacts with unions,

sometimes  in their home countries and sometimes from  operating

in other countries.  Let me hasten to add that I do not entirely

agree with all the feedback and their responses.  I think the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>



trade union movement in Singapore is very different

from the trade union movement in many other countries.  The

trade unions in Singapore take a non-adversarial and non-confrontational approach.  In fact, they have played a key role

in helping employers to survive the recent economic downturn

that we have just experienced.  So we need to persuade such

employers to change their mindset and attitude.  But we must

also bear in mind that where they have genuine concerns, we

should be prepared to address these concerns and not force our

way upon them.  Lest they see Singapore as an unattractive place

for them to do business.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether I

heard  the Minister correctly.  Did  he say that executives  can

appeal  to  him  if  they  feel that  they  have  been  unfairly

dismissed?   If so, I would like to know where the provision  is

to be found in the law.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Yes, I did say that, Mr Speaker, Sir. In

my  main answer, I said that executives who need help to resolve

employment  disputes with their employers can  seek  assistance.

We  can provide conciliation.  And in the vast majority of cases

that  we have to deal with, such conciliation had been effective

and  we  have  been  able  to  help  both  employers  and  their

executives reach a compromise and solve their problems.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does

the  Minister  agree that preventing workers of any  grade  from

joining  a  union  amounts to an infringement of   human  right,

especially in Europe and in the US?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I missed the question. Can he

repeat, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan:</b> Does the Minister agree that preventing

workers  of  any  grade  from joining  a  union  amounts  to  an

infringement of human right, especially in the US and in Europe?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under our law, we do not

prevent  any  workers,  including executives,  from  forming  or

joining  a  union.  They can, including executives,  form  their

unions.   What  we have is a situation where the  law  does  not

allow executives to join a rank-and-file union of workers within

a  company because of this concern of a conflict of interest  in

the  past.  As to whether it is an infringement of human  right,

of course, our law states quite clearly that there is a right to

form and join a union.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister, in

the  light of a recent High Court ruling on the  overturning  of

an  order by the Minister for Manpower that the business  school

owners  should  pay  compensation  to  an  employee  for  unjust

dismissal, the High Court held that the Ministry has  not  given

the business school sufficient opportunities to be heard and the

way  the  investigation was conducted was not in line  with  the

rules  of  natural justice.  Since the said High Court  decision

had affected the confidence of ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tan, I think your question is not related to

this.  I suggest you file it as a separate Question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan:</b> My question is whether the existing system

provides  sufficient opportunities for disputing parties  to  be

sufficiently  heard, including the case involving  the  business

school, and how the current procedure can be improved to  ensure

that investigations into such disputes could be conducted fairly

and  that  the  rules of natural justice are  observed  by  both

employers and employees.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the Nominated

Member  was referring to the case of a lecturer who was employed

by  a commercial school.  Permit me to address his supplementary

question, although it does seem to be a little far from the main

Question that was answered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have to take a bit of time, with your indulgence,

Sir.  The lecturer, who was the subject of this court case,  was

dismissed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>



on  6th May 1997, less than four weeks  before  his

contract  was  due  to expire on 31st May  1997.   The  contract

provided  for a gross monthly salary of $3,700 and  a  bonus  or

gratuity equivalent to at least one month's last drawn salary at

the  end of the contract.  The school said that the lecturer was

dismissed  because  of  his  poor  performance.   The   lecturer

appealed  to  me  alleging  that his dismissal  was  unjust  and

without  valid  ground,  and here  is  the  answer  to  Mr  J.B.

Jeyaretnam  too.   In fact, the avenue for  such  an  appeal  is

provided  for  under  the  Employment  Act.   Pursuant  to   the

Employment Act, I therefore asked the Commissioner for Labour to

conduct  an  inquiry  into  the  circumstances  leading  to  his

dismissal.   This  was done by an officer  of  the  Ministry  on

behalf of the Commissioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the inquiry, the employer had refused to

cooperate.   They  maintained  that  the  Commissioner  had   no

jurisdiction to deal with the case as the lecturer's  employment

contract with the school contained a clause for arbitration over

any  dispute  relating to his employment,  and  that  since  the

lecturer  earned more than $1,600, the Employment  Act  did  not

apply.   Sir,  this  is  incorrect.  The  lecturer  was  clearly

covered by the Employment Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school participated in the inquiry only after much

persuasion,  even  then,  very reluctantly.   The  investigating

officer  extended four invitations to the school to present  its

case to the Ministry.  The school only responded once by sending

its  executive director on one occasion.  The executive director

gave  a  statement  to the investigating officer  and  left  the

Ministry  hurriedly,  claiming that she had  to  attend  another

appointment   elsewhere.   The  school  was  given   more   than

sufficient  opportunities to state its  case  but,  for  reasons

known only to the school, it chose to avoid participating in the

inquiry.   Sir,  in  one of the letters to the  school,  it  was

stated  very clearly that the Ministry would proceed to evaluate

the   case   based   on   whatever  facts   gathered   so   far,

notwithstanding that the school's interests might  prejudicially

be affected by the Minister's decision.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the facts and evidence he was able to

gather, the investigating officer reported that the dismissal

was wrongful and recommended that the lecturer should be

compensated.  The officer's report noted that the school did not

conduct any investigation or inquiry to establish that the

lecturer performed poorly as a lecturer.  In short, he had no

opportunity to defend himself.  The complaints of the school

against the lecturer had, in fact, occurred early in his

employment.  The lecturer had explained, and the school appeared

to have accepted his explanation and did not pursue the matter.

It was, therefore, surprising that just before his term of

employment was to end, he was suddenly sacked.  After

considering the report, I concluded that the school had sacked

the lecturer without just cause or excuse.  The school was

accordingly ordered by me to pay a sum of $6,800 to the

lecturer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school challenged the order in the High Court.

Initially,  it  argued that the Ministry had no jurisdiction  to

conduct  the  inquiry.  Later, it shifted  its  stand  and  kept

changing its grounds for challenging the order.  They failed  on

almost  all the new grounds they raised.  But the Court accepted

their  arguments  that the Ministry's inquiry failed  to  comply

with the rules of natural justice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> I do not know whether

this  matter has gone on appeal.  But if it has gone on  appeal,

it is sub judice.  So we should not be discussing the case now.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> I will come to that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you listen to the Minister?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Let me repeat. The court accepted their

argument  that the Ministry's inquiry failed to comply with  the

rule  of  natural  justice  as  the  school  was  not  given  an

opportunity to be heard.  On this basis, the court gave judgment

in  favour  of the school.  The Ministry did give evidence  that

the  school was given every opportunity to be heard.  The school

presented evidence to the opposite effect.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the court also criticised the Ministry for

lack  of  procedures  in  dealing  with  complaints  under   the

Employment  Act.   Sir,  I  would  like  to  assure  the  House,

employers, unions and workers that under the existing procedures

to  inquire into a dismissal, adequate steps are taken to ensure

that all parties involved are given sufficient opportunities  to

present  their case and to respond to arguments put  forward  by

one  party  against the other.  This process is evident  in  the

case  in question.  The school was invited repeatedly to provide

its  side  of  the story.  The school was given a  copy  of  the

lecturer's  complaint letter to the Ministry and was invited  to

attend  the investigation on four occasions.  It was the  school

which chose not to attend the inquiry proceedings, except on one

occasion, and even so, reluctantly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will not be appealing the court's ruling. We

were  advised  by  the Attorney-General not  to  appeal  as  the

judge's decision was based on his findings of fact. Appeals must

be  on points of law and not findings of fact unless the factual

findings are manifestly against the weight of evidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court had focused on the inquiry procedure adopted in

dealing  with the dismissal appeal.  My Ministry has,  in  fact,

commenced  such  a  review  to refine and  tighten  the  inquiry

procedure  in  view of the court's ruling and observations.   We

will  spare no effort to rectify any shortcomings.  We will also

take  steps to minimise the opportunities for persons to present

to  a third party a distorted picture of what we did or did  not

do, when carrying out our statutory responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to assure the House that the

existing  dispute settlement system administered by my  Ministry

is  effective  and  efficient  in  resolving  conflicts  between

employers  and workers in an amicable manner.  We  have  enjoyed

three  decades  of  industrial harmony with no major  industrial

conflict.  The existing dispute settlement system has served  us

well for 30 years.  In 1998, my Ministry had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>



helped to settle the employment claims and disputes

involving some 12,000 non-unionised workers and amicably

resolved 291 cases of industrial disputes brought up by trade

unions and employers.  For the first half of this year, claims

by about 6,200 non-unionised workers and 120 unionised dispute

cases were handled by the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry fully subscribes to the rules of natural

justice.   Indeed,  as  an  arbiter of employment  disputes,  my

Ministry  has  a duty and responsibility to evaluate  each  case

thoroughly  and  objectively, and to uphold  the  principles  of

impartiality  and fairness in dealing with employment  disputes.

I  would  like  to assure the House that our employment  dispute

settlement  mechanism is sound, as judged  by  the  overwhelming

number of resolved case.  Notwithstanding that, my Ministry will

not spare any effort to improve on the existing system.

<div align="center"><b>CONSTRUCTION SECTOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to reduce accidents)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

what  further  safety  measures are being considered  to  reduce

accidents  in the construction sector, in view of the  increased

number of accidents recently.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the first half of

this  year  (January to June 1999), a total of 753 accidents  in

construction  sites were reported to my Ministry.   This  is  an

increase  of  19 cases or 2.6% when compared to the same  period

last  year.   In  terms  of  fatalities,  28  workers  died   in

construction worksite accidents for the first half of this year.

This  is  11  (or 28%) less than the 39 workers who  lost  their

lives  over the same period last year.  Although the  number  of

fatalities  has been reduced, the number of fatal  accidents  is

still high and should be further  reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two years, the Ministry has taken a number of

measures   to   help  improve  the  safety  situation   in   the

construction  industry.  Some of the more  significant  measures

include Safety

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>



Courses for Project Managers, the requirement for

Safety Provisions in Contract Documents and the stepping up of

enforcement action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, officers from the Department of Industrial

Safety conducted a total of 179 special enforcement exercises on

construction   worksites  in  addition  to  the  4,581   routine

inspections.  The inspections led to 344 contractors being fined

from $500 to $42,000 each and 54 occupiers were issued with Stop

Work Orders for grossly unsafe work sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is aware that safety issues confronting

contractors  must be addressed by the whole of the  construction

industry.   Hence,  there is a need to  adopt  a  total  systems

approach  involving contractors, construction professionals  and

developers  to improve the safety situation in the  construction

industry.  The Construction 21 (C21) study which my Ministry and

the  Ministry of National Development have undertaken  with  key

partners  of  the construction industry will recommend  measures

aimed  at  addressing both the upstream and downstream processes

to achieve higher safety at construction sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the C21 study, my Ministry feels that more

must  be  done  by the contractors as employers to  improve  the

situation.   Investigations  into  accidents  that  occurred  at

worksites revealed that most of these accidents could have  been

prevented if only the contractors had provided the basic  safety

measures, such as barricading open sides, covering all  openings

to  prevent workers from falling as well as objects from falling

into  these  open  areas  and  also improving  on  housekeeping.

Contractors must know that they have the ultimate responsibility

to  ensure  that there is a safe work place  for their  workers.

As  a  further  deterrent, my Ministry is now considering  three

additional  measures.

<br><br><i>Deterrent sentence for contractors</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Factories Act, a person who contravenes any

provision  of  the Act that could lead to bodily injury  of  any

person will face a maximum penalty of $10,000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>



or a jail term of six months, or both.  The Ministry

will not hesitate to press for deterrent sentence (including

jail sentence) for individuals who are found to have blatantly

disregarded safety rules.

<br><br><i>Compulsory safety re-training of all worksite personnel</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a worksite is issued with a Stop Work Order, the

Ministry  will make it a condition to have all the personnel  of

the  worksite  undergo  appropriate safety  refresher  training,

before  allowing  work at the worksite to resume.   This  is  to

impress on the managers, supervisors and workers that unless the

worksite is managed safely, work cannot resume.

<br><br><i>Bar contractors from further employing Work Permit holders</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, contractors who employ foreign workers are obliged

to provide a safe and healthy work environment.  If a contractor

has a bad safety record, it is an indication that the contractor

is  not  able to meet this obligation.  Such contractors  should

not  be  allowed  to  engage more foreign  workers.   Hence,  my

Ministry  will consider barring the contractor from   employment

of  more  work permit holders, i.e. no new work permits will  be

issued  and   renewal  of  existing work  permits  will  not  be

allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take such firm action in order to further bring

down the accident rate in the construction industry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses its deep sympathy and condolence

to  President Ong Teng Cheong and his family on the loss of  his

wife, Mrs Ong-Ling Siew May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When President Ong first learnt of his wife's colon cancer

in January 1997, I can imagine his shock and dismay.  He himself

had been diagnosed with low-grade

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>



lymphoma in November 1992.  To have one person in

the family stricken with cancer was bad enough.  To have both

husband and wife suffering from it was indeed a cruel blow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But President Ong and his wife took the news calmly and

stoically.  As President Ong told me several times, life must go

on.   Both  he and his wife decided to live as normal  lives  as

they could.  They shut out their ailments from their minds,  and

immersed themselves in their work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prognosis for Mrs Ong's cancer was poor. But she

fought on, with the support of her husband and family.  She  was

one  courageous lady.  Over the past two and a half  years,  she

went  in and out of hospitals, both in Singapore and the  United

States.   She  underwent  repeated major surgery,  and  received

chemotherapy  and radiation treatment.  But she took  everything

in  her stride, and kept to her normal heavy schedule of her own

architect's  work and her duties as the First  Lady.   When  her

friends fell ill, she would visit and comfort them.  She kept to

herself  her  own  condition, and the pain she suffered  as  the

disease progressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Ong was brave until the end. Her last public

engagement  was the President's Charity Ball on  9th  July.   My

wife  and  I  called  on her and the President  in  hospital  on

Sunday,  18th July.  We knew that her illness was  in  its  last

stages.   She  was in obvious discomfort.  Yet she  received  us

with her ready smile, and chatted in good spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Ong chaired the boards of Nanyang Girls' High and

Nanyang  Primary  School.  When we talked about  Nanyang  Girls'

High  School,  her  eyes  lit up immediately.   The  new  school

buildings  at Linden Drive had just been completed.   She  spoke

with  pride  about  the  new campus, and was  delighted  when  I

commented on its beautiful facade and distinctive features.   We

had such a lively conversation that for a moment, we forgot that

she  was  not well.  She even talked about her next project,  to

redevelop the Nanyang Primary School.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Ong was the architect for the new campus of

Nanyang Girls' High School, as well as several other projects

for the school.  I was glad to read in the Zaobao that Mrs Ong

had donated her architectural fees from these projects to the

school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Ong was also deeply involved in charitable work. She

supported many fund raising projects for various charities  each

year.   She  was  also  patron of several civic  and  charitable

organisations,  including  the  Children's  Charities  and  Girl

Guides Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us knew Mrs Ong Teng Cheong long before she became

the  First Lady.  She was an unfailingly gracious hostess and  a

friend.   My  wife and I, and many of us here, have enjoyed  her

hospitality at her home.  We will all miss her.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, President Ong Teng Cheong was a member of

this  House  from 1972 till 1993 when he resigned to  stand  for

election  as President.  We all know him well.  He  has  lost  a

dear  wife.  Our hearts go to him and his family in their moment

of  grief.  We offer them our sincere condolences.  Even  though

the  untimely  passing of Mrs Ong has left a big  void  for  the

family,  we  hope that they will draw some comfort and  strength

from our sympathy and support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the people, the Government and this House, I

extend our heartfelt condolences to the President and his family

on their bereavement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the House observe a two-minute silence as a

mark  of  our respect for the late First Lady after others  have

spoken and the motion is passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I propose to adjourn the sitting at

approximately  2.30  pm  to allow hon.  Members  to  attend  the

funeral  of Mrs Ong.  I, therefore, ask hon. Members who  intend

to speak on the motion to bear this in mind.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon

Heng):  Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion moved by the Prime

Minister.   And in doing so, I speak on behalf of the NTUC,  all

union members and workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many unionists got to know Mrs Ong when Mr Ong Teng Cheong

was  the  Secretary-General of the  NTUC.   Our  unionists  were

encouraged by the quiet support she gave to the labour  movement

and  were  touched  by  her  warmth and  hospitality.   It  came

naturally  to  her as she herself had a difficult  life  in  her

younger  days.  The empathy she felt for the lower  income  came

naturally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She provided a good role model for all workers. Everyone

knows  she was hardworking and diligent, and strove to excel  in

her  work.   She had also been a good role model for all  female

Singaporeans  -  a good mother, a good housekeeper, a successful

career woman who still found time to support her husband in  his

public  service.  We also know that she had a soft spot for  the

disadvantaged through the support she gave to many charities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all share the family's loss.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin Hock)</b>

<b></b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing

in the name of the Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I have known the President and Mrs Ong for more

than  20  years.  We feel that Mrs Ong was a strong, courageous,

gracious,  optimistic,  frank  and  sincere  lady.   She  was  a

compassionate person (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). She would go all out

and  put  in her wholehearted efforts to do whatever she thought

she  ought  to  do  for  the nation  and  society,  without  any

consideration  for her personal gains or losses.   Whenever  she

had  any  view  and  feeling on  any  issue,  except  for  major

national  issues, she would unreservedly express her opinion  on

the matter in a straight-forward manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with her illness, she steadfastly discharged her

duties as the First Lady without any hesitation.  The First Lady

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>



herself was enthusiastically involved in charity and

attached great importance to educational and cultural work.  She

took the initiative and actively participated in many cultural,

educational and charitable activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than two decades of association with her, of

course,  we  have  many  fond memories  of  her.   Many  of  our

conversations  with her are deeply embedded  in  our  minds.   I

would like to mention just two recent events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first event was two years ago, at an informal lunch

with  President  Ong, my wife asked Mrs Ong about  her  illness.

She  just  briefly mentioned about the condition of her  health,

and then pinched my wife's hand and said in one simple sentence,

"Just like this" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) to end this part of the

conversation.  However, when touched on the subject  of  raising

funds  for  the  construction of the new  premises  for  Nanyang

Girls'  High  School, she was full of zeal and  enthusiasm.   My

wife  and  I  once  again appreciated the very  style  in  which

President Ong and Mrs Ong conducted themselves in life, and that

is, to suffer in silence their own pain but to devote themselves

enthusiastically to the cause of public interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second event was in July last year when I went with the

delegation  to accompany President Ong and Mrs Ong to Liverpool.

At  the  convocation ceremony of the Liverpool University,  when

President  Ong  was conferred the honorary doctorate  degree,  I

noticed  that  Mrs  Ong  appeared to be  full  of  thoughts  and

feelings.   Subsequently,   she shared with me some memories  of

the  days  she spent looking after her husband and  children  in

Liverpool.   From  the conversation, I felt her  deep  love  and

devotion to President Ong and the children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Lady has departed. She has lived through a full

life  with little or no regret.  For the nation, for the family,

for  society, she has made many great contributions.   Her  love

remains with us.  I believe if, at all, she has any anxiety, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>



would be  the impact of her departure on her

husband, President Ong, because over the past three decades, she

had been a pillar of great strength supporting President Ong.  I

would urge President Ong to restrain his grief and take care of

his health (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). With the support of his

friends  from various  quarters, I hope that President Ong would  be

able  to overcome the impact of this bereavement.  I also hope that

after the  death of their beloved mother, Tze Guan and Tze Boon

would be  even more resolute in the development of their careers,

and spend  more time with their father so as to console the soul  of

their mother.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the motion moved by our Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like him, I share the President's grief for the loss of his

wife.  The President told me a moving tale of his wife when  she

attended the Charity Ball function.  He said she sat through the

night  function with no signs of any problem.   It  was  a  long

night  and she patiently and courageously went about her  duties

as  the  First  Lady.  But beneath the strong composure,  was  a

woman  in  severe and excruciating pain.  It was only  when  she

reached  home  that she collapsed in pain.   She  must  be  very

strong to have gone through this and I am sure she must have put

up  such  a strong front in the course of her duty as the  First

Lady.   She had always stood by the President.  She carried  her

duty as the First Lady with the courage very few can match.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my condolence to our President and his

family.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the First Lady, Madam Ling Siew May, passed  away

on  30th July 1999.  The business community felt a great loss in

the  passing away of the First Lady.  On behalf of the  business

community,  I  would  like to convey our  deepest  sympathy  and

condolence to President Ong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having read the life story of Mrs Ong, I was greatly

touched.  Mrs Ong was an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>



exemplary model of an Asian woman cultivated under

traditional Asian culture and values.  Her contribution to

family, business, society and the nation was the pride of

womenfolk in Singapore, and the pride of the people of

Singapore.  Allow me to raise the following five points to

illustrate the greatness of the First Lady:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, she was very hardworking and dedicated. She went

through severe hardship in her younger days.  After spending  an

unhappy  childhood  in  an orphanage, she travelled  across  the

ocean  to Singapore at the tender age of 11 to study.   All  the

problems  in  coping with a very different language  and  living

environment did not overwhelm her.  Instead, it inspired her  to

cultivate  in  herself  a  fighting spirit.   She  overcame  the

difficulties  in learning English and the other   subjects,  and

successfully  completed her secondary and high  school  studies.

Eventually  she went overseas to study in Australia  and  became

the   first   Asian  girl  to  graduate  from  the  Faculty   of

Architecture in the University.  At a time when the society  was

still  very  conservative, as a female  and  a  Chinese-educated

student, she overcame many difficulties and went on courageously

to  achieve academic success.  This spirit of enduring  hardship

and self-reliance is worthy of our emulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, she was a good wife and a good mother, diligent

and  thrifty.   In the family, she was a good wife  and  a  good

mother, devoting herself body and soul to look after her husband

and  her  children  and creating a warm  home  for  them.   This

enabled the President to concentrate on his work without  having

to  worry  about  things at home.  The two  sons  could   devote

themselves  to  their  studies  to  become  useful  citizens  of

society.  The First Lady must be given due credit for the  great

success  achieved  by  the President and  the  two  sons  today.

During   President  Ong's  term  of  office  as   Minister   and

subsequently as the President, Mrs Ong was always at  his  side,

silently  giving him all the support.   Her cordial  smile,  her

gracious  and elegant demeanour, her simple outfit  gave  people

the feeling of being very approachable and respectable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, she was devoted to her duty and enthusiastic in

her work.  The First Lady was the most reliable partner of her

husband's career. When her husband was holding the ministerial

position, she took over the bulk of workload in their

architectural firm.  After her husband was elevated to the high

office of Presidency, her official duties became even more busy

and heavy.  Yet, she did not drop her responsibility in the

architectural work.  She divided her time and energy on both her

public and private career, attending to each and every aspect of

life with great success.  Her spirit of love for work and

devotion to duties is something that is worthy of our admiration

and praise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, her passion for her alma mater and society. The

First  Lady's love for her alma mater is well known to everyone.

She  had  made the reconstruction of Nanyang Girls' High  School

her  lifelong  aspiration.  Besides her  passion  for  her  alma

mater,   she was also deeply concerned with education,  charity,

welfare  of women and children, as well as the latest  situation

and  development  of culture and the arts in  Singapore,  giving

them  her wholehearted support. The female nature of love, kind-heartedness,  patience  and concern for  others  was  manifestly

revealed in the person of the First Lady.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, her courage and unyielding fight against her

illness.   Two and a half years ago, she was diagnosed  to  have

suffered  from cancer, but she exercised tremendous perseverance

to  battle  against her illness. She showed  no  sign  of  being

dispirited or depressed.  She carried on discharging her  duties

as  the  First  Lady, greeting the people with her usual  smile,

receiving  foreign dignitaries, and even went on overseas  trips

with the President.   From her smile, we could see a strong  and

courageous  woman  who  loved life and  work  and  was  full  of

fighting spirit, battling against her illness.  She had not been

overwhelmed  by  her disease but continued to  live,  and  lived

bravely.   These  noble  qualities had  shaped  a  superlatively

unique image of the First Lady.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the First Lady devoted her whole life to

her family,  society and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>



the nation.  She worked steadfastly and silently all

the way  until the end of her life.   She was the epitome of the

virtues of Asian women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical body is finite, but the spirit lives on

eternally.   The love that the First Lady has left  behind  will

stay  forever.   Her  smile, demeanour, integrity,  noble  moral

character  and  poise will always remain in  the  minds  of  the

people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the business community, I

fully  support  the  motion standing in the name  of  the  Prime

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs  (Mr  Zainul Abidin Rasheed)  (In  Malay):   Mr

Speaker, Sir, I did not know the First Lady, Mrs Ong, well,  but

well enough to say that Mrs Ong was a mother, a professional, an

entrepreneur  and a First Lady who was determined, strong-willed

and  full  of benevolence.  When I was Editor of Berita  Harian,

and  covering the former Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew's visit

to  China  in  1980,  President Ong and  Mrs  Ong  were  in  the

delegation.   I  saw  Mrs Ong then as someone  who  was  gentle,

gracious and caring.  Mrs Ong was very concerned about our needs

and  welfare, especially for the reporters who were covering the

visit.   Singapore  has  lost  a First  Lady  who  was  full  of

dedication  and one with the true spirit of being a Singaporean.

May her soul rest in peace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion moved by the Prime

Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise, on behalf of the

Party and the other Member and myself in this House, to say that

we support whatever has been said by the Prime Minister.  And on

behalf  of  the Party and us, we extend our condolences  to  the

family of Mrs Ong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I met the First Lady was when my wife and I

were invited to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>



Istana to have a popiah party.  She was very

gracious, a woman without airs and easily approachable.  I read

in the papers that she carried out her duties very bravely and

courageously.  No one would know, by looking at her calm and

dignified surface, that she was internally in great pain and

discomfort.

I read also in the papers that President Ong knew the First Lady

when  he  was  in school and they courted and carried  on  their

courtship into the university days and I believe when they  came

back  to Singapore, they worked together.  They were very  close

and I believe that they must have been a very loving couple and,

therefore,  it must have been a great loss to the  President  on

the untimely death of his beloved wife.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I extend my deep sympathy and condolences to the President

and his family.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I join the

Prime Minister and the Members of this House to express my  deep

sympathy and condolences to President Ong and his family on  the

loss of his wife, Mrs Ong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Ong, whom I have known for the past eight years, was

indeed an outstanding person, an outstanding First Lady, who  in

her own quiet ways has won the hearts of Singaporeans.  Those of

us  who  know her personally, know her for her kind  and  gentle

ways  in  which she carried herself. She had won admiration  and

respect for her simple and humble personality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had the privilege of attending a number of

receptions  and dinners hosted by the President  and  the  First

Lady.   At these occasions, she was always an excellent  hostess

who  went  out of her way to show her concern and care  for  the

guests, in fact, every guest. She would be deeply missed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have also come to know her as a brave and

courageous person who had carried out her duties as First  Lady,

despite her illness.  Her smile, an infectious smile, often gave

away  little  clue of her physical condition and often  made  us

believe that she was feeling better.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past weekend, at several of my

constituency functions, many grassroots leaders, residents and

even children had expressed words of sympathy and sorrow at her

sudden demise. One resident who was emotional said that she felt

as if she had lost a member of her family.  Such are the

feelings of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Indian Singaporeans and Indian organisations have also

expressed  their  grief and sorrow at the passing  of  Mrs  Ong.

They  share  the  sorrow of President Ong, his  family  and  the

nation.   The  Hindu  Endowments Board  plans  to  hold  special

prayers in memory of Mrs Ong at its four temples tonight.   Many

Hindu devotees are expected to join in in the prayers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans from all walks of life, different races and

religions feel the loss with great sorrow.  It is this emotional

bind that bonds us as one people.  Mrs Ong will be deeply missed

and fondly remembered by us all.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony</b>

<b>Tan Keng Yam):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family and I have known Siew May for over 20 years since

I  entered politics in 1979.  We always found her to be kind and

gracious  and considerate in the concern for others.   Siew  May

was a brave woman.  My wife and I last saw her on 20th July when

she was in hospital having a blood transfusion.  She was sitting

on a couch holding a pillow, speaking to her grandson. She spoke

animatedly about family matters and preparations for the opening

of the Nanyang Girls' High School.  She was at that time in pain

but  she  showed no signs of it and conducted herself cheerfully

and as graciously as ever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the work for education, particularly for the Nanyang

Girls'  High School, for charity, in the way she carried herself

and  lived  her  life, Siew May was a model for  many  women  in

Singapore.   Her passing away is a sad loss, not  only  for  the

President and his family, but for the whole nation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik

Sidek  bin  Saniff)  (In Malay): Mr Speaker, Sir,  every  living

thing  has  to pass away.  But that has many ways and, according

to  a  Malay  idiom,  when a tiger dies, it  leaves  behind  its

stripes  but for us human beings, we will leave behind our  good

name  and respect. Khairil Anwar, a poet, said that one's legacy

remains  even  after it has passed away.  I  believe  all  these

idioms  can  make  ourselves understand about Mrs  Ong  who  has

passed away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan, my family and

I  have  known  her  since  I  was appointed  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Culture.  I was

the  Parliamentary Secretary to President Ong who  was  at  that

time  the  Minister for both the Ministries, and what  has  been

said in this House by my colleagues is true.  For my wife and I,

whenever we had special meetings with her at Istana or at  other

places,  we always talked about the future, our children,  their

experiences in National Service and what we have done for  them.

President Ong and the First Lady have given us strength when  we

have  to  perform  our duties during a period of  certainty  and

uncertainty.  Her departure has left an impact on the  people  - the  students, the workers, as has been said by Mr Lim Boon Heng

and including those who are unable to come close to her but have

seen her from far away - who have found her departure as a loss.

And that is what I feel about her contribution to the prosperity

of  Singapore.  Just like the Malay idiom that says that when  a

tiger  dies, it will leave behind its stripes but when  a  human

being dies he will leave behind his honour and respect.  That is

the actual meaning of death and whether we die at the age of 30,

40  or 50 years old, is secondary.  The important thing is  that

we have made our life meaningful in many ways, like contributing

to  our  society.   My family and I feel this loss  and  we  are

grateful  that we have got friends who are older whom  we  treat

like our sisters and brothers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I fully express my condolences to President Ong and

his family, as stated by the Prime Minister just now.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I wholeheartedly

support the Prime Minister's motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, like the speakers before me, our hearts do go out to

President  Ong  and  his  family  during  this  time  of   their

bereavement.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, I think this

motion  finds resonance all across Singapore because we can  see

how  many  Singaporeans from all walks of  life,  regardless  of

race,  gender, age  -   how they have actually flocked to attend

the wake because they respected and cared for the First Lady.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to support

the  motion by the Prime Minister and on behalf of my fellow GPC

Chairmen and the Members extend our deepest condolences  to  the

President  and his family on the untimely demise  of  the  First

Lady.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much truth in the statement that behind every

successful man is a supportive woman. The President's  long  and

illustrious  career  spans the private and  public  sectors,  in

political  office,  culminating in the present  high  office  of

President.   Throughout the past 36 years, the  First  Lady  had

been most supportive of her husband.  She continued to lead  the

architectural business of the family when her husband  became  a

Minister in the Government.  As a loving mother, she brought  up

the family of two sons, not to mention looking after her husband

when  he  himself fell sick.  As First Lady, she had done  much,

more  than  a fair share of charity work, and lent her  personal

support  to  a  host  of social services.  It  would  have  been

difficult enough to juggle these three jobs when one is healthy.

It  would be too much to expect the First Lady to continue doing

them  when she herself was stricken with cancer two and  a  half

years ago.  To the amazement of all Singaporeans, the First Lady

took  her  illness  in her stride. She worked  tirelessly  until

almost to the end.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>



Her  positive attitude to life, living  it  to  the

full,  and  making  a  full  contribution  to  her  family   and

Singapore,  despite daunting odds, deserves our full  admiration

and our thanks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will all miss her as she had touched our lives in one

way  or another. We will all have warm memories of the good that

she has done for Singapore directly and through her husband.  My

own  wish  is that with time, the President will come  to  terms

with  the  loss of his loved one in the comfort that  the  First

Lady  in  her time, had made contributions to Singapore that  he

would  be very proud of and we will all remember.  May the  good

Lord  continue  to look after the President and his  family  and

help them to overcome the grief during these difficult times.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the sentiments of the Prime Minister and the

other  Members  of this House.  The loss of the First  Lady  has

been a loss to the whole country.  The loss to the President and

his family is irreparable.  The First Lady, in her lifetime, had

contributed to the country and to the community, especially  her

contribution to education would be a living testimony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last few days, people from all walks of life

have  gone  to the President's house to pay their last  respect.

We  pray  that President Ong will find fortitude in the days  to

come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I end my speech by quoting from Bhagavad Gita which

says, the body leaves the world but the soul lives on.  In a few

hours,  the  mortal  remain of the First Lady  will  leave  this

world.  But her good deeds will live with us.  We in this  House

pray  for  the  President and his family.  May  God  grant  them

strength to overcome the present grief.  The President's loss is

the loss to the whole country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members who

have  spoken  and  joined me in expressing our  condolences  and

support  to the President and his family.  The Members who  have

spoken represent a whole spectrum of the House

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>



- backbenchers, frontbenchers, the opposition as

well as the NMPs.  I note that, if not for the constraint of

time, more Members of Parliament would have joined us in

expressing our condolences to the President and the family.  We

all share a sentiment which I have expressed earlier on this sad

occasion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses its deep sympathy and condolence

<div align="center"><b>EXPATRIATES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what

are the current and projected numbers of expatriates working  in

Singapore; and (b) whether the Government will introduce any tax

efficient  pension scheme as an alternative retirement provision

to  the  Central Provident Fund scheme for such expatriates,  in

line  with  its  efforts  to  attract and  retain  international

talent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) There are currently about 80,000 Employment Pass

holders in Singapore, an increase of 20,000 as compared to  that

in   1995.  We  do  not  have  detailed  projection  figures  of

expatriates.   However,  we would expect  a  higher  demand  for

expatriates  in  the  future.   As  Singapore  evolves  into   a

knowledge-based   economy,  our  industries   will   restructure

themselves to take on higher value-added activities that require

a  better  skills profile.  Therefore, there will be the  urgent

need for more international talents to meet this shortage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To attract and retain international talent, we must

offer  employment  terms  that are internationally  competitive.

Tax   rates   for   expatriates  working  here   are   generally

competitive.  However, as such expatriates do not contribute  to

CPF, their effective rate of income tax is higher than that paid

by  citizens and permanent residents.  MOM together with MOF  is

studying this, to see if there is any justification for allowing

tax efficient pension schemes as the Member has suggested.
