<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[11th  June, 1969], "That the Bill be now  read  a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, the business of government is to

ensure that the rule of law must be seen to

prevail, and not thwarted. This means that the

administration of justice is carried out fairly

and justly, and that the law does take its course.

When making changes to existing practice, we have

to ask ourselves whether the change we are

introducing will be for the better.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having spent a decade in the practice of the law,

with  some experience in the criminal courts,  and

another decade in government having to provide for

the  machinery  of justice, the police  and  their

investigations, public prosecutors and the courts,

I have little doubt that this is a change which in

our  circumstances will ensure that justice is the

more likely to be done, and seen to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If three High Court Judges cannot decide on

questions   of  fact  better  than  seven   random

jurymen,  then grievous harm is being  done  every

day.  Single  Judges and single  Magistrates  have

been, and are deciding questions of fact, both  in

civil and criminal cases. Every day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



single  Judges and single Magistrates  make  their

decisions after findings on questions of  fact  on

the  evidence  of  witnesses under examination-in-chief   and  cross  examination.  Sometimes   they

intervene  to pose questions. Sometimes  documents

and  exhibits  are  brought before  them.  I  have

little  doubt  that they are the  more  likely  to

arrive at the truth as against a jury of laymen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury system may work in Singapore, if our

jurors   do   not   feel  overwhelmed   with   the

responsibility  of having to find  a  man  guilty,

when  they  know that this means a death sentence.

It  also requires Judges who have complete command

of  their courts, and are sufficiently subtle  and

skilful  to  get  juries to arrive  at  the  right

verdict through a judicious choice of words  which

cannot be attacked on appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in England, the present Lord Chief Justice

has  had occasion in recent years to make a number

of  caustic comments on the jury system.  One  can

always  fall back on Blackstone in the  eighteenth

century, and several English Judges of the present

century to proclaim the virtues of the Anglo-Saxon

method  of  jury trial. But, even in England  from

the   requirement  of  unanimous  verdict  for   a

conviction,  it  is now only necessary  to  get  a

majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also not so long ago in England juries were

called  upon to decide questions of fact  even  in

civil cases, like actions for libel. Now they have

been abolished. The administration of justice  has

to  be kept apace and abreast with the times.  And

the  reputation of the jury for divine discernment

is now much tarnished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen in Singapore several miscarriages of

justice  in the past few years. In one  trial  for

murder  recently, a trial that should  have  taken

five days dragged on for over 30 days as Judge and

prosecutor  leant  over backwards  to  ensure  the

appearance of justice being manifestly done. In my

view, it was overdone. Every visiting psychiatrist

was  called  to  give evidence,  ending  with  the

majority of jurymen being so impressed or confused

that a majority of the jury



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



reduced  the charge of murder to a conviction  for

culpable  homicide. The time has come to put  this

right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Europe is not uncivilised. They too have

the  rule  of  law, although more Roman  law  than

Anglo-Saxon  law.  The French, Germans,  Italians,

and Dutch do not have juries for civil or criminal

trials. No jurist or student of jurisprudence  has

been  reckless enough to say that justice  is  not

being done in these countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question some lawyers unconsciously frame is:

Before  whom does an accused person, who  can  pay

for  a good advocate, stand a more sporting chance

of  being acquitted, three High Court Judges or  a

jury  of  seven?  I  suggest that  as  legislators

concerned  with the administration of justice,  we

are  not interested in this question. The question

that  we  in  this House must ask  is:  Are  three

Judges  more likely to do justice than  seven  men

chosen at random to serve on a jury?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we know the answer to this. I support the

Second Reading of this Bill.



<br><br>2.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b>Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday we heard the Minister

for Law and National Development and my colleagues

the Member for Bukit Panjang and the Member for

Serangoon Gardens expressing their views as well

as their concern about certain portions of the

Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill. Today we

had the opportunity of listening to the Prime

Minister himself. All these four Members are from

the legal profession and I have no doubt that they

are fully conversant with and convinced of what

they have expressed in this House. They have

quoted authoritative opinions in support of their

views. We are also aware that several members of

the legal profession in Singapore and the Bar

Committee have raised, to quote the Minister for

Law, "vociferous objections" to the Bill. Sir, may

I express some of the misgivings I have as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



layman  who has no connection whatsoever with  the

legal profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not too long ago, a Member of Parliament (a

colourful personality who is no more with us) in a

friendly  neighbouring country when  referring  to

another  Member of Parliament's interpretation  of

some  law, pointedly stated that just as a  person

who    prescribes    medicine   without    medical

qualifications is termed a "quack",  similarly,  a

man without legal training who presumes to analyse

legal  points is termed a "lawyer burok".  At  the

risk  of  being disparaged in a similar manner,  I

feel   it  is  my  duty  to  express  the  genuine

misgivings  that the ordinary people may  have  in

regard to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister, while outlining the need for

the  introduction of the Bill, has mentioned  that

our  experiences in the recent past have shown the

unreliability of the system of trial by jury where

persons who should have been convicted had instead

been  acquitted. Sir, a pertinent question is,  is

it solely because this aspect of administration of

justice  has  been  left in  the  hands  of  seven

laymen?  Or  can it not be, as the Prime  Minister

once  suggested  when  advocating  more  equitable

salaries  for our legal officers in the Government

service,  that a number of criminals  are  roaming

the  streets  because of the unrealistic  salaries

for legal officers which have been responsible for

effecting  a  brain drain from Government  service

into  private practice, leaving, as it  were,  the

Attorney-General's Chambers with the second  best?

Even   though   the  position   may   have   shown

improvement recently, the few good legal  officers

in the legal service are not able to cope with the

number of criminal cases on their hands. It stands

to  reason that a Deputy Public Prosecutor who has

to  handle several cases at one and the same  time

cannot   devote  the  same  amount  of  time   and

attention as opposing counsel may be able to do in

a particular case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when speaking on this Bill, we

must not forget that in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



many  countries  the trend of  public  opinion  is

against  capital punishment and this Bill is  only

applicable   to  cases  in  respect   of   capital

offences. The effect of this Bill is tantamount to

the   facilitation   of  capital   punishment   in

Singapore. The point I wish to make is  that  just

as  there  are  authorities and  learned  opinions

which  have  been  cited  in  this  House  by  the

proponents  of the Bill in favour of abolition  of

trial by jury, there are equally authoritative and

learned   opinions  to  the  effect  that  capital

punishment  is  not a solution to the  problem  of

criminal and anti-social behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now refer to the practical

difficulties that we may have to face if this Bill

becomes  law.  We  have known in practice  in  all

criminal  cases where the punishment of  death  is

authorised by law, that the trial may spread  over

a  number  of  days and that this  Bill,  when  it

becomes  law, will have the effect of causing  not

one  but  three  Judges to be tied up  during  the

course  of  the  trial. Knowing that  there  is  a

shortage of High Court Judges at this juncture, it

would  appear  that Singapore can ill  afford  the

luxury of having three Judges to be fully occupied

with one trial. Even if we increase the number  of

Judges,  I fear that the Bill will bring  about  a

long  back-log  of  court cases  and  consequently

justice could not be meted out as expeditiously as

it should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now refer to clause 3 of the Bill which

seeks  to  amend Chapter 21, section  178  of  the

Criminal  Procedure Code. Subsection  (3)  of  the

proposed section 178 reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the three Judges of the High Court are unable

to  arrive at a decision either unanimously or  by

majority,  the  court may acquit  the  accused  or

discharge him, such discharge not amounting to  an

acquittal; in either case the accused may be tried

before another court consisting of three Judges of

the  High Court other than those who had tried him

previously.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if three learned Judges cannot arrive at a

decision,  then  I suggest that some  doubts  have

been  raised  and  I  feel the  case  deserves  an

acquittal,  and  not another trial before  another

court,  consisting  of three Judges  of  the  High

Court



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



other  than  those who had tried  him  previously.

Sir,  what  happens if the second  court  is  also

unable  to arrive at a decision either unanimously

or  by majority? I feel that an important accepted

principle is being ignored, namely, that no person

should  be  placed in peril of his life  twice.  I

would have thought that the replacement of a  jury

of  seven  laymen by a panel of three  Judges  who

represent  the  top of the legal profession  would

have  further obviated the necessity of  a  second

trial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is gratifying to know that the Bill is

going  to  a Select Committee and I have no  doubt

that the Committee, as the Minister has given  the

assurance,  will give every consideration  to  the

constructive suggestions and objections raised  by

any interested party.



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is significant that out of

the  58 Members of Parliament in this House,  only

five  Members  spoke on this Bill,  and  of  these

five, four are lawyers. The interest shown in this

House  in  the  Bill reflects the  interest  shown

outside  the  House. The rumblings  and  grumbling

heard  outside this House are confined  mainly  to

some  members of the legal profession  who,  as  I

said  yesterday, practise mostly in  the  criminal

courts.  We have hardly heard a groan  or  even  a

squeak  against  this Bill from  the  man  in  the

street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when lawyers get together and protest and

begin  to shout, "The jury is the lamp of freedom.

What is this Government doing? Ah, they are taking

the  jury away;" some people begin to sit up, some

prick  up  their ears and listen,  and  even  some

students begin to get restless. Fortunately,  Sir,

not many people outside this House have even shown

the  slightest  interest  in  retaining  the  jury

system.  Let  us examine more closely this  catchy

phrase "the jury is the lamp of freedom". What  is

this  freedom?  Whose freedom is  it?  Is  it  the

freedom to kill, or kidnap and hold to ransom  and

sometimes  kill in the process? Is it the  freedom

to carry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



firearms  with impunity? Or is it the  freedom  of

lawyers, whilst defending an accused person  on  a

capital charge, to address and sway a jury? As you

well know, Sir, no such freedom exists. It is  not

even  a  right. The fundamental rights of liberty,

like  the liberty of a person, freedom of  speech,

freedom   of  religion,  are  enshrined   in   our

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will know that in order to make this Bill

law,  there  is no need to amend the Constitution.

So to speak of the jury as the lamp of freedom is,

with the greatest respect, Sir, in the context  of

our  society, pure and utter balderdash. Trial  by

jury  is, therefore, a mere privilege -- a privilege

that  the  law  has  up  to now  accorded  accused

persons  (who  if  convicted  are  liable  to   be

sentenced  to  death) to be tried  by  a  jury;  a

privilege  the law has accorded lawyers  defending

such accused persons to address and perhaps sway a

jury.  The time has come for this privilege to  be

taken away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should explain for the benefit of some

Members  of  this House that in our courts  today,

two  types of cases are heard - civil and criminal

cases. Civil cases in Singapore have never at  any

time  been  heard  by a jury.  Today,  as  far  as

criminal cases are concerned, it is only in  cases

in  the  High  Court  where  accused  persons  are

charged   with   offences  that   may   lead,   on

conviction,   to   the   imposition   of   capital

punishment,  that  juries  are  required.  On  the

average, out of the thousands of cases heard every

year in the High Court and the subordinate courts,

only  about  one dozen cases are cases  which  are

tried  with  a Judge and a jury. This  Bill,  when

enforced,  will result in the end of  jury  trials

for  these  types of cases. In place of the  jury,

there will be three Judges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the main objection to a trial by three

Judges?  I  think it is pretty obvious that  three

Judges  can  decide  questions  of  law  and  even

questions of fact better than seven laymen. It has

been  faintly  suggested that the Government  can,

and the Government may,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



influence  the  Judges. Sir, does  any  reasonable

person believe that this Government, whatever  its

defects and whatever its shortcomings, would stoop

so  low  as  to influence our Judges by pressuring

them   into   convicting  alleged   murderers   or

kidnappers?  I need not assure the House  that  we

have far better things to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also remind the House of Article 125 of the

Constitution which provides for the protection  of

Judges.   This  is  Article  125  of  the  Federal

Constitution  which was retained  by  us  when  we

passed  the  independence Act in  December,  1965.

Sir,  this  Article  is being  re-enacted  in  the

Constitution  (Amendment)  Bill  now  before   the

House.  I  refer  to clause 2 of this  Bill  which

seeks to enact an Article 52F Clause (3) of  this

new Article reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the Prime Minister, or the Chief Justice

after consulting the Prime Minister, represents to

the  President  that a Judge of the Supreme  Court

ought  to be removed on the ground of misbehaviour

or of inability, from infirmity of body or mind or

any   other  cause,  to  properly  discharge   the

functions  of  his  office,  the  President  shall

appoint  a tribunal in accordance with clause  (4)

of    this   Article   and   shall   refer    that

representation to

it, and may on the recommendation of the tribunal

remove the Judge from office.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause (4) of this new Article goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The tribunal shall consist of not less than five

persons who hold or have held office as a Judge of

the  Supreme Court or the High Court in Singapore,

or,  if  it appears to the President expedient  to

make such an appointment, persons who hold or have

held   equivalent  office  in  any  part  of   the

Commonwealth, and the tribunal shall  be  presided

over  by the member first in the following  order,

namely, the Chief Justices...'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am merely bringing the attention of

Members  to  this clause to show that the  Judges,

once  appointed, are firmly seated in their office

and practically irremovable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I will

deal briefly with the suggestion of the Member for

Bukit Panjang, which was also touched upon by  the

Member   for  Telok  Blangah, that  the  proposed

subsection  (3) of the new section 178  should  be

deleted. I informed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



the  House  yesterday that it is the intention  of

Government  to send this Bill to Select  Committee

where  representations may be made in writing  and

representors  heard in person if they  so  desire.

When  the  Bill  is  taken  clause  by  clause  in

Committee,  every consideration will be  given  to

the   Members'   suggestion  and  to   any   other

representations that we may receive. Indeed,  Sir,

now  that  only  members of one  Party  have  been

elected  to  represent  the people  of  Singapore,

representations   from  the   public   to   Select

Committee  on  this  and  on  any  Bill  are  most

welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I also just touch upon one more point

which  was raised by the Member for Telok  Blangah

who  was  worried about the number of  Judges?  He

said  we might require six or more Judges.  May  I

say  at this stage that there is no difficulty  in

appointing  more  Judges. At the  moment,  we  are

short because two Judges, Mr Justice Buttrose and

Mr  Justice Ambrose, left recently and no one has

been appointed since. I do not appoint Judges  but

I  can  assure the House that the matter  is  well

being  looked  after  and  more  Judges  will   be

appointed very soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee

consisting  of Mr Speaker as Chairman  and  seven

Members  to  be  nominated  by  the  Committee  of

Selection." [Mr

Barker].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill now before the House introduces two

amendments to the Singapore Constitution. Clause 2

of the Bill seeks to introduce a new Part A of the

Constitution, and as Members will see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



it  makes provision for the Judiciary. This branch

of   Government  is  missing  from  the  Singapore

Constitution  in  its original  form  because  the

Order  in  Council  setting out  the  Constitution

envisaged   Singapore  as  a  state   within   the

Federation of Malaysia, the judicial power  was  a

Federal  matter and was therefore set out  in  the

Federal  Constitution. Now  that  we  have  become

independent on our own, this obvious hiatus in our

Constitution is being provided for. This amendment

comes  at  an appropriate moment accompanying  the

Supreme  Court of Judicature Bill which would  set

out in detail the judicial structure in Singapore.

In so far as the Judiciary is a separate branch of

Government,  it  has to be set out separately  and

enacted in this Part of the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill sets out more radical

provisions.  The new Part IVa of the  Constitution

deals  with  the  setting up of  the  Presidential

Council.  Hon. Members will remember that  amongst

the  various suggestions made by the Wee Chong Jin

Report   on  constitutional  provisions  for   the

protection of minority rights in the Republic  was

this  recommendation, namely, the setting up of  a

Council  of State to act as an extra Parliamentary

safeguard  for the protection of minority  rights.

Members will also recall the speech I made to this

House   on  the  Constitutional  Report  on   21st

December,  1966, when I informed  the  House  that

among the various recommendations in regard to the

protection  of fundamental rights and freedoms  of

the  individual  and the manner in  which  various

provisions  of  the  Constitution  ought   to   be

entrenched, the Government would agree  with  this

recommendation of a Council of State. I  had  also

told  the  House that although we would differ  in

detail,  in principle we agreed to such a  Council

being established. Instead of calling this Council

the "Council of State", the Government has decided

to  name it the "Presidential Council", a term  we

consider more suitable and more appropriate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council would consist of a Chairman and ten

permanent members appointed for life and ten other

members  appointed for various  periods  up  to  a

maximum  of  three  years.  As  set  out  in   the

Explanatory  Note, the functions  of  the  Council

will  be  principally to consider  and  report  on

matters   affecting  persons  of  any  racial   or

religious  community  in  Singapore  as   may   be

referred to it by Parliament or by the Government.

The  Council  is  also to examine  all  Bills  and

subsidiary   legislation   to   ensure   that   no

provisions  in  our laws would  result  in  unfair

discrimination  against or otherwise  violate  any

fundamental liberties of the individual set out in

our Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been argued by some that such a chamber as

the  Presidential  Council comprising  non-elected

members would be a derogation of the supremacy  of

Parliament.  We have been careful to  ensure  that

this  will  not  be  so. In the normal  course  of

events, the Council can only delay the passage  of

a  Bill  for s period of one month. But as Members

will appreciate, if the Presidential Council is to

play  its  role  as a checkpoint to safeguard  the

rights  of  the individual, it must  have  certain

powers. Although Members of the Government may  be

allowed to attend meetings of the Council  and  to

take part in its deliberations, they will not join

in reaching its decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Council will not be confined

solely  to  the  scrutiny  of  Bills  enacted   by

Parliament. Subsidiary legislation as may be  made

under  the authority of an Act of Parliament would

come  within  the purview of the Council,  to  see

whether  a particular provision even in subsidiary

legislation amounts to a "differentiating measure"

or  in  any  other  way  violate  the  fundamental

liberties of the subject. Whilst it has  no  power

to  veto  any  legislation  and  so  diminish  the

supremacy of our elected legislature, it does draw

public   attention  to  any  proposal   which   it

considers discriminatory of any minority group. So

any  government  of the day has  to  consider  the

odium it would incur



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



publicly  for  enforcing  majority  rule  to  the

disadvantage  of  a minority,  although  this  is

normal democratic practice.



<div align="center"><h4>	[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, certain Bills must of necessity be

excluded from the purview of the Council  such  as

Money  Bills or indeed any Bill certified  by  the

Prime  Minister to be so urgent that it would  not

be in the public interest to delay its enactment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These and similar provisions do not seriously

affect  the supremacy of Parliament. It  is  hoped

that  far  from derogating from the  supremacy  of

Parliament, members of the Council will carry  out

their  functions in the spirit and  intendment  of

this  Bill,  namely, to assist Parliament  in  its

consideration  of  Acts of Parliament  and  ensure

that such Acts or other enactments made under  the

authority  of  Acts  of Parliament  are  fair  and

undiscriminating  in  their  effects  to  all  the

various peoples in our Republic. In this way it is

the  hope  that confidence and a sense of security

and  a  sense  of  more than  fair  play  will  be

engendered throughout the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the considerable public interest

in  this  Bill, I intend to send it  to  a  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Prof Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof Wong Lin Ken (Alexandra):</b> Sir, I rise to speak on the Constitution

(Amendment) Bill, a subject of compelling  concern

to  all those, within and without Parliament,  who

believe  that  a  multi-racial  society,  with   a

diversity  of  cultures, can  be  organized  on  a

rational   basis  that  denies   no   race   equal

opportunities in life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not the only multi-racial nation on earth,

and  the  Government is certainly  not  the  first

government faced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



with  the  all-important problem  of  finding  an

appropriate    national   framework    by    which

multifarious races can live and work  together  in

peace  and  harmony,  respect  and  tolerate  each

other's  differences and share, at the same  time,

an  identity  of nationhood. To take some  liberty

with   a   proverbial  expression,  the  political

harvests which a nation reaps depend on the way in

which  it  has  sowed the seeds of  nationhood  on

ground  fertile for politics along communal lines.

As  a  historian by profession, I  would  like  to

quote history

-  history  is  replete with examples  of  violent

political  harvests that can  only  sow  seeds  of

further bloody discord.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In examining the evolution of the present

constitutional  amendment for the  creation  of  a

Presidential    Council,   I   note    that    the

Constitutional  Commission  of   1966   made   the

following  recommendation, and  I  quote  page  4,

paragraph 16, of its Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We recommend the creation of a non-elected

advisory body to be called "the Council of  State"

with   a   small   membership,  not   subject   to

dissolution   but  renewing  itself   at   regular

intervals by the retirement and replacement  of  a

proportion of its members in rotation. The members

should   be  appointed  by  the  President   after

consultation with the Prime Minister  but  in  the

President's  discretion from amongst able,  mature

citizens irrespective of race, colour or creed who

have attained eminence or responsible positions in

their  respective walks of life but  who  are  not

members of any political party. We believe such  a

body  can play an effective and vital part in  the

affairs  of  the nation in many ways. It  will  be

able in its debates to focus the attention of  the

public  on  any matter originating from Parliament

which  may adversely affect the interests  of  any

minority  group. It will also be able to serve  as

an  additional check on new legislation  and  this

would  be particularly useful on matters of  great

public  importance  and  on  matters  which  might

affect  the  minorities. Also, it  will  be  able,

especially  where  there  is  no  responsible   or

effective Opposition in Parliament, to put forward

where  it  considers it necessary  in  the  public

interest  to do so, constructive and well-informed

criticism  or amendments of measures  proposed  in

Parliament.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it will be recalled that

nowhere  in  the Constitutional Commission  Report

did  it propose that the interests of the minority

races in Singapore be secured or protected in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



the   form   of  constitutional  entrenchment   of

minority  rights over and above those  enjoyed  by

the  majority race. Indeed, it considered minority

representation in Parliament or in an Upper House,

or  proportional representation, as constitutional

measures  that  would defeat their very  objective

and intensify politics along communal lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitutional Commission believed, and I am

of  the  view  that  history  will  vindicate  its

belief,  that  minority interests  would  be  best

secured  and protected if minority groups  enjoyed

the  same fundamental rights as the majority race.

Its  belief and faith in a non-racial Constitution

of   Singapore  evidently  was  derived  from  the

political  foresight  and  common  sense  of   its

members,  and  reflected  their  belief  that  the

various races in Singapore were increasingly aware

that  (and  I quote page 3, paragraph  10  of  the Report):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'their future and the future of the nation lies

in  a non-racial approach to all problems under  a

form  of government which would enable the  growth

of  a  united,  multi-racial, free and  democratic

nation in which all its citizens have equal rights

and equal opportunities.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27th August, 1966, the Commission presented

its Report to the President. The Report was tabled

in this Parliament in December 1966 and debated in

March  1967.  Most of the recommendations  of  the

Commission were accepted by the Government, and in

many  others the Government accepted the principle

but not the details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, slightly more than two years have elapsed

between  the  last  debate on the  Report  of  the

Constitutional Commission and the present  Reading

of  the  Constitution (Amendment)  Bill,  and  the

public has adequate time to digest and ingest  the

Report  and  the basic views of the Government  on

it. In the interim, the present Government had its

mandate  to  govern  renewed,  and  had,  to   the

astonishment of the world and to its own political

embarrassment, won  every  single   parliamentary

seat.  I attach some special significance to this,

for  in  a  state predominantly Chinese in  racial

composition, neither the extreme right  nor  left

Chinese parties had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



wanted  to test their strength with a multi-racial

party,  leaving it an almost uncontested arena  to

assume  power for a third time in succession.  The

Constitutional  Commission of 1966  in  retrospect

had  not misjudged the political mood of the races

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Presidential Council reflects the

intention,  the  purpose, and the  spirit  of  the

Council of State recommended by the Constitutional

Commission.  As  recommended, it  is  an  advisory

body,  and leaves untouched the present unicameral

legislature.  It also does not infringe  upon  the

responsibilities of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a fundamental principle of

parliamentary  democracy  that  the  supremacy  of

Parliament remains paramount. In my opinion, there

is  nothing  in the proposed Presidential  Council

that undermines this principle. It is correct that

the  Presidential Council shall only be  empowered

to   examine   the   Bills   after   the   elected

representatives  of  the  people   have   studied,

debated and passed them, for I regard intervention

of   the  Council  before  the  final  Reading  as

encroachment   upon   the   responsibilities   and

privileges   of   Parliament.   To    allow    the

Presidential Council to intervene at  any  earlier

stage of parliamentary Reading of the Bills is  to

permit   it  to  exercise  an  influence  in   the

legislature,  at  the  time that  the  Members  Of

Parliament  should be sensitive to public  opinion

and form their own independent judgment as to what

parliamentary measures will be for the public good

and    supportable   by   the   electorate.    The

Presidential  Council's  report  of  any  Bill  or

subsidiary  legislation is advisory in  character,

and  it is not mandatory on the part of Parliament

to  accept  it, and can be over-ridden if  a  two-thirds   majority  of  parliamentary  Members   so

decide.  However, I should imagine  no  Parliament

can  lightly disregard or dismiss the view of  the

Presidential  Council unless there be  over-riding

reasons  for  not acting on its advice.  The  two-thirds  majority  rule  is an  adequate  safeguard

against  any  infringement  of  the  supremacy  of

Parliament, at the same time against disrespect of

the Presidential Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it has been both consistent with

parliamentary    principles   and    the    proper

functioning of the Presidential Council  that  its

proceedings  be conducted in private.  Privacy  of

proceedings  safeguards  its  members   from   the

intimidating  pressure of communal public  opinion

as  well as removes any possibility of playing  to

the communal gallery. As regards its lack of right

to  hear objectors or examine witnesses, I  am  of

the  view that this will not impair the efficiency

and  efficacy  of  the Presidential  Council.  The

right  to  hear  objectors  or  witnesses  rightly

belongs  to Parliament, either in the chambers  of

Select Committees or parliamentary commissions  of

inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is criticism from many quarters that there

should be an Opposition to the present Government.

The Constitutional Commission of 1966 had reported

that the Council of State might act as a check  on

Parliament in an advisory manner in the absence of

responsible or effective Opposition. It is, in  my

view, correct that there is no possibility of  the

proposed Presidential Council developing in a  way

that  might give substance to such a view  of  its

function. An Opposition is regarded as a desirable

factor  that keeps the parliamentary system alive,

but  the  lack of it does not mean the destruction

of the essence of democracy. For in the democratic

process, the electorate can collectively decide to

vote a political party entirely out of Parliament,

as had happened to the Singapore Alliance in 1963.

Equally, it can entirely vote a political party to

all the seats in Parliament - this happened to  us

in 1968.







<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>





<br><br>3.27 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have never said that there

should  be  no  Opposition in Parliament.  But  we

cannot  molly-coddle an Opposition into existence,

directly  or indirectly, for this will be  against

the  national survival of Singapore. There is only

one route to Parliament, and that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



is  by way of elections. The road to Parliament is

raw  and  rough, not for those who want  political

glamour the easy way. Only those with the will  to

succeed,  sustained by tenacity  of  purpose  and,

hopefully,    integrity   of   intentions,    will

eventually  make the grade. Finally, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,   there   is   an  organized  Opposition   in

Singapore,  a fact some choose to ignore,  but  it

has   decided  to  pursue  the  path   of   extra-parliamentary   Opposition,   as   some   of    my

parliamentary  colleagues had vividly  found  when

their branch headquarters were attacked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the multi-racialism which this

Parliament  stands for requires  time  before  its

values,  beliefs, and practices become irrevocably

institutionalized.     No     constitution      or

constitutional  amendments of  any  kind,  however

ingeniously  devised by the wisest men  on  earth,

can guarantee that a constitution will survive the

turbulent  realities of politics. No  constitution

can  guarantee  that minority interests  will  not

suffer or that the majority will not exercise  its

will  in  a discriminating way. There is a popular

mystique about the sanctity and inviolability of a

constitution.  This  is true  of  those  countries

where democratic institutions have evolved over  a

long  period of history, and the political  values

of  democracy  are firmly a part of  the  cultural

traditions of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, post-war history is abundant with

evidence   that   democratic   constitutions    by

themselves  do  not make for democratic  processes

nor   ensure  their  own  survival.  In  the  last

analysis,   all   depends  on   the   people   who

participate in politics - their outlook and  their

beliefs. If this is true of democracy, it is  even

more  so  for  any  constitutional  provision  for

minority   interests.  Ultimately,  the   greatest

safeguard for minority interest in Singapore  lies

not  in  any constitutional provision but  in  the

continued  election of people  to  Parliament  who

believe in and practise multi-racialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we in this Parliament believe

in  multi-racialism, and what  Singapore  requires

primarily is confidence that multi-racialism can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



work  within  the  context  of  the  stresses  and

strains of Southeast Asia, it is our duty and  the

duty of those who share our belief to prove to the

people  that the multi-racial system in  Singapore

can  work as well as establish for our Republic  a

viable  and  enduring political identity.  On  our

conduct   as  a  political  party,  and   on   our

administration as a government will  the  minority

and  the majority races judge us as to our  multi-racialism. The existence of multi-racial Singapore

is a daily referendum, and we have to win it every

day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Constitution

(Amendment) Bill as the constitutional  expression

of  our  declared  faith in an equal  multi-racial

society,  and  our unequivocal intention  to  give

substance and meaning to a nation in which all are

equal regardless of differences of race, language,

culture and religion.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Constitution

(Amendment)  Bill, especially  in  regard  to  the

establishment of a Presidential Council.  I  would

like to congratulate the Minister on this, because

the establishment of a Presidential Council is  in

line with the recommendation of the Constitutional

Commission of 1966. Once again the Government  has

demonstrated that it intends to carry out whatever

it has promised to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, although we have been independent

for  only  four years, the democratic  system  has

worked  very successfully in our country. This  is

due  to  the  fact  that,  firstly,  we  have   an

efficient  and  honest government;  secondly,  our

multi-racial  society is accustomed to  democratic

practices.  This  can  be seen  in  the  last  few

elections held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the various clauses in the Bill are

appropriate.  One of the provisions  in  the  Bill

stipulates that the Council should not  take  more

than  one  month  to  examine  a  Bill  passed  by

Parliament. This will ensure that all Bills passed

by Parliament will be implemented smoothly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to offer two points for the

consideration of the Minister. One  is  about  the

appointment   of   members  to  the   Presidential

Council. Secondly, the composition of the  members

of  the Presidential Council must be multi-racial,

1  hope  we  can appoint people who have extensive

social  experience,  and  who  are  impartial  and

patriotic. I hope the Minister will pay  attention

to these points because the task of the Council is

to  look  after  the interests and rights  of  the

minorities in Singapore.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the multiracial texture of our

society  gives the Presidential Council a distinct

role to play, but it is my feeling that this would

depend  ultimately  on  the  composition  of   the

Council.  It is important to realise that  one  of

the  functions of the Council is to act as a  body

of constitutional interpretation, because, if I am

not  mistaken,  Sir,  the Bill  before  the  House

describes  the functions of this proposed  Council

as  being,  first, advising Parliament on  matters

affecting  minority  rights and,  second,  drawing

attention   to  Bills  and  statutory  legislation

which,  in the eyes of the Council, appear  to  be

inconsistent  with the Constitution  or  with  the

fundamental liberties of the individual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second function of the Council,

that   is, to  advise  Parliament  that   certain

legislation when in operation will be inconsistent

with the Constitution or the fundamental liberties

of  the  individual,  this  will  require  of  the

Council  an  expertise which is  primarily  legal,

particularly   an   expertise  in   constitutional

interpretation.  We  can say  that  such  kind  of

expertise will obviously be lodged in very  mature

members of the legal profession, namely, the Chief

Justice and Puisne Judges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, perhaps I can refer the House to

certain  statements made by the Minister  for  Law

and  National Development when the Report  of  the

Constitutional Commission was tabled  before  this

House in 1966, and reported



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



in  Hansard,  Volume 25, No. 14. The Minister  for

Law  and  National  Development did  suggest  that

perhaps  eminent  people like ex-Chief  Ministers.

Chief  Justices and Puisne Judges could constitute

such  a  Council. I wonder whether this will  make

the  Council operate in the way that is  obviously

intended.  Should such eminent people be appointed

to  this Council, they would be in an embarrassing

position  when legislation which is  suspected  of

being  inconsistent with the Constitution  or  the

fundamental   liberties  of  the   individual   is

contested  in  the  High Court for  interpretation

after the Council had decided unanimously or by  a

majority  to submit an adverse report  thereon  to

Parliament,   and   Parliament   had    thereafter

overridden  such  adverse report by  a  two-thirds

majority. Of course, this will only arise if there

is  such a spate of proceedings for constitutional

interpretation  in the High Court that  we  cannot

avoid having the same Judges who had been involved

in  the  deliberation  on  this  legislation  also

taking  part in the High Court proceedings.  I  am

sure  that  the  Minister is quite aware  of  this

possibility,  but if he will clarify  this  point,

perhaps it might assist the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I might ask, why is it that a two-thirds majority is required under the Bill to over-

ride  an  adverse  report  from  the  Presidential

Council?  It  appears that this  would  reflect  a

certain  amount of consensus on the  part  of  the

Council.  But this may raise another problem, for

it  may  be  said that such a two-thirds  majority

over-riding an adverse report from the Council  is

tantamount to an amendment of the Constitution. By

our Constitution we need only an ordinary majority

to  amend  it. I would not be able to answer  this

question. Would a two-thirds majority of the House

over-riding   an   adverse   report    from    the

Presidential Council amount to an amendment of the

Constitution? If it does mean an amendment to  the

Constitution,  then,  of  course,  to  a   certain

extent,  I  agree with the opinion voiced  outside

that  perhaps it might jeopardise the  individuals

who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



would  not be able to contest this legislation  in

the High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point which can perhaps be

clarified by the Minister. The Bill that is before

the  House specifically excludes the consideration

of  evidence by witnesses and individuals  by  the

Council.  But what if the Council wish to consider

written representations from any source? Would it

be  permitted to do this? These are points  which

perhaps the Minister could clarify.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I too have to seek the

Minister's indulgence in asking one pertinent question  for  clarification. Under  the  Constitution

(Amendment)  Bill - at page 2 -it is  provided  in

clause  (2) of the new Article 52B that  temporary

High  Court  Judges  can be appointed.  Can  these

temporary  High  Court Judges hear criminal  cases

where  the  penalty is death? If so, do they  have

the  protection provided under the new Article 52F

in the Constitution (Amendment) Bill?



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may I remind Members

that  this  is  not Question Time? Apparently  all

four Members who spoke on the Bill support it  not

only  in  principle but in detail. The Member  for

Sembawang even congratulates me. But then he  adds

a  rider  to  the  effect that we  had  better  be

careful   whom  we  appoint  to  the  Presidential

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has raised

several pertinent points. He is worried about  the

expertise   that  would  be  required   --   legal

expertise    in    constitutional   interpretation

probably  of documents of the law which  would  be

required of its members. He is afraid that some of

our  Judges  might be embarrassed should  they  be

party  to  a decision of the Presidential  Council

which  is over-ruled by a two-thirds, majority  in

this  House;  the  same Judge  having  perhaps  to

decide the same point which may be an issue in the

High Court.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps to set the worries of the Members at

rest, it would be best for me to refer again to my

speech  in  this House on 21st December,  1966.  I

quote from Hansard, Vol. 25. No. 14, col 1055:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Membership of this Council ... would be of

two types -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Permanent members: This would consist of men

of  distinction who will be chosen from those  who

hold  or  have  held  high offices,  e.g.  Cabinet

Ministers,  former  Chief  Ministers,  the   Chief

Justice,  the Speaker, the Chairman of the  Public

Service  Commission, Puisne Judges, the  Attorney-General  and  former Permanent Secretaries.  There

would be no age limit:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Members who are removable: Appointments

would be on the advice of Cabinet and would be for

a  fixed  period  of,  say, three  years.  Persons

appointed would be mature citizens who have either

rendered  distinguished public service or attained

eminence  in  their  respective  walks   of   life

regardless of race, colour or creed as recommended

by the Commission.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, surely we are not so short of digits in

Singapore  that  we cannot find 20  men  with  the

necessary  legal expertise to sit on this  Council

and advise this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has also asked

why  a  two-thirds majority is required  when  the

Constitution can be amended in this House  without

a  two-thirds majority. Let me put it this way. Is

the  Presidential Council to sit,  deliberate  and

finally  send  us  its advice only  to  have  such

advice flung out by a simple show of hands? I  do

not  think  this is the way we should reject  such

advice in this House. The Council's advice must be

considered  with  some respect  and  a  two-thirds

majority  will ensure that not all its  decisions,

or  perhaps  very few, may be upset here  and  the

advice not taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has also

enquired whether the Council

can receive written representations. The answer is

"Yes".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I end by dealing with the inquiry made

by  the Member for Telok Blangah? He wants to know

why we have made provision for the appointment  of

temporary Judges and whether these Judges can hear

criminal cases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



which  may attract capital punishment. The  answer

is  "Yes,  they can." In Singapore today  we  have

acting  Ministers  who have  full  powers  of  the

Minister who happens to be away. In the same  way,

an  acting Judge of the High Court will  have  the

same  powers as any permanent Judge of that Court-

the  same  powers  to hear even the  most  serious

criminal cases which attract capital punishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.

"That this Bill be committed to a Select Committee

<div align="center"><b>SUPREME COURT OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>JUDICATURE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Supreme Court of Judicature Bill now

before  the  House,  as its  very  name  suggests,

provides a proper basis for the administration  of

justice  in  our Courts which should  really  have

been  introduced  soon  after  we  left  Malaysia.

Unfortunately, the many and varied Problems  which

we  had  to  deal with upon leaving  Malaysia  had

forced us to continue with the existing system  of

administration of justice until the  present  day.

All  that  the Bill purports to do is to  set  out

logically  the  consequences that  flow  from  our

becoming   independent  on   our   own   with   an

independent system of administration of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



justice   separate  from  the  system   that   was

introduced  while  we were part  of  Malaysia  and

which   had   since   continued   in   use.   Such

anachronistic references to the Federal  Court  of

Appeal, for example, would be done away with.  The

Supreme Court now consists of the Court of Appeal,

the  Court of Criminal Appeal and the High  Court.

The Bill generally does no more than to revert  to

the  position obtaining before we joined Malaysia.

The  powers  of jurisdiction of the Supreme  Court

are  the  same  as  heretofore, before  we  joined

Malaysia  and  after we left Malaysia.  There  are

some  minor  amendments to the law  which  can  be

regarded  as technical and which generally  relate

to  drafting  technique. Apart  from  these  minor

changes,  there  is  the  introduction  of  a  new

provision   in   Part   VII   which   deals   with

miscellaneous  matters. This new section  empowers

the  High  Court  to  declare any  person  who  is

habitually   and  persistently  and  without   any

reasonable cause instituting legal proceedings  as

a vexatious litigant, whereupon such person may be

prevented   from  instituting  legal   proceedings

without  first  obtaining the leave  of  the  High

Court. Such application to the High Court to  have

a person declared a vexatious litigant can only be

made by the Attorney-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the Bill would be very welcome

by  all who practise the law as well as those  who

administer it. One could say, therefore, that this

Bill has been long overdue and would set right  on

a  proper  basis the administration of justice  in

our Courts. No more have the records of appeal for

the  purposes of conformity with the existing  law

to be sent up to the Registry of the Federal Court

in  Kuala Lumpur as it is even now being done. The

Court  would carry on its proceedings in the  same

manner  but  without all the anachronistic  carry-over  of a system which prevailed when we  were  a

state of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<div align="center"><b>DRUGS (PREVENTION OF MISUSE) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to prohibit unauthorised import

and  possession of a group of medicinal substances

which  are  generally referred to  as  stimulants,

appetite suppressants, and hallucinogenic drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will remember that when Parliament sat on

the  16th  of December, 1966, the then Member  for

River   Valley  (Mr  Lim  Cheng  Lock)  expressed

concern  over  the abuse of "pep pills"  which  he

found was available to members of the public  from

unauthorised sellers and requested my  predecessor

to look into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put the record straight, I should point out

that  the  import  and sale of  "amphetamines  and

similar substances" popularly referred to as  "pep

pills"  have been controlled under the  provisions

of   the  Poisons  Ordinance  over  the  past  two

decades.  Since 1961 the control was tightened  by

making    the   substance   available   only    on

prescriptions issued by medical practitioners. The

abuse  to  which the Member for River Valley  drew

attention  is  a recent phenomenon  in  Singapore,

following world-wide publicity given in the  daily

press  of the abuse of these drugs in metropolitan

areas of the developed countries, particularly  in

Japan  and the United States of America, it is  to

be   regretted  that  some  of  our  students   in

institutions of higher learning have  resorted  to

the  use  of these drugs. The appetite suppressant

drugs  have similar properties to the amphetamines

and are in demand for weight reducing purposes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



These  include  Preludin,  Apisate,  Pre-Sate  and

several    others.   Mescaline   and    LSD    are

hallucinogenic substances which are available  for

research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am advised that all the drugs listed in the

Schedule to the Act are liable to habituation  and

persons  taking them become increasingly dependent

on  them. The reasons for taking the drugs in  the

first  instance are depression, fatigue,  boredom,

obesity,  anxiety  or premature ejaculation.  Some

have  taken  them for "kicks". But,  sad  to  say,

resort  to  these  drugs  soon  becomes  a  habit.

Addiction  with  its  tragic train  then  follows.

Persons  "hooked  on", to use a  colloquial  term,

these  drugs  are excitable, unstable,  aggressive

and  disorientated. To combat sleeplessness, some

persons  resort  to  sleeping pills  with  further

deterioration   of   their   health   leading   to

psychosis.   Though  abuse  of  these   drugs   in

Singapore   has  not  developed  into  a   serious

problem.  Members will, no doubt,  agree  with  me

that prevention is better than cure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we in Singapore are in an extremely

vulnerable position since we not only have a young

population  but also we are a big  city  which  is

also  one of the big ports of the world. I  cannot

therefore over-emphasise the importance  of  doing

everything  in our power to guard our youths  from

the tragedies of drug addiction which is now quite

prevalent  in  other parts of the world.  We  just

cannot  afford to allow our youths  to  resort  to

drugs   if  we  are  to  achieve  our  fundamental

objective   of  building  a  strong   and   rugged

generation that is healthy both in mind and body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Poisons Ordinance are

inadequate in that possession, unless "for  sale",

is  not  an  offence and that power of  arrest  at

sight  of  persons in possession of drugs  is  not

provided  for.  These  drugs are  not  "narcotics"

which precludes their inclusion under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



the  Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. On these  grounds,

it  was decided to frame this Bill, which is based

on a similar United Kingdom legislation introduced

in  1964.  The  advice  of  the  Poisons  Advisory

Committee,  consisting of doctors and  pharmacists

and  others in Government and the University,  was

sought   and  the  Committee  recommended  control

similar to that exercised over narcotics under the

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (Cap. 137).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noticed that the medically-supervised

use  and possession of these drugs is allowed  for

and  there  is  no  intention of  restricting  the

legitimate  use  of  these  substances  to   treat

patients. However, one of the ways in which  these

drugs may get into the hands of addicts is through

over-prescribing, as has been noted  in  countries

where there is widespread abuse. It is hoped  that

persons  authorised to supply these drugs,  mainly

doctors, will maintain adequate control over these

drugs  and  prescribe them in limited  amounts  to

meet the therapeutic needs of their patients only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Chua Sian Chin].

amendment; read a Third time and passed.
