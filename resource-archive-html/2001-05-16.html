<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Finance

what  is the rationale of Singapore Telecommunications  Ltd's

proposed  acquisition of Cable and Wireless's  Optus  at  the

announced purchase terms and what are the expected costs  and

benefits of this acquisition.



<div align="center"><b>DBS BANK</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Proposed acquisition of Dao Heng Bank)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Finance

what  is the rationale of DBS Bank's proposed acquisition  of

Dao  Heng  Bank at the announced purchase terms and what  are

the expected costs and benefits of this acquisition.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  with  your permission I would  like  to  take

Question Nos. 1 and 2 together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Singapore Government has for

long  encouraged local companies, both GLCs and non-GLCs,  to

grow beyond the confines of the Singapore economy.  Singapore

Telecom's acquisition of Optus and DBS Bank's acquisition  of

Dao Heng are such moves.  They enable SingTel and DBS Bank to

tap  regional opportunities and become more than  Singaporean

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both SingTel and DBS Bank are listed on the Singapore

Exchange  (SGX)  and fully subject to the discipline  of  the

market.  Like all GLCs, they operate strictly on a commercial

basis.   The  Government does not interfere in the commercial

decisions of GLCs.  Their managements are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>

supervised by their own boards of directors.  The  boards  in

turn are accountable to all shareholders, and not just to the

Government   through  Temasek  Holdings,  which   holds   the

Government's shares in the companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchases of Optus and Dao Heng are long term

strategic  business moves.  Their soundness has to be  judged

over time by the performance of SingTel and DBS Bank, and not

by the immediate reaction of the stock market as reflected in

their  share prices.  It is up to the managements of  SingTel

and  DBS  Bank  to  satisfy themselves of the  strategic  and

financial  merits  of the acquisitions,  and  convince  their

boards  of directors and their shareholders that overall  the

deals will benefit the companies and their shareholders.   As

a  shareholder, Temasek Holdings has full confidence  in  the

competence  and  judgment of the managements  and  boards  of

SingTel  and  DBS  Bank.  SingTel and DBS Bank  are  able  to

undertake  these  transactions only because  they  have  been

successful in their operations, and hence have the  financial

resources to pursue such opportunities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask

the  Minister whether he is aware that in the case  of  Cable

and   Wireless  Optus,  it  is  operating  at  a  much  lower

profitability  than  SingTel  and,  as  a  result,  SingTel's

earnings  could  be dragged down after the acquisition?   Can

the Minister tell this House why the board and the management

of  SingTel considered Optus to be acquired at a fair  price,

even though it was at a price tag of about $15 billion?   How

would SingTel fund this acquisition?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question relating to DBS Bank, along the same

vein,  is  whether the Minister is aware that some  newspaper

analysts  have  commented that DBS Bank is  perceived  to  be

overpaying for Dao Heng Bank.  Can the Minister also  explain

why  the board and management of DBS Bank considered Dao Heng

Bank to be a good buy?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I thought I had answered these

questions.  SingTel put in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>

a  bid  for  Optus  because they believed  that  a  long-term

investment  in  a  major  telecommunications  corporation  in

Australia is in their strategic interest.  It would give them

a large footprint in Australia to be linked up with SingTel's

own operations both in Singapore and elsewhere in the region.

They  are  taking  a  strategic  interest  and  not  so  much

concerned about the immediate impact on their share prices or

short-term profitability based on Optus' historical results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, DBS Bank has taken a strategic look at where

they  want to go offshore and Hong Kong is clearly one market

which,  for obvious reasons, is a must for DBS Bank  if  they

are  going  to  be  a  regional player  and  because  of  the

potential   of   entering  China  sooner   or   later.    The

observations  of analysts, as I have explained earlier,  tend

to  take  a relatively short-term view on what the impact  of

the acquisition, whether it is three-times the book value  or

otherwise,  may  have on the immediate profitability  of  DBS

Bank.   When you buy a controlling share in a large  company,

generally, you have to pay a substantial premium.   The  size

of the premium is a judgment which the management has to take

and  it  is not in Government's interest to try and challenge

that decision.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister is

aware  that  in  the  case of SingTel it is  quite  different

because  it is part of our asset enhancement exercise  and  a

fairly  large number of Singaporeans own shares  in  SingTel.

Since  the announcement of the Optus deal, share prices  have

dropped  by some 30%.  The question I would like to  ask  the

Minister is whether there has been any change in the terms of

the  deal  and, if there is any change to the  terms  of  the

original  offer, is SingTel prepared to walk  away  from  the

deal?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am not aware of any

significant   changes.   I  think  SingTel  has   said   that

negotiations are proceeding smoothly, including the issue  of

strategic  use of the satellites.  So I am not aware  of  any

change that would make it necessary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>

to  review  the deal.  So far, this is based on their  public

announcements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  to  clarify  the terms of purchase?   I  hear  that

Singapore wants to exchange shares and also in cash,  and  is

it true that the cash component is in US dollars?  If that is

so,  is  that  the cause of the rise in value  of  US  dollar

against the Singapore dollar?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> SingTel has already announced

the  package alternative which is a mix of shares  and  cash,

and  I  do not think I need to go into it because the  Member

can always find it from the publications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the price of purchase being in US

dollars  - indeed I believe it is in US dollars - and whether

it  will  have an impact on the Singapore dollar,  I  do  not

think  the  amounts  are  sufficiently  large  to  move   the

Singapore dollar in a significant way although there  may  be

short-term  perturbations which MAS  will  surely  take  into

account.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, given that

these  are  Government-linked companies and Government  holds

controlling  shares,  may  I ask  the  Minister  for  Finance

whether Government will reassure their counterparts that this

is  a  private sector deal and not versus their own  national

interest, given that these are relatively sensitive  sectors,

ie, telecommunications and banking?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not think that this is an

issue.   As far as I am aware, the Australian Government  has

not raised any reservation about the deal.  The only question

is  whether  the  use of the US satellites might  impinge  on

problems  of  security.   But SingTel  has  said  that  these

discussions  are proceeding smoothly and they do  not  expect

any particular problems.  In the case of Hong Kong, I believe

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>

the Hong Kong monetary authority supports the deal.

in relation to the sale of Government-linked companies?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We have announced that it is our

policy  to try and divest as much as possible of Government's

holdings in established companies which are ready to be  sold

to the public.  Generally, the preferred way of doing this is

through the public listing of shares.  I do not think we have

deviated  from  this policy for many years.  The  problem  is

that some of these companies are so large that placing of the

shares in large amounts would destabilise the market.  So  we

have  to do it gradually.  I do not think there is any change

from our traditional policy.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Minister for Finance if

he  will  give an evaluation of the performance  of  overseas

investments   made   by   Government  and   Government-linked

organisations,  particularly its performance since  the  1997

Asian currency crisis.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government's   overseas  investments  are  managed   by   the

Government of Singapore Investment Corporation or GIC. As  Mr

J  B Jeyaretnam has raised a query on GIC in Question No. 11,

I suggest Mr Thomas Thomas awaits Government's response later

in Question Time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the GLCs overseen by Temasek Holdings, most of the

larger  companies  would  have made investments  overseas  in

order  to  seek growth outside the constraints of  the  small

Singapore market.  Several are publicly listed companies  and

their overseas investments have been well publicised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in my response to the questions on

SingTel's  and  DBS  Bank's acquisitions,  the  GLCs  operate

strictly  on  a  commercial basis.  The Government  does  not

interfere  in  their  business  decisions,  which   are   the

responsibility  of  their  boards  of  directors.   Not   all

overseas investments will yield immediate benefits but it  is

a  direction which all the larger GLCs will have to  take  if

they   are  to  participate  in  an  increasingly  globalised

economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Could the Minister

also  try  and  explain  the impact the  performance  of  our

foreign reserves, including Government-linked companies, have

on Central Provident Fund balances and holdings?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The CPF balances are managed by

the Government through a mechanism in which the net surpluses

of  the  CPF are acquired by Government through the issue  of

long-term Government bonds to the CPF Board.  These long-term

Government bonds guarantee an interest yield to CPF which  is

then  passed  on  through  their internal  mechanism  to  CPF

members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government investments, which will be clarified

later  on,  have been profitable over the years and  I  think

this is clearly reflected in the substantial increase in  the

total  size  of our reserves over the last 10-20  years.   So

there is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>

no  risk  whatsoever  that any single  and  relatively  small

investment setback encountered by a particular GLC would have

any impact whatsoever on the viability of CPF funds.  This is

quite assured.

<div align="center"><b>DEATHS CAUSED BY MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health (a)

whether he will comment on the two recent deaths in Singapore

due  to  meningococcal infection as a result of close contact

with  pilgrims from Mecca; (b) how many such infections  were

there  in Singapore over the past two years from 1999 - 2000;

and  (c)  whether he expects an increase in the incidence  of

meningococcal infection due to the W135 strain.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, meningococcal disease is a contagious bacterial

disease  caused by the meningococcus bacteria.  It is  spread

by person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets from

the  nose  and  throat of infected people.   The  disease  is

caused  by a number of different strains of the bacteria,  of

which the strains A, B and C are responsible for about 90% of

all cases.  The disease is potentially fatal, with a fatality

rate  of  about 5% to 10%, and this is despite the fact  that

the disease may have been diagnosed and treated early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In year 2000, the World Health Organisation reported an

international  outbreak of the meningococcal disease  related

to  travel to Saudi Arabia, which was caused by the  uncommon

strain,  W135.  In Singapore last year, ie, year 2000,  there

were eight reported cases of meningococcal disease related to

travel  to  Saudi Arabia, of which five were  caused  by  the

W135.   In 1999, there were no cases reported at all.  So  we

have cases only from the year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this international outbreak, in May 2000, the

Ministry of Health and the Ministry of the Environment issued

a joint press statement advising all travellers to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>

Saudi   Arabia   to  be  vaccinated  with  the   quadrivalent

meningococcal  vaccine.   This  provides  protection  against

disease  caused  by  the  A, C, Y as well  as  W135  strains,

instead  of the vaccine against only strains A and C required

by  Saudi  Arabia.   The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura  (MUIS)

was informed of this advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although vaccinated persons are protected against the

disease,  a small number of returning pilgrims who have  been

vaccinated  may  still carry the bacteria in their  nose  and

mouth  and  transmit  the infection to close  contacts.   The

Ministry  of  Health  would  like to  advise  that  returning

pilgrims can reduce transmission to close contacts by  simply

observing good personal hygiene and by reducing direct  close

contact and exposure to respiratory droplets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far in 2001, there were four reported cases in

Singapore  of meningococcal disease caused by the  W135.   Of

the  four, three of them were contacts of returning  pilgrims

from   Saudi  Arabia  who  had  been  vaccinated   with   the

quadrivalent vaccine. The other was a foreigner with a travel

history  to  Africa.   Of the four, three patients recovered,

while    the   fourth,   unfortunately,   developed   serious

complications and died.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is under control. We do not expect a

significant  increase in cases.  The Ministry of  Health  and

the  Ministry  of  the  Environment  will  again  remind  all

travellers  to  Saudi  Arabia  to  be  vaccinated  with   the

quadrivalent  vaccine  and  advise returning  travellers  and

their  close contacts to seek immediate medical attention  if

they  are  unwell.   All hospitals and medical  practitioners

have  been  asked to be vigilant of meningococcal disease  in

returning pilgrims and their close contacts.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether the advice on the  use

of  W135 vaccine could have been given earlier, as there were

many pilgrims who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>

were infected with significant mortality in Saudi Arabia  for

more than two years now?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, as I have said, we issued the

advice  in  the year 2000 when we assessed that there  was  a

threat of infection.  That was one year ago.  In 1999,  there

were  no  cases and we did not feel that it was necessary  to

issue a warning at that point of time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I correct the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary?  There were cases in 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I want to ask is whether his Ministry

could  be more alert on prevalent contagious diseases due  to

our  globalised world and be more vigilant and  proactive  in

taking preventive measures before death strikes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, the answer to that question must

be "yes".

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> If it is yes, I hope the Ministry will be

more active and proactive from now on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I would like to ask is whether his

Ministry  has given attention to public education, especially

to  those  pilgrims involved, on such topics as how  virulent

the W135 strain can be, the carrier status of those returning

pilgrims  who  may harbour the bacteria in  their  noses  and

mouths  for  up  to three days, and why it is  advisable  for

returning pilgrims to avoid contact with their family members

on returning.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, what we do is to provide

information to MUIS, and MUIS would advise the pilgrims.   If

MUIS  requests us to go down and advise the pilgrims, we will

do so.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>

whether  the Housing and Development Board (HDB) will  permit

HDB  lessees  to  use their HDB flats as mortgages  for  bank

loans as a means to finance their businesses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB flats are intended for owner occupation.

As  such,  HDB  will not allow its lessees to use  their  HDB

flats as mortgage for bank loans to finance their businesses.

This  is  because  they run the risk of losing  their  homes,

thereby causing hardship to themselves and their families, if

they are unable to service their bank loans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the flat is

their  only  tangible  asset.  If they  are  not  allowed  to

mortgage  their  flats,  then their  businesses  will  be  in

difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, HDB flats are very heavily

subsidised  by  the  Government.  They are  special  in  that

sense,  and  the Government takes great pains to ensure  that

their  flats  are  protected.   For  example,  even  in   the

situation  where the lessee is made a bankrupt, his creditors

cannot  touch  his  flat.  That is the extent  to  which  the

Government  would like to make sure that lessees'  flats  are

protected.    So   it  does  not  make  sense,   under   such

circumstances, to then allow the banks to give a  loan  based

upon the flats.  Because, obviously, the banks would want  to

have  the  ability to seize the flats if the  loans  are  not

serviced.  Under the Housing and Development Act, it is  made

very  clear that creditors are not allowed to touch the flats

even   if,   as  I  said,  the  lessees  are  made  bankrupt.

Therefore,  with that kind of protection, it  does  not  make

sense for the Government to allow the banks to issue loans on

that basis.

<div align="center"><b>ABOLITION OF CONTROL OF RENT ACT</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assistance to tenants facing hardship)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development whether his Ministry has considered the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>

potential  hardship to existing tenants of  certain  premises

following the abolition of the Control of Rent Act  from  1st

April  2001  and whether any appropriate assistance  will  be

given to those who are requested by their landlords to vacate

their  rent-controlled  premises  and  face  difficulties  in

relocating their homes or businesses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government was

mindful  of  possible  hardship to tenants  affected  by  the

abolition of rent control on 1st April this year.  Hence, the

intention  to  abolish rent control was  announced  in  April

1997,  four years ago.  This exceptionally long notice period

was  to  give  tenants  sufficient time to  find  alternative

premises or to reach agreement with their landlords  to  stay

on  after  lifting  of  rent  control.   The  URA  also  sent

reminders  to tenants every year since April 1997, and  since

April last year, every three months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has in place two special housing schemes

for  residential  tenants affected by the abolition  of  rent

control.  These are the Old Single Person Tenants' Scheme and

the  Rent  Decontrol Housing Assistance Scheme.  Since  1993,

out  of 502 applicants, 441 of them qualified for either  one

of  these  housing schemes.  Seven applications were received

after  1st April this year when the abolition of rent control

took  effect.   Of  these seven, six were  eligible  for  the

special housing schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original intention of rent control was to ensure a

roof over people's heads, especially during the post-war days

of  severe  housing shortage.  It was not  meant  to  provide

cheap  premises for commercial or other non-residential uses.

Tenants who use rent-controlled premises for their businesses

or  other non-residential purposes have enjoyed exceptionally

low  rental  for many, many years.  Such tenants  should  now

look for alternative premises on their own, or negotiate with

their landlords for mutually acceptable terms if they wish to

continue to stay.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, as there are many

small and medium-sized

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>

businesses  using  some  of  these rent-controlled  premises,

could  the  Ministry possibly look into giving some  kind  of

relocation   benefits   or  arranging  alternative   business

premises  for  them, either through HDB or  in  collaboration

with JTC?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I am afraid there are no such

resettlement schemes for businesses which are located in rent-controlled premises.  It is for the simple reason, as I said,

in  the  first  place, the rent control legislation  was  not

really  meant  to  allow them to operate out  of  very  cheap

rental premises.  Indeed, we are aware, for example, of  many

such  tenants  who  have actually sublet  their  premises  at

considerable  financial gain.  Be that as it may,  the  small

and  medium enterprises have actually been given, as  I  said

earlier, many years of notice in order to allow them to start

to negotiate with their landlords to prepare for the day when

the  rent  control  will finally be lifted.   So  under  such

circumstances,  the  Government has no  special  arrangements

made to either relocate or compensate them.  If there was any

compensation to be negotiated, it should have been done  much

earlier when notice was first given.

<div align="center"><b>THREE-QUARTER TANK RULE FOR CARS GOING INTO MALAYSIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Suspension)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay</b> asked the Minister for Finance, in

view  of  the  prevailing high petrol  pump  prices,  if  the

Government will suspend the three-quarter tank rule for  cars

going into Malaysia in order to increase competition.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the three-quarter tank rule was introduced to ensure that cheaper

petrol  in Johor would not undermine our use of petrol duties

to  curb  vehicle  usage  and  limit  traffic  congestion  in

Singapore.   It is therefore not appropriate to  suspend  the

three-quarter tank rule on account of higher petrol prices in

Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Trade and Industry had informed the

House in January this year that his Ministry is studying  how

more  competition  can be introduced into the  petrol  retail

business  and  is  working  with  the  Ministry  of  National

Development to study the feasibility of allowing 'white pump'

sites  to dispense petrol without compromising on fire safety

and environmental requirements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, does the Minister appreciate that the

rule  used  to  be  a half-tank rule and, secondly,  in  that

sense,  we have increased the margin of protection  that  the

local oil companies have in refusing to lower their prices?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, the reason why the half-tank

rule  was changed to the three-quarter tank rule was  because

the  half-tank rule was manifestly inadequate to achieve  the

purpose  which  we  have  set out to  do.   There  was  still

considerable  leakage due to motorists  leaving  their  tanks

half  full and filling up in Johor.  Bearing in mind the very

large differential in price between Johor and Singapore,  the

half-tank rule would not have been effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see the direct correlation between high duty

price   and  the  oil  companies'  prices,  which   are   set

independently of the level of Government duties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, would the Minister appreciate that we

are actually setting up a market in the sense that every rule

we  create structures the ability of the oil companies to fix

their  prices?  I would suggest to the Minister that  if  the

half-tank  rule was reinvoked, actually the margin  of  their

price  being  higher would be narrowed and, therefore,  there

would  be more competition in the market that Government  has

created.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am afraid I do not follow this

logic at all.  I think Mr Tay might want to explain to us  in

detail how this particular mechanism will work.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, may I ask the Minister: would

he not accept that if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>

there  was  no rule at all regarding filling up your  car  in

Malaysia, there would be more competition, especially for the

petrol   stations  in  the  northern  part  of  the  country?

Assuming  that  is  the case, the Government  actually  helps

structure  the  market for competition for  Singapore  petrol

pumps vis-a-vis Malaysian petrol pumps by this rule.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am afraid that is not

possible.  If you look at the difference in price,  there  is

no  way,  even if we remove all duties in Singapore, for  the

Singapore  oil companies to compete with the price  in  Johor

largely  because  Johor  petrol  prices  are  fixed  by   the

government at a level which they believe they want to sustain

in a country which not only produces petroleum on its own but

has a large car population which they want to promote.  So  I

do not think it is feasible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I do not mean to belabour the point.

But  I  am  asking  the Government not to fix  the  price  as

Malaysia does, but rather to fix the market.  The market that

Government  has created, first, by setting the  three-quarter

tank rule (raising it from the half-tank rule), from limiting

the number of sites which petrol pumps can be situated and by

licensing of petrol pumps, has led to a situation where there

is  a  near  cartel  which has proven that prices  have  been

sticky upwards.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think this is a very sensitive

subject.  We understand his concern.  But petrol stations are

sited by the Ministry of National Development in places where

they  do  not disrupt the environment, and are tendered  out.

So  that,  in  some way, fixes the cost of retailing  petrol.

The  proposal to set up "white sites" would allow  more  non-major  oil  companies, presumably, to set up petrol retailing

sites,  although where they would buy the raw petrol from,  I

am  not  clear,  because we are not a country which  is  near

major  sources  of refined products.  The only  suppliers  of

petroleum  here are the major oil companies.  So  unless  you

are  proposing  to  import finished fuel  directly  from  the

Middle-East, then you are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>

really going to find it very difficult to compete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of price-fixing and cartel procedure, the

Minister for Trade and Industry had, in fact, addressed  this

particular  problem, in response to a series of questions  in

January  this year when Dr Teo Ho Pin asked him what measures

could   be   taken  to  address  the  apparent  oligopolistic

behaviour of oil companies in Singapore.  And he had given  a

very comprehensive answer.  I would refer Mr Tay to read  the

details in the Hansard.  But I would just quote briefly  from

his first paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`MTI's study shows that petrol pump prices have moved in

tandem  with  crude oil prices in the past, but with  a  time

lag.'



In  fact, petrol pump prices generally move with crude prices

after a lag, both upwards and downwards.  In other words,  if

crude oil prices move up, petrol pump prices will not move up

simultaneously but with a pronounced lag, and the reason  for

this  is  quite clear if you look into how petroleum products

are  produced.   Crude oil is bought in the Middle-East  from

OPEC  producers.   It  has got to be  shipped  10,000  miles,

through a long supply chain, to a refinery.  It may be  three

months before crude purchased at higher prices would actually

reach  the pump.  So a lag is inevitable.  The reverse  works

the same way.  If prices of crude fall, the lower crude price

will  not be reflected in the pump price until after  a  lag.

So  these lags must occur because of the nature of the supply

chain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second paragraph, MTI has said that it "has found

no  evidence of price fixing by the oil companies.    Because

the  industry  structure is oligopolistic, .  price  movement

tends  to  be sticky and the companies prefer to  compete  on

free  gifts and loyalty benefits."  Generally, in the  market

of  this  sort  where  you  have a  few  major  producers  or

retailers  of  petrol, prices tend to equate largely  because

the  cost of producing a litre of petrol nowadays is not very

different between one company and another.  The difference is

quite small.  Companies are all equally

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>

large,  they  buy crude from the same people, their  refinery

costs are not significantly different, shipping costs are not

significantly  different,  they tender  for  their  sites  in

Singapore, so their retail costs are not that different.   So

in  the  end,  differences in pump prices will  not  be  very

large.   That being the case, the market leader who  has  the

largest  network  of  retail sites would  probably  have  the

lowest  unit  cost.   Therefore, he sets  the  price  and  he

becomes the market leader.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other companies who have comparable retail prices

would then just follow the leader.  If they try to compete by

slashing price directly, I think, in the end, they would  not

succeed.   I  think this is the nature of  retail  oil  in  a

country  like Singapore, where the oil business is  dominated

by  major companies who have very long supply lines.  If  you

are  operating  a  retail outlet in the  United  States,  the

situation  is  quite  different  because  the  US  has   many

independent oil producers with widely varying oil  production

costs,  and  that  allows  them  to  have  different  pricing

structures.  I hope I have explained the matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, this is not the first time he has told us  that

the  reason for the imposition of this tank rule was  because

revenue  was dropping.  May I ask him: is the loss in revenue

that  heavy  that the Government cannot forgo that  and  help

Singapore citizens to get cheaper petrol?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Indeed, there are two parts to

this  petrol tank rule.  One is to set the price high  enough

to  discourage  excessive use of cars.  In  the  process,  of

course,  Government gains revenue.  And I can assure  Members

that the revenue gained is not insignificant.  In fiscal year

2000,  petrol duties collected were $500 million.  So  if  we

lifted  the three-quarter tank rule, based on the average  of

3.4 million cars which crossed into Johor Baru last year, the

estimated loss in tax for 95 octane petrol - based on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>

assumption  that an average 1.6 litre car would  be  able  to

buy, say, 50 litres of petrol - would be in the region of $80

million, and this is not peanuts.

<div align="center"><b>(Rationale for upward revision)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for Finance if

he   will  explain  the  rationale  for  the  Inland  Revenue

Authority of Singapore revising the annual values of property

upwards at this point in time despite the fact that there has

been a general decline in property values.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Mr Speaker, in asking Question No.

8,  I  wish to declare that I have received a similar  letter

from IRAS.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, the annual value of a

property  is  derived  from the market rental  value  of  the

property taking into account the state and physical condition

of  the property at the time of review.  The annual values of

some  properties  may  not move in tandem  with  the  general

movement in property values.  For example, the property might

have  undergone  some  improvements  or  there  could  be  an

improvement in rents due to local factors or due to policy or

law  changes such as the abolition of rent control, therefore

affecting the rental value of that property, which will  then

be reflected in upward revision of the annual value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY98 and FY99, the percentage of the total stock of

properties that had a downward revision in annual values  was

21%  and  7%  respectively.  A total of 2% have their  annual

values reviewed upwards in FY98 and FY99.  For FY2000,  about

4%  of  the  total  stock of properties have  had  an  upward

revision  in their annual values.  Most were due to additions

and  alterations to the properties, therefore enhancing their

rental  values.   1%  had a downward  revision  and  95%  had

experienced no change to their annual values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For owners who are dissatisfied with their annual value

revisions, there is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>

an  appeals  process,  where  those  who  disagree  with  the

revaluations proposed by the Chief Assessor can submit  their

cases,  and the appeals can finally go to a Valuation  Review

Board.  The Valuation Review Board is an independent tribunal

established to adjudicate disputes between taxpayers and  the

Inland  Revenue  Authority.   It comprises  members  with  no

connection with IRAS and who are professionals in the field.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the property we are

discussing has nothing to do with upgrading or rent  control.

In fact, the properties are similar.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Ask your question, Mr Goh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> I do not understand the rationale

for   the  upward  revision  of  the  annual  values  of  the

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Is the Member referring to a

particular property?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> No. One of the properties is mine,

but they are on a whole row, and they are existing buildings.

There is no upgrading.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think the Member has to file a

separate  question.   I  do not know  the  identity  of  that

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether the Government should allow  foreign  lorry

operators  or  traders to transport all  kinds  of  products,

including perishable items such as fruits and vegetables, via

the  Woodlands or Tuas checkpoints into Singapore for  direct

sale  or  distribution to customers and, if not, whether  any

action has been taken to prevent such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>

practices from being increasingly adopted by foreigners.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a small

nation that is highly dependent on trade.  Our trade is three

times  our  GDP.  Goods flow almost totally tariff free  into

Singapore.   They are consumed in Singapore, or  are  further

processed  before being exported to the rest  of  the  world.

Our  free  trade policy therefore allows companies to  source

for inputs at competitive rates.  Consumers also benefit from

being  able to buy a wide variety of goods, including  fruits

and vegetables, at competitive prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current laws do not prohibit foreign lorry operators

or  traders  from  transporting  goods  for  direct  sale  to

wholesalers   or  retailers  in  Singapore.   These   foreign

operators   must   however  abide  by  various   rules.    To

illustrate,  they must pay GST for the goods they  sell;  and

for  perishable items such as fruits and vegetables, they are

subject to AVA rules.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> There have been cases where some of these

businessmen, who are bringing these perishable products  from

across   the   border,  are  actually  selling  directly   to

customers.  By doing this, (a) they are not registered  as  a

business  here;  (b) they do not pay tax, although  they  are

doing  business  here; and (c) they seem to be  using  labour

from across the causeway as cheap labour to sell directly  to

customers.   So I do not know whether the Ministry  can  look

into  how  we  can check on these businessmen to ensure  that

they  are  properly registered here, they  are  doing  direct

business here, and that they pay not only GST but also  other

business taxes that they are liable to pay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they are not

allowed to sell directly to consumers, like you and me.   But

they  are  allowed  to sell their goods  to  wholesalers  and

retailers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Apparently, there are instances where

some of these businessmen are selling directly to consumers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>

Perhaps  the  Ministry could step up supervision  over  these

businessmen  who are doing this business by selling  directly

to  consumers  and also see whether they are in this  process

evading some of the laws of Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Discharged and undischarged bankrupts)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

how  many discharged and undischarged bankrupts were employed

by  the  Civil Service over the last three years from 1998  - 2000  and  whether any civil servant lost his or her  job  on

becoming a judgement debtor or an undischarged bankrupt  over

the same period.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as discharged bankrupts have already  cleared

their  financial liabilities, they are treated no differently

from  any other recruits to the Civil Service selected on  an

open and meritocratic basis.  Consequently, the Civil Service

does not track its employment of discharged bankrupts, though

in all probability very few have been recruited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for undischarged bankrupts, the Civil Service views

their   cases  seriously,  like  other  cases  of   financial

embarrassment.  An officer would be dismissed by  the  Public

Service Commission (PSC) if he is financially embarrassed and

the financial embarrassment is a result of a character defect

or  flaw,  for  instance, where the officer has a  profligate

lifestyle, has gambled, speculated in stocks and shares, etc.

All civil servants are required to make an annual declaration

of  non-indebtedness.  PSC takes a serious view  of  officers

who   falsely   declare   that  they  are   not   financially

embarrassed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, PSC would take a more sympathetic view if

officers  become  financially  embarrassed  as  a  result  of

genuine  hardship,  betrayal  or circumstances  beyond  their

control,  and  if the officers have been honest  about  their

indebtedness or financial difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three years, two officers were dismissed for

financial embarrassment:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) One officer was made a bankrupt after speculating in

shares.  He had also falsely declared his financial status in

the  annual declaration of indebtedness.  This was the second

time  he  had  come  to  adverse  notice  for  his  financial

predicament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Another officer was made a judgement debtor due to

his  over  indulgent lifestyle.  He had also falsely declared

his financial status.

US$100 billion.  The assets have steadily increased in  value

over  the years.  The returns are adequate.  We are a special

investment   fund.    The  ultimate  shareholders   are   the

electorate.   It  is  not in the people's interests  and  the

nation's  interests  to detail our assets  and  their  yearly

returns.   The accounts of GIC are checked by the Accountant-General,  Auditor-General  and examined  by  the  Council  of

Presidential Advisors.  There is total accountability."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are proper control and monitoring systems in place

for reserves managed by GIC.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the reserves of the Government, including

reserves   managed  by  GIC,  are  an  important  factor   in

maintaining confidence in the Singapore dollar.  They  enable

MAS  to  manage  and stabilise the Singapore  dollar  against

other   currencies,  and  discourage  market   players   from

attacking the currency.  Market players do not doubt that the

Government has substantial resources to defend the  Singapore

dollar.  But they do not know the exact amounts that we  have

invested  abroad  and  in  what  assets.    Publishing   this

information would make it easier for would-be speculators  to

assess their chances and plan their attacks.  And this is not

in the public interest.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> First of all, may I ask why is the

Senior  Minister not here?  After all, it is  his  statement,

and it is for him to defend his statement in this House.  But

I  suppose  I  cannot compel him to come here.   Having  said

that,  if  you  accept, as he accepted, that the shareholders

are the electorate, that accountability must be to them.   Do

you   accept  that  the  Government  is  accountable  to  the

shareholders,  and not just the Accountant-General,  Auditor-General, or to somebody else, but to the shareholders?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we operate not

direct democracy in a fashion of Asian ways.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What is "not direct democracy"?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We operate a representative

democracy  in which the people elect the Government  and  the

discussed  every  year, and we have good  reasons  for  that,

which I have given.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Do I then take it that the Deputy Prime

stand up and defend its judgement.  It does not stand up  and

say,  "Here  are all the things, here are all the data,  here

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Minister of State for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Information and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as a symbol of our nation, the Singapore flag is treated with

dignity  and  respect.  To celebrate our  National  Day,  the

public  can, and indeed are encouraged to fly the  flag  from

1st to 31st August.  During this period, commercial buildings

are  also  encouraged  to display the  Singapore  flag.   The

widespread display of the flag during this period adds to the

celebratory  mood, and gives all Singaporeans an  opportunity

to express their joy in their own small way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At other times of the year, only Government-owned and

occupied  buildings  display the flag.  Government  does  not

encourage  the  Singapore flag to be flown in  private  homes

after the National Day Celebration period, as there have been

cases where the flag was used in an undignified manner.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, given that the Government wishes to

promote loyalty in Singapore and affinity in Singapore, would

it  not be natural to have more rules about how the flag  can

be  displayed, and what would be constituted undignified  use

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many ways to

demonstrate our loyalty to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>

the   nation.   But  if  grassroots  organisations  or  other

organisations  have  occasions to  feel  that  they  want  to

display  the Singapore flag, they can make an application  to

my  Ministry,  MITA, and we would be happy  to  consider  the

application on a case-by-base basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, would the Minister of State not

agree  that  the  Singapore flag, in that sense,  belongs  to

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, we would like to

encourage Singaporeans, on appropriate occasions, to fly  the

National  Day  celebrations, or when we go for  international

sports meets, especially when we win, we get to fly the  flag

and  I  think  that gives a tremendous boost to the  nation's

pride.   But,  as I said, if there are occasions  outside  of

these  where Singaporeans would like to fly the flag,  please

put in an application and we would consider it.  It is better

that  we have fewer rules than more rules because more  rules

only   make   it   more  complicated.   Now,   it   is   very

straightforward.   You  put in on a case-by-case  basis.   So

long as we feel that the dignity and respect of the flag  can

be safeguarded, I think approval can be forthcoming.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, nothing so severe as

Arms and Flags and National Anthem Rules 1960.  Anyone guilty

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE 21</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Progress)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay</b> asked the Prime Minister what

progress  there has been on Singapore 21 and  ways  in  which

such progress can be measured.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may I, before I give the reply, thank Mr Tay for his question

and opportunity to briefly update this House on Singapore 21.

Realising  the Singapore 21 vision, or S21 for  short,  is  a

long-term process.   To briefly recap, Singapore 21  is  made

up of five key ideas.  These are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Every Singaporean matters, and can contribute to our

society's development;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Strong families are the foundation of our society

and our future;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Nurturing the Singapore heartbeat is important,

because it makes us proud to be and want to be Singaporeans;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We want to make Singapore a centre of opportunities

for all; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Everyone should be an active citizen, and play a

part in shaping our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ideas are not new. But they collectively set a

direction, and affirm the foundations on which we  build  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Singapore 21 Report was published in April

1999,  the Government considered how best to take the  vision

forward.    An   implementation  committee  best   guaranteed

results,  but ran counter to the S21 notion that Singaporeans

should  take  greater responsibility for shaping  the  future

society  they  want.   To  do nothing,  however,  risked  the

Singapore  21 vision dying a premature death.   We  therefore

decided  that  a  facilitative  approach  would  best  create

awareness and ownership of the Singapore 21 ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S21 Facilitation Committee decided that it could

play its role by raising public awareness of Singapore 21 and

by   encouraging  individuals  to  play  an  active  part  in

realising S21 goals.  It maintains a

S21 website, publishes a monthly newsletter, and organises an

annual    public   conference   to   highlight    significant

contributions to the vision and to discuss S21 issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the committee does not prescribe how

individuals  and  organisations should respond  to  S21.   It

leaves it to each person and organisation to respond in  ways

they  feel  appropriate because the success of  Singapore  21

depends on its values being internalised by Singaporeans  and

manifested in their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach has worked fairly well. Singapore 21 has

become a familiar term to many.  Good ideas are often raised,

and  activities  are  often  organised,  in  the  spirit   of

Singapore  21.  Many people-sector organisations, like  CDCs,

or  self-help  groups and other NGOs have organised  outreach

activities  to  explain Singapore 21  to  their  members  and

constituencies.  Some private companies are now helping their

employees   to  balance  their  work,  family  and  community

commitments.  The public service is also cultivating a spirit

of  openness and responsiveness amongst its officers to  take

in  ideas from the public, as well as encouraging them to  be

active citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has deliberated on how we can track the

progress  of a long-term goal like Singapore 21.    It  noted

that  many  Ministries and agencies, such as the Ministry  of

Community  Development  and Sports, already  have  indicators

that   measure   aspects  of  Singapore  21.   The   national

volunteerism rate, for example, is an indicator of the  level

of active citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these indicators do not fluctuate significantly

on  a year-to-year basis, so it may not be very meaningful to

measure   our  progress  in  the  short-term  against   them.

Ultimately,  what  we  are  aiming for  are  qualitative  and

emotional  results,  such  as a  deeper  sense  of  identity,

ownership and commitment that cannot be measured by  counting

events  and  keeping scores. Indicators are  useful,  but  we

should  not  over  rely  on them to  track  the  progress  of

Singapore 21.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore 21 vision cannot be

realised by a committee alone.  It becomes a reality only  if

the  whole  community takes an active part  in  building  our

future  society.  If each one of us lives according to  these

principles, then, over time, we will be able to  see  and  to

feel the progress that we have made.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I commend the Minister of State

for  the  work that he is doing in the Facilitation Committee

and the recognition that there needs to be some monitoring or

tracking.  While I recognise the problems of trying to use ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, no speeches. Can you ask the

question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Yes, Sir. May I ask the Minister whether

they  will  move towards an index - trying to bring  together

things  like the volunteerism index he mentioned - and  other

factors  and  somehow,  although  imperfectly,  reflect   the

trends, because when the Minister said they are doing "fairly

well", I would like to know how he thinks we are doing fairly

well, why does he think we are doing fairly well.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I say that we are

doing "fairly well", I look at anecdotal evidence, I look  at

how  much  recognition there is for the term "Singapore  21",

and how people raise issues under this banner and argue their

case  and  their cause in the name of active citizenship,  on

the  principle  that  everybody does matter  or  can  make  a

contribution.  And I think we see these arguments being  made

from time to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to indicators, I indicated in my reply there are

several agencies that already seek to monitor various  social

indicators.   I  do  know that MCDS  is  working  on  a  more

comprehensive  set of indicators but, perhaps,  it  would  be

more appropriate for them to explain that.

<div align="center"><b>POLICE WARNING TO MR JAMES GOMEZ AND MR KEVIN LIEW</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Justification)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs what offences

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>

were  committed by Mr James Gomez and Mr Kevin Liew  on  10th

December  2000 to justify the warning given to  them  by  the

police.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, Mr James

Gomez  and Mr Kevin Liew were investigated for an offence  of

holding  an  assembly without a permit under Rule 4(1)(a)  of

the   Miscellaneous  Offences  (Public  Order  and  Nuisance)

(Assemblies  and  Processions) Rules, Chapter  184,  on  10th

December 2000, at Hong Lim Green.  They were warned  in  lieu

of prosecution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the junior Minister whether he

is  aware  of  section  5(2)  and (3)  of  the  Miscellaneous

Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act?  Has he read it  up

before he came here?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I do not have the Act

with me.  If the hon. Member can read out the section, I will

respond.  But I am sure that police would have looked at  the

entirety of all the laws before deciding on whether or not to

investigate and in deciding whether or not to prosecute.   In

the  circumstances,  they have decided  to  warn  instead  of

prosecute.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Am I to understand that the Minister has

not read the sections before coming here?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I have read the Act

many,  many  times.  It is just a matter of pinpointing  what

the  section in particular says.  If the hon. Member can read

the section, I will tell him why it will not apply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I say that I am surprised, but I

suppose  that  does  not count.  Is the Minister  aware  that

section 5(2) requires the Minister, first of all, by an order

- which I take will be published in the Gazette - to prohibit

any  assembly or procession in any public place,  and  it  is

only  after  that  order  has been made  that  the  penalties

provided under section 5(4)

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>

come  into operation?  The rules were made to implement these

sections of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my first question, following what I have told the

Minister,  is when was this order made that any  assembly  at

the Speakers' Corner is prohibited.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, once again, Mr

Jeyaretnam  reads the Act selectively because, under  section

5(1), rules can be made by the Minister to govern assemblies.

Indeed,  under  section  5(1) of the Act,  the  Miscellaneous

Offences   (Public  Order  and  Nuisance)   (Assemblies   and

Processions) Rules are promulgated legally, and Rule 2 states

very clearly that any assembly of five or more persons in any

public place to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) demonstrate support for or opposition to the views

or actions of any person;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to publicise a cause or campaign; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to mark or commemorate any event,

must get a permit under these rules.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister accept that rules owe

their  legitimacy to the parent Act?  I repeat: was there  an

order made by the Minister under section 5(2) prohibiting the

holding of any assembly in the Speakers' Corner?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam is a

lawyer.   He  must know that sections must be read  in  their

totality.  He has mentioned section 5(2).  But that is in the

context of the entire section 5, and section 5(1) allows  the

Minister to make rules and the Minister has made these rules.

So  section 5(2) will not apply.  Section 5(2) may apply, for

example,  in a situation where the Minister makes a  specific

order  as  to a particular place, but it is still subject  to

section 5(1) and the rules which have been promulgated.   And

we  have said very clearly in Parliament when we set  up  the

Speakers'  Corner, that the Speakers' Corner will be  subject

to the laws of the land.  And the Miscellaneous

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>

Offences rules are indeed part of the laws of the land.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I have an answer to the question?

Has  the  Minister made any order or declaration that  before

anybody  holds  an assembly at the Speakers' Corner  he  will

have  to  get  a  licence?   May I have  an  answer  to  that

question?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> May I ask the hon. Member

whether or not the Speakers' Corner is a public place?  Under

section  5(1), read with Rule 2 of the Miscellaneous Offences

Rules,  any  assembly  of five or more persons  in  a  public

place,  if  they do (a), (b) or (c), they must  apply  for  a

permit.   And that is the governing provision, in so  far  as

the Speakers' Corner is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, if Mr Jeyaretnam or anybody is doubtful

about  it, he can challenge it in court.  But, in this  case,

Mr  James Gomez accepted the warning, which means that he did

not  challenge the interpretation of the laws by  the  police

and the AG's Chambers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I again ask the Minister: did his

Minister  say  in  this House not very long ago  that  nobody

needs  any  permit  for  going to the  Speakers'  Corner  and

address  an assembly, that all he had to do was to  register?

Are  we to understand that that utterance by the Minister was

simply  hot air and that it will be an offence for any person

to assemble at the Speakers' Corner to listen to somebody?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I do not know who is

spouting  hot air and who is selectively hearing speeches  in

Parliament.   The  Minister said that one does  not  have  to

apply  for  a  permit to speak, because he was talking  about

exemption  under the Public Entertainments Act.  So  that  is

the  exemption.   He also said that one needs to comply  with

all  the  other laws of the land and, like I have  said,  the

Miscellaneous  Offences Rules are part of  the  laws  of  the

land.   So  the  exemption  is to speak,  not  exemption  for

anything else.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister tell us what did

these two persons do at the Speakers' Corner on 10th December

last year except to speak?  Now you say that is an offence.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, it is all in the public

domain,  both in the media as well as captured on  the  Think

Centre website, what happened.  It was not a matter of people

just going there to speak, but it was an organised gathering.

They had organised a gathering of people - in this case about

60  people  -  to  commemorate an event, International  Human

Rights Day, and "to demonstrate" - the words were used in the

notice which was publicised on the Think Centre website - "to

demonstrate"  against the abolition of the Internal  Security

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gone through this debate many times in this

House, Mr Speaker, and I have made my points very clear, that

over  the last eight months, more than 800 registrations have

been  received and people have spoken, people have  listened.

This is the first time ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I do not know if anybody goes there now.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> It is up to them. It is all

there.   The  Government  provides for  it.   And  after  six

months, in December 2000, there was this first investigation,

and we have to see this event in context - what happened, the

notice  that I have talked about which explicitly  mentioned:

come,  run,  after running, demonstrate.  So it is  not  just

coming to speak and coming to listen to speakers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> One final question is ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, I find that you are

asking the questions over and over again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> One final question, if I may.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are we to understand then that the

setting up of the Speakers' Corner is a trap?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> It only will trap those who

think that it is a trap.  Mr Jeyaretnam probably thinks it is

a  trap  because  at  the outset he condemned  the  Speakers'

Corner,  both in Singapore and overseas, and said  it  was  a

"farce"  and only meant for irresponsible people  to  go  and

speak.  But, ultimately, on 10th December, he spoke.   If  it

is  a  trap to him, then in his mind it is a trap.   But  the

Government  is  serious  about  setting  it  up.    And   800

registrations  have been received, thousands of  people  have

gone  to listen, and it is still there.  It cannot be a trap.

It is there for everybody to see, free for everybody to use.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You will not get me there anymore.

<div align="center"><b>RUNAWAY MAIDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

if  he will state (a) whether any maids have been charged and

convicted after running away from their employers' homes  and

having had their work permits cancelled; and (b) whether  any

persons have been charged with harbouring such maids.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir, for

question  (a), the answer is yes.  Last year, a total  number

of  292  work permit holders were charged by the Ministry  of

Home   Affairs  for  overstaying  and,  of  these,  291  were

convicted.  We do not have the breakdown for foreign domestic

workers.  The number of foreign domestic workers charged  and

convicted  for  overstaying is very small compared  to  other

groups of foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For question (b), the answer is also yes. Last year the

Ministry  of Home Affairs charged 152 persons for  harbouring

an  overstayer or an illegal immigrant. We do  not  have  the

breakdown for harbourers of foreign domestic workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Can the Minister of State tell us

what the penalties are for both (a) and (b)?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, for (a), the

penalty for overstaying in Singapore for 90 days or less,  is

a  fine  up  to $4,000 and/or up to six months' imprisonment.

For  (b),  the penalty carries a mandatory jail  sentence  of

between  six and 24 months and a fine of up to $6,000.   Sir,

when  more  than  five  illegal workers who  are  immigration

offenders are involved, the law provides for mandatory caning

of the employer upon conviction.

<div align="center"><b>GEYLANG POLICE DIVISION</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reasons for dissolution)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs if he will explain the reasons for the dissolution of

the Geylang Police Division.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, the police is always looking for ways to

serve  our  people better.  For this reason, it is constantly

reviewing  a  system  of  policing  and,  if  necessary,  the

boundaries of our Police Land Divisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closure of Geylang Police Division on 17th December

last  year was a result of this review.  After careful study,

the police concluded that its operational effectiveness would

be  enhanced,  and the public better served, by  reorganising

its resources from seven into six Police Divisions, each with

its  complement  of Neighbourhood Police Centres  (NPCs)  and

Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs).  Thus, the areas  formerly

under  the jurisdiction of Geylang Police Division have  been

absorbed   under  Ang  Mo  Kio,  Bedok  and  Tanglin   Police

Divisions.  This reorganisation enables the police to operate

closer  to areas where its services are most needed, such  as

areas of high population density.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the police has opened four new Neighbourhood Police

Centres (NPCs) to serve the needs of the residents in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>

area  formerly  covered  by  Geylang  Division.   Apart  from

Geylang  NPC,  which  in  fact occupies  the  former  Geylang

Division building, the police has also established the Marine

Parade,  Hougang  and Serangoon NPCs.  With  the  opening  of

these  four  NPCs,  police services have  been  brought  even

closer to the residents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, as I understand the Minister of

State,  reducing police divisions from seven to six was  part

of  the reorganisation.  Was there any particular reason  why

Geylang Division was chosen to be closed down?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Police reorganisation is

done  systematically and carefully.  In fact, police  decided

to  follow the URA's Development Guide Plans.  Under the  URA

Development Guide Plans, there are five regions.  But in  the

Police  scheme of things, there are six, because the  central

region  is  a  big one.  So there are two divisions  there  - Central  and  Tanglin.  For the eastern region, we  have  got

Bedok  and Geylang under this redivision.  Between  the  two,

the Police decided to close down Geylang Division because  it

was  smaller.   This is all very rational  and  there  is  no

discriminatory treatment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister of State tell us

whether  the  prosecutions of some officers from the  Geylang

Division  for their links with gambling and brothel operators

were  one  of  the  reasons  for  closing  down  the  Geylang

Division?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I do not think Mr

Jeyaretnam has a police mindset.  The police does not work on

such  short-term  considerations.  It is an  overall  review,

looking   at   both   the  immediate   and   also   long-term

considerations,  and  also in line with  the  repackaging  of

services.   I do not know whether Mr Jeyaretnam  is  in  tune

with  the many things that have happened which other  Members

know.   In  the Committee of Supply debate, we had, in  fact,

extensively debated the police's reorganisation over the last

three years.  The NPC Scheme started in 1997 and it has  been

rolling out.  So this is a big

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>

planned  review that will ultimately and, in fact, is already

benefitting  Singaporeans.  Singaporeans  already  served  by

NPCs have said this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Could the Minister please, for once,

answer  the question?  Did the prosecutions have anything  to

do with the reason for choosing Geylang Police Division?  May

we have an answer?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I ask the Member not to repeat

his question?  Because he will just get the same answer.  The

answer  has been given.  I do not see why the Member  has  to

repeat  his  question.  Do you have any  other  question,  Mr

Jeyaretnam?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You have disallowed the question. So

there is no other

question.

<div align="center"><b>BANKING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.49 pm

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, the Monetary Authority of

Singapore  (MAS)  has  progressively  changed  the   way   it

supervises  the financial sector.  Our objective of  ensuring

financial  stability is unchanged.  But in order  to  have  a

more  dynamic  and vibrant financial sector, we have  shifted

emphasis from regulation to supervision.  We have moved  away

from one-size-fits-all laws and regulations, towards tailored

supervision  of  individual institutions  according  to  each

institution's financial strength, risk management  capability

and risk profile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important changes have been to the banking

sector.   Banking  is not just the biggest  industry  in  the

financial  sector.   A sound and dynamic  banking  system  is

critical  to  financial stability and to the entire  economy.

We need to attract quality

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>

international  banks and, at the same time, build  up  strong

local banks able to compete against the best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1999, MAS launched the first phase of the

liberalisation of the banking sector.  We introduced  greater

foreign  competition, removed foreign shareholding limits  on

local banks, and raised standards of corporate governance and

disclosure.  We required banks to form nominating  committees

to vet key appointments of directors and top executives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2000, we required banks to separate their

financial and non-financial businesses, and unwind the cross-shareholdings within the local banking groups.  This  was  to

limit  the  risk of contagion from non-banking businesses  to

banks,  improve  the  banks'  corporate  governance,  enhance

transparency  of  transactions  and  market  discipline,  and

ensure  that  bank managements focus their attention  on  the

complex  business  of banking in an increasingly  competitive

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these major initiatives, we have been updating

and  streamlining  many banking regulations,  for  which  the

underlying objectives are either no longer valid or not being

effectively met.  We have amended rules to give banks greater

business  and  operational flexibility  without  compromising

prudence.   We  have also adopted a risk-focused  supervisory

approach  that  enhances  our  oversight  on  banks   without

increasing their cost of regulatory compliance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing our supervisory framework for the banking

sector  is  a  continuous process.  Several important  pieces

have  been put in place, and more will be done over the  next

few  years.   The  enactment of the Banking (Amendment)  Bill

will  give legislative effect to new policy changes announced

in  the past year.  The Bill will also introduce several  new

changes to bring the Banking Act up to date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the Bill, MAS has consulted widely with the

industry through the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>

Association  of  Banks in Singapore, and with accounting  and

legal  practitioners.   The  individual  amendments  to   the

Banking Act are explained in the explanatory statement to the

Bill.  I also circulated earlier a separate Explanatory  Note

to Members, following the First Reading of the Bill.  Today I

propose to speak in detail only on the major changes.

<br><br><i>Giving Effect To Announced Policies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of giving effect to announced policy changes, I

shall  discuss three main ones: (1) separation  of  financial

and non-financial activities; (2) revision of ownership rules

for  local  banks;  and  (3)  reduction  of  paid-up  capital

requirements for local bank subsidiaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, separation of financial and non-financial

activities.  New sections 30 to 35 will prohibit  banks  from

carrying  out  any  business which is not  banking  business,

other  financial business regulated or authorised by MAS,  or

business which is incidental to financial business.  Business

incidental  to financial business includes the  provision  of

clearing  and  settlement  services,  custody,  trustee   and

nominee  services,  financial advisory activity  as  well  as

agency  transactional services where the banks act as  agents

for  third  party  products but take on  no  additional  risk

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks will have to obtain MAS' approval before acquiring

a  major stake in any company.  If the company being acquired

carries  on  non-financial  activities,  MAS  will  generally

withhold  consent, although it may grant approval  if,  after

discussion  with  the bank, it is satisfied  that  there  are

clear  synergies  with the bank's financial  business.   Over

time, MAS will be able to develop a list of such approved non-financial  businesses,  so  that  banks  need  not  seek  our

approval for each acquisition.  The list will naturally  have

to  be  regularly updated.  The financial industry is rapidly

evolving, and it is not possible to define a static  list  of

approved activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While banks should not venture into non-financial

activities, we do need to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>

allow  them  some flexibility to own shares in  non-financial

companies,  for  portfolio  investment  purposes.   The   new

section  32  will  allow  banks to  purchase  non-controlling

stakes  (generally 10% or less) in the share capital  of  any

company.   To limit concentration risks, the new  section  31

will limit equity investments in any single company to 2%  of

the  bank's  capital  funds, while the new  section  33  will

revise the rules on a bank's immovable property holdings  and

lower the limit to 20% of its capital funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These restrictions on non-financial business will also

apply   to  the  branches  of  foreign  banks  in  Singapore.

Contagion  and  other risks arising from the  co-mingling  of

financial and non-financial businesses can affect all  banks,

whether local or foreign.  The policy is thus relevant across

the entire banking sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Bill will prohibit a person from using

any   logo  or  trademark  in  a  manner  that  would   imply

association  with  a bank incorporated in  Singapore  or  its

subsidiaries  carrying  on financial  business,  unless  that

person  is a financial affiliate of the bank or its financial

holding  company.   This  will  limit  the  reputational  and

contagion risks from such name-sharing between the  bank  and

its non-financial affiliates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend section 78 of the Act to enable MAS

to   make   regulations  which  spell  out   other   detailed

requirements on the separation of financial and non-financial

activities,   including  the  prohibition   on   sharing   of

management  between  the  bank group  and  its  non-financial

affiliates, and on cross-shareholdings within the bank group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new measures will require local banks to undertake

significant  corporate restructuring and divestment  of  non-financial  assets.  To ensure that the process is  undertaken

in  an orderly manner, the new section 34 will allow banks  a

three-year  grace  period,  from  the  time  that   the   new

amendments take effect, to divest any investment assets which

they hold at that time.  MAS has been in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>

close  discussion  with the banks on  their  plans  and  will

continue  to  keep  close watch over the divestment  process.

There  is no reason to force the banks to conduct fire  sales

in  a  depressed  market.  This would be detrimental  to  the

interests  of  banks'  shareholders,  and  might  weaken  our

financial  system.   But  the banks  have  to  act  with  due

despatch  within the three-year period, and  I  am  confident

that they will do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, revision of ownership rules for local banks. When

MAS  lifted the 40% aggregate foreign shareholding limit  for

local  banks,  it  had  also introduced  a  new  shareholding

approval  threshold  of  12%, to be  added  to  the  existing

thresholds  at 5% and 20%.  The Bill revises sections  15  to

18, which relate to the approval of controllers of Singapore-incorporated  banks,  to  ensure  that  control  rests   with

individuals  or groups whose interests are aligned  with  the

long-term interests of the Singapore economy and the national

interest.  The new 12% threshold gives greater flexibility to

MAS  to  allow  strategic  partners and  large  institutional

investors  to  reach  and  cross the 5%  shareholding  level,

without   having   to  also  allow  their  stakes   to   grow

unrestrained up to 20%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended sections will also address passive increases

in   shareholdings  and  shareholders  acting   in   concert.

Legislative  powers will be introduced for  the  Minister  to

object  to persons who were previously allowed to exceed  the

threshold levels but who subsequently become unacceptable  as

significant shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, reduction of paid-up capital requirements for

local  bank  subsidiaries.  The Bill provides for  a  reduced

minimum  paid-up  capital requirement of  S$100  million  for

banking  subsidiaries of Singapore-incorporated  banks  which

have  themselves  met the S$1.5 billion capital  requirement.

(This  will  be  in a new section 9A to be  inserted  in  the

Banking  Act.)  This was announced in July 2000  as  part  of

MAS'  Internet  banking policy.  The reduced paid-up  capital

requirement  facilitates the setting up  by  local  banks  of

banking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>

subsidiaries  which  adopt  new  business  models,  such   as

Internet-only banking.  These new banking subsidiaries may be

set  up  together  with joint venture partners  provided  the

parent local bank retains control.

<br><br><i>New Policy Changes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for new policy changes contained in the Bill, I shall

elaborate on four main ones: (1) revision of banking  secrecy

provisions;  (2)  prohibition  of  unlicensed  deposit-taking

services;  (3)  flexibility  for  MAS  to  prescribe  capital

adequacy  requirements  on  a  supervisory  basis;  and   (4)

revision   of  methodology  for  regulating  property-related

exposure.

<br><br><i>Revision of Banking Secrecy Provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking secrecy provisions of the Banking Act

protect  the confidentiality of customer information.   Tight

banking secrecy is important to maintaining the confidence of

customers  in  our  banking  system.   However,  our  present

banking secrecy provisions have impeded banks wanting to take

advantage of potential operational benefits and savings.  For

example,  banks  find  it  difficult to  securitise  mortgage

loans, or to outsource data processing to third parties.  MAS

has  reviewed  the banking secrecy provisions in consultation

with  the  industry.  We have considered both the operational

requirements  of  banks  and the need  to  preserve  customer

confidentiality.  The measures set out in the new section  47

strike   a  careful  balance  between  these  two   sets   of

considerations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 47 will stipulate a wider set of

circumstances   under  which  banks  can  disclose   customer

information, and the terms of such disclosure.  These are set

out  in  a  new Sixth Schedule, which consists of two  parts.

Part I will contain many of the existing exceptions, and Part

II  will  contain most of the new exceptions to  the  secrecy

provisions.  Examples of new exceptions are the disclosure of

credit information in a sale or transfer of credit facilities

(for  example,  asset securitisation), and the disclosure  of

customer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>

information  to  a  bank's head office  for  risk  management

purposes.   Two  key  points about the  new  exceptions  are,

first,  only  very few exceptions have been allowed  for  the

disclosure  of  information relating to a customer's  deposit

and  funds  placed for investment; and second, a  person  who

receives customer information will be required by law to keep

the information confidential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures ensure that by law, all banks will

provide  a  basic  level of customer confidentiality  to  all

their customers.  Beyond this legal minimum, individual banks

and  customers  may reach their own contractual  arrangements

offering  higher standards of confidentiality.  The Act  does

not  compel  a bank to invoke the newly introduced exceptions

if  the  bank deems this to be in the best interests  of  its

business and its customers.

<br><br><i>Prohibition of Unlicensed Offering of Deposit-Taking Services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taking of deposits is an integral part of banking

business  regulated  under the Banking Act.   However,  under

current provisions in the Banking Act, deposit-taking on  its

own   is  not  a  regulated  activity.   A  company  is  only

considered  to be conducting banking business if  it  carries

out  three  related  activities - deposit  taking,  extending

loans,  and  providing  customers with  chequing  facilities.

Hence,  a company set up to take deposits in Singapore  which

does not also grant loans and provide chequing services would

not  need to meet MAS' licensing requirements or abide by the

Banking Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But new business models have emerged in the changing

banking  industry.  Some banks now operate using an Internet-only  strategy.  They take deposits but do not extend  loans,

yet  there  is  no  doubt  they are banks,  and  need  to  be

regulated  like  banks.   We therefore  need  to  update  the

legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will introduce new sections 4A to 4C to

generally restrict deposit-taking in Singapore in the  course

of  a deposit-taking business to institutions licensed by MAS

or specifically exempted.  The new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>

provisions   will  also  prohibit  offers,  invitations   and

advertisements  to the public in Singapore to place  deposits

with any deposit-taking business.  Again, this does not apply

to   institutions  licensed  in  Singapore  or   specifically

exempted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new rules will accord the public a measure of

protection.  But they do not prevent anyone from seeking  out

on  their  own, via the Internet or other means, the services

of  financial institutions operating overseas.   Persons  who

choose to do so take their own risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to assure the House that the new provisions

are  not  meant  to restrict capital market  fund-raising  by

corporations   which  are  not  carrying  on   deposit-taking

business.  Such companies issue bonds and notes from time  to

time,  and  these  will generally not be considered  deposit-taking  business.   Where necessary,  MAS  may  make  further

exemptions   to  clarify  that  capital  market  fund-raising

activities are not restricted by the new provisions.

<br><br><i>Flexibility for MAS to Prescribe Capital Adequacy Requirements on a Supervisory Basis</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 10 is amended to enable MAS to impose, on a

supervisory  basis,  specific capital requirements  over  and

above  the  statutory minimum that apply to  all  banks,  and

specific  capital adequacy ratio requirements that vary  from

the stipulated minimum of 12%.  This amendment allows MAS  to

impose  capital  requirements appropriate  to  an  individual

bank's risk profile and management capabilities.  This  risk-focused supervisory approach is being increasingly recognised

and  followed  by regulators in other key financial  centres.

After  the enactment of this amendment, MAS will engage  each

bank  in  an  ongoing consultative process to  determine  the

appropriate level of capital that it should maintain.

<br><br><i>Revision   of  Methodology  for  Monitoring  Property-Related Exposure</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to effectively monitor and limit banks'

exposure to the property

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>

sector  in order to minimise the vulnerability of the banking

system  in  a property market downturn.  Section  34  of  the

existing  Banking  Act  limits loans  secured  by  "immovable

property   for  the  purpose  of  purchasing,  improving   or

altering"  that  property to 30% of the  bank's  deposits  in

Singapore.   This statutory requirement will be repealed  and

replaced  by a section empowering MAS to make regulations  to

limit banks' property-related risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another facet of the risk-focused supervisory

approach.   In some jurisdictions, the law does not prescribe

any  limits to the exposure of banks to the property  market.

It  is  left  entirely to regulators to exercise  supervisory

discretion.  In Singapore, a major part of the banks' lending

comprises  loans that are directly or indirectly  related  to

property.   This is because of the structure of our  economy.

Many  manufacturers are MNCs who depend on their own  sources

of  financing rather than on local banks.  Rather than  leave

the  matter  entirely to the discretion of the regulator,  we

have decided that the Banking Act should explicitly spell out

the  scope  of MAS' supervision of banks' property  exposure,

while  leaving the specific approach and degree of  tightness

to MAS' judgement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the enactment of the Bill, MAS intends to

implement, via regulations, a new methodology to monitor  and

limit  property-related  exposure.  The  old  methodology  is

unsatisfactory in several ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it only limits loans secured on immovable

property, and fails to capture loan exposures to the property

sector  that may not be secured on property, for  example,  a

general  loan  to a property developer.  The new  methodology

will impose a limit on all loans and debt instruments for the

purpose of property development or investment, whether or not

it is secured on immovable property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the old methodology limits property exposure to

a  proportion  of the bank's deposits.  But deposits  can  be

inflated  by  borrowing via the inter-bank market.   The  new

methodology will limit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>

property  loans to a proportion of the bank's total  non-bank

loans   and   debt  instruments.   This  encourages   healthy

diversification in the bank's loan portfolio.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the old methodology includes owner-occupied

housing  loans secured on the property.  The new  methodology

excludes   owner-occupied  housing  loans  from  the   limit,

recognising  that  its risk of default is  lower  than  other

property loans.  Owner-occupied housing loans will be subject

to  separate supervisory limits where warranted, according to

the circumstances of each bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS intends initially to set the limit on banks'

property  exposure  at  35%  of  its  total  loans  and  debt

instruments.   The  main banks are all currently  below  this

limit.   For  the  handful of smaller banks  which  currently

exceed the limit, MAS will grant them a short grace period to

bring down their ratios.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid any misunderstanding that this change is

intended  either  to tighten or loosen bank  lending  to  the

property sector, let me state explicitly that this is not the

case.   Our  aim  is rather to enable MAS to more  accurately

monitor  and  limit banks' exposure to the  property  sector.

Whether the 35% limit will be tightened or loosened in future

is   an  entirely  separate  policy  decision  that  will  be

considered in the future, and will depend on our view of  the

risk profile of the banking sector, and our view of the risks

in the property market at that time.

<br><br><i>Other Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to take the House through the rest of

the  amendments  that  will be made in the  order  that  they

appear in the Bill.  These include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustments to the provisions in section 9 on capital

requirements for foreign banks to allow the bank's issued and

paid-up  capital or its equivalent, and the bank's  reserves,

to count towards the S$200 million capital requirement;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeal of the rule in section 24 prohibiting payment

of  dividends  by banks until all capitalised expenditure  is

written  off.  This is in line with new accounting  standards

that require goodwill to be amortised over a number of years;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeal of provisions in section 25 empowering MAS to

determine  the  form in which a bank publishes its  accounts.

This  is  no longer necessary because MAS does not  prescribe

the form of presentation, verify the accuracy of the accounts

or  decide  on  any other details in relation to  the  bank's

accounts.   This  is and should remain the responsibility  of

the Board of the bank and the bank's external auditors;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment of section 62 to clarify that Singapore-incorporated banks are able to issue subordinated debt that

qualifies as regulatory capital;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The updating of penalties in the Banking Act to

underscore the importance of sound prudential standards.   In

general the penalties have been multiplied by a factor of  5.

This  is not excessive considering that many of the penalties

have  not  been  revised  since  1984,  and  some  have  been

unchanged since 1970.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, these amendments to the Banking Act will

implement   key  measures  to  strengthen  MAS'  risk-focused

supervision  of the banking sector, upgrade the local  banks,

and  provide  all banks with greater operational flexibility.

MAS  is currently reviewing policy changes to other areas  of

our  supervisory  framework.  A new Banking (Amendment)  Bill

will be tabled once the next major pieces are ready, probably

next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

start by stating explicitly that I support all the provisions

in   this  Banking  (Amendment)  Bill.   The  amendments  are

positive as they generally strengthen the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>

regulatory and legislative structure of the banking industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments pertain to stronger prudential

safeguards  and  corporate  governance,  greater  operational

flexibility and facilitating risk supervision of  the  banks.

As  said by the Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee, who is also the

Chairman  of  MAS,  these  changes  will  ultimately  benefit

depositors  and  shareholders, and strengthen  the  financial

system as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rules that I particularly like are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Separation of financial and non-financial

activities  of  local banking groups, and  the  3-year  grace

period for the divestments to take effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The revision of ownership rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Revision of methodology of monitoring property-related exposure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Prohibition of unlicensed offering of deposit-taking services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Changes to the capital adequacy requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from these amendments, I have the following

clarifications and queries which I wish to pose to the Deputy

Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the overall consolidation and merger of local

banks.   The Government has expressed the wish to see  faster

consolidation  of  local  banks, so  that  they  can  achieve

greater   size  and  bulk,  to  be  better  able  to  compete

regionally  and  internationally.  I would like  to  ask  the

Deputy  Prime Minister whether the Government is  happy  with

the  current pace of restructuring and consolidation of local

banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of consolidation, I would like to urge

the  Government  not  to  forget the  small  SMEs  and  small

depositors.  Bigger banks mean that they will target for  and

concentrate on the big customers.  Hence, I am concerned that

the smaller customers and depositors may be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>

neglected, and given poorer service.  This is evident in  the

merger  of  DBS Bank and POSBank.  There have been  instances

recently  where  the  small  depositors  have  to  suffer   a

significant drop of the service standards and an increase  in

the  charges  imposed on them.  I would  therefore  urge  the

Government or the MAS to be mindful of these developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the prohibition of unlicensed offering of

deposit-taking services.  This restriction is targeted mainly

at entities that are offering deposit-taking services through

the  Internet.  I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister

how  the  Government could regulate Internet banking entities

that  are  not  domiciled  in Singapore,  and  therefore  not

subject to MAS' licensing and rules.  I recall that about two

years  ago,  there  was an Internet bank started  in  the  UK

called  EGG.com.  This company offered better interest  rates

to  attract depositors and managed to amass 7 billion  pounds

of  deposits  within  one  year.  If  such  Internet  banking

companies  were to lure Singapore depositors with substantial

higher  interest rates and other benefits, some  Singaporeans

and  residents  may  fall for it.  How  do  we  regulate  and

control such Internet banking operators who are not operating

within Singapore, but attract deposits from overseas?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, flexibility for MAS to prescribe capital adequacy

requirements.  The present Banking Act requires  local  banks

to  maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR)  of  12%.

The  new  amendment  will allow MAS to  prescribe  CAR  on  a

consultative  basis.  This is a meaningful flexibility  which

MAS  can  decide  to impose lower CAR for the stronger  local

banks  which are therefore better able to take a higher  risk

profile  so  as to compete internationally.  For instance,  I

understand  that  the Basel Accord only requires  a  8%  CAR.

However,  we have to be aware that if the CAR on  some  local

banks  is lowered, would the depositors be subject to  higher

risk?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, MAS may decide to impose higher CAR for

the smaller local

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>

banks.   I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minster whether

or  not,  in  this case, MAS is setting uneven standards  and

rules on CAR for the various local banks, thereby creating an

unlevel playing field between the local banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of my queries and questions. May I

conclude by stating that I fully support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to support the Banking (Amendment) Bill which seeks  to

effect  changes  to  revised and new policies  and  measures.

These  will  help  position Singapore banks  better  in  ever

changing  circumstances that will require and reward  greater

operational  flexibility.   At  the  same  time,  we   should

continue  to  have  the  assurance that  banks  meet  minimum

prudential limits in order to preserve the integrity  of  the

Singapore   banking   system,   something   which   we   have

painstakingly built up over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes cover a wide range of issues but I

would like to limit my comments to the following three areas,

namely,  capital  adequacy,  property  exposure  and  banking

secrecy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, capital adequacy of banks. It is a well-known

fact  that  unlike  banks elsewhere which are  found  wanting

during  an  economic  downturn,  Singapore  banks  are  well-capitalised.   In fact, for many years, the  main  grouse  of

institutional  investors  in banking  stocks  has  been  that

Singapore  banks are over-capitalised.  Hence, their  returns

on  capital would pale in comparison with those of comparable

banks elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years, capital efficiency has figured

prominently and banks have sought other ways of funding their

activities whilst reducing the capital base.  Notwithstanding

that,  banks  here  still generally keep a  capital  adequacy

ratio  (CAR)  well above the MAS' minimum of  12%,  which  is

itself  already  higher  than  8%  imposed  by  the  Bank  of

International

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>

Settlements (BIS) on all banks.  According to published data,

the  average CAR of the top five locally owned banks  ranging

from  16%  to  24% was 19% in year 2000.  Thus, the  proposed

flexibility  for the MAS, in clause 12, to set  bank-specific

CAR  above its relatively high 12% minimum, runs the risk  of

being seen as an over-kill unless the circumstances for  such

an  imposition,  such as the innovation of  new  but  riskier

activities, are well understood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, our local CAR standards must always be

seen  in  the  context  of  regional  or  even  international

competitiveness  as well as the ambitions of Singapore  banks

to  expand offshore.  Imposing higher standards for Singapore

banks   may   unwittingly  limit  the  ability   to   compete

meaningfully as their threshold returns would be much higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the intent behind the introduction of

flexibility is a sound one, I would like to urge the  MAS  to

constantly  review  its 12% minimum  level  with  a  view  to

lowering  it  to  reward banks for good behaviour,  that  is,

banks  who  are themselves using internal models to calculate

risk  so as to calibrate the amount of capital they must  set

aside.   This, I believe, would be consistent with the spirit

of the new Basle 2 framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, property exposure. Sir, the changes outlined

in clause 22 attempt to help minimise the contagion effect of

a   property   market  downturn  through  a  more  meaningful

definition  of  property-exposed  loans.   Whilst   the   re-definition  will effectively broaden the coverage to  include

loans  to  building and construction, the  increase  will  be

offset  to  a large extent by the exclusion of owner-occupied

property  loans.   Hence,  lending  capacity  should  not  be

materially affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this exclusion of owner-occupied property loans is

well-founded and intuitively logical.  But I note that it  is

a  slight departure from the convention of attributing  lower

rates to mortgages in general, regardless of whether they are

owner-occupied or not.  The question of enforcement comes  to

mind, as an owner-occupied property may turn into an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>

investment  during  the tenure of the loan.   How  would  the

banks,  and the MAS as supervisor, know when there is such  a

change?   If left unchecked, would the real property exposure

be understated over time?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, banking secrecy versus the convergence of

retail  businesses.  Sir, here, the amendment seeks to  grant

banks  more  operational  flexibility  whilst  guarding   the

confidentiality of customer information.  This is significant

on  two counts, as the DPM has elaborated.   Firstly, it will

allow  outsourcing  of  functions to intermediaries  who  may

enjoy  greater economies of scale than the banks  themselves,

for  example,  backroom processing of  credit  cards  or  the

provision  of non-sensitive banking services which  does  not

involve  data handling.  This will enable banks to  focus  on

what they do best in the whole value chain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and more importantly, it will facilitate the

extension   of   cross-marketing  capabilities   to   promote

financial  products  and services as outlined  in  the  Sixth

Schedule.   Again, as banks cannot be experts across  a  wide

spectrum,  cross-marketing to help  broaden  consumer  choice

must be allowed as far as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take special significance on the Internet

platform  in  the  light of increasing  customer  demand  for

speedier processing.  For example, in the area of e-payments,

we read of Citigroup's use of the MSN portal or the emergence

of  PayPal,  which is posing some competition to credit  card

companies  like  Visa  and MasterCard.  However,  convergence

will  not  be limited to the electronic medium and a one-stop

banking-cum-services point may soon be the model for customer

satisfaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In due course, with convergence and the exciting

possibilities    of    cross-marketing    beyond    financial

institutions  to overlapping customer segments, the  question

of  selectively extending banking secrecy requirement has  to

be  addressed.   An  appropriate balance  has  to  be  struck

between  reaping synergies and unbridled use of  confidential

customer information.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>

Even  the imposition of a non-disclosure obligation will have

limited  practical effects.  Hence, any extension  should  be

contemplated only on a selective basis.  I would like to  ask

the  Deputy Prime Minister what are the MAS' thoughts on  the

possible  extension  beyond financial institutions  in  these

circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Banking (Amendment)

Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I support the Banking (Amendment) Bill as I believe the policies and measures

encapsulated  in  these amendments to the  Banking  Act  will

enhance  our position and reputation as a credible  financial

centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have two main concerns to raise and would

like  to  seek clarification from the Deputy Prime  Minister.

My  first  concern  relates to Internet-only  banks  and  the

second relates to revision of the banking secrecy provisions.

<br><br><i>Internet-only Banks.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2000, the Monetary Authority of Singapore issued

an Internet banking policy statement that allowed a reduction

of   the  paid-up  capital  requirements  for  local  banking

subsidiaries from $1.5 billion to $100 million.  This is  now

covered in clause 11 of the Bill by introducing a new section

9A to the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was stated in the MAS policy statement that one of

the reasons for this reduction in capital requirements was to

facilitate  the banks' adoption of new business models,  such

as  Internet-only banking.  The MAS also recognised that  two

broad  business models had emerged that a bank could consider

in  implementing  its  Internet banking  strategy.   One  was

through Internet banking facilities within the existing bank,

and  the  other  was through a stand-alone  entity,  such  as

Internet-only  banks (or IOBs).  I have a concern  about  the

second model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree that to survive in this fast changing

world,  a  company must be nimble, innovative  and  quick  to

change to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>

respond  to  challenges in its industry.  I also  agree  that

Internet  banking has the potential to improve  services  for

the  public.  But I would like to ask, in the context of  our

local  banking industry, is Internet-only banking so  crucial

that   it   warrants  a  reduction  in  the  paid-up  capital

requirements  from $1.5 billion to $100 million?   Could  not

the  existing  banks  achieve  their  Internet  strategy  and

compete  equally effectively by offering its banking services

through  the  Internet directly?  Do we  have  to  have  this

special  emphasis  so  as  to encourage  the  setting  up  of

Internet-only banks?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the use of the Internet is only a means of

delivering   a  company's  products  and  services   to   its

customers.  Whether these products are toys, books or banking

services,  many  of these Internet-dependent business  models

have not been proven to be sustainable in the long run.   For

toys,  I  am reminded of e-Toys which has folded up  but  the

good old Toys-R-Us is still around.  And, in the light of the

recent  NASDAQ meltdown, people are now more enlightened  and

sceptical  about  the viability or non-viability  of  a  pure

Internet-only business model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the MAS issued the policy statement in July 2000,

NASDAQ  was  then in the first phase of its long and  painful

decline.   Now  that almost a year has passed and  many  once

high-flying  Internet or dot-com companies with  much  higher

capitalisation  than $100 million have run out  of  cash  and

crashed,  I  would  like  to ask the  Deputy  Prime  Minister

whether there should be a re-think on this issue of promoting

Internet-only banks.  S$100 million do not seem like a lot of

money  when  the  company  has  to  invest  in  building  the

infrastructure  and  to  advertise  aggressively  to  attract

traffic.   And  banking products and services are  definitely

more important to us than toys.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business risks faced by Internet-only banks are no

different  from  other companies.  The MAS July  2000  policy

statement recognised these risks and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>

cautioned that "unlike other Internet ventures, banks can ill-afford  to  incur  losses  for long start-up  periods".   The

policy  statement also highlighted liquidity  risk  resulting

from   price-sensitive   customers  moving   their   deposits

electronically from one bank to another to take advantage  of

a  marginal difference in rates.  This is compounded  by  the

convenience of conducting Internet transactions and may cause

an electronic run on the bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons for companies to set up a subsidiary

for  a  new business venture is to limit the liabilities  and

exposure arising from that venture.  Notwithstanding that the

parent  Singapore incorporated bank will retain  control  and

letters  of  undertaking will be required from the  Singapore

bank and any alliance partners to pledge their support, in  a

limited liability company, the shareholders' liabilities  are

limited  to the extent of the capital they have put in.   The

letter  of  undertaking is usually not binding.  But  if  the

intention  is  to make it binding, it would effectively  mean

that  alliance  partners are guaranteeing the liabilities  of

the  banking subsidiary.  In that case, how would it help  in

removing  the  obstacles to our banks adopting  new  business

models?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the rationale is to facilitate the adoption of

new, but untested, business models, I believe there are other

operational structures and forms of collaboration that can be

explored  to  provide  the  banks  with  the  same  level  of

operational flexibility and yet afford the customer of the so-called  banking subsidiary better protection.   With  banking

subsidiaries licensed as banks and permitted to offer a whole

host of traditional banking services and products, my concern

is on how the bank's customers will be protected in the event

that  it  runs  out of cash and folds up. Will  such  a  bank

collapse  affect the banking industry on the  whole  and  our

reputation as a financial centre?

<br><br><i>Revision of banking secrecy provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this point, I have two concerns. The first is

paragraph 3 in Part II of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>

Sixth   Schedule   that   permits  disclosure   of   customer

information in connection with the performance of operational

functions  of  a  bank where such operational functions  have

been  out-sourced.  Under this exception to banking  secrecy,

the  disclosure can be made to any person, whether inside  or

outside  Singapore,  who  has been engaged  by  the  bank  to

perform  the  out-sourced  functions.   These  persons  would

probably be located in a lower cost jurisdiction, such as the

Philippines  or  perhaps Bangalore IT  Park,  as  that  makes

commercial and financial sense to the bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: what if these companies become

insolvent  and  bankrupt?  We have heard of bankrupt  dot-com

companies  becoming  the  target  of  a  takeover  for  their

valuable  databases  of  customer information  and  of  cash-strapped companies offering their customer database for  sale

to  raise cash.  What is to prevent otherwise-secret customer

information  from  falling into the wrong hands  through  the

sale  of  the database by a cash-strapped foreign contractor?

What  can we do to prevent or stop such a sale of information

in  a  foreign jurisdiction?  Could the Deputy Prime Minister

please elaborate on the nature and types of conditions  which

may be specified or imposed by the MAS to prevent such events

from happening?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in view of the risk of leakage of banking

information  through foreign companies which are  undertaking

out-sourced functions, I believe that more measures should be

put  in place to counter this risk.  My thinking is that  the

penalty   of  $250,000  under  new  section  47(6)  for   any

corporation which contravenes new section 47(5) by disclosing

the  customer information is grossly insufficient in relation

to the value of the customer database at hand.  Further, I am

unsure  how  this penalty can be enforced extra-territorially

against a foreign company in a foreign jurisdiction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of concern is on paragraph 9 of Part II

of   the  Sixth  Schedule  that  allows  disclosure  of   the

customer's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>

name, identity, address and contact number if such disclosure

is  solely  in connection with the promotion to the customers

of  the  bank in Singapore of financial products and services

made  available  in  Singapore by any  financial  institution

which  is  licensed or otherwise regulated  by  the  MAS.   I

presume  this  is  to facilitate the promotion  and  sale  of

financial products, such as credit cards, insurance policies,

foreign  currency deposits and unit trusts, offered by  other

financial institutions apart from the bank itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask what the rationale is for

introducing  such a blanket exception to our banking  secrecy

laws.   Instead of having this blanket exception, I  think  a

better way would be for the bank to ask its customers, either

by  way  of a newsletter, customer survey or other  means  of

communication from time to time, whether they would  like  to

receive  promotional  materials  and  information  on   other

financial  products and services.  This would be an  "opt-in"

system.   If  the customer wishes to know about  these  other

products and opts in, he would have signified in writing  his

consent  to the bank disclosing his name, identity and  other

contact particulars to the other financial institutions which

can  then  contact him.  This consent would be sufficient  to

permit  disclosure  as covered under the first  paragraph  of

Part  1,  ie,  where  the disclosure has  been  permitted  in

writing by the customer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a position is in fact commonly adopted by many

reputable on-line vendors where they state clearly  in  their

personal privacy policy that they will not sell or distribute

any  personal  information about the customer  to  any  third

party  and  the  customer is assured  that  he  will  receive

promotional materials only when he requests that  the  vendor

sends  that  information to him.  Additionally, the  customer

may  take  his name off the list at any time and  the  vendor

will  immediately cease delivery of the promotional materials

to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore surprised that a customer of a bank

should run the risk of his  name

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>

and  contact particulars being circulated to other  financial

institutions.  I fear this will open the floodgates for  name

lists  of  bank  customers to be swapped and exchanged  among

financial  institutions, leading to all of us being inundated

with more junk mail and cold calls, and not to mention a loss

of privacy and confidentiality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Banking (Amendment) Bill and hope

that,  in  its  implementation, the MAS will take  the  above

concerns into consideration.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Members  who have spoken for their support for the Bill,  and

let  me  address  the points which they have raised,  all  of

which are valuable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Leong Horn Kee has asked whether the rate of

banking  consolidation is fast enough.  There has  been  some

progress.   DBS has merged with POSBank, but there have  been

no  other mergers in Singapore, as he well knows.  But, as  I

have said, no merger does not mean that nothing is happening.

I am sure that the banks are talking to each other and I hope

that  something  will  develop as time  passes.   It  is  not

something  which  we can do in a hurry.  Arranging  a  match-making  is  a delicate business.  One has to find  the  right

partner  and  reach  the right terms, otherwise  it  can  end

unhappily,  and  it  is MAS' job to make  sure  that  unhappy

outcomes  are  kept  to a minimum.  So we will  foster  their

consolidation but it will take a little bit of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for small companies and small depositors who may be

affected  by the consolidation of banking, this is  an  issue

which  we have discussed several times in this House.  It  is

naturally of considerable concern to Members.  DBS-POSBank is

a  major  example, but there will be others  because  further

consolidation  will take place and further  adjustments  will

become  necessary.   So  one  of  the  things  which  we  are

considering  in  MAS is whether we should  not  require  many

banks in Singapore to provide a basic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>

banking  account - not free, but affordable - with  specified

characteristics, which we can have the Association  of  Banks

discuss  and  agree  upon, so that whoever  operates  in  the

Singapore  retail  banking market  will  have  to  provide  a

service  to look after the small depositors.  It is something

we  are considering.  We have to make sure that the burden is

not too onerous, but we hope to reach a conclusion before too

long.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Internet banking and how they will be regulated,

I  completely share Mr Leong Horn Kee's and also Mr Ong  Kian

Min's  scepticism about the risks of Internet  and  the  hype

about the dot-com euphoria which was very strong 12-18 months

ago but is now substantially evaporated.  I think it is right

for  us  to allow a certain degree of experimentation by  our

banks, but in a cautious way.  And one of the things which we

have  allowed  is to say, "You may set up a subsidiary,  only

$100 million paid-up capital, and you can use that subsidiary

to   carry   out  Internet  banking  or  all  other   banking

activities, or form a joint venture with a foreign partner."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$100 million is not a small sum of money. Our overall

requirement  for bank capital is $1 1/2 billion paid-up,  but

that  is  at the top level.  To require the subsidiary  of  a

bank  also  to have $1 1/2 billion tied up is not reasonable.

In  most other jurisdictions, one can set up a bank with much

less  capital than that.  In the UK, it is only five  million

Euros,  which  is  about S$7 million.  In Hong  Kong,  it  is

HK$150  million,  which is only about S$30 million.   So  our

requirement  of  $1 1/2 billion is many orders  of  magnitude

higher.   It  is there because we want to be absolutely  safe

and  we also wanted the banks to have a certain critical mass

and size.  But there is no justification for applying that at

the subsidiary level.  So we have set the subsidiary level at

$100  million,  which is still higher than  nearly  everybody

else.   If you say that the burn rate will soon burn out  the

$100  million, I would reply with what one banking supervisor

told me, that it makes him very nervous when he reads bankers

saying that they are running an Internet bank and it is their

business to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>

lose money so as to gain customers.  Because when banks start

to think like that, trouble is going to come.  And so we have

a  banking  framework  for Internet  banking  which  puts  in

adequate safeguards so that if a bank wants to start, it  has

some  flexibility but, before it goes too far, there will  be

some checks to hold it back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked about the capital adequacy of

banks and whether 12% was not already high, and whether going

for  even more on a supervisory discretionary basis would  be

an  overkill.   12% is higher than the BIS  standard  of  8%.

That  is  true.  But I would make two points.   Firstly,  our

banks  are  operating  in Asia and  this  is  a  less  stable

environment than the OECD countries and economies.  So it  is

wise  to  have  a  bigger capital cushion to  deal  with  the

uncertainties  of  the market.  Secondly,  although  the  BIS

standard  is  8%, nearly all banks in good health  have  much

higher  capital ratios than that.  Very few banks operate  at

the  margin,  with  just enough capital as specified  by  the

regulator.  So they have 12%-16% capital, enough  to  have  a

cushion without being so excessive that it affects their rate

of return.  I think 12% is about the right figure for us.  We

may  revise  it  from  time to time.   We  have  revised  the

composition of this 12% already twice to give the banks  more

flexibility, but it is not in the wrong ballpark.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will we go above 12%? When we think the bank's

risk profile or risk management capabilities or the health of

the  bank's loan book is such that it better have a bit  more

capital because, over all, its exposure is riskier.  That has

to be judged bank by bank.  I think the circumstances will be

that we will look at the individual banks to decide, and I do

not  expect  very  many banks to have additional  supervisory

impositions  placed  upon them over  and  above  the  general

standard.  But that will depend on how the practice  evolves.

With a Basel II framework which is being developed now, banks

are  moving  towards  internal  risk  models  of  loans,   of

operational  risks,  and will depend on these  internal  risk

models to decide how much capital they need,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>

rather than a certain formula set by the regulator.  We  hope

that our banks in Singapore will be able to develop such risk

models.   They are working at it, but it will take some  work

and it also requires some pooling of data, because we need to

have  the track record to have reliable statistics as to  how

risky  the loans are.  If they have these risk models and  if

indeed their track record is good, then, of course, they will

be  able to save on their capital requirements and this  will

be  to their advantage.  So there is a positive incentive, as

Mrs Lim Hwee Hua suggested should be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On property exposure, Mrs Lim talked about the coverage

being broadened because it will include loans to building and

construction, and whether this will not be offset to a  large

extent  by  the  exclusion of owner-occupied property  loans.

First  of  all,  I  should clarify that the coverage  is  not

really  broadened, because we are still focusing on  property

loans, ie, loans for property development.  We are not  going

to  impose  limits on loans to construction service providers

or  people who provide building materials, because these  are

not  property  developers or property  investors.   They  are

providing  services, goods.  So, similarly,  if  you  are  an

architect,  you  are  not a property developer  but  you  are

providing  services to the property developers.  Or,  if  you

are  a  civil engineer, construction engineer or a  transport

company,  you  are  not in the business.   So  we  are  still

focused only on property development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have excluded the owner-occupied housing loans from

our  limits  on property exposure, but it is not a  departure

from  the Basel approach, which assigns risk weights  because

owner-occupied housing loans do tend to have a lower risk  of

default,  so they do merit more lenient treatment than  other

property  loans.   We  are not treating  them  completely  as

unrestricted.   We  will  monitor  them  separately  and,  if

necessary, we will limit them.  And one of the limits we  now

have  is  to  say  home-buyers must make a 20%  cash  payment

before they borrow money from the bank and the bank will only

lend them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>

80%.   It  is a somewhat sore point with the developers,  but

that is a rule which we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for ownership status, Mrs Lim is right that it is a

little  bit difficult to find out who is living in  a  house.

HDB  has  ways of finding out and there are severe penalties.

If  he is not really living in the house and he is found out,

he  may get evicted and the house may be re-acquired.  If  it

is  a  private  property, there is no  such  sanction.   But,

still,  there  is a distinction between a loan which  is  for

owner  occupation  and  a loan which  is  for  an  investment

property.   If  it is for owner occupation, it is  his  first

house,  he is living in it, he is paying for it probably  out

of  his income and, therefore, he is not so likely to default

on  it,  whereas if it is an investment property  and  he  is

paying  for it out of rental income and he loses his  tenant,

then he may be unable to service his mortgage.  So there is a

risk  difference between an owner-occupied house and a  house

purchased for investment purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will the banks know? The banks presently already

ask  borrowers to declare, when they want a loan, whether  it

is  for owner occupation, and it is possible that one way  is

for  the  banks  to regularly ask for a new declaration,  and

ascertain  the position every year.  It is not likely  to  be

absolutely  foolproof but I think adequate  measures  can  be

worked out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, banking secrecy provisions. I will take Mr Ong

Kian Min's comments on banking secrecy provisions first.   Mr

Ong   asked   what  happens  to  the  database  of   customer

information  which  has been given to  an  outsource  service

provider  to process and it goes bankrupt.  Can he  sell  it?

The  answer is he cannot, because it is an offence under  the

Banking Act for a party receiving customer information from a

bank  in  the  course of performing an outsource function  to

onward  disclose that information.  So he cannot go and  sell

it to somebody else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is overseas, it is a bit difficult for us to

enforce, because our laws do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>

stretch  overseas.   But before a bank outsources  a  service

overseas,  we will want to be satisfied that it is  going  to

somebody  overseas  which the bank can, in  good  conscience,

have confidence with.  And the outsource service provider  is

in  a  country overseas where he can have some assurance that

the  rule  of  law applies and that it is not just  a  cowboy

environment.  These are standard precautions before we  allow

a  bank to outsource its services.  They will have to consult

us  and if there is a regulator on the other side, we will be

in  touch  with the regulator on the other side to  reach  an

understanding on the conditions before we approve.  So  there

are some safeguards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On contravention of banking secrecy, Mr Ong says

$250,000 is not an adequate penalty.  It is not a small  sum.

It  is five times bigger than any other penalty that used  to

be  in the Act.  It is the biggest penalty in the Act, as  it

will  be  amended.  If it is still not enough and we need  to

multiply  it by another factor of five, I will come back  and

ask the House for permission.  But I think, for now, $250,000

is adequate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sharing information about customers for cross-selling, Mr Ong and Mrs Lim made opposite suggestions. Mrs

Lim  talked about making it more flexible and allowing cross-selling even to non-financial institutions.  Whereas  Mr  Ong

says,  "Why do we want to have cross-selling?  Why  not  just

restrict  it to people who opt in and tick off in a  box  and

agree  to have their information shared around?"  This  is  a

judgment.   It  is a trade-off.  On the one hand,  the  banks

need  the flexibility to cross-sell.  On the other hand,  the

customer  wants  some privacy.  Mr Ong talked about  Internet

sites  invariably asking you whether you want  to  have  your

name  being  circulated around before they give your name  to

other service providers.  I wish they were all so scrupulous.

I  receive  all sorts of junk mail from people whom  I  never

agreed  to  give  my  name to, and I  am  sure  so  does  he.

Usually, there is a mechanism to get your name off the  list.

I  think what we need is a balance between the two, a balance

which will enable cross-selling to take place

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>

without  it  being intrusive to the customer and without  the

customer feeling that his privacy has been compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are two things we should do. First, there

should  be  only limited customer information relating  to  a

person's  personal  particulars which may be  disclosed,  and

only to financial institutions.  So, if your banker wants  to

cross-sell a product of the insurance company, he cannot tell

the  insurance company, "This is a good customer.  He  has  X

number  of dollars in his bank account.  Please go and  offer

him  a  $1 million insurance policy."  He can give your  name

and  you  may  be approached, but he cannot give  particulars

about accounts, transactions, assets and so on.  I think that

is  not  the  purpose why people go to the bank in  order  to

manage  their  money.   So it should  be  only  to  financial

institutions, only personal particulars and, secondly,  there

has to be an opt-out mechanism.  So if I object or I tick off

in  a  box, I will not have my particulars circulated  around

and not receive junk mail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried to strike a balance in this legislation.

It  is  a  delicate balance.  It is not one which is possible

for  MAS to strike on its own.  We have discussed it with the

banks  very carefully.  The banks are comfortable with  these

arrangements,  and  that is why I am here  before  the  House

commending this Bill to Members.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, could I ask the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  there will be a problem of less financing  available

for  home  purchasers as a result of this Bill,  and  whether

there  will  be unloading of properties by some  banks  as  a

result  of this Bill, and thus adding to the present property

glut?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, as I explained in my main

speech,  it is not the intention of the changes in this  Bill

to  tighten or loosen bank loans to the property sector.  The

35%  ratio which we intend to set has been calculated so that

nearly  all  the banks are below this limit.  The main  banks

are all below this limit.  There are a few

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>

small banks which are above it, but we will give them time to

adjust  their  loans, and I do not think it should  have  any

significant impact.  In future, whether we tighten or  loosen

this  limit  is a separate matter, which we will  address  in

future   when   the  moment  comes.   It   depends   on   the

circumstances  at  that time.  As of now, we  see  no  reason

either to tighten or loosen the state of bank lending to  the

property sector.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister has

not  answered  a  question that I posed in  my  speech.   The

supervision of banks using different capital adequacy  ratios

may  lead  to  unfair rules and an uneven playing  field  for

different banks.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, I should

have explained.  As I said, we expect most of the banks to be

on  standard rules.  But in special circumstances  where  the

banks  have special risks, then it is necessary for  them  to

have higher capital adequacy provided for, and we have to set

higher limits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it an uneven playing field? Well, it is, because we

are  dealing with players who are not of equal quality.   And

if  the risk is higher, it is necessary that you carry higher

capital.   It  may  be that you are running higher  risk  and

because  your capital is down, you are trying desperately  to

double  or  quits, and make good.  As a regulator, we  cannot

allow  that  to happen.  Between Singapore banks and  foreign

banks, even today there is a certain unevenness, because  the

Singapore  banks  have to have 12% capital adequacy,  whereas

foreign  banks in foreign jurisdictions have 8%  by  law  and

operate  under  a  different regime.  So it  is  already  not

equal.  But as I explained to Members, very few banks operate

exactly  at  the margin.  The Singapore banks  are  all  well

above  the  12% level.  The good foreign banks are  not  only

above  the  8% level but also above 12% de facto.   In  fact,

capital adequacy has not been a constraint on banks' returns,

and has not been a constraint on banks developing and growing

their business.  I do not think the changes we are making

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>

will make the situation any more difficult than it is now.

<div align="center"><b>TIMBER INDUSTRY (REPEAL) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to repeal the Timber Industry Act.

The  Timber  Industry  Act, originally known  as  the  Timber

Industry  Board (Incorporation) Act, was introduced in  1974.

At  that  time, Singapore was one of the leading  saw-milling

centres in the region.  The main objective of the Act was  to

ensure  the  quality of timber processed  and  exported  from

Singapore, so as to maintain Singapore's status as a reliable

timber  trading  centre.   The Act  stipulated,  among  other

things, the licensing of manufacturers, exporters and graders

of sawn timber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has since changed. Singapore's economic

landscape  has  evolved over the years and  our  trade  today

largely  comprises  high-value  manufactured  goods.   Timber

processing  and  timber  trading  are  largely  carried   out

offshore,  where the cost is lower.  Last year, timber  trade

accounted for only 0.3%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>

of  our  total trade compared to 2% in 1980.  The  number  of

sawmills has gone down from about 50 in 1980 to 4 last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our timber trade now mainly consists of import and re-export of timber. Those who continue to maintain their

activities in Singapore have also reached a certain level  of

maturity.  Our traders have adopted market practices that are

in  line  with international standards and requirements.   In

addition,  the  industry has introduced the Singapore  Timber

Trade  Procedures  since 1996 to foster  good  practices  for

timber  trading.   To  them,  market  competition,  and   not

Government  regulations,  provides  the  best  discipline  to

maintain high product quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater industry self-regulation by the Singapore

Timber  Exporters'  Association (STEA) and  Singapore  Timber

Manufacturers'  Association  (STMA),  the  Trade  Development

Board (TDB) has over the years progressively deregulated  the

timber  industry by removing export licences and registration

of manufacturers for timber items such as fibreboards, ground

wood and mouldings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these considerations, the Trade Development

Board  decided  to  review  the  regulations  on  the  timber

industry.    The   Trade  Development  Board  consulted   the

Singapore  Timber  Exporters' Association and  the  Singapore

Timber  Manufacturers' Association, who  confirmed  that  the

Timber Industry Act no longer serves much purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<div align="center"><b>COMMODITY FUTURES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>

I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br><i>Objective</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commodity Futures (Amendment) Bill introduces new

provisions  to  the existing Commodity Futures  Act  (Chapter

48A) to address the `bucket shop' problem.  The Bill provides

for  penalties for persons and entities operating  without  a

licence,  and enhances the penalties for stipulated  offences

under the Act.

<br><br><i>Background</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Bucket shops' are firms that entice the public to open

trading  accounts with them and to grant them wide discretion

to  trade on the investors' behalf.  Instead of trading  with

the  investors' interest in mind, the contractual  terms  are

such  that  they favour the firms.  They may claim to  effect

transactions  when they did not; or `churn',  that  is,  make

repeated transactions to earn commissions, without regard  to

the  interest of investors.  Investors are enticed with small

initial profits but may end up losing their entire investment

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commodity Futures Act was first enacted in 1992. It

covers  commodity  futures that are traded at  the  Singapore

Commodity  Exchange (SICOM), namely, rubber and coffee  only.

In  the  mid-1990s, `bucket shops' caused a stir with  mainly

spot or leveraged foreign exchange trading.  This was stamped

out  when  the MAS amended its Futures Trading Act  in  1995.

The  situation  was somewhat controlled until  `bucket  shop'

operators  came  up with new schemes in the last  2-3  years.

These  `bucket shops' deal in other commodities such as  pork

belly,  which  are  not covered under the  current  Commodity

Futures Act.

<br><br><i>Amendments to the Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commodity Futures (Amendment) Bill provides for the

Commodity  Futures Act to cover all commodities,  instead  of

just   rubber  and  coffee.   Apart  from  commodity  futures

trading, the Amendment Bill also provides for other forms  of

commodity trading to be covered.  These

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>

include  forward contracts, trading in differences, spot  and

leveraged trading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who wishes to engage in any of these trading

activities, for any type of commodity, will have to apply for

a  licence under the amended Act.  Those who cannot  qualify,

including  bucket  shops,  will  have  to  close  down  their

operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the licensing requirement, the Amendment

Bill  also  stipulated  stiffer penalties  for  offences,  as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Individuals who operate without a licence will face

a  fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment for up to one  year,

or  both.  Corporations face a fine of up to $100,000  or  to

imprisonment for up to three years, or both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Penalties have also been enhanced for offences such

as  false  trading,  bucketing, disseminating  of  misleading

information  in  the  promotion of false  trading,  employing

fraudulent  devices  or  schemes, and  fraudulently  inducing

persons  to  trade in commodity contracts.   Individuals  who

commit  any of these offences face a maximum fine of $250,000

or  imprisonment of up to seven years, or both.  Corporations

will face a higher maximum fine of $500,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the broader scope of the Act does not

affect  bona  fide  traders and result in over-regulation  or

unintended  consequences, the Act  provides  for  a  list  of

exemptions.  They are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, principal to principal traders. This is because

these  transactions are conducted between parties  that  know

the  commodity  and  its market very well.   They  also  have

genuine  business  reasons  to  conduct  these  transactions,

either because they physically need the commodities to supply

to   the  market,  or  they  need  to  hedge  against  future

uncertainties.  For the same reason, we are also proposing to

exempt  over  the counter trade, as they comprise  mainly  of

principal to principal trade;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, banks or financial institutions already licensed

or approved by MAS;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, persons trading with accredited investors

regulated under the Futures Trading Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, organisations which are approved oil trading

companies   or   approved  international  commodity   trading

companies, within the meaning of the Income Tax Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, persons who carry out spot commodity trading on

their  own accounts and do not solicit any funds from members

of the public.

<br><br><i>Public Consultations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has held wide consultations before proposing

the  amendments  to  the  Act.  We  consulted  the  Singapore

Commodity  Exchange  (SICOM), the  Consumers  Association  of

Singapore  (CASE),  the Trade Development  Board  (TDB),  the

Commercial   Affairs  Department  (CAD)  and   the   Monetary

Authority  of  Singapore  (MAS).  In  addition,  we  put  the

proposed amendments to the Act on the MTI website for  public

comments  during  the  month of January  2001.   We  received

feedback from 10 members of the public, all of which we  took

into  consideration  in the drafting of the  final  Amendment

Bill.   I  would like to thank Members of the House  and  the

public for their comments.

<br><br><i>Caveat Emptor</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no law can protect consumers who are gullible

and  fall  for get-rich-quick schemes.  My Ministry  is  also

working  with CASE to raise public awareness on such schemes.

Ultimately, we believe that the best defence for consumers is

to be vigilant and not fall for such schemes.  At this point,

I would like to take this opportunity to thank CASE for their

efforts  to  promote consumer awareness on the `bucket  shop'

issue.   My  Ministry  will continue to  work  with  CASE  to

promote the education of consumers to guard

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>

against falling prey to unscrupulous business practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed additional amendment to clause 4

widens  the  definition of "commodity" to include  intangible

commodities, like bandwidth.  These intangibles  are  already

is  to  remove  any scope for bucket shops to circumvent  our

law.

<div align="center"><b>COMMISSION ON PARLIAMENT STAFF</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Third Report of the

Commission on Parliament Staff as contained in Paper Misc.  3

of  2001,  accepts the recommendations of the  Commission  as

contained  in paragraph 6 thereof and resolves in  accordance

with such recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in accordance with Article 51(6) of the

Constitution  of  Singapore, a Commission consisting  of  the

Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance,

the  Chairman of the Public Service Commission and myself was

set  up to consider a new Scheme of Service for the Serjeant-at-Arms and Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has presented its Report to Parliament on

23rd  April  2001.  The Commission considered a  proposal  to

create  a new Scheme of Service for the Serjeant-at-Arms  and

Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms.  The rationale for the proposal  was

that  the duties of the Serjeant-at-Arms, especially  in  the

area of security, have increased tremendously over the years,

especially more so after moving into the new Parliament House

in 1999.  For

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>

instance,  there  was an increase in the number  of  visitors

over the last five years from 9,390 in 1996 to 30,500 in  the

year  2000, and this number is expected to increase over  the

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was recommended that the new Scheme of Service for

the Serjeant-at-Arms and Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms be based  on

the  existing  Police Scheme of Service  for  Senior  Station

Inspector   and   Station   Inspector   respectively.     The

recommendations of the Commission are contained in  paragraph

6 of the Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is asked to accept the recommendations of the

Commission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Third Report of the

Commission on Parliament Staff as contained in Paper Misc.  3

of  2001,  accepts the recommendations of the  Commission  as

contained  in paragraph 6 thereof and resolves in  accordance

with such recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<div align="center"><b>IS VOTING A PRIVILEGE OR A RIGHT?</b></div>

<br>3.37 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I decided to claim the

right to speak on this motion after one or two members of the

public  had  asked me what was all this flurry about  whether

voting  is  a right or a privilege.  But not being a  regular

reader of the Straits Times, I missed out a lot of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>

what  had been going on.  So I decided I would raise this  in

the  House.  I decided to look at this article that  appeared

in  the  Straits Times on 25th April where there was a  great

piece  about  whether  the  vote is  a  right  or  privilege.

Without  being  disrespectful to the  writer,  may  I  say  I

thought it was much of a flip-flop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flurry arose, as I understand it, from the

Minister's   statement  in  this  House  when  debating   the

Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill that the vote is not

a  right, but a privilege.  Having seen the article, again, I

said, "Well, that is just symptomatic of the PAP Government's

thinking  that the citizens of Singapore have no  rights  and

they  have  only such rights as the Government deems  at  its

pleasure  to grant them."  I do not know whether the Minister

consulted  or sought any legal opinion before he  made  this,

may  I say, very surprising statement in this House.  And the

article in the Straits Times did not make it any better.  The

writer talks about digging deep into the Constitution to  see

whether  there  was any such right.  May  I  suggest  to  the

writer that perhaps she was digging deep into the underground

looking  for  it somewhere down far below when it  was  there

right  on  the  top.  She missed that, and kept looking  down

below.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's statement, with all due respect to the

Minister, suffers from one basic flaw.  And the flaw is  this

-  a  failure to recognise that the marking of a ballot paper

is  just  as  much  an  expression as a writing  or  an  oral

utterance.   What  is more is that it is an expression  of  a

political choice on a matter that is of supreme importance to

the country.  The marking is an expression, just as a drawing

or a picture is an expression of the artist's view of things.

So  if  you  accept, and I do not see how you cannot  accept,

that  the marking of a ballot paper is an expression  of  the

voter, the electorate, then it becomes obvious that it  is  a

right  and  it  is  not a privilege that is  granted  by  the

Government.   And what is more is that it is right  there  in

the Constitution.  The writer of the article says, "Oh, there

are plenty of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>

other  rights.  But I couldn't find any right to vote."   But

she  misses it.  As I said, right at the beginning of Article

14,  one finds that every Singapore citizen has the right  to

freedom of expression.  And if, as I said, the marking of the

vote is an expression of the citizen's choice of a candidate,

then the citizen, the electorate, has a right to express  his

choice.  It is no longer a privilege.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of that, if you look at section 5 of the

Parliamentary  Elections Act, what does that  say?   For  the

benefit  of the Minister, in case he has not read  it  before

coming  into Parliament, it says in no uncertain  terms  that

all  citizens of Singapore over 21 years of age, resident  in

Singapore, on the 1st of July in any year, shall be  entitled

to  have their names on the register of electors.  What could

be  clearer - "shall be entitled to have their names  on  the

register".   And  if they have their names on  the  register,

then they are entitled to vote.  No two ways about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did say when I spoke on the Parliamentary Elections

(Amendment)  Bill that I considered leaving out some  of  our

Singapore   citizens   overseas  is  a   violation   of   the

Constitution, and I repeat that.  Every citizen of Singapore,

whether he is in Singapore or not, if he had been resident in

Singapore  on  the 1st of July before he went overseas,  and,

again,  if his name is still on the register, whether  he  is

here  or not, because there is a presumption, is entitled  to

vote, and there can be no discrimination between them.  And I

do question even section 6 in the Parliamentary Elections Act

which  takes away from prisoners serving sentences the  right

to  vote.  That clearly conflicts with section 5, that  every

citizen of Singapore over 21, resident, shall be entitled  to

have his name on the register.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally, I question the validity of section 43(5) and

(8)  removing, from the register, non-voters.   That,  again,

seems  to me to be a violation of the Constitution.  If  they

are  over 21 and they are citizens of Singapore, whether they

voted  or  not,  their names have to remain on the  register.

They cannot be taken out.  And

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>

this  suggestion offered to them, that they  can  have  their

names  on  the  register again if they  pay  $5,  is  equally

another violation of their constitutional right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I hope, without sounding too professorial, that I

have  cleared  the  cobwebs in the mind of the  Minister  and

others who seem to think that the vote is not a right  but  a

privilege.   As I have said, it is symptomatic of  the  PAP's

thinking.  Workers in Singapore have no rights.  And we  were

only  told  this  afternoon that a Singapore citizen,  if  he

wants  to  fly the Singapore flag, has no right  to  do  that

without getting the permission of the Government.  He has  to

make an application for it.  Everything, it would appear,  in

Singapore is a privilege granted at the pleasure of  the  PAP

Government.  I said this when I spoke on 28th April  2001  at

Yio  Chu Kang Stadium and I also said this in Manila, when  I

attended  the  conference  of all  Asian  parties,  that  the

society  in  Singapore is a castrated one.  Nobody  seems  to

have  any  right.   All  the  rights  are  vested  with   the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the Minister will now tell us, if he can,

why  he  says that the vote is a privilege and not  a  right.

Where  does  he  get that authority from?  In any  democratic

country,  it  is the citizens who decide who the  legislature

shall  consist  of.   And  so  it  is  provided  in  our  own

Constitution.  It is the electorate who elect the Members  to

this  legislature.  So they are given a right to choose their

representatives to this House.  But, in Singapore, apparently

according  to the Minister and the PAP Government,  they  can

take away from the citizens this right to vote to elect their

own Members into Parliament.  No wonder we have had all these

amendments  about introducing Nominated Members of Parliament

when  Parliament  should  only consist  of  elected  Members,

elected by the electorate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about yourself?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What about myself? I was elected, my

dear  man,  under a different provision, like  you  have  the

proportional representation system in other countries.  So do

not be under any fallacy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, may I know from the Minister and, if you will

permit,  Sir, I would like to reply to the Minister  when  he

gives an answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, actually, I am quite flummoxed

by  this.   I would say that this speech by Mr Jeyaretnam  is

quite symptomatic of his conduct in the House - to borrow his

word "symptomatic" - and let me explain that later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the whole basis of his statement is based

on  some  comments he read in the Straits Times, and that  is

his source of authority of what I said.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Then you have got it wrong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> How did I get it wrong?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Straits Times article is not the

authority for what I have said in this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> What the hon. Member said was that he

read  this article.  He was not actually quite interested  in

this  until there was this flurry of comments in the  Straits

Times and people complained to him and he wondered what  this

flurry  of comments was really about and he referred to  this

article  on  25th  April  in  the  Straits  Times  which  was

headlined  something like whether voting  is  a  right  or  a

privilege  and has ascribed to me saying that  "voting  is  a

privilege", and Mr Simon Tay saying that voting is  a  right.

Let me get it clear.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> He said that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I must say that Mr Jeyaretnam is just

as  confused  as  the writer who wrote that article  and  who

started  this  debate  on whether voting  is  a  right  or  a

privilege.  She said she was confused "by the apparently self-conflicting statements" made between Mr Simon Tay and myself.

Indeed,  by  her  article, she confused others,  including  a

person like Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the two Hansard records of 19th and 20th April

containing the speeches made

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>

by me in the two days of sitting of Parliament.  I would like

anyone, including Mr Jeyaretnam, to point out to me where  in

the two speeches I have made that I have said that "voting is

a privilege". And if I did indeed say so, I will apologise to

him.   But if I did not, then I think they should do what  is

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not the only one who was misled by this article.

I would have expected academics, who are supposed to do their

research,  thorough  in their work and finding  out  what  is

actually in the primary source of information, eg, documents,

to check and confirm before they actually express a view.  So

we  have  an  academic who says he now feels very  diminished

because  his  right  to  vote  has  been  converted  into   a

privilege.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> By whom?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> This academic is Mr Chua Beng Huat.

I  do not want to name names, but I think it is there in  the

newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, amongst the letters published in the papers,

only  Mr  Simon Tay seemed to have argued rationally what  is

the  position in the law.  When I said Mr Jeyaretnam's speech

just  now is symptomatic of his conduct in this House,  I  am

referring  to the times when we gave replies to his  comments

and he was not around to listen.  Or, when we made statements

and  speeches,  he did not listen, just as when  the  answers

were  given  this afternoon by my Minister of  State  to  the

various  questions  he raised.  He kept  repeating  the  same

questions over and over again.  It is a pity.  He should have

used  the time properly and then he would have been  able  to

make  more constructive contributions to the House.   But  he

raises the same issues over and over again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from his earlier comments attributing to me saying

that "voting is a privilege", all his points about what is in

the  law,  I agree with them.  This is one of the  very  rare

occasions that I agree

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>

with  him.  Let me put in my way what the position is in  our

law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, the only expressed reference to voting by a

citizen  is  in the Parliamentary Elections Act.  Section  38

states  that  the  register  of electors  is  the  conclusive

evidence  of  a  person's entitlement to  vote.    So,  if  a

person's  name is not in the register, he is not entitled  to

vote.   Section  5  says  that the  qualifications  for  that

entitlement  are that he must be a citizen,  he  must  be  21

years  old and above, and that he must be ordinarily resident

in  Singapore.   So, if a citizen whose name is  not  in  the

register  or  if he is not ordinarily resident in  Singapore,

then he cannot vote.  That is quite clear in section 5 of the

Parliamentary Elections Act.  Section 43 of the Act, which Mr

Jeyaretnam  also referred to, says that voting is compulsory.

So we have a duty to vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Constitution does not contain an expressed

declaration of the right to vote, I have been advised by  the

Attorney General, even before today, that the right  to  vote

at parliamentary and presidential elections is implied within

the  structure  of our Constitution.  We have a parliamentary

form  of  government.  The Constitution provides for  regular

general  elections  to  make  up Parliament  and  establishes

representative democracy in Singapore.  So the right to  vote

is  fundamental to a representative democracy, which we  are,

and  that is why we have the Parliamentary Elections  Act  to

give effect to this right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must also add that, as is the case in most

countries of the world, the right to vote is not absolute but

is usually subject to some conditions.  Singapore, therefore,

is  no different.  The most common of these conditions is age

-  in  our case, 21 and above.  All democracies allow  voting

only  for  citizens  above  a  certain  age.  Another  common

condition  is  residence in the country where  elections  are

held  for  regional  representation.  In our  case,  this  is

reflected as the need for a citizen to be ordinarily resident

in  Singapore  to  be  able to vote.   Residency  is  also  a

requirement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>

for  voters  in,  for example, New Zealand, Canada,  Germany,

Ireland, and South Korea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me reiterate and emphasise again that the recent

amendments  did not change or affect our citizens'  right  to

vote.   Rather,  they  have relaxed the definition  of  being

"ordinarily resident" in the Singapore context to  facilitate

overseas  voting. Any overseas Singaporean  who  fulfils  the

criteria as a registered overseas voter, can register at  the

nearest mission, whether or not he lives in the country where

the mission is located, or he can come home to vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the comments also referred to equality or

protection  in  Article 12 of the Constitution.   The  recent

amendments  to  the  Act  are also not  in  contravention  of

Article  12, which I think Mr Simon Tay referred  to  in  his

earlier  statement.   They  do not remove  anyone's  existing

voting  entitlement.  Neither do they make it more  difficult

for anyone to vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In replying to some of the Members' questions at the

last sitting, I have explained why not every overseas citizen

can  be  qualified to vote so long as parliamentary elections

continue  to  be run on a constituency representation  basis,

and there also remains the threat of plural voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residency requirement is necessary to allocate the

voter  to  a constituency.  This is necessary in an  election

based  on  constituency representation and to prevent  plural

voting.   The  recent  amendments expand  the  definition  of

"residency" to include groups of citizens who are  away  from

Singapore   for   non-permanent  reasons  and   hence,   have

sufficient  ties  to  be allocated to vote  in  a  particular

constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help it but to also refer to another article in

the  Straits Times recently, arising from this debate on  the

right  to vote.   Another Straits Times journalist has argued

that   being  Singaporean  adds  up  to  a  Singapore   minus

experience.  It is a pity that she feels

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>

this way.  Among other things, she wrote about several issues

like  detention  without trial, X-rated  movies,  banning  of

chewing   gums  and  mandatory  imprisonment  for  harbouring

illegal immigrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans generally agree that the unbridled rights

of  individuals who run afoul of the law cannot override  the

rights   of  the  community  to  be  safe  from  subversives,

gangsters,  illegal immigrants, or to have  clean  roads  and

smooth MRT rides.  Likewise, voting as a right comes with the

responsibility  to  exercise it  for  the  best  interest  of

Singapore,  one's  family and the  community  at  large.   If

Singaporeans do indeed feel "diminished when their  political

space  and  political rights are circumscribed", as  she  had

claimed,  then would they still remain in Singapore if  their

personal  safety  and  security, and that  of  their  family,

become  a  daily  concern through the  lifting  of  the  same

safeguards  that  were cited?  Singapore  cannot  be  such  a

stifling  place if it continues to attract tens of  thousands

of foreigners who want to work and live here.

.     Finally, Sir, I would like to reiterate what I said  at

the  last  Parliament  sitting.   We  are  not  doubting  the

loyalties  or  emotional links of Singaporeans  to  Singapore

just  because  they live overseas.  We believe that  many  of

them  will return to Singapore, that they feel for Singapore,

and  that they will defend Singapore's interest.  The current

criteria for overseas voting are not cast in stone, as I said

at  the  last  sitting.   This is only  the  first  step  the

Government  is  taking  to provide  for  it.   As  the  Prime

Minister  has  said recently, the original intention  was  to

implement overseas voting only in the 2007 General Elections,

but we decided to bring it forward so that we can do it on  a

limited scale to gain some experience.  We will review  after

the next Elections to assess the scope for extending overseas

voting to more Singaporeans who are overseas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just say that ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, under the Standing

Orders, you have no right of reply.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I just want to say that if I have done

the  Minister an injustice, I apologise.  But I wish  he  had

reacted to the article in the Straits Times by saying that he

never said it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I was waiting for an opportunity to

say  this.   The  Prime Minister and I  discussed  this.   He

decided that he would want to say something about it as well.

So I waited for this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>

occasion and Mr Jeyaretnam gave me the opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.

<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at Five</div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if  he will furnish details of all remuneration paid to  each

and   every   Cabinet  Minister,  Minister   of   State   and

Ministerial  statement on "Civil Service  NWC  Award,  Public

Sector  Salary Revisions and Review of Salary Benchmarks"  in

Parliament on 29th June 2000, and in the two-day debate  that

followed,  announced and explained the new  salary  structure

and  benchmarks for the Administrative Service, Political and

Statutory Appointment Holders.  He also gave the monthly  and

annual  salaries  of  key political appointment  levels  (eg,

Prime Minister, Ministerial Range 3 and Ministerial Range 4).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual remuneration packages of Cabinet

Ministers,  Ministers of State and Parliamentary  Secretaries

for  the  year 2000 were determined by the Prime Minister  in

accordance  with this Ministerial statement.  They constitute

confidential information that it would not be appropriate  to

publish.   However, the total amounts paid out  to  Ministers

and  Ministers of State in Financial Year 2000 were given  in

the  reply to Mr Jeyaretnam's earlier Parliamentary  question

on 19th April 2001.
