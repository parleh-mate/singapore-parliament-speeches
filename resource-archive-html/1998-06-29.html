<div align="center"><b>OFF-BUDGET MEASURES TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Finance, in

view  of  the continuing deterioration in the economies  of  the

countries in the region, whether the Singapore economy will also

be  affected  and  deteriorate further than expected,  and  what

measures  the  Government intends to introduce to stimulate  the

economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan</b> asked the Minister for Finance if his

Ministry  has  completed the assessment of  the  impact  of  the

regional economic and financial crisis on the Singapore  economy

and,  if  so,  what  off-Budget measures will be  introduced  to

support the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether  it  is now imperative for the Government to announce  a

package of off-Budget measures to restore confidence and  arrest

the economic downturn.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether

substantial measures, such as increased and accelerated spending

on infrastructure development, will be made by the Government to

stimulate the economy at home and, if so, what are the measures.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  with  your permission,  I  would  like  to  take

Question Nos. 1 to 4 together as they are related.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I will speak on the economic

outlook and details of measures to stimulate the economy in  the

Ministerial Statement later this afternoon.

<div align="center"><b>PROPERTY TAX</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reduction)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he

will  consider  reducing the property tax rate for  house-owners

and companies in view of the financial crisis.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, home owners are

already  taxed  at a low concessionary tax rate  of  4%  on  the

annual  value  of their properties.  Further, with the  property

tax  rebates  given  since  1994 to offset  GST,  currently  the

majority  of HDB households living in one to four room flats  do

not pay any property tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustments to the property tax payable by companies will

be announced in my Ministerial Statement later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Dr Wang Kai

Yuen -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To ask the Minister for National Development in view of

the  rapidly  deteriorating situation on the real estate  market

and  the  economic slowdown whether he will reconsider repealing

all anti-speculation measures.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has reviewed the anti-speculation measures in the light of the present state of the

relevant  in today's context and will be retained. Some  changes

will  be  announced by the Minister for Finance as part  of  the

overall  off-Budget package for the economy. MND will be issuing

a press release on the details.

<div align="center"><b>WEAK JAPANESE YEN</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Impact on Singapore economy)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b> asked the Minister for Finance what

impact  the  weakening  of the Japanese yen  will  have  on  the

Singapore economy as well as on the ASEAN countries.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Japan is a

significant  export market for the regional economies  including

Singapore.    It  accounted  for  18%  of  regional  (Indonesia,

Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei) exports and 7.6%

of Singapore's total non-oil domestic exports in 1997. A falling

yen  would  raise the prices of imported goods  into  Japan  and

further  dampen  the weak demand for regional imports  including

those  from  Singapore. Japan is also an  important  market  for

Singapore's  services exports. For example,  it  is  our  second

largest  single market for tourism, accounting for 15% of  total

visitor  arrivals  in 1997. A continuing weakening  of  the  yen

would  lead  to  a  further  decline in  Japanese  arrivals  and

aggravate   the  slowdown  in  retail,  restaurant   and   hotel

businesses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region has also been a major recipient of Japanese

foreign  capital. Direct investments from Japan  have  accounted

for  an  increasing  share  of total foreign  direct  investment

approvals   in  ASEAN-3,  which  are  Indonesia,  Thailand   and

Malaysia,  from 15% in 1992 to 24% in 1996. In Singapore,  Japan

contributed a significant 21.5% of total FDI inflow between 1990-95.  A  weakening  of  the yen would adversely  affect  Japanese

companies' overseas expansion plans. This could have a dampening

effect on the growth of Japanese investments in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a weakening of the yen is likely to exacerbate

the  weak balance sheet position of Japanese banks, which  would

lead  to  a  further  consolidation  of  Japanese  international

banking  activities, including those in the Asian Dollar  Market

in  Singapore. This would in turn adversely affect the growth of

the financial services sector in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a significant exporter of electronics goods, Japan also

competes with Singapore and some of the other regional economies

in  major  markets  such as the United States  and  Europe.  The

continued  depreciation of the yen will therefore exert  greater

competitive pressure on regional exports. Finally, as  shown  by

events in recent weeks, a weakening of the yen has a tendency to

unsettle regional financial markets.

<div align="center"><b>NEW INVESTORS AND INVESTMENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry (a) if he will indicate the number of new investors and

amount  of  investment Singapore attracted from January  to  May

1998 and how these figures compare to the projected figures; (b)

what  is  the  outlook for new investments for the rest  of  the

year; and (c) whether we lost any investors because of the  high

property  cost and the high land rentals charged by  the  Jurong

Town Corporation and the Housing and Development Board.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Second Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, based on the latest figures, 107

new  projects  in manufacturing were committed from  January  to

June  1998.  These investments are expected to generate a value-added of $2.6 billion and employment of 10,500, of which 41%  of

the jobs are for knowledge and skilled workers.  The fixed asset

investments totalled $3.9 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exportable services sector, 48 projects were

committed as of June this year.  When fully realised, they  will

yield  a value-added of $823 million and create 2,600 jobs,  66%

of  which are for knowledge and skilled workers.  These projects

are  expected  to  record  a  total business  spending  of  $723

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large proportion of investments this year are based on

decisions  made last year.  Investments for the  rest  of  1998,

1999  and  beyond  will depend on further  developments  of  the

situation in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When companies evaluate whether to invest in Singapore,

land cost or rental is only one out of many factors that  are

taken   into   consideration.    Other   factors   such    as

capabilities, wage rates, infrastructure support  and  market

potential  are important considerations as well.   Certainly,

the appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the regional

currencies  has  affected our cost competitiveness  vis-a-vis

other  regional  countries. This may have  been  one  of  the

factors that have caused some companies to re-evaluate  their

investment  plans.  However, slower regional  growth  is  the

main  factor  that will cause a slowdown in investments  that

cater mainly to markets in the region.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I

ask  the Minister whether any of the companies, who had  made

their  decisions to invest here last year, have  reconsidered

their  decisions  and  declined to come  in  at  the  present

moment?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> There are some companies which

have  extended  their decision-making process  to  take  into

account the current regional economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>

situation.   But it is not clear at this point  in  time  how

much reduction in investments we will encounter this year  as

a result of it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister  whether we have lost any investor who  has  cited

land cost as a reason.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said

earlier, land cost is only one of many considerations.   Whether

land  cost as a specific reason has caused an investment  to  be

rescinded, I am not aware of.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Can I ask the Minister whether he feels

that the land cost in Singapore is excessively high compared  to

our  competitors, for example, in Taiwan where it is about  four

times  cheaper,  and in Kulim, Malaysia, which  is  about  20-30

times cheaper than in Singapore, and will this continue to be  a

serious problem for us to attract new investments in the future?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Land cost is a factor, as I said

earlier.  Our objective in the coming months and years should be

to  lower  our  overall cost position.  But as to  the  specific

measures  that we should take, I think we should wait  for  this

afternoon's statement by the Finance Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry,   in  view  of  the  expected  decrease   in   foreign

investments  into  Singapore in the near future,  what  are  the

measures  the  Government plans to take to promote  and  attract

more foreign investments into Singapore.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

is  committed  to  keep  Singapore an  attractive  location  for

foreign  investments. However, the slowdown in regional economic

growth  has  caused  some  companies,  which  rely  on  regional

markets, to re-evaluate their investment plans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been proactive in encouraging foreign

companies  to locate their operations here. For the short  term,

the  Government  has  sought ways to keep costs  down.  JTC  had

announced in March that it would freeze its posted rentals until

June 1999. In cases where the market has dropped, JTC will lower

its  rentals  accordingly to be in-line with market  conditions.

The Government will continue to  keep industrial land prices and

rentals   competitive  and  respond  to  the  changing  economic

conditions so as to create a conducive business environment  for

investors.  We  will also continue to invest  in  infrastructure

projects like the reclamation of Jurong Island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDB is intensifying its efforts to promote investments from

the major regions to ensure that investments in the pipeline are

committed on schedule.  EDB officers have been stepping up their

promotional  efforts  both in Singapore  and  overseas,  closely

monitoring  the  needs  of  companies  and  continuing  to  spot

opportunities  to  attract  investments  into  Singapore.   More

investment promotion trips involving EDB's senior management are

being conducted this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, EDB will continue to co-invest with

companies  to  help share risks and provide equity  funding  for

strategic  projects.   Recently,  the  EDB  also  introduced  an

Industry  21 (I21) initiative. One of the thrusts of I21  is  to

promote  world-class capabilities by encouraging  MNCs  to  base

world-class facilities here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> I would like to ask

the Minister whether it is also worthwhile for Ministers to lead

some  business delegations overseas so that they can bring along

local businesses to attract foreign investments into Singapore.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The answer is yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister said that the Government will

petrol will affect our traffic management efforts.  We will have

to  rely  more  heavily on measures such as the Electronic  Road

roads, it will not be prudent to reduce the petrol duty.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs

if  he  will  give  an  update  on  the  negotiations  regarding

outstanding bilateral issues with Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr

Speaker,    Sir,    I   last   informed   this    House    about

Malaysia-Singapore relations during our sitting  on  13th  March

1998.   On that occasion, Members will recall that I ran through

the various items mentioned in the Joint Communique issued after

our Prime Minister's visit to Kuala Lumpur in February 1998.   I

told  the  House  that  there  had been  progress  in  bilateral

relations, but I also cautioned that several outstanding  issues

remained unresolved.  This remains the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Pedra Branca, on 14th April 1998, officials from both

sides  finalised  the  text  of a  Special  Agreement  to  refer

Malaysia's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>

claim  to  Pedra Branca to the International Court  of  Justice.

This  is  a  positive development which brings the Pedra  Branca

dispute one step closer towards resolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there has been less progress on other issues such

as   the  long-term  supply  of  water  to  Singapore  and   the

development of Malayan Railway Land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On water, the Joint Communique issued in February 1998

contained a general undertaking that Malaysia would continue the

supply of water to Singapore beyond the expiry dates of the 1961

and 1962 Water Agreements. This was to have been confirmed in  a

formal  Water Agreement within sixty days from the  issuance  of

the Joint Communique. However, both sides have not been able  to

meet the deadline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Singapore seeks is not just a general undertaking but

a  formal,  legally  binding, Water  Agreement  which  sets  out

clearly  the terms and conditions for the supply of water  after

the   present  Water  Agreements  run  out  in  2011  and   2061

respectively.   This will avoid future disagreements  after  the

present leaderships in both Singapore and Malaysia are no longer

around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There had been several rounds of negotiations before the

deadline.   But we had not reached agreement on a  formal  Water

Agreement.   We  will continue discussions with  the  Malaysians

when they are ready.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the region is in the grips of an economic crisis.

Both   Singapore  and  Malaysia  are  affected.   In  times   of

difficulties,  both countries should enhance  their  cooperation

and   minimize  the  areas  of  disagreements.   The  two  Prime

Ministers  have discussed financial cooperation but no agreement

has yet been reached on specific measures of cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other issues which have been discussed include the

outstanding matters relating to the Points of Agreement (POA) on

Malayan Railway Land in Singapore and withdrawal conditions  for

West  Malaysians' CPF savings. Minister Lee Boon Yang told  this

House on 1st June 1998 that the CPF withdrawal conditions can be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>

settled  in the context of a broader cooperation package between

Malaysia and Singapore.  This remains our position. We have  not

yet  reached  agreement on such a broader package of cooperation

which  would include the long-term supply of water to Singapore.

If  this  can  be  agreed, there is considerable  potential  for

mutually  beneficial  cooperation in a wide  variety  of  areas.

This  would include the development of the Malayan Railway  Land

at  Bukit Timah which is not covered by the Points of Agreement.

Members will recall that the Prime Minister made this point when

he  spoke about the framework of wider cooperation in this House

on 5th June 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at today's sitting, Minister for Finance, Dr Richard

Hu,  will  move  the  Second Reading of the Customs  (Amendment)

Bill.  This amendment has to do with the shifting of Singapore's

Customs,  Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) facilities  from  the

railway  station at Tanjong Pagar to the new facilities  at  the

train checkpoint in Woodlands on 1st August 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had informed Malaysia of our intention to move to

Woodlands  as  early  as 1989 and repeated  on  many  subsequent

occasions.  We have also informed Malaysia that once Singapore's

CIQ  facilities  move  to Woodlands, Malaysia's  CIQ  operations

could  no  longer  continue in Tanjong Pagar because  Malaysia's

Customs  and Immigration officials would have no legal authority

to  exercise such functions in Singapore in the absence of their

Singapore  counterparts. Moreover, they would be  clearing  rail

passengers  for entry into Malaysia before they are cleared  for

exit  from  Singapore by the Singapore CIQ at Woodlands.    This

sequence  of clearance would not only be illogical and  contrary

to  international practice but could also present other problems

such as in crime investigation and prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1993, Malaysia agreed that they relocate their

CIQ facilities to Woodlands together with Singapore. However, in

June 1997, one year ago, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>

Malaysians told us that they had changed their mind and did  not

wish  to  co-locate their CIQ facilities with ours at  Woodlands

after all, thereby rejecting Singapore's offer to move their CIQ

to    Woodlands.     Therefore,   the   present   administrative

arrangements  which allow Malaysia to exercise CIQ functions  at

Tanjong  Pagar will cease after 1st August 1998.  The Malaysians

were  informed  of  this  in  July  last  year  and  on  several

subsequent occasions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say, Sir, that this does not affect the status of

the  Malayan  Railway  Land which is subject  to  the  POA.   As

Members  are  aware, the Prime Minister and I  had  briefed  the

House  in June 1997 on the background to the POA.  Members  will

recall  it was our decision to relocate our CIQ to Woodlands  in

1989 which prompted the negotiations culminating in the POA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Sir, Singapore and Malaysia are bound by a

multiplicity  of complex  ties. Any relationship of  such  close

interdependence is bound to go through different phases.  It  is

only natural that there will be ups and downs. What is important

is  that we do not lose sight of the central fact of our  inter-twined  destinies.  That was why the Prime Minister went  up  to

Kuala Lumpur in February, and issued a Joint Communique with  Dr

Mahathir to pursue a "prosper-thy-neighbour" policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated in this House before, after Separation,

Malaysia and Singapore have become two different societies, each

having  its  own  distinct national character and  culture.   We

compete  as  well  as  cooperate to  advance  our  own  national

interests.   This too is only natural, as leaders  in  both  our

countries   have   recognised.   Singapore   will   manage   our

relationship  with  Malaysia on the  basis  of  reciprocity  and

mutual respect for each other's interests.  We are committed  to

forging a long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Malaysia

on this basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that

the   Singapore  Government  will,  willy-nilly,  move  the  CIQ

operations to Woodlands as from 1st

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>

August 1998.  Has the Malaysian Government made any response  to

this    decision   of   the   Singapore   Government   to   move

notwithstanding their reluctance?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If the Member had listened to what I said

carefully,  he  would have noted that it was not  a  willy-nilly

decision.   I said that this move was decided, and the Malaysian

Government was informed, as early as 1989.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, we have overshot the

target  by  two months to reach an agreement on continued  water

supply.   Can I ask the Minister whether a new target  date  has

been  set  and  when can we expect an agreement  to  be  reached

between the two countries?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> It is true, Sir, that certain target dates

-  which  I  would really not say are "target dates", but  dates

which  the  two leaders indicated as dates for the officials  to

try  to  work out the arrangements on Pedra Branca and  water  - were   set  in  the  Joint  Communique.   But  in  international

negotiations,  Sir, Members will know that we can  endeavour  to

reach   agreement  by  a  certain  date.   But  if   there   are

difficulties  and,  if  further negotiations  are  needed,  then

obviously  we  have  to  press on, in  good  faith,  beyond  the

deadline.   I would not want now to set a clear fixed  deadline.

What  I can say is, as I have mentioned in my main answer,  that

we will resume the negotiations when the Malaysian Government is

ready.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

ask  the  Minister to confirm  that, in international  practice,

checks are normally carried out at the nearest checkpoint and  I

think  Woodlands checkpoint is the most suitable.   Members  who

are not aware of the international practice will be glad to know

the  Government's position because in most countries it  is  the

nearest  point  when you enter the country.   We  have  had  the

Keppel  Road  checkpoint  for a long time  and  the  House  will

appreciate  that it is a move in the right direction.   Could  I

have the Minister's clarification on this point?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If the Member is referring to what Dr

Richard  Hu  is  going  to  mention  later  that  the  move   by

Singapore's  CIQ  to  Woodlands is consonant with  international

practice,  the  answer  is yes.  It is  also  the  international

practice  that the checkpoints of countries are located  in  the

territory of their respective countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the

Minister,  given  that it took almost four years  on  the  Pedra

Branca  issue  between  the agreement in principle  between  the

Prime  Ministers  and  this final agreement  by  the  officials,

whether   he  is  satisfied  that  bilateral  negotiations   are

proceeding at a sufficient pace and, if not, whether as part  of

the  framework of cooperation, both countries might consider  an

agreement  for  mediation  and peaceful  settlement  in  a  more

orderly and systematic manner?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I am not sure I have fully understood the

thrust of the Member's question.  I would have thought that  the

decision by both countries to resolve an outstanding dispute  on

Pedra  Branca is a very good example to other countries  of  how

such  difficult  issues  can  be resolved  in  an  amicable  and

peaceful  manner,  in  this  case,  by  resort  to  third  party

judgement,  ie,  the International Court of Justice.   It  might

have  taken  time,  but  in the process  that  dispute  has  not

affected the other on-going discussions on bilateral issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, if I may clarify. I agree with the

Minister that it is a good step.  But the point is that it  took

four years.  Would it not have been better if the two countries,

as part of a broader framework of cooperation, as Prime Minister

Goh has asked for, seek a more systematic way of proceeding with

mediation  and,  if mediation is not sufficient,  then  to  have

third  party  settlement  on a broader  range  of  issues?   For

example, some countries ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Tay, can you ask your question?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> That is the question. Basically, should we

not have a broader agreement to proceed with mediation and third

party  settlement on a wider range of issues, rather than  issue

by issue?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Certain issues lend themselves to

mediation  and third party settlement.  Obviously, those  issues

will  be  very  few.   Other  issues  have  to  be  resolved  by

negotiations,  sometimes  protracted negotiations,  by  the  two

countries and the two governments themselves.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, according to recent press reports,

Singapore  motorists  have  been  taken  to  task  by  Malaysian

authorities for not paying traffic fines there.  Will this be  a

bilateral issue between the two countries?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Am I right that the Member is referring to

reports  in  Malaysian newspapers about Singapore motorists  not

paying up fines and summonses?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I do not think this needs to become a

bilateral  issue.  The position of the Singapore  Government  is

that  if our citizens go abroad, to whichever country, we expect

them to abide by the laws and regulations of that country.   And

if  indeed  the  facts  are that Singapore motorists  have  been

delinquent and not paid up the fines and traffic summonses, then

they  will  obviously  have to face the  penalties  just  as  we

require  foreigners coming to Singapore to observe our laws  and

face the consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me also say that this is a problem

which  is  not unique just to Malaysia.  Singapore has the  flip

side of the problem also, because I am told that the problem  of

foreign  traffic defaulters not paying up summonses  or  meeting

warrants of arrest in Singapore is also quite a big problem.   I

am   told   that  there  are  some  80,000  outstanding  traffic

summonses, most of which, of course, will be Malaysians.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower, in

the   light  of  the  further  deterioration  of  the   economic

situation,  whether the rates of CPF contribution in respect  of

employers  and/or employees will be cut and if so, by  how  many

percentage points.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Government  has  indicated that  if  the  preliminary

estimates for Singapore's second quarter growth shows a  further

slowdown,  off-Budget  measures to  help  the  economy  will  be

implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off-Budget measures including raising Government's

expenditure for infrastructure projects and cutting the cost  of

doing  business  will be announced by the Minister  for  Finance

later  today.   A cut in CPF contribution rate  is  one  of  the

options  that we had considered in view of the deterioration  of

economic prospects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is a drastic measure, we should not rush into

cutting  CPF.  The National Wages Council has recently announced

its  recommendations  urging companies and workers  to  exercise

wage restraint to tide over the difficult period.  Although  our

economy  has  slowed down considerably, we have not  experienced

negative growth yet, as in 1985.  The wage structure in 1985 was

also  more rigid, leaving little room for adjustments.  However,

with the flexi-wage system that is in place today, companies can

now  reduce their wage cost by adjusting their variable payment,

including  the  AWS  (or Annual Wage Supplement)  based  on  the

performance  of the company.  Reduction of the CPF  contribution

should be implemented only if these cost cutting measures need a

further boost.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, do the Minister and the

Government  appreciate  that with the  downturn  in  the  retail

trade,  it will be a good thing to put some money back into  the

pockets  of  the consumers?  For that reason, has the Government

considered cutting down the employee's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>

contribution  to  the CPF, not the employer's contribution?   We

can  maintain  the  employer's contribution  but  cut  down  the

employee's contribution to CPF.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we cut down the

employee's CPF contribution rate, then we will also have a  very

significant  impact  on the workers' ability  to  service  their

mortgage  loan  repayments, because many CPF members  depend  on

their monthly CPF contributions to service their mortgage loans.

If  you  cut down on the employee's CPF contribution,  obviously

many  CPF members will have to come out with their own  cash  to

meet the monthly repayment.  So it may not be of much benefit in

terms  of boosting the spending power of the consumer.   Cutting

CPF should be taken as a cost reduction measure rather than as a

consumption  stimulation measure.  And if we do eventually  have

to  cut  the  CPF because the economic situation has got  worse,

then  cutting the employer's CPF contribution makes  more  logic

and  it  is  more  rational  than  cutting  the  employee's  CPF

contribution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, in 1985, I believe

the  employer's component was cut by 15 percentage points.   Can

the  Minister now give an indication, if there is going to be  a

cut, what is the percentage point?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member is correct

in  saying  that in the 1985/86 economic downturn,  we  cut  the

employer's  CPF contribution rate by 15 percentage  points.   We

will cross the bridge when we get to that point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Question No. 13, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron</b>

<b>Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

the  first  quarter  of  1998, a total  of  7,131  workers  were

retrenched.  This is the highest quarterly figure ever  recorded

since  retrenchment  data  was  first  compiled  in  1983.   The

majority  of  the retrenched workers were from the manufacturing

sector,  mainly the electronics, electrical, and  petroleum  and

chemical products industries.  Survey findings show that 63%  of

the  local workers retrenched in the fourth quarter of 1997 were

re-employed  by March 1998.  This was significantly  lower  than

the  72% re-employment rate of those who were retrenched in  the

previous two quarters.  Retrenched workers with higher education

and  skills generally enjoyed better re-employment prospects  as

compared to those with lower education and skills.  The Ministry

will continue to monitor the retrenchment situation closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in number of workers being retrenched is not

unexpected.   In fact, in anticipation of this, my Ministry  had

in late February set up a Tripartite Panel on Retrenched Workers

to prepare for this eventuality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel comprises representatives from the Ministry of

Manpower  (MOM),  EDB,  PSB, NTUC, and  the  Singapore  National

Employers' Federation (SNEF).  I am pleased to inform the  House

that the Panel has completed its deliberations and has submitted

its  recommendations.  As announced during a press  briefing  on

26th   June   1998,  my  Ministry  has  accepted   the   Panel's

recommendations  and will implement them with  effect  from  1st

July 1998.  Sir, let me highlight the key recommendations of the

Panel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to minimise retrenchment, the Panel recommended that a

Retrenchment Advisory Programme involving MOM, EDB,  PSB,  NTUC,

and  SNEF be implemented.  Under the Advisory Service Programme,

companies   with   excess   manpower   and   are   contemplating

retrenchment would be encouraged to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>

provide  advance  information to any of these agencies  so  that

appropriate  advice on the various alternatives to  retrenchment

could  be  given.  These alternatives include the implementation

of  shorter  workweek and temporary lay-off, making use  of  the

flexible  wage system to reduce cost and avoid retrenchment,  as

well as sending of their workers for subsidized training through

the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) during the lull period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Retrenchment Advisory Programme, companies with

surplus  manpower  can approach any of the participating  agency

which  they are most comfortable in dealing with, so  that  they

could  be  better informed of the alternatives to  retrenchment,

including the training grants available under the SRP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tripartite Panel has also recommended that an

Employment  Assistance  Programme  be  implemented   to   assist

retrenched  workers seeking re-employment as soon  as  possible.

The Programme consists of an integrated job placement system  to

enable various agencies (MOM, EDB, SNEF, NTUC, and companies) to

pool   job  vacancies  into  the  job  bank  of  the  Ministry's

Employment Service Department so that the Department would be in

a  better  position  to  assist retrenched  workers  secure  re-employment expeditiously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help retrenched workers secure alternative

employment and at the same time enhance their employability, low-skilled  retrenched workers will be offered appropriate training

under  SRP  for higher value-added jobs.  This will enhance  the

employability  of such workers and make them less vulnerable  to

future  retrenchments.  To better assist retrenched  workers  in

securing re-employment, companies are therefore urged to  notify

the Employment Service Department of their job vacancies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Panel has also recommended that

information  on alternatives to retrenchment and  how  employers

could carry out retrenchment responsibly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>

be  made  available  to  companies.   For  workers  affected  by

retrenchment,  they would need to be advised on how  they  could

secure  re-employment expeditiously and cope with the situation.

For  this  purpose, the Ministry has produced two pamphlets  for

distribution:  one  targeting at  companies  and  the  other  at

retrenched workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the implementation of the Committee's recommendation

will   result   in  more  effective  employment  assistance   to

retrenched  workers.   Further, low skilled  retrenched  workers

will  be  given the opportunity under the SRP to take up  higher

skilled jobs and this will enhance their employability.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek an answer from

the  Minister  of  State  to  two questions  that  I  have  been

attempting  to ask and my Party has asked.  Firstly,  would  the

Minister tell us in what form the monitoring of retrenchment  of

workers  is done or how does it take place?  And secondly,  will

the  Minister  tell  us whether his Ministry  is  aware  of  the

practice  of  some companies to retrench Singapore  workers  and

take on foreign workers at much lower wages?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the first question is

on how retrenchments take place.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How do you monitor the retrenchment

situation?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> As I have mentioned earlier

in my reply, we have set up this Committee.  This Committee will

give  advisory notice to the employers to approach  the  various

agencies which they are comfortable with in dealing with details

of retrenchments that are being proposed, particularly when they

have  excess workers.  And we would expect that these  companies

would  then approach any of the agencies which I have mentioned,

whether  it  is  MOM, EDB, SNEF, NTUC, and let  them  know  what

excess workers they have and what are their plans, whether there

are  retrenchments, and we will provide them assistance.  At the

same  time, companies sometimes give notice either to the unions

under the Collective Agreement when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>

they  propose  to undertake retrenchments or they  approach  the

Ministry  of  Manpower  to seek advice  when  they  have  excess

workers and how they want to proceed to deal with them.  This is

how we continue to monitor the situation on retrenchments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second question, I think the retrenchments have

been fairly even and usually retrenchment exercises are done  in

proportion   to  the  existing  workforce.   That   means,   the

retrenchment is reflective of the proportion of foreign  workers

and  local  workers.  So I do not think there is any attempt  to

replace  one category with another.  But let me also  say  this,

Sir.   Employers  cannot be expected to  just  lay  off  foreign

workers  first as most companies need Singaporeans  as  well  as

foreign workers to remain competitive.  The key issue is  really

whether  our companies continue to be competitive.   Because  if

they  are competitive, particularly under the current situation,

they  will be able to do well.  And if they do well, they create

more employment.  In this case, when they do that, they will  be

able  to attract more workers into their companies.  So I  think

there  is no special case of retrenchment of locals in order  to

recruit foreign workers.  I think they have retrenched according

to the proportion of the nationalities in the workforce.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Will the Minister of

State  publicise the availability of the various training grants

to the public so as to facilitate people to upgrade themselves?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Yes, we will definitely

publicise  the availability of training grants.  In fact,  as  I

mentioned  in  my  reply, we have prepared two  pamphlets.   One

pamphlet  is  for  retrenched workers and it  is  called  "I  am

retrenched:  What can I do?"  This pamphlet contains information

on  the various training assistance and re-employment assistance

programmes that are available to retrenched workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I do not know whether the Minister fully

understood   my  question.   I  understood  him  to   say   that

retrenchment will be in proportion to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>

quota.   That  is not my question.  My question is simply  this.

Is  the Ministry aware that Singapore workers are being got  rid

of  and, in their place, foreign workers are being taken in?  It

is  not  a  question that they do not need them.  They need  the

workers,  but they are replacing Singapore workers with  foreign

workers.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> As I replied earlier,

firstly, as far as we have monitored the situation, retrenchment

is  according  to  the proportion of foreign workers,  which  is

reflective of the composition of the workforce.  Secondly, there

are  dependency  ceilings in the companies, in  so  far  as  the

number of foreign workers that they can employ.  So long as they

do  not  breach  the dependency ceiling, the  problem  does  not

arise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can

the  Minister of State give an assurance to the House that  non-unionised workers and unionised workers who are retrenched  will

be given the same kind of assistance by the Ministry?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Yes, certainly. For non-unionised workers, if they have problems, they can approach the

Ministry's Employment Service Department.  At the same time, the

pamphlets,  which  are  being produced for  retrenched  workers,

apply  to  both  the  unionised as  well  as  the  non-unionised

workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I get a clarification from the

Minister  of  State?  He says that the retrenchment  of  workers

will  be  in  proportion to the nationalities of the  workforce.

But not long ago in this House, I heard that the retrenchment of

workers  depends on the skills of the workers.  Supposing  there

are  a  Singaporean worker and a foreign worker.  If the foreign

worker  is more skilful, the Singapore worker will be retrenched

first.  Is that not the position?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> First, let me clarify.

What I said was that retrenchment has been done in proportion to

the  nationalities of the workers in the workforce.  But  coming

to a more specific situation, when you have a retrenchment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>

in  a  company, the company then decides, within the  dependency

ceiling  and the proportion of the foreign workforce which  they

have, who should go first.  And I think the key point is that we

want  the companies to continue to be competitive.  If they want

to  be competitive, they require good and skilled workers and in

such  a  situation, they will want to maintain workers who  have

good  skills and work attitudes and, therefore, they will decide

which  of  the two workers should go.  On a specific  case,  the

company  will decide who they want to retain and who should  go.

In that case, the position is that they would want to retain the

good workers regardless of their nationality.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I get a further clarification? You

are  talking about a specific instance.  But in a case,  say,  a

factory which produces chips and it has a whole batch of foreign

workers  whose  skills are very good, will this whole  batch  of

workers be retained and an equivalent number of Singaporeans  be

retrenched?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Firstly, the company will

have  to  watch  what is the dependency ceiling,  ie,  how  many

foreign  workers in proportion to local workers.  So it  has  to

keep  this  dependency ceiling and there is this safeguard.   It

cannot  have all its workers who are all foreigners  because  it

will  then break the dependency ceiling.  So it depends on  what

is  the  approval that has been given for it to recruit  foreign

workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  whether he can tell us how many companies  or  workers

are  now on short work week or temporary lay-off as a result  of

the financial crisis.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

have  the information as of now.  If he files a question I  will

provide him the answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, does the retrenchment figure that we

have  learned  include  workers in all  types  of  companies  or

companies of different sizes or only companies of certain sizes?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> These are figures which

have  been  reported  to us.  There may be  companies  with  few

workers which may not have reported to us.  But, generally, this

is quite a comprehensive figure.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask

the  Minister of State whether the dependency ratio he mentioned

is always in favour of the Singaporean workers?  In other words,

if a company were to retrench one Singaporean worker and, by the

dependency ratio, it may have to retrench three or four  foreign

workers.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> It depends, because some

companies  have  foreign workers who are  below  the  dependency

ceiling.   So although the dependency ceiling in some cases  are

40% - for the services sector it is 25% - but they may have more

Singapore workers than foreign workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to seek

two  points  of  clarification.  On  this  issue  of  a  company

retrenching Singaporean workers and replacing them with  cheaper

foreign  workers, am I right to say that, firstly, if a  company

were  to retrench workers and, immediately following that,  were

to  replace  them  with  workers,  whether  foreign  workers  or

Singaporean workers, to do the same job, then this will  violate

the understanding of retrenchment and that the NTUC can actually

bring  up  the  case  to the Ministry of Manpower  and  it  will

actually investigate into these cases?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to seek clarification from the Minister that,

according  to a previous survey conducted by economic  agencies,

such  as  EDB,  it  was  established  that,  having  taken  into

consideration the foreign worker levy and the cost of housing in

Singapore,  the foreign workers, on the average,  will  actually

cost  20%  more than the Singaporean  workers.  One  reason  why

companies  are  going for more foreign workers  is  not  because

foreign  workers on the whole are cheaper but rather because  of

the  shortage  of Singaporean workers.  I would  appreciate  the

Minister's confirmation on these two points.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> I can certainly confirm the

two  points.   If  there are cases where  NTUC  feels  that  the

companies are unfair, it can always report the situation to  the

Ministry  of Manpower.  And I have mentioned earlier, under  the

Advisory  Programme, companies will discuss with  us  what  they

intend  to  do  when they have excess manpower.  So  once  these

recommendations are implemented, I think the situation that  the

Member has described in the first part of his question will  not

arise.   On the second point about the cost of workers, I  agree

that, with the various charges and cost of housing, it may  well

be more expensive for companies to recruit foreign workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister of State a final

question and that is this: Are we to understand that so long  as

the  company  has room for more foreign workers, that  is,  when

they  have  not  filled their quota, then the Ministry  turns  a

blind  eye  to  them dismissing Singapore workers and  replacing

them with foreign workers?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> If they are within the

dependency ratio, they can always recruit foreign workers.   But

under the Advisory Programme for employers that we are going  to

implement,  we  will discuss with them the excess  manpower,  if

they have, at the point of retrenchment and to advise them to go

for  other  measures other than retrenchment.  So the answer  to

the question is that we want to make sure that our companies are

competitive  and, if they are to be competitive, there  must  be

certain flexibility given to the companies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister of State

to clarify the clarification that has been given to Mr Lim.  Can

I  have a clarification that the situation, spoken by Mr Lim, is

in  fact in the case where there are insufficient workers?  What

we  are  talking now is that there are more than enough workers.

So  the  situation  of employing foreign workers  who  are  more

expensive does not apply.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> I think some companies

still need foreign workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Even when it is not competitive?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> It is a question of the

skills of the workers.  If the workers are skilful, then  it  is

relative,  and it is the quality of the workers that they  want.

And  if they do not have this type of workers in Singapore, they

may need foreign workers although they may be more expensive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> We are talking about a case of

retrenchment.   In  other  words, there  are  more  than  enough

workers.   There are not enough jobs to go round.  This  is  the

situation we are talking about. Therefore, the situation that Mr

Lim  stated does not apply, because he said that there  are  not

enough  workers  and  you have to pay 20% more  to  house  these

foreign  workers.   But our situation now is  different.   Am  I

right?  So his situation does not apply.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> In fact, under the SRP, we

are  trying  to get Singapore workers to be trained.   So  those

workers  who  are retrenched, they go under the  SRP  programme.

Some  of  the workers will then be employed by these  companies.

There  are  examples where certain companies, like International

Video  Products, have retrenched workers and some of  them  went

under  the SRP, and they were able to work in wafer fab  plants,

and  so  on.  But there may be situations, I think we are really

talking about hypothetical cases, where they could not get these

workers  and  they may still need skilled workers and  therefore

they  will continue to recruit.  But with these skilled workers,

the  plant is able to operate and it becomes competitive.   This

in turn creates more jobs for Singapore workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, may I also follow up with the

clarification  from  Mr Chiam See Tong?  I would  like  to  seek

further clarification from the Minister of State.  On this issue

of  retrenching workers, is it right to say that some  companies

are  not  able  to focus on retrenching foreign workers  for  at

least  two reasons?  Firstly, it is the skills.  As the Minister

of  State  mentioned,  because there  are  foreign  workers  who

possess the skill which the local workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>

do  not  have.  Secondly, is it right to say that many companies

find that Singaporean workers are not prepared to work in a  12-hour  shift and, as a result, the third shift, ie, the  midnight

shift,  has to depend a lot on foreign workers?  Even at a  time

like  this,  they  have  no choice but to continue  to  retrench

workers through a combination of Singaporean workers and foreign

workers.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Yes, I can certainly

confirm that.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, can I ask the

Minister  of State whether the dependency ratio can be  adjusted

downwards so that we can take in more Singaporeans now that more

Singaporeans are willing to perform that kind of job at a  lower

wage level?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> For the time being, I do

not think we need to do that.  In companies where the dependency

ratio  is  high,  these  are basically  construction  companies,

Singapore  workers  do not want that job anyway.   So  you  will

still  need  to allow for a high dependency ratio, particularly,

in  industries where Singapore workers are reluctant to work in.

So it may not really change the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government embarked on a fundamental review

of  its  policies towards the financial sector, with a  view  to

developing  Singapore as a major financial centre in  Asia,  and

globally.   The  review included re-examining the  role  of  the

Monetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS) and that of its Board  of

Directors.

<br><br><i>Financial Sector Promotion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, MAS has focused on promoting monetary stability

for sustainable economic growth, regulating the financial sector

to   ensure  its  soundness,  and  acting  as  the  Government's

financial  agent.  It has also played a developmental role  with

regard   to  the  financial  sector.   Under  MAS'  stewardship,

Singapore's financial sector has seen dramatic growth  over  the

last 25 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot simply extrapolate this success into the

future.   The global financial industry is in ferment.   Falling

regulatory  barriers, advances in information technology  and  a

tidal   wave  of  mergers  are  integrating  financial  markets.

Financial  activities are consolidating in  fewer  centres,  and

competition is intense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thrive and grow in this bracing environment, we need a

change  in  approach.  MAS needs to build  up  a  much  stronger

promotion  capability.  To this end, MAS has formed  a  separate

Financial  Sector Promotion Department to focus its  efforts  in

developing  the  financial  industry.   Besides  attracting  new

activities, players and products, this department will carry out

manpower  and IT planning for the financial sector  as  well  as

design and implement incentive schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to include financial sector promotion as

one  of  MAS'  principal  objects.  This  is  to  recognise  the

importance of this function, and signal to  the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>

industry  MAS'  commitment  to  a proactive  role  in  promoting

Singapore's financial services sector.

<br><br><i>Size of the MAS Board</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS Act currently limits the size of the MAS Board to

seven  directors. At the moment, there are six directors serving

on  the Board, and one more will be appointed on 1st July, in  a

few  days' time.  It would be useful to have the flexibility  to

appoint  a slightly larger Board, in order to benefit  from  the

experience  of  a  wider  group  of  individuals.   This   would

strengthen  MAS  as an organisation and support its  efforts  to

promote Singapore as a world-class financial centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to raise the maximum number of directors

from  seven to 10.  In line with this enlargement, the Bill also

recommends redefining the quorum for Board meetings so that  the

quorum would at least constitute a simple majority of the number

of directors serving on the Board.

<br><br><i>Criteria for MAS Board Members</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its founding in 1971, MAS has assumed oversight of

various  segments of the financial services industry,  including

insurance  in  1977 and securities in 1984.   In  addition,  new

activities   such  as  financial  futures  trading   have   been

introduced, which now come under MAS' purview.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS Act currently disqualifies directors and salaried

officials  of banks from serving on the MAS Board.  However,  it

does  not  disqualify  those involved in  the  other  activities

supervised by MAS from serving on the Board.  The Bill  proposes

to  rectify  this  omission and extend the  disqualification  to

directors  and salaried officials of all financial  institutions

licensed or approved by MAS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, for giving me this opportunity.  Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal aim of the MAS has been and will always be to

act  as  a  central bank of Singapore, as well as the  financial

agent of the Government.  And it is to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>

credit  of  this body that we have sound fiscal policies,  sound

monetary  management and Members would welcome,  as  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister  has pointed out, to include  one  more  mission

statement, which is to foster a sound and progressive  financial

services sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two areas which I would like to raise. When

the first Bill was read a Second time in this House in September

1970,  the then Finance Minister said that the issue of currency

notes would be left to the Currency Board.  I wonder whether the

Government  is  going  to change this and  bring  the  issue  of

currency notes within the purview of the MAS in the near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern that I have is this. I support the

Government's  move to increase  the membership of the  Board  of

Directors, but I am a little worried on one count.  There is now

a  new requirement of a minimum of four members.   I think  four

is  too  few.   I  think we should be a bit more  flexible.   We

should  have a minimum of six to a maximum of nine, and I  would

urge  the  Deputy  Prime Minister to consider  appointing  Board

members  from the private sector.  It is very important to  have

private sector inputs in our financial management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the Government's move to appoint Mr J. Y.

Pillay  from  1st July.  I think he would, with his  experience,

contribute immensely to the MAS.  And as I have said earlier,  I

hope   the  Government  will  consider  appointing  people  from

outside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I am concerned with is this. There

is no definition of "financial institution" in the Bill.  I know

it  will  take into consideration financial managers.  Would  it

include insurance brokers, moneylenders, pawnbrokers, because it

is  a very wide definition?  I think it would be wise if the DPM

could state to the House what are the institutions that will  be

covered.   In any case, I applaud the DPM because it shows  that

we  are  very  transparent and we do not  want  people  who  are

involved in this sector to sit in judgment as a Board member.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our financial sector has grown considerably. Our

foreign  exchange  dealings per day are in the  tune  of  US$190

billion.   The fund management is also on the increase  and  the

Bill  before the House is timely, especially in view of the fact

that the recommendations have been made by a Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, and with the questions that I have raised

earlier, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, if I may respond to the

points.   First,  on  the  issue of  currency  notes.   No,  the

Government has no plans to transfer this responsibility from the

Board  of  Commissioners of Currency to MAS.   The  MAS  remains

technically not quite a central bank, because it does not  issue

currency and we have a currency board system which has served us

well.  I think there is no reason to change it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Board Members, the Member has suggested that we should

look  for  some more members from the private sector.   I  agree

with  him.   It  was  precisely with this  in  mind  that  I  am

proposing to increase the size of the Board.  The difficulty, of

course, is finding the right persons to serve on the Board,  but

we are actively looking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on definition of "financial institutions", I

believe there is no definition in the Bill, but basically  these

are  the institutions which are regulated and supervised by MAS.

So  if  we  supervise the insurance industry or the stockbroking

industry,  executives in those companies which  come  under  our

jurisdiction will be excluded from sitting.  I think it  is  not

quite  straightforward to pin down exactly where the  boundaries

of  financial services are.  The field is growing very  rapidly.

Things  like futures exchanges, for example, did not exist  when

we last amended the Act, and we have had to include them.  So  I

think we just leave it as financial institutions and it will  be

clear which are the ones which come under MAS' purview.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>BANKING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International financial markets have over the years become

more  interdependent, as a result of technological advancements,

competition  and  the  increased  scale  and  sophistication  of

financial  players.  Disturbances in one market are  transmitted

rapidly  to other markets, as the spread of the Asian  financial

crisis  in the last year illustrated.  Large banks and financial

institutions are managing their exposures and risks on a  global

basis, wherever they operate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trend towards increased globalisation in financial

activity  underscores  the  need for  closer  cooperation  among

supervisory   authorities  in  protecting  the   integrity   and

soundness  of  their  financial  markets,  as  well  as  of  the

international financial system.  This is all the more  important

for Singapore, which as an international financial centre, has a

large  number of foreign banks.  The MAS must therefore be  able

to   engage   in  coordinated,  global  supervision   with   its

counterparts  in other countries, to strengthen the  supervision

of  large international banks and safeguard the stability of the

financial system.

<br><br><i>Inspection by Foreign Supervisory Authorities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking Act was amended in 1996 to include a new

section  45A to allow foreign supervisory authorities to inspect

their  banks' operations in Singapore, which was until then  not

permitted.   This was to enable home supervisory authorities  to

exercise  effective consolidated supervision over  their  banks'

global operations. To safeguard the confidentiality of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>

customer information, a foreign supervisory authority is allowed

to  inspect  its banks' operations if it provides  MAS  with  an

undertaking not to divulge the information to other parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several supervisory authorities have been unable to

undertake  to  MAS  that they will not divulge  the  information

obtained to a third party under any circumstances, as they could

be  compelled under their domestic laws to disclose  information

held  by  them to their courts or legislature. Hence, under  the

current Act, they cannot inspect their banks here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major international financial centres, such as the US,

the   UK,   Hong  Kong  and  Australia  allow  home  supervisory

authorities  to  inspect  foreign  banks  operating   in   their

jurisdictions.  These countries impose conditions which are less

stringent than Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking (Amendment) Bill proposes to amend section 45A

to  enable  foreign supervisory authorities, or bodies appointed

by  them,  to inspect the Singapore branches of their  banks  if

they   provide   a   written   undertaking   to   maintain   the

confidentiality  of the information obtained, as  determined  by

MAS.    This  will  allow  inspections  by  foreign  supervisory

authorities which are conducted solely for supervisory purposes.

The  written  undertaking is to ensure that foreign  supervisory

authorities do not disclose information obtained from inspecting

their banks here, unless compelled by their laws. The Bill  will

also amend the conditions under which foreign banks in Singapore

may disclose to their parent supervisory authorities information

on  credit facilities granted. Currently they may do so only  if

the  supervisory authority does not divulge the  information  to

any third party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign supervisory authorities will, however, still be

prohibited  from accessing information on deposits  and  private

banking accounts during the on-site examinations.  Also, foreign

banks  will  still be disallowed from disclosing information  on

deposits   and   private  banking  accounts  to   their   parent

supervisory authorities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Disclosure of information on borrowers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Banking Act allows MAS to provide

information  on the operations of a foreign bank to  the  parent

supervisory  authority, but not the particulars of a  customer's

account.  This Bill proposes to allow MAS to provide information

on  particulars  of credit facilities granted by  the  Singapore

branch,   to   parent   supervisory  authorities,   solely   for

supervisory  purposes.  Such information on credit  exposure  is

necessary  for  foreign supervisory authorities  to  assess  the

asset  quality  of their banks on a global basis.   However,  no

information on deposit and private banking accounts  of  foreign

banks  in  Singapore  will  be provided  to  parent  supervisory

authorities, even with the amendment.

<br><br><i>Real-Time Gross Settlement System</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second main amendment proposed in the Bill is to

provide  for the introduction of the Real-Time Gross  Settlement

(RTGS)   system.   Every  day,  large  amounts  of   money   are

transferred through interbank payment systems around the  world.

It  is  estimated  that in the G-10 countries  alone  the  daily

turnover of the main payment systems is more than US$5 trillion.

Many   of   these  payments  are  to  settle  financial   market

transactions  between the banks themselves,  such  as  interbank

loans or foreign exchange deals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been increased recognition that

the   way  many  of  the  payment  systems  worked  exposed  the

participating banks to large risks, with potential repercussions

for the financial system as a whole. If one bank were to fail to

meet  its  obligations for whatever reason, other banks  in  the

system  could  face  liquidity  problems  or  even  fail  as   a

consequence  of  these interbank exposures.   Because  of  these

concerns,  countries  have  been taking  action  to  make  their

payment   systems  more  robust.  The  Bank  for   International

Settlements (BIS), an international institution which  seeks  to

promote   central  bank  cooperation  and  foster  international

financial  stability, has strongly encouraged all  countries  to

introduce RTGS systems.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to allow MAS to establish and operate an

RTGS  system  in Singapore.  The RTGS system will be implemented

on  13th  July.  It will replace the existing interbank  payment

system called SHIFT which was established in 1985.  SHIFT is  an

electronic payment system that settles interbank payments  on  a

net  basis  at the end of the day.  This means that all  payment

instructions are accumulated throughout the day and at  the  end

of  day,  the  net  obligation for each  bank  is  computed  and

settled.  This gives rise to a risk to the whole banking system.

Should   one  bank  not  have  sufficient  funds  to  meet   its

obligations  at the end of the day, all the payments  that  have

been  accumulated  during the day may have to  be  unwound,  and

other banks may be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the RTGS system, payment instructions between banks

are  processed  and settled individually and continually  during

the  day, subject to the paying bank having sufficient funds  in

its current account maintained with MAS.  Once settled, the Bill

provides  that  the  payment  is  final  and  irrevocable.   The

receiving  bank is thus assured of good value for the funds  and

can  use  the funds immediately without being exposed  to  risk.

The  RTGS  system  therefore reduces the chances  of  settlement

failure in one bank affecting other banks, thereby also reducing

systemic risk. The Bill also contains provisions to ensure  that

the  stability  of  the  system is not unduly  affected  by  the

insolvency of any single bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RTGS system will thus enhance the stability of

Singapore's  financial system. RTGS systems  have  been  or  are

being implemented in many developed financial markets, including

the  US,  the  UK, Switzerland, Germany, Japan,  Hong  Kong  and

Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common for central banks to own and operate interbank

payment  systems  as they have responsibility for  ensuring  the

efficient  operation of payment systems, which is  critical  for

the  smooth  functioning of the financial system.  Some  central

banks  that operate their respective countries' payment  systems

are the US Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, German

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>

Bundesbank, Banque de France and Bank of Italy.  Others such  as

Hong  Kong and the United Kingdom have set up separate companies

to operate their RTGS systems, but under central bank control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, MAS will be protected from liability

arising from operating the RTGS system, except where it involves

a  reckless  act or omission, or intentional misconduct  on  the

part  of MAS.  This is similar to the RTGS systems in Hong  Kong

and  the  United  Kingdom.  The RTGS system will  apply  to  the

transfer  and  settlement  of book-entry  securities  and  other

instruments in addition to payment obligations.

<br><br><i>Priority of Repayment of Balance of Stored Value Cards</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another proposed amendment concerns the issue of stored

value  cards,  such as the CashCard, by banks.  Presently  under

the  Banking Act, in the event a bank winds up, non-bank deposit

liabilities  which  are subject to maintenance  of  reserve  and

liquidity  requirements  are  accorded  first  priority  in  the

repayment of the bank's unsecured liabilities.  As the  proceeds

received by a bank from the issue of stored value cards are akin

to deposits, the Bill proposes to accord similar priority to the

balance of such proceeds as well. Stored value card holders will

therefore   receive  first  priority,  together  with   non-bank

depositors, for repayment in the event of a winding up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the very

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Customs Act to provide for a

customs station along the railway line, in lieu of the Singapore

Railway Station at Keppel Road, as the place of import or export

by  rail.   It  also  amends the Customs  Act  to  include  Tuas

Checkpoint as an additional customs station.

<br><br><i>Rationale</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Customs Act provides for Singapore customs

clearance  of dutiable goods by rail to be carried  out  at  the

Singapore  Railway  Station at Keppel Road.  The  Bill  replaces

this with a general provision for Singapore customs clearance by

rail to be carried out at a station to be designated.  This will

provide flexibility in the designation of a customs station  and

obviate  the need to change the Customs Act for such a  purpose.

Further,  as  the Customs Act already allows the flexibility  to

designate  the customs station for import and export by  air  or

sea,  this change will also rationalize the expressions for  the

place of import and export by the various modes of transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st August 1998, the Singapore Customs, Immigration

and Quarantine (CIQ) clearance facilities will be relocated from

the Keppel Road Train Station to the Woodlands Train Checkpoint.

Following  the amendment to the Customs Act, we will proceed  to

designate and gazette the Woodlands Train Checkpoint as the  new

customs station for Singapore customs clearance in lieu  of  the

Keppel Road Train Station.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs (Amendment) Bill also provides for an

additional customs station at Tuas for the import and export  by

road,  which can be done only via the road checkpoints,  namely,

the Woodlands Checkpoint and Tuas Checkpoint.

Proposed Amendments

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes the following amendments to the Customs Act:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to amend sections 3, 31, 34, 37, 39, 41, 45 and 52 to

provide that dutiable goods must be imported or exported by rail

at  a  customs  station along the railway to be designated,  and

that  goods on arrival at that customs station cannot be removed

except  in  accordance  with a permit issued  by  the  Director-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to amend sections 34 and 37 to provide for an

additional  customs  station  at  Tuas  for  goods  imported  or

exported by road.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br><i>Aim</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aim of this Bill is to amend the Motor Vehicles

(Third-Party  Risks  and  Compensation)  Act  to   ensure   that

Singapore  registered and insured vehicles travelling into  West

Malaysia  are  covered for third party liability  insurance  and

that  the  benefits  of third party victims  of  road  accidents

caused  by  the use of Singapore vehicles in West  Malaysia  are

preserved.

<br><br><i>Background</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and

Compensation) Act, victims of accidents have a right to look  to

the  insured's  insurers  if  the insured  fails  to  satisfy  a

judgement  entered against him.  The Act also provides  for  the

vesting of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>

the  insured's rights against his insurer in the third party  if

the insured is made a bankrupt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the recent Court of Appeal case, Nippon Fire &

Marine  Insurance  Co Ltd v Sim Jin Hwee, the  Court  of  Appeal

ruled  that  a passenger in a Singapore registered  and  insured

motor  vehicle involved in an accident in West Malaysia  has  no

right  to  claim against the insurers directly under  the  Motor

Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court made this ruling on the premise that Singapore

laws  generally are not extra-territorial in scope unless it  is

expressly  provided.   Where a motor  accident  occurs  in  West

Malaysia, the benefits provided for in the Act do not extend  to

victims  of such accidents.  The benefits in the Act only  apply

to motor accidents occurring in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Implications of the Court's Ruling</i>

<br><i>Recovery against insurers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Court has ruled that the passenger has no

right to sue the insurer under the Act, the Court's ruling  does

not  affect  the victim's right to recover indirectly  from  the

insurer  if  the policy is valid as a contract at  the  date  of

judgement.  This indirect recovery route means that the  insured

driver  will  have to sue the insurer on the contract  of  motor

insurance  and  any  monies recovered by the  insured  from  the

insurer will then become available for payment by the insured to

the victim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nippon's case, the policy that was issued covered the

use  of  the  Singapore-registered and insured vehicle  in  West

Malaysia.  However, as the insured driver is now a bankrupt, the

passenger  must  rely  on  the  Official  Assignee  to  make   a

contractual claim against the insurer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Court of Appeal's ruling not only

applies  to  passengers  but also to every  victim  of  a  motor

accident  on  a  Malaysian road involving a car  registered  and

insured  in Singapore.  Such victims would, as a consequence  of

the  Court's ruling, have no right to sue the Singapore insurers

directly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Court's ruling is not in the public

interest  as  it means that victims of motor accidents  have  to

resort to indirect means in order to claim against the insurers.

This  will  cause  victims and the estates of  deceased  victims

unnecessary  expense  and  delay.  In Nippon's  case,  it  would

reduce  the  amount of damages payable to the injured  passenger

because  the insurance monies will have to be shared with  other

creditors of the bankrupt insured.

<br><br><i>Extraterritorial scope of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap. 189)</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, historically, when the Act was first

enacted  in  1938,  it was intended to cover the  use  of  motor

vehicles  in  Singapore and Malaysia when  both  countries  were

treated as a single territory under the British administration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, the scope of our Act has not changed even after

the constitutional changes which occurred during the period 1959

to  1965.  In fact, the Act still retains section 19(1)(f) which

indicates  that  the  legislative  intent  was  to  provide  for

compulsory  third  party liability insurance whenever  Singapore

registered motor vehicles are used in Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of Singapore insurers has always been to issue

insurance  policies which cover the use of Singapore  registered

vehicles  in  West  Malaysia.  The effect of such  an  insurance

policy  is to contractually extend the insurance coverage beyond

Singapore  in order to provide protection to third  parties  who

might  be  injured or killed by the use of the insured  vehicle.

In  this  way,  the practice is consistent with the  legislative

intent  to  provide the benefits of the Act to victims  of  road

accidents occurring in West Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear that the spirit and intent of the Act was

to  cover  the use of Singapore registered vehicles within  West

Malaysia.   Any  other interpretation would lead to  undesirable

consequences  and  subject innocent victims  of  road  accidents

occurring in West Malaysia to unnecessary expense and  delay  in

obtaining compensation for the injuries caused to them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary for the law to be amended to

restore  to victims of road traffic accidents caused by the  use

of  Singapore  vehicles in West Malaysia, the right  to  make  a

direct  claim against the insurers.  Nothing is served by making

an  injured  party or a deceased's estate go through unnecessary

legal  rigmarole  just  to get the insurers  to  pay  what  they

contractually have to pay under their insurance policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have therefore decided that these

issues should be put right by amending the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) (Amendment) Act.  As Malaysia  has

similar  legislation,  we have sought the  co-operation  of  the

relevant  authorities  in  Malaysia  to  similarly  amend  their

legislation.   I  have  written to  the  Malaysian  Minister  of

Transport, Tan Sri Dr Ling Liong Sik, and he has agreed that our

legislation  should be harmonised to safeguard the interests  of

motorists  and  do  not impede the movement of vehicles  between

Malaysia and Singapore.  Our officials will be meeting  soon  to

work out the details.

<br><br><i>Provisions of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) (Amendment) Act 1998</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight the key provisions of the Motor

Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill introduces new provisions and amends existing

provisions  to  the  Motor  Vehicles  (Third-Party   Risks   and

Compensation) Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 3(1) to extend the

extraterritorial  effect to motor insurance policies  issued  by

Singapore insurers to any territory specified in the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 also prohibits persons from using a motor vehicle

which  is  registered in Singapore unless the person is  covered

for  third-party risks which may be incurred by him  when  using

the motor vehicle in any territory specified in the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill introduces 2 new subsections, and

these are (1A) and (1B).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1A) deems any policy of insurance: issued on or

before  the  commencement of the Bill  by  an  insurer  who  was

lawfully carrying on motor insurance business in Singapore;  and

which  insures any person specified in the policy against third-party  risks  which may be incurred by him when  using  a  motor

vehicle in any territory specified in the Schedule, to have been

a  policy  of insurance issued for the purposes of the  Act  and

under which, third parties are conferred benefits by the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1A) reverses the Court of Appeal's ruling in

Nippon  Fire  &  Marine Insurance Co Ltd v.  Sim  Jin  Hwee  and

retrospectively confers the right of all affected persons to sue

Singapore insurers under the Act if a motor accident involving a

Singapore  registered  and  insured  vehicle  occurs   in   West

Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the new subsection (1B) provides that this

benefit,  or  the retrospective effect, does not extend  to  any

person  whose claim has, prior to the passing of the Bill,  been

held  by a Singapore Court not to give rise to an action against

a  Singapore  insurer.  What this does is that it preserves  the

decision of the Court of Appeal in Nippon's case and other cases

that the Courts have decided since that decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill inserts a new Schedule which specifies

the territory outside Singapore to which the new subsection (1A)

and  the  amended  section 3(1) apply.   West  Malaysia  is  the

territory  specified  in the Schedule and this  means  that  any

person  using  a Singapore registered vehicle in  West  Malaysia

must be covered by an insurance policy in respect of third party

risks as complies with the Act.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill restores the law governing motor insurance

coverage and the rights of road accident victims to the  way  it

was prior to the ruling of the Court of Appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL COMPUTER BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend the National Computer Board Act, which

I  will  refer  to as the NCB Act in short.  Firstly,  the  Bill

expands NCB's charter to develop the Information Technology  (or

IT)  industry  and  to carry out other functions  which  may  be

conferred  upon the Board under any written law.   Secondly,  it

removes    the   requirement   for   Ministry-or-agency-specific

appointees as members of the Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now describe the proposed amendments in greater

detail.

<br><br><i>NCB's Enlarged Role</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the transfer of NCB to the Ministry of Trade and

Industry,  NCB's  role  was enlarged  beyond  the  provision  of

computer-based services or data processing, as stipulated in the

existing  NCB  Act.  NCB is now also tasked to  develop  the  IT

industry  and  to harness IT to improve the performance  of  our

economic sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapid evolution in the IT environment has placed new

demands  on  NCB.  This is particularly evident in  the  rapidly

growing  area  of electronic commerce, where the marketplace  is

being  transformed and new enabling infrastructures and services

are needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One new role of NCB is that of the Controller of

Certification  Authorities,  as  set  forth  in   the   proposed

Electronic  Transactions Bill, which is also  before  the  House

today.  Clause 3 of the Bill amends

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>

section 11 of the Act to reflect NCB's enlarged role, and  other

new functions which it may assume in future.

<br><br><i>NCB's Board Composition</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow for greater flexibility in Board appointments,

clause  2 of the Bill amends section 5 of the Act to remove  the

requirement  that certain members of the Board be  appointed  to

represent specific Ministries or agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  proposed Amendment Bill on NCB's charter, at first  glance,

looks  innocently simple and, that is, NCB is  now  to  promote,

with  the  amendment, Information Technology instead of computer

science.    As  the  Minister  has  rightly  pointed  out,   the

definition of Information Technology now is very wide.  As such,

the  amendment  would open up tremendously the  scope  of  NCB's

mission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "Information Technology" nowadays encompasses a

whole  lot  of  technologies.   It  can  be  telecommunications,

computer software, mass media, Internet-related innovations,  e-commerce, etc.  Such convergence of technologies makes the  term

"Information Technology" very much generic in nature.  Hence,  I

would  like  to  question whether NCB is  embarking  on  such  a

challenging  task  of covering the wide range  of  technologies,

especially in this amendment, it is stated that it is  doing  it

without budget implication.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that, currently, the National Science and

Technology Board (NSTB) and Economic Development Board (EDB) are

all  involved in the promotion of IT industry.  To many  people,

it  appears  that there is much overlapping between these  three

agencies.  Any interested investor or entrepreneur in IT may  be

confused  about  whom  to approach.  With  this  amendment,  the

presumption  would be NCB would be playing the key  role  in  IT

promotion and development, while NSTB would be focusing on other

non-IT R&D, and EDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>

would  be  concentrating on the manufacturing aspect of  the  IT

industry.  I hope the Minister can clarify this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Singapore, on many counts, should

have a vibrant IT industry.  Some countries, including the small

ones,  like Taiwan and Israel, are experiencing strong  economic

growth  partly  because they have built  up  their  IT  industry

earlier  than  we  did.  The need to diversify  our  traditional

business  is  a  must,  as highlighted by  BG  Yeo,  the  Second

Minister for Trade and Industry, not too long ago.  And there is

no  dispute  that  NCB has done a superb job  in  promoting  and

developing  world-class applications.  But this is  not  enough.

With  NCB  amending its charter, it can help to set priority  by

having  a  coordinating one-stop body to focus on  the  task  of

developing IT industry through working closely with the  venture

community,   research  laboratories,  industries   and   various

Ministries  and to identify what is lacking and take  aggressive

steps  to help develop the IT industry.  Although we are a  good

deal  away from having the critical mass, we can emulate  Israel

which has achieved amazing results in just a few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, NCB, with its new charter, should take up the

challenge to create an environment for our IT industry  to  grow

and prosper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Chuang Shaw

Peng  for  supporting the Bill and for making some very relevant

points.   It  is  true that IT is very wide; it is  generic  and

covers  a lot of areas, and it is also growing very fast.   That

is  why  the  Government  has  in fact  adopted  a  multi-agency

approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is really to give NCB the powers to

be more involved in the promotion of IT, especially in the areas

of setting up the IT infrastructure, developing software, and so

on.   But the task will not just be for NCB alone, but also EDB,

NSTB and others.  For example, EDB is involved in promoting  the

computer manufacturing sector, disk drives, and so on.   So  all

the hardware, that basically is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>

under  EDB.  And increasingly, EDB is also approaching companies

to  do software and they have got all the offices overseas.   So

by  having  both  NCB and EDB under my Ministry, it  facilitates

coordination.  At a higher level, there is a Committee known  as

the  National IT Committee, chaired by Minister Teo  Chee  Hean,

and  this  coordinates policies at the broad level.   Also,  the

agencies  hold  regular  dialogues  and  exchanges  among  their

working level committees to coordinate issues at the operational

level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned the National Science and

Technology  Board.  NSTB also plays a role in  this  area.   But

NSTB's role is mainly to do with R&D on a very broad basis.   So

where  it  concerns IT, they are of course involved in  the  R&D

aspects.  NSTB is under my Ministry.  So there is no problem  of

coordination.  The essential point of this change is to  broaden

the  scope of NCB so that it is not just a provider of  computer

services to the Government, which was its original role, but  to

broaden it and recognise that IT is a very big industry, and  to

put  the  focus  on  development  of  mainly  the  software  and

infrastructural  aspects on NCB.  In  so  doing,  they  will  of

course  have  to work with all the relevant agencies,  including

the   Ministry   of  Communications,  on  the  telecommunication

aspects.   NCB  and  the other agencies will  be  provided  with

adequate  funding  for their purposes.  Already  the  funds  are

provided  in  the budget and, if need be, there could  be  other

funds provided.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of electronic commerce, or e-commerce for

short,   is   transforming  the  way  businesses  are  conducted

globally.   The  possibilities and opportunities are  limitless.

Leading  Internet research companies such as ActivMedia and  IDC

have  projected worldwide Internet sales to reach the  order  of

US$200-300 billion by the year 2001.  There is little doubt that

e-commerce  will become an important engine of  growth  for  the

global economy in the next millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to be plugged into this global development and

position Singapore as an international e-commerce hub.  The  aim

is  for Singapore to play the role of a secure and trusted  node

where  e-commerce transactions from the region  and  around  the

world are processed.  To do so, a pre-requisite is to provide  a

conducive  legal  and policy framework.  We need  to  create  an

environment  of  trust,  predictability  and  certainty  in  the

Singapore  system, with good arbitration and good  jurisdiction,

for e-commerce to flourish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advent of e-commerce and the increasing use of the

digital medium have created some novel legal issues where  there

are  yet  no clear answers.  In the physical world today,  there

are  requirements for documents to be in writing and  for  hand-written  signatures.  Such requirements need  to  be  translated

into  the  electronic realm.  For communication and transactions

occurring over a faceless network, there is a need for  reliable

methods  to  authenticate a person's identity and to ensure  the

integrity  of  the  electronically transmitted  documents.   The

Electronic  Transactions  Bill aims to address  these  important

issues   and  to  create  the  legal  framework  for  e-commerce

transactions in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in drafting the Electronic Transactions

Bill, the following guiding principles were adopted:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The need to conform to international standards and

international models in order to be integrated with the global e-commerce framework;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The need to avoid over regulation;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The need to be flexible and technologically neutral to

adapt quickly to a fluid global environment; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The need for transparency and predictability in our

laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly, the Bill seeks to do the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Enact a Commercial Code to support e-commerce

transactions;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Provide for a Public Key Infrastructure;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Enable Electronic Applications and Licences for the

Public Sector; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Clarify Network Service Providers' liability for third

party content.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will describe each of these four objectives in turn.

<br><br><i>Commercial Code for E-commerce Transactions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clearly define the rights and obligations of transacting

parties,  we  need  a  commercial  code  to  support  e-commerce

transactions.  The first objective of the Bill is  thus  to  set

out  a  commercial  code  that combines  the  best  features  of

international  models such as the United Nations  Commission  on

International Trade Law's Model Law on Electronic  Commerce  and

the   Illinois  Electronic  Commerce  Security  Act.   The  Bill

contains  provisions dealing with how a contract can  be  formed

electronically, and the status and use of electronic  signatures

and records.

<br><br><i>Electronic Contracts</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on electronic contracts in general. While rules on

the  formation  of  contracts are clear in the  physical  world,

there  are  significant  ambiguities in  the  electronic  world.

There  is  therefore a need to enact legislative  provisions  to

clarify the rules of formation of electronic contracts.  Part IV

of the Bill clarifies that contracts can be made electronically.

It  also deals with the issues of time and place of sending  and

receipt of electronic messages.

<br><br><i>Electronic Records and Signatures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on electronic records and signatures. Part II of

the Bill clarifies that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>

electronic signatures have the same legal binding effect as that

of written signatures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transactions and submissions that are currently done and

signed  in  written  form can also be done in  electronic  form.

Nevertheless,  in  the generating and processing  of  electronic

records,  Parts II and IV of the Bill can be varied by agreement

between the parties to a transaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As e-commerce is still in an early stage of development, we

foresee  a period of time before the international scene settles

down.   As such, the provisions of the Bill should not  at  this

time   go  so  far  as  to  require  recognition  of  electronic

signatures  and  documents in place of physical forms  entirely.

There are certain classes of documents or transactions that  may

not  be  ready for such an immediate change.  Hence, insofar  as

Part II and Part IV of the Bill are concerned, it is provided in

clause 4 that in certain matters such as wills and documents  of

title,   the   electronic  records,  signatures   and   contract

provisions  do not apply.  This does not, however,  prevent  the

courts from recognising the use of electronic documents in these

matters  on  a  case-by-case  basis.   Eventually,  when  public

confidence  in electronic transactions grows, the  Bill  may  be

widened to include such documents.

<br><br><i>Secure Electronic Records and Signatures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on secure electronic records and signatures. We

recognise  that  in the digital world, there is no  face-to-face

interaction.    As   a   result,  issues  concerning   identity,

authenticity  and integrity arise.  One solution that  has  been

gaining popular support is the digital signature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A digital signature, when affixed to an electronic

document,  has  two essential properties.  It  confirms  that  a

document has not been tampered with since the time the signature

was  fixed.   It  also  identifies  the  person  who  fixed  the

signature.   Traditional hand-written signatures do not  perform

these  functions  with  the same degree  of  certainty.   It  is

therefore justifiable to afford some evidentiary presumptions on

digital  signatures and the documents on which they are affixed,

if  these  signatures are created in accordance  with  a  secure

procedure.  The Bill

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>

provides for this legal effect.  The use of such signatures will

supplement  the electronic contract rules that I have  described

earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill provides for the circumstances and

conditions under which electronic records and signatures are  to

be  treated as secure.  Parts VI and VII of the Bill  go  beyond

electronic  signatures to describe the legal effect  of  digital

signatures and the general duties relating to them.

<br><br><i>Public Key Infrastructure</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to the second objective

of the Bill which is to provide for a Public Key Infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generation and verification of digital signatures are

done  through cryptographic algorithms using a pair  of  private

and   public  keys  unique  to  an  individual.   A  Public  Key

Infrastructure,  consisting  of  Certification  Authorities   as

trusted third parties, needs to be set up to enable public  keys

to   be  issued  in  a  reliable  manner.   Singapore  has  been

developing such an infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this infrastructure, the Certification Authority

(CA),  certifies  that a given public key is associated  with  a

given  individual.  A CA may perform a face-to-face verification

of  the individual before such a certification is given, in  the

form   of   a   digital  certificate.   This   certificate   can

subsequently be used to confirm the public key of an individual,

and  verify  the signature that is generated by the  individual.

Netrust  is the first CA in Singapore to issue keys for  digital

signatures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CA, being in a position of trust, needs to be subject

to  some  standards and controls, so that there will  be  public

confidence in the services it offers.  These are set out in  the

general duties of the CAs prescribed in Part VIII of the Bill

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also corresponding duties on the subscribers of

such  CA  services.  These are set out in Part IX of  the  Bill.

These  duties will not create criminal offences, but  will  form

the basis on which courts may attach civil liabilities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>CA Licensing Scheme and Controller of CA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voluntary licensing scheme is proposed in the Bill. Only

licensed  and  approved  CAs  will enjoy  the  benefits  of  the

evidentiary presumptions that I described earlier for signatures

generated from the certificates issued.  The exception  to  this

is  where parties agree to be bound by signatures created  by  a

commercially reasonable procedure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed networks may continue to use unlicensed CAs for

their own purposes.  They may, however, also be licensed to gain

the full benefit of the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides in clause 41 for the appointment of a

Controller  of CAs.  The Controller will, amongst other  duties,

license, certify, monitor and oversee the activities of CAs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 42 further provides for regulations to be made

concerning  the  licensing and regulation  of  CAs  and  when  a

digital  signature  qualifies as a secure electronic  signature.

The Bill provides for different consequences in situations where

a CA is licensed as opposed to one where the CA is not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 45 of the Bill also provides for licensed CAs to

enjoy  the  limitation of liability for any loss caused  by  the

reliance on a false or forged digital signature of a subscriber,

as  long as the CA has complied with the requirements under  the

Act.   Foreign  CAs  recognised by  the  Controller  will  enjoy

similar  benefits.   This is known in the  industry  as  "cross-certification" and will facilitate cross-boundary e-commerce.

<br><br><i>Electronic Applications and Licences for the Public  Sector</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to now go on to the third

objective of the Bill, which is to provide for the acceptance of

electronic documents by the public sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote the use of the electronic medium in the public

sector,  the Bill will contain an omnibus provision in  Part  XI

for  Government  departments  and  statutory  boards  to  accept

electronic filing without having to amend their respective

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>

Acts.   It  also  allows  public bodies  to  issue  permits  and

licences electronically.  It is an "opt-in" provision,  so  that

those agencies that are not yet ready to go "paperless" are  not

compelled  to  do so.  However, the Government is  committed  to

making  available counter services in the electronic  medium  as

far as possible and where it is cost-effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 63 of the Bill makes a related amendment to the

Interpretation Act (Cap. 1) to allow regulations on  the  manner

and method of electronic filing and issuance to be made by these

public  bodies  under their respective Acts.  The amendments  to

the  definition  of "Gazette" and "Government  Gazette"  in  the

Interpretation  Act is to enable the Government to  publish  the

Gazette electronically on the Internet, in addition to the  hard

copies printed by the Government Printers.  The Government  will

take  advantage of Internet technology to enable the Gazette  to

be  published  electronically on a daily basis instead  of  only

once  a  week.  Details of the plans are currently being  worked

out and will be announced in due course by MITA.

<br><br><i>Network Providers' Liability</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the final objective of

the Bill regarding Network Providers' Liability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential for the growth of a national information

infrastructure  that we manage the exposure of  network  service

providers  to the risks of liabilities for third party  content.

For  example, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) should  not  be

held  liable for objectionable contents or defamatory statements

on  the thousands of web sites that are accessed daily, and over

which the ISP has no control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of Part III of the Bill provides that a network

service  provider is not subject to criminal or civil  liability

for  third party material for which the provider merely provides

access.   Where  network service providers engage in  activities

which  are indistinguishable from those of common carriers  such

as  telephone companies and post offices, they should  be  given

the  assurance  that they will be treated in  the  same  way  in

respect of such activities.  The clause, however, will not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>

affect  the obligations of a network service provider under  any

licensing or other regulatory regime established under the  law,

eg,  Singapore Broadcasting Authority's class licences.  It will

also  not  affect  any obligation founded  on  contract  or  any

obligation  imposed  under any written law  or  by  a  court  to

remove, block or deny access to any material.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Network service providers will of course continue to be

liable  for their own content, or third party content that  they

adopt or approve of.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this Bill will have a significant impact on the growth

of electronic commerce in Singapore, the views of the public and

of  experts in this field have been solicited when drafting  the

Bill.  Ministries, statutory boards, academics from the NUS  Law

Faculty,  as well as practising lawyers who are known for  their

expertise  in  technology  law were consulted.   Their  valuable

comments   and   inputs   have,   wherever   appropriate,   been

incorporated into the final version of the Bill now  before  the

House.  The National Computer Board also conducted a Round Table

Session for chief executives from the industry to brief them  on

the  salient features of the Bill and to gather their  feedback.

In  general, the feedback has been favourable and supportive  of

the new legal framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill sets the basic

legislative    framework   for   e-commerce    and    electronic

transactions.    It  removes  existing  legal  impediments   and

instills confidence in businesses and individuals to engage in e-commerce.   This Bill will bring Singapore to the  forefront  of

international e-commerce developments.  It will help us  achieve

our vision of turning Singapore into an international e-commerce

hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to express my

support for this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Bill is both opportune and

necessary.   It is opportune because Singapore has aimed  to  be

wired

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>

up  nation-wide  under the Singapore One programme  as  a  fully

integrated and networked nation, striving to be one of the  most

progressive nations in the area of information technology in the

21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary because with the advent of widespread use

of  the world-wide web and the Internet for electronic commerce,

there  will  be a need to set rules and regulations  to  protect

both  the  providers and users of goods and services offered  on

the Internet.  The future market place is in the Internet or the

so-called  cyberspace.  This cyberspace market is  a  burgeoning

market  where the volume and value of transactions will explode.

As  the Minister has stated, by the year 2001, it is expected to

grow  to  S$200  billion.  Hence, it is  imperative  that  there

should be proper rules to govern this market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three main points to raise with regard to this

Bill.    First,  on  publicity  programme.   This   concept   of

electronic commerce is still very new to many people.  Most  are

not  aware of the full implications; how it works; what are  the

risks and responsibilities; what is an electronic signature; and

how  do  the certification authorities such as Netrust  operate.

Hence,   I   feel  that  the  Government  should   undertake   a

comprehensive publicity programme to educate the public  on  the

entire concept and the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on the protection of the users. I wish to ask the

Minister whether the present level of controls and penalties are

adequate to protect the users, particularly the small consumers.

Electronic commerce is very vulnerable to computer frauds.  When

a  hacker  gains access into a computer, he can get the  account

numbers  and  signature  codes of  users.   Thereafter,  he  can

withdraw large sums of money or use another person's account and

electronic signature to purchase goods in the cyberspace market.

Similarly, a user of a service has to provide his account number

and  signature  code.   Hence, there is an  inherent  risk  that

others can get unauthorised access, and use the information  for

fraudulent purposes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sums of money involved in computer frauds can be

large,  I wish to ask the Minister whether the present level  of

penalties  proposed  in  the Bill is  adequate  to  serve  as  a

deterrent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is on foreign participation. I wish to ask

the Minister whether foreign-based individuals and companies can

register  with the certification authorities and participate  in

the  electronic commerce in Singapore.  On the one hand,  if  we

limit  the participants to just Singapore-based individuals  and

companies,  we  are  also limiting the size  and  scope  of  the

market.  On the other hand, if we were to extend the coverage to

outside  Singapore, there are many legal and physical  problems.

Legally, do our laws have extra-territorial coverage?  How do we

police  and  exercise  controls?  How do we  handle  claims  and

suits?  Do we have the capacity to deal with the volume?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the many issues and complications of the

cyberspace.   Essentially, the question is: who has the  rights,

the means and the clout to become the "government" in cyberspace

where there are no physical boundaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will enlighten us on these

questions.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, given

the  increasingly  large  role  that  technology  plays  in  our

everyday  lives, the introduction of this Bill is  timely.   The

Bill   provides   a  comprehensive  framework   for   electronic

transactions in general and focuses on electronic commerce.   An

important  feature of this Bill is that electronic  transactions

will  be  given  their  due  legal  effect,  and  a  transaction

conducted electronically, for example, over the Internet, is now

deemed to be a valid and enforceable contract, as provided   for

in clause 11.  However, I would like the Minister to clarify the

following  issues, especially those pertaining  to  transactions

involving the individual as an end consumer who is a party to an

electronic transaction.

<br><br><i>Scope of coverage, especially cross border transactions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister seems to imply that not all cross border

transactions involving a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>

party  outside Singapore would fall within this legal framework.

If  so,  would the public know how to differentiate between  the

transactions  that  are and those that  are  not  covered?   For

example, when the Act comes into effect, will an individual, who

runs  into  a problem with his purchase from a company overseas,

have any legal recourse?  Will he know that, even before he puts

his  order  across?  On a broader scale, will  there  be  enough

public education on matters that are excluded, as elaborated  in

clause  4, for example, the creation or execution of a will,  or

any  contract for the sale of immovable property?   This  is  to

ensure  that  the  public  will  not  be  misled  by  fraudulent

representations.   The  importance  of  a  comprehensive  public

education programme cannot be overstated.

<br><br><i>Understanding the legality of an electronic transaction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When electronic commerce takes on greater significance,

more  individuals are likely to transact through  the  Internet.

Doing  one's  shopping  over the Net would  soon  become  common

place.   However, will there be enough education to help  ensure

that  the  public  understands the legality of  such  electronic

transactions?   That, once the transaction has  been  completed,

neither  the  purchaser nor the supplier may change their  minds

and  rescind  from the contract nor vary the terms unilaterally.

Even though one may never have met the other party with whom one

is  signing  this  contract, the clicking of the  mouse  or  the

keying  in of the credit card details and the necessary  digital

signatures  will have the same effect as putting  one's  pen  to

paper.   This  brings  to  mind  the  question:  which  is   the

appropriate body to turn to when one has enquiries or complaints

with  regards to electronic transactions?  Does one turn to CASE

or  the  Small Claims Tribunal or the Certification  Authorities

for answers to one's questions?

<br><br><i>Responsibility of a subscriber</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public must note that once they have registered

themselves  as subscribers, they have a legal duty under  clause

39 "to exercise reasonable care to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>

retain control of the private key and prevent its disclosure  to

a  person  not  authorised  to create the  subscriber's  digital

signature."    As no specific penalty was prescribed,  it  would

appear that contravention of this will render them liable  under

clause  56  to  a  maximum fine of $20,000 or a maximum  of  six

months'  imprisonment or both.  For electronic  commerce  to  be

truly  successful and effective, it would appear that  the  more

users,   and   therefore  subscribers,  we  have,  the   better.

Understandably,  there do not appear to be  stringent  statutory

nor  other  specific requirements to be met before  one  can  be

registered as a subscriber.  This brings me back to the point of

education again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will subscribers understand the obligations upon

registration or the significance of digital signatures?  Or will

this result in unwanted transactions by a family member who  has

been entrusted with the subscriber's private key?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the above points raised, the introduction

of    the   Bill   also   presents   some   important   economic

considerations.   Now  that the Government  has  lent  its  full

support  to electronic commerce, what impact will this  have  on

our local economy, particularly the small and medium businesses?

Does this mean that more business will be diverted to those  who

have the presence on their net, or who can facilitate electronic

transactions or even to suppliers overseas?  There is no looking

back  now.   On the other hand, the signal is not for businesses

to  jump on to the Internet band wagon.  How best can we prepare

companies, especially the small and medium businesses, for  such

new but inevitable developments?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advent of electronic commerce, middlemen of any

size  will potentially be squeezed out.  They may then be forced

to  concentrate  on  the one area which they  triumph  over  the

electronic  medium, ie, the human factor.    You  cannot  put  a

friendly  human touch across electronically.  In contrast  to  a

computer   screen,  non-electronic  services   can   provide   a

personalised  touch, a friendly smile and a generally  feel-good

sentiment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the introduction of this Bill is

timely,  as it anticipates the legal issues that may arise  with

an  increasing undertaking of electronic commerce.   However,  a

great deal of attention must be paid to educating the public and

business  community on the effects and economic implications  of

such transactions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, public communication

networks  such as Intenet are becoming vital business tools  for

organisations that wish to implement electronic transactions.  A

key factor which has prevented many  organisations from engaging

in   this   type  of  services  is  security.   Unsecured   data

transmitted  over  an  untrusted public network  is  vulnerable.

Data  is  subject  to  interception,  vandalism,  mutation   and

unauthorized  access  to an organisation's network  by  unknown,

unauthorised and sometimes hostile users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable companies to take advantage of business

opportunities created by the Internet while avoiding the  risks,

there  must  be  technology to provide secure  transactions  and

there  must  be  the legal framework to ensure  that  electronic

transactions are safe and valid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology to provide secure electronic transactions is

readily  available  now.   In Singapore,  Internet  banking  has

already  been  piloted  or implemented in  several  banks.   The

Government has led the push for Internet commerce by introducing

several  initiatives  such as Singapore One,  coupled  with  the

availability  of  key  technologies such  as  secure  electronic

transaction  protocol, Internet commerce is poised to  take  off

rapidly in Singapore in the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An IDC Asia-Pacific Report recently indicated that in

Singapore  the number of users accessing the Net will grow  from

62,529  at  year-end 1996 to 1.3 million by year-end 2001.   The

percentage  of users buying goods and services on the  web  will

grow  significantly  from  8.1% in December  1996  to  34.3%  by

December  2001.  The same report also forecasts  the  amount  of

electronic commerce in Singapore to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>

grow  dramatically  from US$1.07 million  at  year-end  1996  to

US$883  million  by  year-end 2001.  Other  countries  are  also

moving  on to electronic commerce fast.  Japan is giving  a  big

push  for  electronic  commerce.  Their Ministry  of  Trade  and

Industry (MITI) has since 1995 committed an equivalent of  S$486

million  as  seed  venture  capital  to  finance  50  electronic

commerce projects.  The Minister has also given an indication of

electronic  commerce  in  the  United  States.   The  electronic

commerce  in the US is expected to exceed US$500 billion  within

this  year and is expected to increase by US$70 billion per year

through the end of the decade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of electronic commerce is transforming the

way  business is conducted globally.  The possibilities for  new

business opportunities are practically limitless.  Singapore has

always been in the forefront of IT development and usage in this

region.   With  our IT infrastructure, we are able  to  position

ourselves as an international electronic commerce hub.  We  have

the  capability  to play the role of a secure and  trusted  node

where  electronic  commerce transactions from  anywhere  can  be

processed.  To do so, we need to provide a conducive  legal  and

policy  framework  to facilitate the development  of  electronic

commerce.   Sir, we have that environment now.  The Bill  before

the  House  today  seeks  to provide the  legal  regulatory  and

enforcement  framework.  It is a timely Bill with  a  tremendous

impact on our economic development.  I support this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, business in cyberspace is a whole new faceless and

intangible  world  fraught with risks and  uncertainties.   This

Bill  defines the rights and obligations of transacting parties.

But  how  does this Bill provide the protection of the different

players  in  an  electronic  transaction?   Then  there  is  the

question  of  tax  which  is silent  in  this  Bill.   Different

countries have different views on the question of tax.   On  the

one  hand, the European Community is concerned that the Internet

will create a black market that cannot be taxed, which will mean

a  loss  of  revenue  to  the government.   The  United  States,

however,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>

advocates that no new tax be applied to Internet commerce.  Sir,

is our 3% GST applicable to electronic transactions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development of electronic commerce in Singapore

must  have consistency with international regime.  International

cooperation  and  inter-operability  are  necessary.   Will  the

certification  authorities specified in this  Bill  be  globally

inter-operable?   Perhaps  the area  where  electronic  commerce

causes  the greatest problem is jurisdiction of tax.  Cyberspace

is  a  borderless and yet cross border transactions will  become

more popular.  Identifying which country has jurisdiction to tax

the  proceeds from the new form of commerce is a significant and

difficult  issue.   How  does the Bill  apply  to  cross  border

transactions,  tax and legal issues, when there  is  a  lack  of

geography  in determining the place of formation and performance

of contracts?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies in the United States have shown that electronic

commerce  brings big and small organisations to an even  footing

as  the entry barrier to a presence in the virtual shopping mall

is very low.  There are some 91,000 small and medium enterprises

in   Singapore  employing  more  than  half  of  the   country's

workforce.   They  will  benefit most from electronic  commerce.

But  SMEs  are  today  predominantly  concerned  with  the  more

immediate  and  fundamental  issues like  staying  in  business,

trying  to  make  a  profit, and overcoming  competition.   SMEs

generally   do   not  perceive  that  electronic  commerce   can

substantially assist them with these primary concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of appreciation of SMEs today on the potentials

for   electronic  commerce  to  provide  competitive  advantage,

encourage  and support export opportunities, is still relatively

low.   There is an urgent need for Government and their agencies

to  set  up  programmes to assist SMEs in coming to  terms  with

electronic  commerce  more quickly.  This can  be  done  through

extensive  education and training.  NCB perhaps could  establish

an  electronic commerce resource centre which will help SMEs  to

accelerate  adoption  and implementation of relevant  electronic

commerce technologies for business

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>

benefits.   The  Government can help SMEs to avoid uncoordinated

development   of   underlying  technology  which   could   cause

incompatibility  resulting in problems  of  integration  in  the

global  market.   Assistance in the form  of  funding  could  be

provided  for  projects that encourage SMEs to  be  involved  in

electronic  commerce.   SMEs usually do not  have  the  in-house

expertise  for  system integration and many will  need  to  seek

external  advice  and  assistance.   Perhaps  Government  should

consider grants for SMEs to engage consultants to advise on  how

to implement electronic commerce strategies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, electronic commerce will be the next lap for

business  growth.  With this Bill, the legal safeguards  are  in

place.   The  Government  should  now  encourage  and  help  all

businesses  to  formulate a coherent and  integrated  electronic

commerce   strategy   as   a  basis  for  sustainable   economic

development.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  speak in general support of the Bill.  May I just  say

first  that I was in fact consulted earlier as a member  of  the

NUS  Law  Faculty regarding this Bill, but I did  not  make  any

representations  on the issues that I will raise  today.   So  I

hope that I am not estopped from speaking on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it necessary to draw the attention of Members to a

number  of  issues that this Bill raises but are not  adequately

dealt  with.   Sir, the Bill, in its intention, is to facilitate

electronic  transactions,  especially  commercial  transactions.

That such a Bill is necessary, there can be no doubt.  Among the

stated  purposes is the security of communications as  well  as,

and  I quote, "to promote public confidence in the integrity and

reliability  of  electronic  records and  electronic  commerce."

These are aims that we can all support.  The question is whether

the Bill, as it stands, achieves these purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with a couple of preliminary issues. First,

despite what the Minister indicated just now, it should be noted

that  the Bill is not technology neutral.  It deals in the  main

with digital signature systems.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>

Of course, there are other security systems that are in frequent

use.  For example, certain US companies are using secure  socket

layers, avoiding the need for the rather more cumbersome process

of certification and digital signatures. The Bill does not cover

this  type  of  secure  transactions even  though  for  ordinary

electronic  commerce, such methods are perfectly acceptable  and

efficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bill adopts somewhat confusing terminology. I

refer,  in  particular,  to the use of the  term  "certification

authority".  In Singapore, we use the word "authority" to  refer

to Government agencies and regulatory bodies.  Frankly, what the

Bill  is  seeking to refer to are actually certification service

providers  who  are  in  turn  subject  to  the  control  of  an

authority,   in   this   case,  the  so-called   Controller   of

Certification  Authorities.   To call  a  certification  service

provider  a  certification authority may be  misleading  to  the

general  public and I would hope that the term be  redefined  to

its proper form, that is to say, certification service provider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Bill is very technically drafted. If one of its

objectives  is  to  promote  public confidence  in  the  use  of

electronic transactions, it will take a very serious attempt  to

make the general public understand the complexities contemplated

in  the public key infrastructure.  In particular, I would  draw

attention  to  the technical definition of  "digital  signature"

which   in   turn  depends  on  the  definition  of  "electronic

signature"  -  two definitions.  Both these definitions  do  not

seem  to  convey  the  idea  to the general  public  that  these

signatures  are meant to be unique links to the signatory,  that

they  are  capable of identifying the signatory and are presumed

to  be  under the signatory's control.  It is also necessary  to

assure the signatory, the public, that subsequent alteration  of

data would not be possible using such a system.  This simple but

important reassuring element is not found anywhere in the  Bill.

Frankly,  the  Bill needs to be less technical  and  technology-specific  if  it  were to achieve its purpose of raising  public

confidence in the use of electronic transactions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I turn to the very serious issues concerning liability

in  the  electronic world.  There are at least  three  areas  of

concern  here  for  me.   The first  has  to  do  with  consumer

protection in the world of electronic commerce; the second,  the

liability  of  network service providers,  and  the  third,  the

liability of certification service providers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take consumer protection first, and the importance

of  realising  that  electronic  contracts  are  very  different

animals from paper-based contracts that most of us are used  to.

When  we  sign  a  paper-based contract, we  are  appending  our

signature  to  a document that is frozen in print and  for  that

matter  in  time.  Any dispute arising out of the  contract  can

then  be referred to the document containing the terms.  Usually

both  contracting parties would have a copy.  In the  electronic

world, contract is a dynamic entity that is capable of change in

microseconds.  To take a simple example, in the law of contract,

it  is  possible  to  incorporate by reference  terms  found  in

another  document.   However, such terms would  not  be  binding

unless  the contracting parties know of their existence  at  the

time  of  the  contract.   In  the electronic  environment,  the

provision of hyperlinks is commonplace.  What is also likely  is

that  the  person who posted a document can change a hyperlinked

document at will.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My worry is that in electronic commerce, trading partners

may  change  terms, say, regarding time for payment or  interest

rates  without the knowledge of the other party. This  would  be

very serious indeed because if a dispute were to arise, it would

be  by  no  means clear that the consumer would have a  specific

contract  to  refer to.  There is no such thing as  an  original

contract  and  a copy in the electronic world.  How  this  issue

should be tackled is not readily apparent in this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing on this subject on certainty of terms, I should

also mention that the effect of the provision in clause 7, where

the law provides that certain contracts should be in writing and

electronic  version  can also be acceptable,  is  a  very,  very

serious one, because it means that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>

contracts  of guarantee which are required to be in writing  can

now  be  in  electronic form.  They are not excluded  under  the

Bill.   Contracts  of  guarantee impose secondary  liability  on

guarantors and usually it is absolutely essential to ensure that

the  terms  of  the guarantee are clear and that the  guarantors

know  what  they  are letting themselves in for.   This  section

(clause 7) seems to allow electronic guarantees.  I am not  sure

whether  this  is intended for it can have serious repercussions

on those who are guarantors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I turn to a provision that is both imprecise and

perhaps  too wide.  I refer to clause 10 - liability of  network

service providers.  First of all, there is no definition of what

a  network service provider is.  As the exemption from liability

is extremely wide for network service providers, they are exempt

from  both  civil and criminal liability in certain  situations.

It  seems to me to be a serious omission not to have defined the

term  "network  service provider" in the Bill.  Leaving  such  a

technical  term  for  the  judges  to  define  may  be  to  risk

imprecision  and create uncertainty.  Unscrupulous organisations

may  also  be able to use the wide exemption from liability  for

undesirable purposes as the provision also can exempt them  from

criminal liability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take a simple example. Organisation X may set up a

string  of  servers  to  allow  users  to  upload  copyright  or

defamatory materials.  When prosecuted for such offences, it may

claim that it is a network service provider, thus attracting the

exemption  of  some liability under clause 10. Frankly,  it  may

well succeed.  Surely this cannot be intended.  So if we were to

have  such a wide provision for exemption of liability, I  would

respectfully suggest that the definition of a  "network  service

provider"  be provided in the legislation.  In contrast  to  the

wide  exemption  for  liability of  network  service  providers,

certification service providers seem to be provided for only  in

terms  of forged digital signatures and misrepresentation.   One

should  have thought that it is necessary to include a provision

to   exempt   certification  service  providers  from  liability

relating  to  inaccurate  facts given  to  them  by  subscribers

provided the certification service provider

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>

has  taken  reasonable steps to verify them.   Similarly,  there

should be some limitation to liability with regard to the use of

certificates for purposes that were not intended by the  service

providers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have raised the issues above not because I am

against  the Bill.  I am strongly in support of such legislation

but I think that more careful consideration needs to be given to

its  provisions.  I hope that sufficient time will be given  for

consideration of these provisions.  As it stands,  the  Bill  is

technical and the content gaps should be plugged.  Frankly,  the

Bill  is seeking to facilitate electronic commerce.  We  can  in

principle support such an effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just say that we must realise that there

will  also  be social costs involved.  Member of Parliament  Mrs

Lim  Hwee  Hua  has  already  made reference  to  these.   I  am

concerned  in particular about the ease with which  trading  can

take  place  on the Net.  Indeed, the whole family can  now  sit

down  comfortably  in front of the computer and  shop  to  their

hearts'  content.   I can see that many may be  tempted  by  the

offers  that may come through the Net and be persuaded to  spend

even  more than they should.  I hope that the relevant  agencies

will  closely monitor this new phenomenon of cyber shopping  and

to  regulate it more carefully if the need arises.       Sir,  I

support the Bill subject to the comments I have made.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first

declare my interest.  I am the Chairman of CommerceNet Singapore

Limited which is a grouping of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>

commercial companies that has been set up to promote e-commerce,

to  set  standards, to provide feedback on laws and policies  to

the Government, and as a self-regulatory business association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have to say too that I have been involved

from the early days of this Bill because I was fortunate to have

been invited on the Drafting Committee and I have also given  my

feedback  at  various times to the various agencies involved  in

this.   Still, as with all committees, there are certain  things

which  of  course  I  feel  have to be addressed  but  were  not

addressed  satisfactorily or, as with  committees,  I  get  out-voted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise these issues publicly in this House

for  clarification and also to have these aired so  that  others

can  join  in the debate.  As has been evident from the speeches

of the Members earlier on before the break, there are many, many

more issues which have to be addressed and these may have to  be

taken  up  at a different time.  This is why even though  I  was

minded to move some amendments to this Bill, I have decided that

we should not put barriers in the path of this Bill, but have it

go through and then work at refining and fine-tuning it later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in support of this motion, particularly, the four

guiding principles that the Minister has stated.  These are  the

principles  that, firstly, the Bill must be technology  neutral.

Secondly,  it  must be light regulation.  Thirdly,  it  must  be

certain  and  transparent.  And, fourthly,  it  must  track  the

global developments in this area: Because if Singapore tries  to

run too far ahead of the crowd, it could say that it is a leader

but  there is no point in being a leader when it turns back  and

see  that  the  rest  of the field has actually  turned  off  or

sidetracked and gone off in a different direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address the specific points of these four

guiding  principles.  First of all, I do share some reservations

about  its  total  neutrality, as Prof. Chin mentioned  earlier.

There is, for example, in clause 3, an over-emphasis on the word

"electronic".

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>

Clause    3   talks   about   electronic   records,   electronic

communications, etc. The medium of electronic communications  is

not  the only communication channel for e-commerce, particularly

if   technology  in  optical  communications  and   radio   wave

communications  is  considered.  Like Prof.  Chin,  I  think  it

appears  to  be  a  Bill which gives overdue  treatment  to  the

digital  signature.  I have raised this several times throughout

the  course of this drafting and I know that efforts  have  been

put  in  to  make  sure  that there is  a  set:  the  electronic

signature - which means any procedure that you can have,  it  is

technology  neutral.  And with digital signature,  it  is  meant

only  to  be  a  sub-set  which gives the  law  certainty.   The

intention is good and it is there but, as I will point out later

in my speech, does not come through all that well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, which is a guiding principle, is that it

must be light regulation.  In other words, we should try and  be

as sparing with new rules as we can until we are sure that these

are  necessary.   In  this context, I would  like  to  highlight

clause  9  which  aims to make all electronic records  generally

recognised  in law.  Prof. Chin has reservations in that  if  we

make  this  too wide, it could cover a lot of transactions  that

should  not  be  on  paper yet, like consumer transactions,  for

example.  Again, I will raise that in a while.  But clause 9 has

this  intention that if the law allows for an electronic record,

then  the Electronic Transactions Bill should carry on with  it.

But  where  the law is silent, the intention is that  this  Bill

will  make  it possible.  The proviso, however, I feel  is  like

giving  with  one hand and taking away with the other.   We  say

that  it  is  possible to have electronic records  provided  the

approval of the department or ministry of the Government,  organ

of  State  or  the statutory corporation, which has  supervision

over  the  requirement for the retention  of  such  records,  is

mandatory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister how would a

businessman  who wants to do e-commerce know whose  approval  he

needs  from  the thousands of Government agencies around.   Most

would  of course clear with the known regulators, like the  MAS,

IRAS, Customs and Excise, RCB and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>

the  Stock  Exchange  of Singapore Ltd (SES).   What  if,  after

clearing  all these points with the agencies involved, one  fine

day  down  the road, some obscure Government agency says,  "Hey,

you  didn't  check  with me and therefore the  whole  record  is

invalid."   This  proviso  should be removed  in  future.   This

proviso  in  clause 9(1)(d), particularly, should  be  tolerated

temporarily to give Government agencies time to put in place the

control and security measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an illustration, a quick reading of the Companies Act

would give confidence that company books, accounts and registers

are  expressly permitted to be electronic, for example, sections

199  and  395 of the Companies Act.  But the average businessman

is still not sure if his contractual documents and other papers,

such  as  invoices,  for  which  he  needs  to  verify  his  tax

liability,  can be paperless till the taxmen say so.   And  this

means nobody would convert his papers to electronic records with

clear  confidence.  So you have the regulation, but I think  the

proviso in clause 9(1)(d) has gone too far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the Minister could take the opportunity to clarify

that  the  Government  agencies fully support  the  use  of  IT,

document processing systems and e-commerce systems and will  not

place unnecessary burdens in the way of businesses which wish to

execute  and convert electronic documents, especially  if  these

documents  are  electronic  from the  outset  of  the  creation.

Otherwise, businessmen would be asked impliedly to maintain  two

separate systems, ie, paper and electronic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of certainty and transparency, great efforts have

been  made  to clarify.  But like what they say on the  Internet

websites, "This site is under construction."  I would  say  that

this  Act  is  under construction.  It is still something  which

needs to be further worked on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has been made to clause 4. Clause 4 says that we

are  trying to do some incremental  changes here and  we  should

not be too broad and sweep out all the paper immediately.  There

are  some things that still require paper, for example, as Prof.

Chin has pointed out, consumer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>

transactions.  We need to protect the consumers, we need to keep

certain  seriousness  and  certain  warning  procedures   inside

contracts that deal with consumers.  At various stages,  I  have

actually  raised this issue.  Again, as I said, because  it  has

been  an  issue  on  which  I have been  out-voted,  I  wish  to

emphasise again that consumer transactions, for example, such as

those dealing with guarantees, money lending, hire purchase  and

even  the  provisions of the Unfair Contract  Terms  Act,  which

Prof.  Chin  has alluded to, should be included in the  list  of

exclusions in clause 4.  And obviously, the Minister has got the

power  in the subsidiary legislation to introduce this if he  is

so minded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 too deals with documents of title. This is a

clause  which is one thing to businessmen and another  thing  to

lawyers  because the meaning differs.  It is probably useful  to

clarify  that the meaning here is that of law, which means  that

essentially title deeds which are documents of title to land and

negotiable  bills of lading which are truly in law  only  quasi-negotiable and these would have to be specially and specifically

covered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 is another clause needing certainty. Prof. Chin

has said that this is a clause which is too wide because network

service  providers cover the whole world.  Sir, I beg to  differ

and because I beg to differ, maybe it is not clear after all.  I

think  this clause is too narrow in scope.  Seemingly, it covers

only  Internet  service providers (ISPs).   It  does  not  cover

resellers  of  network  services,  such  as  Singapore   Network

Services, for example, or America Online.  And it does not cover

operators of cybermalls, such as, perhaps, locally, we have Silk

Route ventures.  It does not cover search engine operators, such

as  Yahoo  and  Alta Vista, and other providers of  services  or

networks whose service may be used to disseminate defamatory and

infringing  works of copyright even when these are beyond  their

control.  If the intention is only to cover ISPs, then  I  think

it is too narrow because there are certain commercial operations

like  this  that  also need that protection from defamation  and

copyright  infringement  for things that  they  cannot  control,

unless the Minister says that this particular clause is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>

a  provision only limited to protection of ISPs from hackers and

non-subscribers.   If so, this is a very restrictive  protection

and does not give much comfort for e-commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10(3) deals with third parties over which the

service  provider has "no effective control".   What  does  this

mean?  Most service providers can put in their service contracts

that the subscribers must not use the service to post illegal or

offensive  material.  They can reserve the rights  to  terminate

services  and pull out or block objectionable content  and  they

can   indemnify   themselves  from  the  consequences   of   the

subscribers' breaches of contract.  They can also add,  if  they

so  wish,  a  clause to prohibit the subscribers  from  defaming

others  but  they  cannot prevent such people from  deliberately

breaching the rules and the agreement.  They can only do so by a

lengthy  court proceeding.  This, however, may still be seen  to

be  "effective control" and thus the service provider's immunity

would  be  removed, and that is why I say this  provision  would

only  protect the service provider against incursions by hackers

and  non-subscribers.   If this is not  the  case,  I  wish  the

Minister could clarify that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going on to clause 13(3)(b), it deals with relationships

and  it  says  that if the relationship to the originator  of  a

message  is  close  enough,  then  it  is  the  message  of  the

originator.   Is  this  relationship  contractual,   social   or

fiduciary?   Does it mean a degree of proximity as in  marriage,

in  kinship?   In  other  words, does it cover  parents,  child,

siblings,  in-laws?   Or is it wider than that,  covering  legal

relationships,  such  as  employer/employee,  licenser/licensee,

landlord/tenant?  I think this can be clarified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13(4)(c) says that it may be unconscionable to rely

on  an  electronic  record.  This is a big word.   What  is  the

meaning of "unconscionable"?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify

this too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15(1) deals with despatch and it says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`. despatch of an electronic record occurs when it enters

an information system outside the control of the originator .'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>

This  is  not applicable obviously when an Intranet owner  or  a

service  provider sends messages to its own subscribers, because

everything  is within its control.  It does not go  out  of  its

control.   So, what rules of sending and receipt would apply  in

this case?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15(2)(a) says that there is a designated information

system  that you can send documents to.  Should this  designated

information system be expressly designated?  If not, is the mere

mention  of  an  e-mail address on my name  card  sufficient  to

designate  that  I  intended  to receive  contractually  binding

documents at that mail box?  This cannot be so, as I could  well

mean it as a means of social communication only.  I give you  my

e-mail  address to chit chat with me, not to send me a contract.

In addition, I may not necessarily be indicating an "information

system", but essentially a messaging system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is this question of designated information

system   designated by whom and to whom.  If I tell X my  e-mail

address  and Z comes along and takes that address from X without

my  knowledge and consent, am I designating to Z?    What  if  I

have it on my name card which I give only to X without intending

and not expecting that he should pass it on to Z?  And what if I

have  my  professional  card and my  CASE  card  and  they  both

designate different e-mail addresses, as they do, can a document

binding on my law firm, in this case, be sent to my CASE  e-mail

address?   This  is not satisfactory.  I hope the  Minister  can

also clarify this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neatest rule in an electronic system is really to have

a  rule  which requires actual receipt.  This can mean  in  most

cases  the  actual retrieving or opening of the message  by  the

recipient,  and  it  is up to the sender  to  stipulate  to  the

recipient that arrival in the latter's mail box is sufficient by

prior  arrangement or by agreement, if that is  what  he  wants.

This is the same as the rules for receipt of messages by fax  or

telex,  except that in situations where a mail box is  expressly

stipulated  as a place of receipt of legally binding  documents,

then this express designation moves the time of actual

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>

receipt  to the time when the message is deposited or is capable

of being retrieved from the designated mail box.  And so I would

hope  that in future there is a clarification, and mail box  can

be defined as referring to the server or the system on which the

mail service is run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to clause 23, there is, I think, a need to have

more  direct  language in this provision.   As  it  stands,  the

clause can mean one of two things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It can mean that it is foreseeable that a relier on

digital  signature will also rely on a valid  certificate.   And

hence,  if the issuer has issued a false certificate,  there  is

negligence straightaway without further proof, as foreseeability

is a test of the existence of a duty of care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It can refer to the fact that it is foreseeable that a

relier  on  a digital signature should also go on to  check  the

validity  of the certificate issued, failing which he  would  be

held to be negligent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which meaning is it (a) or (b)? Or perhaps the law is

speaking  with  a forked tongue!  We should be more  precise  in

this respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim has mentioned a problem with clause 39. It is the

same problem with clause 40 also.  Here, the subscriber has  got

certain obligations, eg, to keep the keys safe and to inform the

certification  authority  (CA) when the  private  key  has  been

compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no clear provision in these two clauses as to

whether a breach of this is a criminal offence or it gives  rise

to  civil  liability.   Mrs Lim seems to think  that  clause  56

applies because it is a criminal offence, but I do not think  it

is all that clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of offences, are the penalties for violation

of  clauses  25, 26 and 42 sufficient?  Cheating under  sections

419 and 420 of the Penal Code are subject to penalties of up  to

three to seven years in jail respectively.  Under clauses 25, 26

and  42,  the penalties are not that serious.  Should electronic

cheating  warrant any less protection?  As has been pointed  out

by  Prof. Chin, the instances of consumers being cheated on  the

Net would be immense, and immensely possible too.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth guiding principle that the Minister has

mentioned  about  this  Bill is that it hopes  to  track  global

developments  in this area, and there are many model  laws,  for

example, that have been drafted by different countries.  Some of

these are already existing legislation.  And I do know that  the

committee in drafting this Bill referred to provisions as varied

as  the Utah Digital Signature Act, the Illinois Act, German Act

and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have raised this point that it is good and

fine  for us to have a law which deals with electronic commerce.

But  as with all laws, it is territorial in nature.  It can only

apply to Singapore transactions and to transactions in which the

parties  stipulate the use of Singapore law.  When  you  have  a

cross-border transaction as e-commerce is wont to be, then it is

difficult  to  say that Singapore law applies and therefore  the

consumer must not be lulled into thinking that now he can  trade

on all these cyber stores in the United States, Germany or Italy

with  clear laws.  The whole idea of tracking international laws

and  developments  in this area, especially the  United  Nations

Commission for International Trade Law model provisions, is that

we  are able to achieve total harmonisation of the laws when all

countries  in  the  world  accept  the  model  laws.    This  is

different  from  a  United  Nations  Convention  where  all  the

signatory   parties  would  sign  and  the  law  is  immediately

effective   once   the  different  Parliaments   pass   domestic

legislation to accept those laws.  But the model law is meant to

be  something that you can follow at your own pace, at your  own

time.   And  so we have actually followed some of the provisions

but not all of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for consumers and business dealings all

around  the  world, across borders, that there must  be  maximum

harmonisation of laws in different countries, just as  there  is

harmonisation  of laws for letters of credit.  The International

Chamber  of  Commerce  has a set of model provisions  which  are

incorporated  into letters of credit contracts  by  bankers  and

traders all around the world.  And different courts, even though

they have different ways of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>

looking  at  these model provisions, nonetheless,  have  adopted

similar  approaches.  We hope that if the model laws are adopted

all  around the world, then the fact that ours is the first  Act

in this area, it is not going to be too significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point of harmonisation, I have argued that the

electronic  commerce  provisions of the Electronic  Transactions

Bill are separate from the digital signature provisions.  I have

argued  that the two sets of provisions should be kept  separate

as  two  separate pieces of legislation.  Prof. Chin has earlier

on  alluded to some of the difficulties in this: Because of  all

the  digital  signature provisions, this Bill  has  become  very

technical  and  loaded down with details  which  should  not  be

there.   I  feel that in the spirit of the United Nations  model

laws,  for example, they have two separate model laws;  one  for

electronic commerce and one for digital signature.  Because when

you   talk   about   contractual   principles   and   rules   of

communication, you are talking about concepts.  You are  talking

about  principles and you are not bogged down by the  technology

and  it  does not matter what technology is used as long as  the

procedures are there.  Firstly, the technology itself  is  going

to  change  very  fast and very soon digital  signatures  within

three  to five years might actually be obsolete.  And we  should

not entrench these provisions into a general Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the contractual rule gives rise to civil

liability,  but  most of the digital signature  framework  gives

rise  to  regulatory and prescriptive provisions,  a  breach  of

which  gives  rise  to criminal liability, and  this  is  really

trying to mix everything and be all things to all men, which  is

not very good for clarity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the EC Policy Committee has argued that this

combining of two different laws into one would aid retrieval and

reference,  but  I think, with respect, this  is  not  a  strong

argument  because digital signature is a state  of  art  set  of

words and people who want to look for laws on digital signatures

can look for them under that title.  And if they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>

looking for laws on electronic commerce, I suspect there are not

too  many  laws in our statute books that have got an electronic

title,  and  I  do  not think therefore it is  going  to  be  so

difficult to chase.  Nonetheless, if they become two Bills, they

could  cross  refer  to  each other and, ultimately,  electronic

searches are possible in Singapore, since we have statutes on CD-ROMs.  Then, a good search engine is really all that you need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would agree that we cannot burden an electronic

transaction Bill with all these technical provisions, but it  is

now  a fact and I would hope that eventually we can rethink this

and in the next set of rules, try to separate the technical from

the  clearly conceptual and the legal principles.  I think  this

is possible and I look forward to that day.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I rise in support of

this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only important and necessary in our growing IT

oriented society but timely as we and the world move quickly  to

embrace electronic commerce.  This Bill will give legal standing

to  electronic transactions which will be the basis of a growing

number  of  commercial exchanges.  However, I am concerned  with

the  wide  scope  of  clause 48(1) that appears  to  taint  with

illegality  innocent  acts  like the forwarding  of  e-mail  and

information   obtained   from  the  Internet.    We   must   not

inadvertently set obstacles to curtail the usefulness, potential

and  growth of a medium of communication of the future.  I would

like the Minister's assurances that the provision and others  in

this Bill do not inadvertently taint innocent exchanges and acts

between parties on the Internet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all the

Members  who  have spoken for their support of  the  Bill,  even

though some of them have reservations about very specific  legal

or  technical aspects of this Bill.  I will try and  respond  to

the  main  points that have been raised.  I can  assure  Members

that  my officers have been listening very carefully to all  the

points  made and they will refer them to the relevant Ministries

and agencies to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>

further study this matter.  This Bill really represents the best

effort  up  to  this point in time by the officers concerned  to

deal  with a very complicated area which is fast evolving.  Like

Hong  Kong,  Australia, US and so on, we are trying to  position

ourselves  at the forefront of this fast developing field  which

holds  great  potential  for  us.   I  think  there  is  a  good

possibility for us to become an electronic commerce hub  and  to

be a place where people have confidence in doing business on the

Net,  making use of our trustee services and so on,  because  of

our  record of reliability, transparency and the high regard  of

the  international  community for  our  laws  and  the  judicial

process.  This is an area we want to position ourselves  quickly

to  try  and  take advantage of what is fast evolving.   In  the

process,  they  have  come  out  with  a  Bill  which  is  quite

technical.   They have assured me that they have tried  to  make

this Bill neutral so that later on when there are other kinds of

technology  they  can  be  incorporated  fairly  readily.   This

remains to be seen. But there is no big problem because, if need

be, the Bill can be refined and further improved upon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Members that public education is very

important.   It  is not just a question of investing  a  lot  of

money into Singapore One, infrastructure and so on.  We must get

people  to  use it.  This means changing the habits  of  people.

They  may  prefer to go shopping and make it a day's outing  for

the  family.  We are trying to make it convenient for people  to

shop on the Net and also to do business, especially cross border

business.  We are not trying to cater just for Singaporeans.  Of

course, Singaporeans, being so used to changes in the way we  do

things, are a good test bed, as it were.  Once we have wired  up

the  whole island into an intelligent island, we can try out new

services,  video-on-demand, education and of course  e-commerce.

That is an area where a lot of people are putting in effort  and

we  ourselves  are  involved in the  international  arena.   For

example,  in  APEC, we are working with Australia.  We  co-chair

this  APEC  Task  Force on E-Commerce.  So we  have  raised  the

profile of Singapore to be one of the key players in this area.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that we have this education programme,

which has to be an on-going effort, to bring the public on board

and to make them confident of what we are trying to do.  So this

whole  law is to give confidence to consumers and businesses  to

make use of the systems that have been developed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the systems that NCB has developed is the digital

signature system which makes use of a dual key system where  one

party  holds  a  private  key  and the  so-called  certification

authority certifies that this is indeed the person and there  is

a  public key that can be matched with this private key  through

some computer process so that it can assure the two parties that

in fact they are dealing with the people they profess to be.  So

this process of identification comes in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system also helps to ensure that the documents are not

altered once they have been signed.  I have been told that  this

process actually does that.  This will give extra confidence  to

the businesses and the consumers.  Even without this system,  in

fact,  a  lot  of business has already been done.  For  example,

those who order on mail service or order on the Internet and you

give  your  credit  card  numbers.  In fact,  you  are  exposing

yourself to misuse of the credit card numbers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas if people were to use this system here, at least

they  have the assurance.  For example, if you trade shares  and

you bid COEs or other big transactions, the parties involved are

really the parties they claim to be, and there is assurance that

the  documents  are secure and the process is  safe,  and  where

there  are disputes the law tries to provide for those disputes.

It  has  to  be read together with other kinds of laws governing

fraud,  contracts  and  so on.  This is to  make  it  such  that

transactions done on the Net electronically can also be accepted

in  a  court.   Government ministries and departments  like  the

Inland  Revenue  Authority  are  gradually  moving  on  to  this

paperless world on an opt-in system.  Not everything can be done

paperless.   There are certain areas like wills and title  deeds

where you still need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>

paper. The Bill provides for those areas to be exempted.   Later

on, when we are ready we can bring them in.  So to answer Dr Toh

See Kiat's point about businessmen being confused, I think there

should be no confusion here because it depends on what area  you

are  involved  with.   It  is  for the  Government  ministry  or

department  to  say,  "Okay, from now  on,  we  can  accept  the

electronic  documents for this purpose."   So  businessmen  will

have  to know what are the areas they need to look into and,  if

necessary, clarify with the departments concerned.  There is  no

central  body  responsible for this.  It is up to the  different

Ministries  and agencies to come on board as and when  they  are

ready. Even when they come on board, they may still insist  that

certain documents be kept on paper form.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In using this system, of course, there are responsibilities

of  the  parties involved, not only the certification authority,

but also the holder of the private key.  Just like you would not

allow your ATM card to be used by your family members, you  must

also  be careful that you do not allow your family members  easy

access to these keys and misuse them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, following this Bill, there is another Bill

known  as  the  Computer Misuse (Amendment) Bill which  will  be

enhancing penalties for different kinds of fraud or hacking  and

so  on.  So we are trying to do all these things to provide  the

technical and legal infrastructure, enhance the penalties and so

on,  to make sure that we are in a position to make use of  this

technology  and  take advantage of this new and  exciting  field

that  opens  up  vast  opportunities for  us  in  the  field  of

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about the use of the term "certification

authorities",  I have been told that in fact this  is  the  term

that has been internationally recognised and used in the USA and

other  OECD countries.  I agree with the Member that in  reading

this Bill, one gets the impression that "authority" often refers

in  our case to Government.  But it is a matter of getting  used

to the term and, if need be, we can of course make changes later

on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked how this would apply to cross border

situations.  What are the liabilities and so on?  This Bill does

provide  for  the  possibility  of  cross  certification.    For

example,  the NCB has signed a memorandum of understanding  with

its counterpart in Canada to recognise each other's certificate.

Through this process, we can extend the coverage of this law  to

also  the  other parties, or the contracting parties  themselves

can  opt  to  be  covered by certain laws.  So those  situations

could be provided for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new technology provides a lot of scope for the small

businesses because through this means they are able, for example

to  create  their web page, which can then allow them to  access

the   international  market.   There  have  been  instances   of

companies which are very small, for example in Australia,  which

are  able  to  grow  their business through making  use  of  the

system.  So we have to help our small industries through various

means,  through funding support for example, in computerisation,

through helping them to hire consultants and so on, to get  them

on  to  this  new  process.   So my Ministry  and  the  relevant

statutory  boards will work together with the  SMEs  to  educate

them  and  help them in this process.  I think this is  a  great

opportunity  for them because it levels the field.   It  is  not

only the big players who are able to make use of this electronic

commerce   but   also   the  small  firms.    There   could   be

possibilities,  for  example, of central bureaus  which  provide

service to these companies so that it is not too costly for them

to  develop their own systems.  So they can make use of a common

system to get on to the world markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the process, it may also cut out certain

middleman roles. There will be certain businesses which will  be

affected,  because when the seller can reach the buyer directly,

they  do  not need the middleman.  This  may be true  in  theory

but,  in  practice,  for big deals you still  want  to  see  the

person.   It  is  a matter of trust.  So it is unavoidable  that

there must still be person to person contacts and there will  be

a  role  for  the  middleman in marrying these parties.   So  it

cannot displace this middleman role in that situation.  It might

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>

be  more useful in cases like where you are trying to sell books

or relatively small items.  There again, because of our physical

location and our shipping and airport facilities and so  on,  we

can  combine  the  commerce  area, the  Internet,  the  ease  of

communication,   the  trust  and  so  on,  with   our   physical

infrastructure  to position ourselves so that  we  are  able  to

service  the region and they are able to place their orders  for

products  which  are  then kept here, whether  it  is  books  or

consumer  items  or  spare parts.  There  again,  combining  the

Internet  possibilities with all the logistic  possibilities,  I

think, will open up a great new area for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin touched on quite a few legal points. As I said,

I  will  ask  my  officers to look further into  them.   He  was

concerned   that  the  exemptions  given  to  Internet   service

providers are too broad and so forth.  This is an area which has

been   looked   into  very  carefully.   The  Attorney-General's

Chambers  have  been involved in this area and perhaps  I  could

just read out to Members their comments on this point:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Clause 10 was drafted after very careful consideration of

the  scope  of  protection that should  be  granted  to  network

service  providers.  Special attention should be  given  to  the

words "merely provides access".  These words are in a sense  the

linch-pin  of  the section.  Protection is only available  where

the  network service providers merely provide access.  In  other

words, where the service provider is merely fulfilling a conduit

role  in the transmission of content from the originator to  the

end user.  This conduit-only role would occur, for example, when

Internet  access service providers provide connectivity services

that  allow their subscribers to access web sites in  far  flung

corners  of the globe.  In such a case, these companies are  not

aware  of,  have  no  control  over,  and  should  not  be  held

responsible for the content that the user obtains from these web

sites.   This  type of protection is similar to  the  protection

enjoyed  by  the  postal service in respect of  the  content  in

postal  mail.    However, if the network service  provider  does

anything more than merely provide access, then the protection is

not available to him.  Two examples are:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) where the network service provider hosts on its servers

or servers under its control the content in question.  In such a

scenario,  the  service provider has direct and  actual  control

over  the content and cannot in respect of the content be merely

providing access; and

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) where the network service provider does not host but adopts

by  reference or hyperlinking the content of a third party.   In

such  a scenario, the network service provider may, by endorsing

it, be deemed to have adopted the content as its own.  Hence, if

a network service provider recommends or points users

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



to  content which infringes intellectual property rights, he may

be deemed to have adopted such content to be his own, and may be

held  responsible  for contributing to the infringement  of  the

copyright owner's rights.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to emphasise that clause 10 is not

intended  to impose or create liability when there is  currently

no liability under common law.  What it does is to make it clear

that   there   is   no   liability  within  certain   restricted

circumstances  where  the  provider does  no  more  than  merely

provide access.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much would depend on the facts of each particular case.

Clause  10  leaves  it  to a court to decide  in  each  instance

whether the network service provider has in fact done more  than

merely provide access.  I would like to point out that clause 10

does  not  absolve the network service providers from regulatory

regimes  such  as  the Singapore Broadcasting Authority's  Class

Licence Scheme which requires some service providers to prohibit

access to certain objectionable material.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to assure the Member that we are

following international trends very closely.  If there is a need

to  fine-tune clause 10 in the light of the experience of  other

countries or other international developments, we will do so.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.So this is the response from the Attorney-General's

Chambers on this particular point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most of the points. If Members feel

that  I  should cover something more adequately, please  let  me

know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I think hon. Members are going to be disappointed.   I  am

not going to defer the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill before the

House  today  seeks to amend the Central Provident Fund  Act  to

enable  the  implementation of CPF policies regarding  voluntary

contributions,  intra-account  transfers  and   the   CPF   Home

Protection  Scheme.   The  Bill also  seeks  to  streamline  the

enforcement  and  recovery of CPF contributions.   I  shall  now

highlight the major changes introduced by this Bill.

<br><br><i>Voluntary contributions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on voluntary contributions. Clause 2 of the Bill

amends  the CPF Act to expand the definition of "member  of  the

Fund"  or "member" to include any person who contributes to  the

CPF  Fund  voluntarily.  Examples of such persons are housewives

and Singaporeans working overseas.  To encourage such persons to

save  for  their retirement and medical care, a new section  13B

will  be  introduced  in  the CPF Act  to  empower  the  Central

Provident Fund Board to receive voluntary CPF contributions from

such persons.  This amendment is in clause 3 of the Bill.

<br><br><i>Intra-account transfers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on intra-account transfers, the Finance Minister had

announced  in February 1998 that CPF savings in the Special  and

Retirement  Accounts  will  earn  higher  interest  rate.    The

interest rate will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>

be  1.5%  more than the Ordinary and Medisave Accounts' interest

rate  with effect from 1st July 1998.  In addition, CPF  members

are allowed to transfer their savings in the Ordinary Account to

the  Special  Account  up  to a cap of $40,000  in  the  Special

Account,  with no option of reversal of the moneys  transferred.

In  other  words,  once you transfer savings  into  the  Special

Account, they will remain locked up in the Special Account until

age 55.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 of the Bill inserts a new section 18B to

allow  a  CPF  member to apply to the CPF Board  to  transfer  a

portion  of his Ordinary Account savings to his Special Account,

and to provide the limit on the amount which may be transferred.

This is to allow the CPF member to receive a higher interest  on

his  CPF  savings  and  to  build  up  his  cash  component  for

retirement  purposes.   The transfer is only  permitted  if  the

amount of savings in the CPF member's Special Account is below a

prescribed  amount.  This prescribed amount is  set  at  $40,000

currently, in line with the eventual cash component of  the  CPF

Minimum Sum Scheme in the year 2003.

<br><br><i>Home Protection Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Home Protection Scheme, or otherwise known as HPS,

was introduced in 1981 to protect CPF members and their families

from  losing  their  HDB flats should a  member  die  or  become

incapacitated permanently before the housing loan is fully  paid

up.   Under normal circumstances, a member can only own one  HDB

flat  at  any  one time.  However, HDB gives upgraders  a  grace

period of six months to sell off their old flats after they have

purchased  and  been allocated their new flats.  In  fact,  this

grace period may even be extended if the upgrader has difficulty

selling  his  old flat and HDB will consider such  appeals.   So

there  are  occasions where HDB flat owners and CPF members  are

actually owning two HDB flats for more than six months.  HPS  is

a  compulsory mortgage reducing term insurance for  CPF  members

who  use  their CPF savings to service HDB loans.  Hence  during

this transitional period, a CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>

member  legally owns two HDB flats and has to pay  the  premiums

for two HPS insurance policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not the intention of the HPS to pay insurance

claims  on  two HDB flats for one CPF member should  he  die  or

become  incapacitated permanently before  the  housing  loan  is

fully  paid  up.  Clause 5 of the Bill therefore  enacts  a  new

section  30A to provide that no person may be insured under  the

HPS  for more than one HDB flat at any one time.  This provision

allows  the CPF Board to automatically terminate the  HPS  cover

for  a  CPF member's existing HDB flat upon the commencement  of

HPS  cover for his new HDB flat.  The CPF Board will refund  the

surrender  value of the HPS cover for the existing flat  to  the

member upon cessation of the cover.  With this amendment, should

a  CPF member die or become permanently incapacitated during the

transitional period when he legally owns two HDB flats, the  HPS

will  pay the insurance claim on the new flat while the member's

family  can  proceed to sell the existing flat and  receive  the

proceeds  of the sale after discharging the outstanding  housing

loan for the old flat.

<br><br><i>Enhancing the enforcement and recovery of CPF contributions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to the amendment concerning the

enforcement  and  recovery of CPF contributions.   Currently  it

takes  about 100 days to prosecute employers who have  defaulted

on  CPF payments.  That is more than three months to trace up on

an   employer   who  is  in  arrears  to  his   employee's   CPF

contribution.  This long period results in employers owing  more

CPF contributions to their employees because of the delay in the

prosecution  action.   This  delay is  mainly  due  to  existing

provisions  in  the CPF Act which stipulate the procedures  that

the CPF Board has to follow when recovering CPF arrears from the

employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF contributions form part of employees' salary.

Employees use their CPF savings for various commitments such  as

housing,  healthcare and insurance, apart from savings  for  old

age.   Hence, there is a need to ensure that the CPF Board deals

effectively and promptly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>

with  employers  who  have failed to pay CPF  contributions  for

their  employees within the prescribed time, and the Board  also

has  to  speedily  recover  these contributions  which  are  now

overdue.   A slow and protracted recovery process may  encourage

some employers to chalk up larger arrears at the expense of  the

employees.   The CPF Board's role is to safeguard  CPF  members'

interests  and  enforce  CPF payments to  ensure  that  members'

contributions are paid promptly.  Hence it is necessary to amend

the  CPF  Act  to  expedite the recovery of  CPF  arrears.   The

proposed  amendments in four areas will reduce the total  number

of  days  taken  to  recover CPF arrears to  about  60  days,  a

reduction of about 40 days.

<br><br><i>Public Prosecutor's sanction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first area is on the Public Prosecutor's sanction.

The existing provision in the CPF Act requires the CPF Board  to

get  the  Public  Prosecutor's sanction before the  Board  could

commence prosecution action against employers who have defaulted

in  CPF contributions.  Since the CPF Board has always and  will

continue  to  discharge its powers fairly and  impartially,  the

Public  Prosecutor has agreed that such prior  approval  is  not

necessary.   Hence,  clause 6 of the Bill repeals  the  existing

section  62  to remove the requirement of obtaining  the  Public

Prosecutor's  sanction before initiating prosecution  under  the

CPF Act.

<br><br><i>Notice to Attend Court</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 also inserts new sections 62 and 62A. The new

section  62  empowers a CPF Board officer to issue a  prescribed

notice to a defaulting employer requiring him to attend court in

lieu  of applying for a summons of court.  This amendment  would

allow  the  CPF Board officers to issue Notices to Attend  Court

similar  to  those  issued by the Traffic Police.   The  Traffic

Police  found that this provision had worked well for  them  and

80%  to  85%  of  the  offenders have paid their  fines  by  the

composition date.  Currently, Notices to Attend Court  are  also

issued  by agencies such as the Ministry of the Environment  and

the Ministry of Health for offences

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>

such   as   littering,  breeding  of  disease  bearing  insects,

operating  as a hawker without licence, and many other offences.

This  amendment  would  shorten  the  recovery  of  CPF  arrears

significantly, hence benefiting employees.

<br><br><i>Service of Notice to Attend Court/Summons</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new section 62A sets out the manner in which a

Notice  to  Attend Court issued under the new section  62  or  a

summons  issued  by a court may be served.  Under  the  existing

provision, summonses must be served on employers personally.  It

is  difficult  to locate the employers in most  of  the  default

cases,  hence  usually  many attempts have  to  be  made  before

substituted  service,  such  as  affixing  the  summons  at  the

employers'  premises  or advertisements in  the  newspapers,  is

allowed by the court.  Allowing the service of Notice to  Attend

Court  and summons, for example, by registered post would reduce

the  time  taken to serve such notices or summons from  about  3

weeks to only 2 to 3 days.  I would like to point out that other

statutory  boards  such as the HDB, URA  and  LTA  already  have

similar provisions in their respective legislation.

<br><br><i>Composition of offences</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, the CPF Board is empowered to compound any

offence under the Act for a sum not exceeding $200.  Composition

has  proven  to  be an effective way to deal with employers  who

have defaulted in CPF payments.  To enhance the effectiveness of

this  enforcement option, the Ministry proposes that the maximum

composition fine be raised to $500.  This amendment is reflected

in clause 7 of the Bill.

<br><br><i>Certification of Board on non-payment of contributions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill introduces a new section 66A to

provide  that a certificate issued by the CPF Board stating  the

amount  of  contributions  and interest  that  is  due  from  an

employer  is  to  be  treated as prima facie evidence  of  those

facts.  This is to replace the need for every

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>

affected  employee  to attend court as a witness.   The  use  of

certified  documents as prima facie evidence  can  be  found  in

other  legislation such as the Sale of Food Act and the  Patents

Act.   Under  the  Patents Act, for example, attendance  of  the

witness  is not necessary to prove authenticity of documents  or

entries authorised by the said Act.  A certificate signed by the

Registrar   can   be   admitted   as   prima   facie   evidence.

Nevertheless,  should the Court so require, the CPF  Board  will

ensure that affected members attend court as witnesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the removal of the need to seek Public Prosecutor's

sanction, issue of Notice to Attend Court, new service of Notice

to  Attend  Court  and the certification of Board  on  the  non-payment  of  contributions will save 40 days  from  the  arrears

recovery  process.   It  will  help to  prevent  employers  from

delaying payment of their employees' CPF contributions.

<br><br><i>Priority of Claims</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently the CPF Act gives the Board priority over

execution creditors who have taken out Writs of Seizure and Sale

against  the assets of employers.  However, the Board  does  not

have priority when creditors attach employers' bank accounts  or

seize  their  movable properties.  This had  resulted  in  cases

where  employees' CPF arrears could not be recovered.  Clause  9

of  the Bill therefore amends section 68 of the Act to allow the

CPF  Board  to have priority for CPF arrears over landlords  who

have taken a Writ of Distress against defaulting employers.  The

same clause also extends the Board's priority of claims to cover

garnishee order in cases where creditors have attached the  bank

accounts of the defaulting employers.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the amendments proposed in this Bill

will ensure that the provisions of the CPF Act will continue  to

be  relevant and in line with the objectives of the CPF  system.

The  amendments  will also remove existing rigidities  and  thus

better safeguard employees' interests by ensuring that their CPF

contributions are promptly paid.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  support  this  Amendment Bill.  I welcome  the  further

opening of the door to  voluntary contributions of CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few years, our economy has

enjoyed rapid  growth and the Government had accumulated  a  lot

of surpluses.  To share  the fruits of our economic success with

the people, the Government initiated the CPF Top-Up Scheme which

has  enabled  a  lot of people in Singapore to  have  their  CPF

accounts  topped  up  so  as to enjoy  better  benefits  as  CPF

members, such as MediShield and all kinds of protection schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our present economic situation, it is unlikely

that the Government will continue to top-up our CPF accounts  in

the next two years or so.   On this perspective, I must say that

this Amendment Bill is very timely.  It provides for people  who

do  not  have a regular employment or fixed income to  have  the

opportunity of enjoying the benefits provided by the CPF  scheme

through  voluntary contributions, especially  for  temporary  or

casual  workers and self-employed people who do not have regular

incomes,  such  as  private  tutors and  housewives.   With  the

amended  provisions  in  this Bill,  they  can  make   voluntary

contributions to their CPF accounts according to their own  free

will.   They  will  not  be excluded from the  CPF  scheme  just

because  they  are  unable  to submit  certified  statements  to

substantiate their incomes.  By so doing, these people enjoy the

benefit  of  being covered by the MediShield scheme for  medical

protection,  not  only for themselves but for  their  dependants

too.  With medical cost rising all the time, I think it is  very

important to have this kind of protection, particularly when the

coverage  of MediShield or MediShield Plus is being extended  to

75 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the amendment to provide for those people

who  are in  arrears in contributing to their employees' CPF  to

be summoned directly to court.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>

This  would  improve our enforcement efficiency and shorten  the

legal  procedure to make sure that the employees will get  their

CPF due to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceiling for composition fine is increased from $200 to

$500.  This  will have a better deterrent effect.  I would  like

to  ask  the  Minister  whether it  is  because  the  number  of

offenders has been increasing to such a great extent that it had

prompted   the  Government  to  raise  the  maximum  amount   of

composition  fine.   If  that  is  the  case,  will   the   $500

composition  fine  be  enough to achieve the  desired  deterrent

effect?   At  the same time, will the CPF Board   exercise  some

flexibility in their enforcement  by first allowing  the  errant

employers  the  opportunity to explain  the  reasons  for  their

default  in payment, before an appropriate composition  fine  is

offered?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing inter-account transfer by members is a measure to

be welcomed.  But I do not understand why it has to be done only

under  certain   circumstances.  Can we not allow  all  the  CPF

members to transfer their money from Ordinary account to Special

account  at  their  own  time,  at  their  own  convenience  and

according to their own wishes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the amendment to Section 9 of the Act which gives

priority  to claims for any sum due to the Fund so as to  better

protect the CPF members' interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I support the Amendment Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be

short and sharp.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the relevant amendments

that  have been made.  They are useful amendments because,  with

the  aging  population and many of those  who  have  very  small

accounts  in  their CPF, such a move for voluntary  contribution

would  help to provide support for them.  This is indeed  timely

because they can meet their old age needs, in terms of provision

of  social  security.  Sir, we need to provide a boost  to  make

this  scheme  more  successful because  voluntary  contributions

between account holders may be helpful to an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>

extent, but there are others who like to make cash contributions

to their family members and friends.  For such contributions, it

may  be  necessary  to  provide some incentives  for  those  who

contribute under this scheme by way of tax deduction.  This will

perhaps  encourage  more  people to transfer  savings  in  their

accounts to help others who are in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of them, who are not covered, have very low CPF

accounts.  The question is whether voluntary contribution itself

is  going to make any significant difference.  I would  like  to

ask the Minister whether there are any other efforts or plans in

which he would boost or reinforce this voluntary contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect is the Special Account, Sir. The transfer

or top-up of $40,000 in the Special Account is very useful.  But

what is of most concern to many people is that they need medical

support for their old age.  And to lock in such an amount in the

account  which  cannot  be  moved, is  not  in  a  way  helpful,

particularly  to  those  who are old  and  who  require  medical

treatment.   I  would  like  to  ask  whether  people  who   are

participating in this scheme by topping up their Special Account

can  be  allowed  to move some of their money  to  the  Medisave

account.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I get some clarification from the

Minister?  Sir, this is in regard to clause 3 of the Bill.   The

Minister  says  that voluntary contributions  can  be  given  by

housewives and people who are employed abroad.  I can  think  of

other  categories  of persons in Singapore who  will  be  making

voluntary  contributions,  such  as  the  self-employed,   small

businessmen, like the hawkers and shopkeepers, and of course big

businessmen who are well-off, and professionals.  I suppose that

for  small business people who make voluntary contributions,  it

can be said that they are in fact saving for their old age.  But

in  the  case of people who are well-off, who may own their  own

homes and in fact own one or two other investment properties and

who have a regular  income, not only from their employment but

from  their investments,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>

these   people  may  want   to   make   voluntary contributions

not for the purpose for which  the  CPF  Act  was enacted.   In

other words, they have got no worry about  saving for  their

old  age.  They are quite well-off already.   So  if these people

make voluntary contributions, they may be doing  it for other

reasons, probably to save on their income tax.  So  if they really

do that, and they also want to enjoy their Medisave, in  case

there is a worse scenario situation, they  are  taking advantage

of  the  CPF  system.    The  CPF  Act  was  set   up specifically

to make provision for workers to save for their old age.   So  if

this  group of people takes  advantage  of  these voluntary

contributions, they may do it for their own  purpose, as I said,

like tax savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to clarify what he means by

different  classes of members in the new section 13B.   Are  the

people  who  make voluntary contributions a class by itself,  or

are  they  different  from  the regular  workers  who  make  CPF

contributions?  Maybe the Minister could clarify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point about the lock-in to the Special Account has

been  mentioned by Dr Vasoo.  It says here with  a  strong  word

"irrevocable".   In other words, if he agrees  to  put  in  this

money  up to a maximum of $40,000, he cannot take it out anymore

until  he  probably reaches 55 years old.  Is there  any  escape

clause here where there is a real difficulty he could just  take

some funds out?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I know time is very

short  and  I have to rush through my response.  But,  first,  I

have  to  thank  the  hon. Members, Mr Yeo  and  Dr  Vasoo,  for

supporting this Amendment Bill.  I would address the  points  as

they have raised them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked whether there are more and more cases of

employers  committing offences under the Central Provident  Fund

Act.  While the number of such cases has not risen sharply as to

attract  special attention, the point is that the $200  compound

fine  limit had been set many years ago, and I think it is  time

to make an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>

adjustment.  If we do not do so, there may be some employers who

will  say,  "Since the fine is so little and my  employee's  CPF

contribution is so large and the interest rates being what  they

are  at  the  bank,  I  can  always defer  payment  of  the  CPF

contribution.   I will wait until I receive a Notice  to  Attend

Court,  then rush and pay. It is still worth my while to  be  in

arrears from time to time."  But I do not think that is  a  good

situation.   We should not encourage that.  We want to  serve  a

reminder  to  all  employers that they should  pay  up  the  CPF

contribution of their employees on time rather than wait.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the $500 compound fine enough? I would say at this

juncture,  yes, because it was set at $200 some years  ago.   We

are making a revision now.  If in the years to come, we discover

that,  again, it is not adequate as a deterrent, we  are  always

prepared to review it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we give the employers an opportunity to explain their

predicament  if they are unable to pay?  Yes, the CPF  Board  is

always  ready  to  listen  to  an employer  if  they  have  some

difficulty.   It  is  up to the employer  to  make  a  firm  and

concrete  proposal  to the CPF Board to repay  all  the  arrears

within  a certain timeframe, including the interests accumulated

on  the  arrears, so that the employees are not worse off.   The

Board will take into consideration such appeal but it has got to

be  assured that there is some payment coming because the  Board

will certainly want to safeguard the interest of the members  to

ensure  that it does not just allow the employer to prolong  the

process and, at the end of the day, there is nothing to claim on

behalf  of  the  employees.   I  think  that  would  be  a  very

undesirable situation.  While we are sympathetic, we  also  have

to remember that our first responsibility is really to safeguard

the interest of the CPF members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has asked whether there could be a tax deduction

to  encourage  more people to contribute voluntarily.   Firstly,

let me point out that most employed Singaporeans actually do not

pay  income  tax  already.   I think nearly  about  70%  of  the

employed  Singaporeans do not pay any personal income tax.   So,

income tax may

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>

not  be  that effective as an incentive.  Voluntary contribution

is  targeted at a group of people who are not working either  as

an employee or as a self-employed.  They do not have any taxable

income.  So tax incentive is also not applicable in this  sense.

Voluntary contribution is a totally free choice on the part of a

Singaporean who wants to put some money aside for his  old  age,

and who looks at the CPF as a very safe long-term investment, as

a  very secure place where he can put aside his old age savings,

knowing that the interests are guaranteed and that, in fact,  if

he  puts  the  money in the Special Account,  he  would  earn  a

premium interest of 1�% above the normal CPF interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which Dr Vasoo raised was, if I got it

correctly,  what  else would the Board do  to  help  members  to

increase  their  old-age savings.  This  move  to  increase  the

interest  that  is  being paid for the balance  in  the  Special

Account is one such effort on the part of the Board.  By  paying

1�%   interest  over and above the interest in the Ordinary  and

Medisave Accounts, it will in fact help many members to save  up

much more money in the Special Account for their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam and Dr Vasoo also mentioned the same point about

irreversibility or irrevocable decision to transfer  money  from

the Ordinary Account into the Special Accounts.  Members have to

understand  that the Special Account represents  very  long-term

savings.  A CPF member cannot withdraw the money in the  Special

Account  until  he reaches the age of 55.  So  he  is  making  a

commitment to leave this money for a fairly long term, which  is

why  the  Government can guarantee that we will pay 1�% interest

above  the  normal interest rate.  The normal interest  rate  is

calculated  on the basis of an average interest rate  of  banks'

savings  accounts  and one year term deposit accounts.   So  CPF

members  are  getting higher interest than  what  they  normally

would  get  if  they place their savings in a bank.   We  cannot

allow  a situation where people transfer money from the Ordinary

Account into the Special Account and then transfer it out as and

when they need it, ie, earn the extra interest and then take  it

out.  That would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>

defeat  the  whole purpose and the basis on which the  long-term

interest rate has been calculated to offer this additional 1�%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members must remember that the Ordinary Account is actually

money  available  on  demand for most CPF members.   It  is  not

locked  up  to the age of 55.  A CPF member uses the savings  in

his  Ordinary Account to pay his home mortgage as  and  when  he

needs  it.  He can use his Medisave to meet his medical expenses

as  and when he needs it.  He can even draw the savings from his

Ordinary  Account to invest in shares.  He can take it  out  and

put it into a bank as a fixed deposit if he thinks that the rate

there is better.  So there are many options for a CPF member  to

draw from his Ordinary Account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting the money in the Special Account is only one of the

options,  but  this  option carries with it certain  conditions.

And  one  of the conditions is that a CPF member cannot withdraw

it  at will until he reaches the age of 55.  I think we have  to

keep  it that way.  Otherwise, we lose the basis for paying  the

additional interest on the balance in the Special Account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam raised another point about different classes of

members.    Yes,  I  think  different  classes  of  members  are

necessary because we have employees who are  CPF members.   They

contribute  20% plus 20%.  We have the self-employed people  who

have  to  make  mandatory  Medisave contribution  but  voluntary

contribution for the Ordinary Account or Special Account.  So we

have  totally voluntary contributors who can contribute  as  and

when  they  want  and with whatever amount that  they  want  to.

There is no minimum contribution that they must comply with.  So

we need to create these different classes of members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other point is about people who contribute to CPF for

other  reasons  to take advantage of income tax.   Today,  self-employed people can already make voluntary contribution.   They,

of course, have to make mandatory contribution to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>

their  Medisave accounts.  But the self-employed already  enjoys

tax benefit from the CPF contribution up to 20% of his income or $14,400  per annum, whichever is the lower.  So there is already

a  provision  and,  in fact, it is an incentive  for  the  self-employed to make CPF contributions and to enjoy the tax  benefit

which  all employees enjoy.  And we should also not discriminate

against  the higher income people for wanting to put some  money

into  their CPF accounts, because Members have to remember  that

even the highest income employee also makes CPF contributions of

a  portion  of  his salary, ie, up to $6,000.  A person  may  be

earning tens of thousands of dollars but he also contributes CPF

up to a maximum of $6,000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Per month?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Per month. $6,000 of his salary per

month.   This is already allowed.  So we should not deny anybody

who wants to make voluntary contribution into a newly opened CPF

account  to put aside some money for his old age.  I  think,  on

balance, we should allow and welcome voluntary contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>AND OFF-BUDGET MEASURES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the FY98 Budget

Statement, I informed the House that the Singapore economy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>

would feel the full impact of the regional economic crisis  this

year.  I announced several tax concessions and other measures to

help  ease business costs during this economic slowdown, and  to

help  local businesses obtain working capital in a situation  of

tight liquidity.   I also said that the Government would monitor

the  state  of the economy closely and stood ready to  implement

appropriate  off-budget  measures  if  the  economy  slows  down

sharply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the external economic environment has

deteriorated significantly.  The US and the EU are still growing

robustly,  but Japan has slipped into recession.   Closer  home,

the  regional  economic outlook has also  worsened.   After  the

change  of  government in May, Indonesia  is  now  undergoing  a

difficult   process   of  political  transition   and   economic

reconstruction.   The negative growth rates  registered  in  the

first quarter of 1998 in Malaysia, Hong Kong and South Korea are

indications of tougher times for Asian economies in  the  months

ahead.  The weakening Yen has also led to fears of another round

of  currency contagion.  Regional currencies have therefore come

under pressure.   The prospects are for continued turbulence and

uncertainty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's financial and economic fundamentals are good.

But   this  deteriorating  external  environment  has  adversely

affected  us.   This is inevitable, given the  openness  of  our

economy  and  our  close linkages with the region.   The  latest

figures  confirm  that growth momentum in Singapore  has  indeed

slowed significantly.  GDP growth moderated to 5.9% in the first

quarter  of 1998, from 7.8% in 1997.  MTI's preliminary estimate

for  the second quarter, based on figures for April and May,  is

that  growth  has  slowed further to 1.9%, with  the  seasonally

adjusted annualised figure at 0.2%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector has slowed down, due to weaker

global demand and the regional economic crisis.  The outlook for

the  worldwide  electronics industry has turned  less  sanguine.

Producers  are  cautious  about demand  and  wary  about  rising

inventories.   The commerce sector continues to be  affected  by

the decline in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>

entrepot  trade,  slower tourist arrivals  and  weaker  domestic

consumer spending.  This has in turn affected the transport  and

communications sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial services sector has also slowed considerably

as  activity  in  the Asian Dollar Market and  foreign  exchange

market  remains  weak,  and domestic bank lending  continues  to

slacken.   The  construction sector is still  supported  by  the

healthy  pipeline  of  major  public sector  projects,  although

private construction activity has slowed down drastically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Composite Leading Index, which leads economic activity

by  about three quarters, has continued to fall since the fourth

quarter of 1997.  The latest survey of business expectations  in

March  1998  also showed that the outlook for most  sectors  had

deteriorated, especially the commerce and services sectors which

are more exposed to the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade figures confirm the growth estimates. Our trade

performance has been weak. Non-oil domestic exports in  the  two

months  of  April and May fell by 3.2% compared to a  year  ago.

Electronics exports contracted by 4.8%, while non-oil re-exports

fell by 2.4% due to a reduction in regional demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the pessimistic external environment and domestic

sentiments,  MTI expects economic growth in the second  half  of

the year to remain very weak, and possibly even become negative.

However, for the full year of 1998, we should still see positive

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI's previous GDP growth forecast of 2.5% to 4.5% for 1998

was  made  in  February  this  year.   After  factoring  in  the

substantial  regional developments that have arisen since  then,

as   well   as   possible  future  downsides  in  the   external

environment,  MTI  has revised this forecast down,  to  0.5%  to

1.5%.

<br><br><i>Additional measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax and budgetary measures announced in my FY98 Budget

Statement  were  based  on  the economic  outlook  in  February,

against  a  volatile  regional setting.   Rather  than  reacting

prematurely, the Government decided first to watch

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>

how  external  events would unfold, and ascertain the  pace  and

extent of the economic slowdown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that developments are clearer, and we have revised our

growth  forecast downwards, we are ready to act to mitigate  the

impact  of the regional troubles on our economy.  The Government

has  therefore  decided  to implement a  package  of  additional

measures  worth a total of $2 billion to cut business costs  and

stimulate the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In carrying out this package of additional measures, we

should  recognize that the primary cause of Singapore's  current

economic  slowdown  is  the  sharp  fall  in  external   demand,

especially regional demand. It is not domestic problems inherent

in our own economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in contrast to the 1985/86 recession where the

primary  cause was the loss of competitiveness of the  Singapore

economy.   In  particular,  in  the  early  1980s,  labour  cost

increases  had exceeded productivity growth significantly.    As

these  were internal problems, we could rectify them swiftly  by

changing policies and making our own adjustments.  Together with

the  quick recovery of global demand, the Singapore economy  was

able to bounce back within one year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, our export competitiveness position has not been

too  adversely  affected, although we cannot be  complacent  and

will  have  to  monitor the situation for specific sectors.  Our

unit  labour cost and unit business cost have been stable. While

the   Singapore  dollar  has  indeed  appreciated  substantially

against  the  baht, ringgit, rupiah, and won, it has depreciated

against most OECD currencies. On a trade weighted basket  basis,

the  Singapore dollar has appreciated only slightly. Furthermore

our  inflation  has been low, whereas several of these  regional

countries are suffering from high inflation and cost of  capital

as a result of their weaker currencies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems we face this time are largely outside our

control.    We  cannot  change  the  external  environment,   or

determine the course of events in the region.  However,  we  can

cushion the fallout from the regional economic slowdown  on  the

Singapore  economy.   We  should also  use  the  opportunity  to

consolidate  our strengths and further enhance our capabilities.

In  this  respect, the package (Cols. 359 - 360)  of  additional

budget  measures  has three broad objectives  :  (i)  to  reduce

business  costs;  (ii)  to  build  economic  infrastructure  and

capabilities;  and (iii) to help stabilize specific  sectors  of

the Singapore economy.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980629/19980629-HA-0690359.htm">Package - OFF-BUDGET PACKAGE (Cols. 359 - 360)</a><br>



<br><br><i>Land - Rentals and Charges</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our limited land resource, land-related costs like

rentals are a significant proportion of business cost.  To  help

ease   the   pressures  of  land-related  business  costs,   the

Government will implement the following measures.

<br><br><i>Additional Property Tax Rebate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in addition to the 15% property tax rebate which was

announced during the FY98 Budget Statement, the Government  will

grant  an  additional 40% property tax rebate on commercial  and

industrial properties for the year commencing 1st July 1998  for

a  total  of 55%.  The additional revenue loss to Government  is

estimated at $400 million.  HDB and JTC will pass on all of this

rebate  to  their tenants and lessees.  Likewise, the Government

strongly urges private sector landlords to pass on at least half

of this rebate to their tenants.

<br><br><i>Rental rebates by JTC & HDB</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, JTC and HDB will increase the rental concessions to

their tenants and lessees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of JTC's continuing efforts to adjust its rents to

varying  market conditions, JTC will reduce its posted rents  by

up  to  12%.   This  will benefit new tenants  and  those  whose

tenancies come up for renewal.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, JTC will also grant enhanced rental rebates of

up  to  20%,  depending on how far the existing rents  are  from

JTC's  posted  rents.  About three quarters of JTC  tenants  and

lessees,  who are currently paying more than 80% of  the  posted

rent,  will enjoy the full reduction of 20%.  Those paying  less

than  30%  of  posted rent, about 2% of the total,  will  get  a

freeze in rents.  The rest of the tenants and lessees will enjoy

pro-rated   net  reductions.  These  measures  supersede   those

announced at the FY98 Budget, and are estimated to cost  JTC  an

additional $200 million over a 12-month period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, HDB will reduce its posted rents in line with

market rents.  For industrial properties, HDB revises its posted

rents  every  quarter in line with the market.  It  has  already

reduced posted rents by 10% in the first half of this year,  and

will  implement  a  further reduction of up to  5%  in  the  3rd

quarter.  In addition, HDB will also grant a net rebate  on  its

industrial  land leases of up to 20%.  Tenants of HDB industrial

and commercial space will enjoy a flat 10% rebate on their gross

rents.  These rebates are estimated to cost about $80 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC and HDB will be releasing more details on these

additional concessions shortly.

Rental rebates by Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAAS will also extend a 15% rebate on the rentals for its

office,  warehouse and retail tenants for 12 months with  effect

from  1st  July  1998.  In addition, it will continue  with  the

rebate  on airport concession fees which was given in the  first

half  of 1998.  These additional measures are estimated to  cost

CAAS $54 million.

<br><br><i>Labour Costs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour costs form a significant proportion of business cost

in Singapore.   Appropriate wage restraint will be a key measure

to  keep  labour costs down.  The priority must  be  to  protect

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting wage costs was also a key response during the 1985

recession.   However, at that time our wage system

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>

was  too rigid.  To trim wage costs, we had no choice but to cut

the  employers' CPF contribution rate.  After the recession,  we

set  up the flexible wage system.  Over the years, we have built

up a variable component of wages which can serve as a buffer and

be  reduced during difficult times.  Today, in the civil service

the  variable  component has increased to  over  20%  of  annual

wages,  while the corresponding figure in the private sector  is

about 16%.  This sizeable variable wage component will provide a

useful  first  line  of defence to reduce wage  costs.   As  the

National  Wages  Council has pointed out, wage restraint  is  an

integral part of our response to the current problems, for  both

the private and public sectors.  The civil service will take the

lead in this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February, the Government announced a freeze on salaries

of  Ministers and senior civil servants this year.  In line with

NWC recommendations, the civil service also reduced the mid-year

portion of the Annual Variable Component (AVC) to � month,  from

the  usual  _ month.  At the same time, the Government indicated

that  the  end-of-year AVC would be reviewed when  the  economic

situation and outlook became clearer. The deteriorating  outlook

has made it more probable that we will have to reduce the end-of-year  AVC.   We will decide on the actual adjustment nearer  the

end  of  the  year, taking into account the economic  conditions

prevailing at that time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage restraint will complement Government's ongoing efforts

and  new  initiatives  for  worker training,  job  matching  and

upgrading  the  employability  of  Singaporean  workers.   These

include   the  Education  Training  Fund  and  various  manpower

development  and  training  initiatives  under  EDB's   Economic

Development Assistance Scheme (EDAS).  Recently, the  Government

and  SDF  contributed  $50 million each  to  expand  the  Skills

Redevelopment  Programme  (SRP).   The  SRP  provides   training

courses  to raise the employability of less educated  and  older

workers by equipping them with certifiable skills, so that  they

can find suitable employment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will extend an additional $20 million grant

to  expand  the training facilities and capacity to support  the

SRP.  This includes establishing a new Skills Development Centre

to  cater to growing demand for training places, and expand  the

range  of  courses  through  the  Singapore  National  Employers

Federation  and  the  network  of  industry  associations.   The

Ministry  of  Manpower will be announcing further  details  when

they are finalised.

<br><br><i>Costs of Capital</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability and cost of capital to support business

activities  are  a  third  area of concern  amongst  businessmen

during  this period of uncertainty.  Interest rates have  indeed

risen in recent months, but this is largely a reflection of  the

rising  risk  premium  in Asia.  In fact,  Singapore's  interest

rates remain relatively low, compared to other countries in Asia

with perhaps the exception of Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls from the public for the Government to

reduce  interest  rates  and  to  encourage  banks  to  be  more

forthcoming in their lending.  However, the scope for doing this

is  very  limited.  Given the openness of our financial  system,

MAS  can  only manage the exchange rate.  The level of  interest

rates  is  set by market forces based on foreign interest  rates

and  market  expectation of the movement of our  exchange  rate.

For  individual  loans, banks set the interest  rates  based  on

their cost of funds and their assessment of the credit risks  of

individual borrowers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the MAS were to start pumping in liquidity to bring down

interest  rates,  foreign  investors  would  move  out  of   the

Singapore  dollar.  And then, we will end up  with  even  higher

interest  rates because investors will start demanding a  higher

premium  to hold Singapore dollar deposits.  The banks would  in

turn  have  to raise their lending rates because their  cost  of

funds would have gone up.  So it is better for interest rates to

be determined by the market.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither can Government instruct the banks to extend loans

to  companies.  These are commercial decisions which  the  banks

themselves have to take.  The Government is not in a position to

second guess their judgments, or to take responsibility for  the

consequences if the loans turn bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what the Government can do to help local

businesses  continue to have sufficient working  capital  is  to

provide  support  through the Local Enterprise Financing  Scheme

(LEFS).  Under this scheme, banks undertake the necessary credit

assessment, while the Government co-shares the risks with  them.

This  is  a practical way to help local enterprises address  the

problem of credit availability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the FY98 Budget the Government enhanced the LEFS scheme,

to increase the loan line to $1.1 billion. We also increased the

co-sharing of risks by Government and the maximum loan quantums,

and  extended  the scheme to cover more local enterprises.   The

response   so  far  to  the  enhanced  LEFS  scheme   has   been

encouraging.   The Government will now increase  the  LEFS  loan

line  further, to $2 billion and more if necessary. We will also

study  further enhancements to the scheme to respond to  changes

in the credit situation.

<br><br><i>Services Charges</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fees and service charges are a fourth area of business

costs containment which Government will address.

Suspension of Parking Surcharge Scheme

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a surcharge of $60 per lot per month is levied

on all non-residential car parks with at least 5 parking lots in

and  around the Restricted Zone (RZ).  The surcharge supplements

the  Area  Licensing  Scheme (ALS) as  a  road  usage  restraint

measure to keep traffic free flowing within the CBD.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retailers have been asking the Government to suspend

this Parking Surcharge Scheme for some time.  We were unable  to

do  so  earlier  because  the Parking Surcharge  Scheme  was  an

important  component  of  the total  traffic  management  system

within the CBD.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>

Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) scheme will be a more flexible and

effective  way to control traffic congestion. With the extension

of  the ERP to the Restricted Zone from 1st September 1998,  the

Land  Transport Authority (LTA) will be suspending  the  Parking

Surcharge Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspension will benefit the owners of car parks

currently under surcharge.  The Government urges these owners to

pass  on  their savings in the form of lower parking charges  to

benefit  their tenants, retailers, and motorists who  use  their

car  parks.   This measure is estimated to cost  $37  million  a

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retailers in the CBD have also requested that ALS hours be

shortened on Saturdays to encourage shoppers to drive  into  the

CBD.   With the implementation of the ERP for the CBD,  the  LTA

will  be  able to make this adjustment as well. The Ministry  of

Communications  will release the details in a few  weeks'  time,

when it announces full details of the new ERP charges.

<br><br><i>Port-Related Tariffs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to market conditions and customer requirements

on  an  on-going  basis, PSA Corporation  has  already  extended

various rebates to its shipping customers through its customised

agreements.   Similarly,  it  has  reduced  its  distripark  and

warehouse rentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shippers who use Jurong Port, JTC will also offer a 20%

rebate  on  Jurong Port tariffs with effect from 1st July  1998.

This is estimated to save $20 million for some 1,000 companies.

<br><br><i>Telecommunications Tariffs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, as part of its regular schedule of tariff

reductions, Singapore Telecoms has informed the Government  that

it will be offering further rate reductions on its International

Direct   Dialling,  Subscriber  Trunk  Dialling,  Local   Leased

Circuit,  International Leased Circuit, and Frame Relay services

beginning  the  second  half of this year.   These  changes  are

expected to result in customer savings totalling $100 million.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Electricity Tariffs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since corporatisation, Singapore Power has made substantial

productivity  gains,  reducing  costs  and  improving  financial

returns.  It  will give a one-off 3.5% rebate  on  the  non-fuel

component of electricity tariff for 1 year with effect from  1st

July  1998.   This is equivalent to a 2.6% reduction in  average

electricity tariff and is estimated to result in cost savings of

about  $81  million  for all users.  This is separate  from  any

adjustments  which  will  be  made  on  the  fuel  component  of

electricity  tariffs in line with movements in fuel  cost  every

quarter.

<br><br><i>Water Tariffs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not hold back or reduce the PUB water

tariff  increases for households, scheduled for  1st  July.  The

increases are a long term strategic move to get water tariffs to

reflect  the true scarcity value of water in Singapore,  and  to

make   Singaporeans  conscious  of  the  vital   importance   of

conserving water.  The increases will not cause any hardship  to

lower income households, as they will be fully offset by the PUB

rebates and service and conservancy charge grants for the HDB 1-4 room flat dwellers.

<br><br><i>Economic Infrastructure/Capabilities Building</i>

<br><i>Public Sector Projects</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the open nature of our economy, it is difficult to

stimulate  domestic economic activity through  pump  priming  or

boosting consumption.  However, even as we seek to reduce  costs

to  maintain our competitiveness, there are projects  which  the

Government  can  undertake  which  contribute  to  building  our

economic infrastructure and enhancing our capabilities  for  the

longer  term.  To put in place such economic infrastructure  and

capabilities for the future, Government will speed up several on-going  public sector infra-structure projects as well  as  bring

forward  suitable new development projects.  In total, close  to

$1.9  billion  worth  of  new  development  projects  have  been

approved.   Together with the on-going projects  which  will  be

speeded  up,  it  will  result in an estimated  additional  $670

million in new disbursements in FY98 alone.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education will continue to be the key focus, accounting for

over  40% of the newly approved projects.  Human talent  remains

our  most  precious resource and we want to develop  it  to  the

maximum.   Major  projects  brought  forward  will  include  the

expansion  of our Primary School Building Programme to  increase

the  number  of  Primary schools to be built in new  and  mature

towns  from  18 to 27; the incorporation of IT into Primary  and

Secondary Schools under construction; upgrading of NUS and  NTU;

and  enhanced computer facilities at our polytechnics.  MOE will

also   expand   its  recruitment  of  teachers  to   raise   the

effectiveness of the education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic infrastructure will be the other area of focus.

Key projects include increased investment for commercial rollout

of  Singapore One; Jurong Island development; and development of

industrial  land.   We  will also provide additional  funds  for

EDB's  Economic  Development Assistance Scheme Phase  III  which

provides  loans  and grants support for companies  and  manpower

initiatives,  and for TDB to undertake more trade promotion  and

facilitation work.

<br><br><i>Measures For Specific Sectors</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from cost reduction and infrastructure enhancement

measures, the Government will adopt several specific measures to

help  stabilise and strengthen certain sectors of  the  economy.

This  is  to ensure that such sectors, whose health affects  the

rest of the economy, are not subject to severe stress.

<br><br><i>Property Market</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property market is one area of particular concern. A

weak property market can affect confidence and asset values, and

also have repercussions on the financial sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1997 and again during the FY98 Budget

Statement,  Government  made  adjustments  to  its  land   sales

programme, to avoid aggravating the excess supply in the market.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last review, the property market situation has

continued  to  weaken.   To  help  stabilise  the  market,   the

Government will adopt the following additional measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will suspend sale of sites for private

residential,  executive condominiums and commercial  development

for the rest of 1998 and 1999, except for the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Sengkang site to tie in with the development of the

MRT/LRT station and bus interchange in Sengkang New Town.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Clarke Quay MRT site to tie in with the development of

the North-East MRT line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Four small infill sites within the Chinatown

Conservation Area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will resume selling a steady supply of

land  when  the  property market recovers. We  will  review  the

situation  at the end of 1999 to decide whether to  resume  land

sales in the year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will suspend the 5% per annum premium that is

currently levied on developers of private residential properties

for  every year of extension of their Project Completion  Period

(PCP).   Developers can now apply for extension of PCP up  to  8

years   without   penalty.   The  suspension   will   apply   to

applications made before the end of 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will allow the reassignment of government land

sale  parcels, as a temporary measure, until the  end  of  1999.

This  will  allow consolidation within the property  development

industry,  as some successful tenderers may no longer  be  in  a

financial position to complete the development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we will defer payment of stamp duty by purchasers

of  uncompleted properties until TOP or time of subsequent sale,

whichever is earlier.  This will also apply to subsequent buyers

of  an  uncompleted property. It will help to improve  the  cash

flow  of  property  purchasers.  This is  a  refinement  of  the

measure  introduced  during the May 1996  property  curbs.   The

estimated revenue impact on Government is $85 million.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development will be announcing

more details of these measures separately.

<br><br><i>Financial Sector</i>

<br><br><i>Tax Deduction for Bank Provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the property market, another key area is our

financial  sector.   Our banking system  is  strong  and  sound.

However, to encourage banks to make adequate provisions for loan

exposure to the region and to further promote stability  in  the

banking  sector, the Government has decided to lift the  current

3%  limit on tax deduction for general provisions made by  banks

and  merchant  banks for Year of Assessment 1999, provided  such

provisions  exceeding 3% are approved by the Monetary  Authority

of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General provisions exceeding 3% will be brought to tax when

they are written back to the bank's Profit & Loss Account later.

The  tax rate to be applied will be the tax rate prevailing when

the provisions were made.  If at the end of 5 years, the general

provisions still exceed 3%, the provisions in excess of 3%  will

be  brought back to tax.  Again, the tax rate to apply  will  be

that prevailing at the time when the provisions were made.

<br><br><i>Stamp Duty for Contract Notes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Government has also decided to

suspend  the stamp duty on contract notes for share transactions

for  one  year,  with effect from 30th June 1998.   This  is  in

recognition   of  the  marked  weakness  in  the   stock-broking

industry.   Compared to the average monthly  turnover  in  1997,

stock market turnover in the month of May 1998 declined by  over

40% in value terms.  Consequently, earnings for stockbrokers  as

a group have also fallen sharply.  The immediate outlook for the

industry  also remains weak.  The suspension of stamp duty  will

help  to lower transaction costs.  This measure is estimated  to

cost the Government about $50 million.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Hotel Sector</i>

<br><i>Refurbishment Of Hotels</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitality sector has been one of the most severely

hit.   Tourist arrivals have declined by about 17% in the  first

five  months  of  this year.  Hotel occupancy has  also  fallen.

Government  will  give  a  tax  allowance  of  up  to  150%  for

qualifying expenditure incurred in the refurbishment of  hotels,

to  encourage  hotels to upgrade during this lull period.   This

incentive is applicable for a period of 5 years and focused more

on hotels in the core zone.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole package of measures will inject an estimated $2

billion  into  the  economy.  Of this,  about  $1.6  billion  is

expected  to  affect  the  Budget balance  directly.   Based  on

revised  revenue and expenditure estimates, the introduction  of

the  package  will  result in a budget  deficit  of  about  $800

million  for FY98.  The Government believes that this  level  of

budget  deficit, relative to the size of our economy  and  at  a

difficult  time  like this, is still in line  with  our  prudent

approach towards fiscal policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small open economy with extensive links to the region,

we  cannot  generate  strong economic  growth  through  our  own

actions, so long as the regional environment and external demand

remains depressed.  Sustained resumption of economic growth  can

only  come  about  with the stabilisation and  recovery  of  the

regional economies and increased global demand for the goods and

services we produce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must brace ourselves for slower economic growth during

the  next  few years of regional transition and recovery.   Some

industries  and companies will feel the fall in business  demand

and profits more acutely than others.  Some may have to merge or

relocate.  Retrenchments will increase as businesses consolidate

and  re-structure themselves.  This process will be painful  but

we  must  accept  it  as the only way to adapt  to  the  changed

economic conditions and resume growth again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to monitor the external and

domestic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>

economic situation closely and take additional suitable measures

where necessary to maintain the framework for economic activity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more retrenchments this year, workers should have more

realistic  expectations,  accept  wage  restraint  and   retrain

themselves  to  acquire new capabilities and remain  employable.

New  jobs  are being created, but Singaporeans must acquire  the

necessary skills and knowledge to perform these jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their part, companies should streamline their

operations,  improve  their  efficiency  and  productivity,  and

upgrade  their  workers.   They too should  make  the  necessary

adjustments  to  stay  the  course and  position  themselves  to

capitalise on the opportunities when the region recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional economic crisis poses us a formidable

challenge.    But  there  is  no  reason  to   be   daunted   or

disheartened.   Our  financial  and  economic  fundamentals  are

sound. We do not suffer from the problems which beset some other

regional countries.  Analysts and investors know this. To  quote

a   recent  report  by  SG  Securities  Research,  "Overall  the

Singapore economy will face a difficult environment but, like  a

well  maintained  ship with plenty of ballast,  state-of-the-art

navigational  facilities and a good crew, will  safely  navigate

the  choppy  waters  and not only stay afloat  but  slowly  move

against  the  storm".   By taking appropriate  measures  now  to

counter  the  adverse conditions, and to develop our  long  term

potential,  we  will emerge more resilient and competitive  when

the region recovers.  [Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I like to take this

occasion  to ask the Minister a few questions.  First,  I  would

like  to  congratulate him for having presented a  comprehensive

and  a  well-done  Off-Budget Budget.  Reading  his  speech,  it

sounds  really like a Budget session to us.  And I  believe  the

Minister  has  put in a lot of thoughts by introducing  measures

that are able to stimulate the economy and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>

bring us back to a good footing.  I am particularly impressed by

the  Minister's coverage on how he intends to cut down corporate

expenses and costs.  In this respect, I like to congratulate the

Minister  for having introduced many new cost-cutting  measures,

especially by JTC, HDB, CAAS and various other quarters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister a few questions. First,

on   the  proposed  property  tax  rebate  for  commercial   and

industrial properties, which is a very substantial 40%.  Why  is

it that the Minister did not also include the residential sector

as a component to enjoy this rebate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that for this entire Budget package,

there will be a negative budget of $800 million.  It seems to be

a  very prime pumping Budget.  May he explain whether this  $800

million  negative is just for operating budget or does  it  also

include the capital expenditure of the Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of interest rates, of course, the Minister

explained  that  the  Government cannot ask  banks  to  be  more

accommodating.   But  I think the Government revenue  collection

agencies  can  be  more accommodating.  In their  collection  of

rates,  fees,  various  payments,  perhaps  the  Government  can

instruct  the  Government agencies like JTC, HDB, PSA  and  even

IRAS  to be more accommodating.  Since times are difficult, many

companies  and  individuals are facing difficulties  in  meeting

cash flow requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that the Minister has come out with a

good  package  for  a  specific sector, which  is  the  property

sector.   I  note that the measures are very well conceived  and

well  thought through.  Once again, we would like to appeal that

this  80-20%  payment between the bank and the individual  might

also be a point that the Minister would like to review, since it

is an item that can help purchasers in their cash flow.  Perhaps

they  can  use their CPF savings for that 20%.  This might  help

them  to  buy  properties,  especially for  first-time  property

purchasers who may find that this is the time for them to  enter

the market if they are able to find the finances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Leong, may I remind you that you are

not allowed to make a speech.  Please ask your questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Yes, I will ask two more questions, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the Minister how come he did not consider the

foreign worker levy and the foreign maid levy as components  for

cost  cutting.  These are very heavy costs to the employers  and

they  have  to incur substantial costs to employ some  of  these

foreign workers.  For families which employ foreign maids,  they

also can look for some form of relief for their households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I note the Minister has not provided any

particular incentive for the individual.  Could he also  explain

why in this case he has not considered giving, say,  an increase

in  the tax relief from 5% to 10% that was given last year.   In

this  particular  package,  I  do  not  see  any  provision  for

individuals  to  improve  on their own cash  flow  and  increase

spending, so as to help stimulate the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like

my  colleague before me, I would like to thank the Minister  for

Finance  for the very comprehensive off-Budget measures.   I  am

sure they will be welcomed by a lot of corporate business people

as  well  as property developers.   But I would like to ask  why

the  Minister has not considered measures to stimulate  domestic

consumption, because I notice most of them are more cost cutting

measures for companies.  There are not enough measures given  to

the individuals to put more disposable income into their pockets

and  help to stimulate consumption.  For example, I do not  know

whether the Minister would like to consider giving more time  to

the  taxpayers to pay their income tax over a longer  period  of

time  and  also,  for example, the domestic and  foreign  worker

levies  could  perhaps be reduced, so that there  will  be  more

disposable income for people to spend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of property purchase, the Minister may want to

take a look again at this 20% which is now to be paid for in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>

cash when one buys a property.  Perhaps the Minister may want to

consider allowing both CPF and cash to be used to help stimulate

the property market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is common

knowledge  that the bank interest rates will affect the  ability

of  Singaporeans  to  service their loans  and  the  ability  of

businesses  to stay afloat under the current economic situation.

I  wonder  why the Government has not introduced any measure  to

influence the banks to reduce interest rates so as to  ease  the

burden of borrowers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I applaud

the  Minister for Finance for some of the measures he  announced

today.  I have a number of questions for him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the projection of our economic growth of 0.5-1.5%, has

the  $2  billion  package, which has just been  announced,  been

taken  into  account in the projection?  The $2 billion  package

would have some stimulative effect on the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the budget deficit of $800 million, I would like

the Minister to explain whether this will have a negative impact

on the Singapore dollar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my colleagues have already mentioned measures to

stimulate consumption.  I hope the Minister would not  take  too

severe  a  stand on the Annual Variable Component (AVC),  ie,  a

further substantial cut in the AVC which he intends to do if the

economy  worsens,  because this will  only  make  the  situation

worse.  So I hope the Annual Variable Component will not be  cut

substantially.  If we send a wrong message that the AVC will  be

cut,  we will end up like the situation in Japan whereby a  one-off tax rebate had no effect on their economy at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another question on interest rates. The Minister

has  mentioned  that  the Government has no  control  on  banks'

credit.  But,  unfortunately, there are many small  and  medium-sized  companies today which are actually facing a credit crunch

from   banks,   all   because  bankers  are  afraid   to   lend.

Irrespective of whether the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>

companies are good or bad, banks take a very blunt approach  and

I  think the Minister should address this issue to see how  this

credit  crunch  can be eased for many of the small  and  medium-sized companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Minister said that we have no control on

interest  rates and yet just a few days ago, the Prime  Minister

of  Malaysia, at the UMNO general assembly, indicated  that  the

economy  in Malaysia would have a speedier recovery if  interest

rates  in Singapore were reduced.  It was reported in the  press

that he said, "If interest rates rise, there would be an outflow

of  money  from this country [meaning Malaysia]."  Sir,  if  the

Prime  Minister of Malaysia says that, should we not be  a  good

neighbour and find ways to reduce interest rates?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister mentioned

that  the new forecast for this year will be 0.5%-1.5%.   If  we

assume  a  productivity growth of 2% and the workforce expansion

of  1%,  it  means that the unemployment rate in Singapore  this

year is likely to reach between 3-5%.  Next year, if we continue

to  grow at a slower pace of about 1%, then it is possible  that

unemployment may reach as high as 5-7% by the end of next  year.

I  would  like  to ask the Minister in what way  the  off-Budget

measures  will help us not just to contain the slowdown  on  the

loss  of  jobs  today but, more importantly, contribute  to  the

speeding  up  of the creation of new jobs in 1998 and  1999,  so

that,  hopefully, unemployment would not get out of  control  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Hu, would you like to give your answers to

the questions raised?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I will answer the questions in

turn.   Mr Leong Horn Kee asked why the property tax rebate  has

not been extended to the private residential sector.  The answer

is  fairly  straightforward.  The private residential sector  is

already  paying very low property tax of 4%.  In addition,  with

the GST rebates introduced over the last few years and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>

other  offsets,  about  70% of the population  of  Singapore  no

longer pay property tax, particularly the HDB sector.  So  there

is really little reason to give them further rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know why the Government should not be more

accommodative on interest rates and fees charged.  I  think  the

impact  of interest rates on fee collections is that the amounts

are  so  small  and  I do not think it is going  to  affect  the

economy  very  much.  But I will ask our officials  to  be  more

reasonable in pressing people who find difficulty in  paying  on

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked why we have not reduced the amount of

cash  required to purchase properties from 80% to 70%.  We  have

said  many  times that this is undesirable.  The last  thing  we

want  to do in a situation of an economic downturn is to  induce

people to increase their debt liabilities which, if uncontrolled

and  later if they should lose their jobs, would have  a  severe

repercussion not only on the individual but on the  banks  which

lend such money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also wants to know why we have not cut the foreign

worker  levy.   This was explained in the earlier  question  and

answer  session because a reduction of foreign worker levy  will

merely  induce  companies to increase their  intake  of  foreign

workers which we do not want at this point of time.  In the case

of  the domestic maid levy, even at the current rate, demand has

not  slackened.   So  a cut at this time would  merely  increase

demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had anticipated the question why nothing has been done

for  the  individual.  I would like to remind him that I started

off by saying that the package of measures we are introducing is

focused entirely, in this present case, on getting companies  to

be  viable.  Our main objective is to reduce costs so that  they

can   remain   in   business  and  ensure  employment.    Giving

concessions  to individuals to stimulate the economy  will  have

very  marginal  value  at  this point  of  time.   For  example,

increased private consumption is not going to help companies  in

the  export sector.  Our priority is to help the businesses stay

viable so that they can preserve jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also answers the question raised by Mr Lew Syn Pau on

why  we have done nothing for the individual.  I would point out

that  we have, in fact, done something for the individual in  my

earlier  Budget  in  March where we gave 5% rebate  on  personal

income  tax and rebates on HDB rents and S&C charges.   For  the

time  being,  we do not consider it necessary to increase  these

rebates  because  its  effect on domestic  consumption  will  be

marginal in helping us recover from our present dilemma.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew also asked about the domestic maid levy and the

answer is what I have just said to Mr Leong.  On the use of  CPF

for  housing,  we do not want to increase the individual's  debt

burden this time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked why Government is not doing

anything  to reduce interest rates.  I will answer this question

together with the question raised by Mr Chng Hee Kok on interest

rates in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say has asked what Government is going to do to

stimulate  the  recovery  so as not  to  allow  unemployment  to

increase.  There are several ways we have proposed to  do  this.

Firstly,   by   reducing  business  costs.   This   will   allow

businesses,  which  may face difficulties  keeping  their  staff

because  they  are  unprofitable,  to  remain  in  business  and

therefore   protecting   jobs.    Our   investments    in    new

infrastructure  are also to ensure that we continue  to  attract

foreign  investments.  And we have large programmes through  the

EDB  to  co-invest in new ventures and EDB is actively  scouring

the  world  for new investments.  And through the generation  of

new types of industries, particularly high-tech ones, we hope to

protect future jobs or generate new jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok has asked whether the $800 million deficit

will  affect  the  Singapore dollar.  I would hardly  think  so,

because  we  have  very large reserves.  As Members  know,  $800

million  deficit is a small percentage of our total  GDP  and  I

doubt it will have any influence at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked why there have been complaints from the

Malaysian Prime

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>

Minister  and  from  the  Malaysian media  in  general  on  high

interest  rates  for ringgit in Singapore.  The  problem  arises

from  a  misunderstanding of the nature  of  interest  rates  in

Singapore.   The  Malaysian media have reported  that  Singapore

banks  are  offering  very high interest  rates  which  tend  to

attract  the  outflow  of  ringgit  into  Singapore,  therefore,

reducing the liquidity in Malaysia and affecting their business.

Some even suggest that this might be a deliberate attempt by the

Singapore Government to damage the Malaysian economy.   I  would

say categorically that this is not the case. We have to remember

that Malaysia is Singapore's second largest trading partner, and

Singapore is also one of the largest investors in Malaysia.   So

the  continuing  welfare of the Malaysian economy  is  of  vital

interest  to Singapore.  It is not in our interest  to  try  and

undermine their economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS has also earlier issued a statement that it does

not regulate or influence the interest rates of bank deposits in

Singapore, whether the money is in Singapore dollars or  in  any

other  foreign currencies.  Although it has been said before,  I

think at this point of time it will be useful if I elaborate  on

the principles which have been announced earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks in Singapore are free to set interest rates on

deposits  in  a  wide range of foreign currencies.    Currently,

deposit  accounts for over 25 currencies are readily offered  in

the   Singapore  Asian  Dollar  Market,  covering  all  the  G-7

countries'  currencies, and most Asian and European  currencies.

Interest rates quoted for these deposits in these currencies are

based  on  market supply and demand.  Singapore  is  the  fourth

largest  foreign exchange trading centre in the world, following

London,  New  York  and  Tokyo.  Of  necessity,  therefore,  the

Government  cannot  interfere in the foreign  exchange  markets.

All  currencies enter and leave Singapore freely,  depending  on

demand for such currencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, interest rates for off-shore Malaysian

ringgit  deposits have been very volatile, and have on  occasion

risen as high as 30% to 40%.  Such high

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>

interest rates for the ringgit have naturally raised concerns in

Malaysia,  but it should be emphasised that the high rates  were

determined by market conditions and have always been  of  fairly

short duration.  In normal times, ringgit interest rates offered

by banks in Singapore are not significantly different from those

quoted by banks in Malaysia.  The difference is probably  a  few

percent. Today, the difference is probably about 4% to 5%, based

on  the risk premium, but no more than that.  When spikes in the

rates  on  ringgit  do  occur,  they  therefore  reflect  severe

shortages of supply, suggesting that on those occasions currency

speculators have been caught covering short positions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that the globalization of

capital markets allows currencies to move freely world wide.  As

long  as  there  is an offshore demand for ringgit,  whether  by

Malaysians or foreigners, any attempt to restrict the trading of

such  currencies will merely induce the traders to  shift  their

activities to another foreign exchange centre  such as Hong Kong

or London.  Even the Singapore dollar is traded actively in both

Hong  Kong  and  London, and this explains why  even  after  our

foreign  exchange  market  closes in  Singapore,  the  Singapore

dollar exchange rate still moves because of trading in the other

centres.   It  merely  moves from one time  zone  to  the  other

electronically.   This  can just take place  at  any  time.   So

trying  to  restrict  such  trading  activities  of  ringgit  in

Singapore is simply not feasible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in the Ministerial Statement, the Government does

not  and cannot manipulate the level of interest rates even  for

Singapore  dollar loans and deposits.  Many laymen,  whether  in

Singapore  or elsewhere, believe erroneously that the Government

plays  a part in setting interest rates, but this is simply  not

so.  Their belief arises because many governments, including the

Malaysian  government, directly intervene in the  interest  rate

markets,  quite  legitimately, of course, as  an  instrument  of

monetary policy.  I think  many may assume that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>

since  other countries do it, we must also be doing it.  But  in

our  case  we  do  not  do it.  Because of the  small  size  and

openness  of  our  economy, Singapore cannot and  does  not  use

interest  rates as an instrument of monetary policy.   Banks  in

Singapore  are free to set interest rates in response to  market

conditions.   MAS  monetary policy is centred  in  managing  the

exchange rate and not on domestic interest rates.  The Singapore

Government,  therefore, has no policy either to raise  or  lower

interest  rates in Singapore on the Singapore dollar or  on  any

other foreign currency.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, in the interest of keeping

investors in Singapore in the long term, would it not be  better

for  us  to  consider a permanent reduction in the  JTC  or  HDB

rental, rather than a one-year rebate, as has been proposed?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The one year rebate, of course, can

be   extended,  depending  on  conditions.   So  a  year-to-year

extension  gives  us more flexibility rather  than  a  permanent

change, because conditions do change.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> My point is that we want to keep

investors  here  for  a long time, not just  on  a  year-to-year

basis.   So  in  making the assessment of whether  to  keep  the

investment  here in Singapore or to move out to our neighbouring

countries,  they  may want to look at a more permanent  solution

rather than a year-to-year solution that has been proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Under present conditions, the

likelihood is that if things continue to deteriorate, there will

be  further reductions rather than remaining fixed at any single

rate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I have two questions. First, can

the  Minister explain why is the suspension of land sales  given

such  a  relatively  long period, ie, 1� years?   Why  cannot  a

review  by  made, say, during the next Budget session?   Second,

how confident is the Government that this off-Budget package can

cushion the economy from sliding into a recession, say,  in  the

second half of this year or the first half of next year?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The suspension is for a fairly

lengthy period because property investments take a long time  to

mature,  and currently there is an over supply of about  20,000-odd  residential units already in the market.  According to  URA

statistics,  the take-up in the first quarter of  this  year  is

probably  1,500 units.  So the overhang is huge.  Assuming  that

things  do not deteriorate, the present overhang would  probably

last  several  years.  So the projection is that any  change  we

make must be over a substantial period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we can assure that the present package will help us

avoid a recession is something which I cannot guarantee nor  can

anyone.   We  will  simply  have to review  the  situation.   If

conditions  deteriorate sharply, we will always be  prepared  to

come back with more measures.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Can I ask the Minister, although it is

difficult to stimulate the local market demand, and perhaps also

the  regional  market  demand, why have we  not  considered  the

provision of incentives to tap overseas markets which  are  non-traditional?   These are areas which are still there  and  which

can  provide us with growth.  In the past, because the  regional

market tended to be accessible, is it not time now for us to tap

into  these  markets?  The reluctance to go overseas  into  more

difficult markets is something which can be overcome now.  Would

the Minister like to comment on that?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am not sure what other market the

Member is talking about.  Which other countries can provide this

growth?   Eastern Europe is in difficulties.  Latin  America  is

stumbling  along.   I  do not know what other  countries  he  is

talking about.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> What about South America, for example?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> South America has its own share of

problems  and  I doubt that it would provide a major  source  of

investment either for us or for exports into the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I could use an example. To use a medical analogy,

the present problem

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>

we  are  facing is like a healthy person suddenly being attacked

by a viral flu.  As everybody knows, a viral flu cannot be cured

by  a large injection of antibiotics.  It is simply this: if you

have  a  healthy body, the doctor will treat the symptoms,  give

you  panadol for your headaches and give you a lot of  vitamins.

If  you are basically healthy, sooner or later you will recover.

So do not expect a magic bullet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, one short question.

I  think  a lot of lay people, individuals and small and  medium

sized  businesses,  will be asking why  the  Government  is  not

considering  suspending  GST because  this  has  the  most  far-reaching impact on one's cash flow.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Choo talks about GST having a far-reaching impact on the cash flow. It is only 3%. It is already

fully offset for all the lower income people.  So removing it is

not  really going to stimulate the growth of the economy.  As  I

have  said  earlier, our main objective in this exercise  is  to

reduce  cost  so  that companies which are in  difficulties  can

remain in business and continue to employ Singaporeans.  That is

what  we  are trying to do.  Trying to artificially  give  money

back,  hoping  that the individual would then go and  spend  it,

does  not really help, because the bulk of the industry we  want

to support should be exporting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, while it is really

laudable that the Minister for Finance has announced a  host  of

measures  to  lower  the business cost and preserve  jobs  as  a

result  of  that,  the fact still remains that  there  are  many

individuals  in distress, especially individuals who  have  lost

their jobs and those who may be losing their jobs.  The question

I  have  is this: why has the Minister not considered using  the

CPF  mechanism?  For instance, I know that many individuals  are

prematurely  redeeming their insurance policies and  individuals

who  have  difficulties  paying for their children's  education.

Perhaps  the Minister could consider using the CPF mechanism  to

allow  the usage of their CPF funds to temporarily at least  pay

for some of these costs that individuals have to incur.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have

two  questions to raise here.  Three months after presenting his

Budget statement, the Minister for Finance is now presenting his

package of off-Budget measures to help cut the business cost  in

Singapore.   I hope that three months later, he will review this

package and make the necessary adjustment to it.  I believe most

Singaporeans  will  be disappointed with the package  introduced

today,  because the people have high expectations.   The  higher

the    expectations,    the    greater    the    disappointment.

Entrepreneurs in Singapore know that the Singapore Government is

prudent, and  very conservative, especially in time of  crisis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Peh, what is your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am coming to my questions.

The  Minister has just said that we are suffering from  flu.   I

think  it is not just an ordinary flu but there is diarrhoea  as

well.   So the treatment provided by this package must  be  more

thorough.    Just a few pills  will not solve the  problem.   Mr

Leong  Horn  Kee has made some useful suggestions just  now.   I

think  the  Minister  can consider them more  seriously.   Three

months later he can give us a review.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I understand from the Minister that the bulk

of companies he wishes to support are export-oriented.  But does

he   not  know  that  many  more  companies,  small  and  medium

enterprises, are not export companies?  Should the Minister  not

then  be  thinking  of  ways  to  stimulate  local  consumption?

Particularly I recall that our tax rates, because of the smaller

reliefs  this  year, are actually higher than  last  year.   And

should there not be an increased relief for this year?

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I appreciate that the

focus is on businesses and helping businesses reduce costs.  But

I  think  perhaps  helping  or giving something  to  individuals

should  not just be seen from a stimulating angle but also  from

the   point  of  view  that  there  are  those  who  are  facing

difficulties, for example, the recent increases in the  mortgage

rates for HDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>

loans.   Could  that not have been considered as  a  measure  at

least  to  defer  those increases until the  economic  situation

improves?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> The Minister has used a medical

example  of somebody getting flu, and a person with flu can  get

very  sick.  So does it imply that it is Government's policy  to

allow a recession to occur?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> The Minister has said many

times that the measures are actually meant to stimulate business

and  our economy.  But surely at this time when many people  are

losing  their  jobs,  would  the Government  not  consider  some

sympathy  towards the people who have lost their jobs  and  that

measures be introduced to ease the pain of the cost of living in

Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> While I agree with the Minister

that  the 4% property tax on owner-occupied properties  is  low,

the  12% property tax for rented properties remains high.  I  am

sure  that  a  lot  of middle-class people own  a  property  for

themselves but at the same time they own another property  which

is  rented out.  And they are now having difficulty in servicing

their  loan because the rental market is fairly bad.   Why  does

the  Minister  not look at this matter and give  these  property

owners some property tax reduction, so as to help them tide over

the problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> What is sorely lacking in Singapore's

economy  is  the  confidence factor.  I want to  know  from  the

Minister:  Is  he  comfortable that what he has announced  today

addresses that issue?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to seek

further   clarification  from  the  Minister  for  Finance   who

mentioned  that  Singapore does not control  the  bank  interest

rates.   But  I  wonder whether he would comment  on  the  Prime

Minister  of  Malaysia, Dr Mahathir's recent comment  after  the

UMNO General Assembly, that Malaysia's economic recovery will be

faster  if  interest rates in Singapore were  reduced.   And  if

interest rates rise, then there will be an outflow of money from

Malaysia to Singapore.  Would he comment on that?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I just want to clarify. I

understand  fully as to what the Minister has explained  earlier

pertaining to the GST suspension.  But I think a lot  of  people

feel  and  just  hope  that somehow in  this  kind  of  economic

situation, no matter how artificial it is, every single drop  of

water counts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  about the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme.   He  has

increased  the  amount  from $1.1 billion  to  $2  billion.   My

question  to the Minister is, of the $1.1 billion set  aside  so

far,  how  much of it has already been utilised?   And  does  he

think that $2 billion would be enough?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Questions have come so fast and

furious, I do not think I can respond individually by name.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First question is: why do we not allow the use of CPF for

those  who are in trouble?  Of course, that is the easiest thing

to  do.   But do not forget that CPF is, in fact, for  old  age.

And  if  we deplete it now, how are you going to top it up?   We

have,  in  fact, from time to time, in the past, introduced  CPF

top-ups.   But to open the door to use CPF for these  particular

situations,  I  think is a step which we are very  reluctant  to

move at this time, unless things get really, really bad.  And  I

would recommend against it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister for Manpower had earlier on during

Question  Time already responded to this question that the  bulk

of money is, in fact, used for mortgage payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested that the problem we are facing now is more

severe  than a flu.  Well, it is a severe form of flu.   What  I

was really saying is: do not expect the magic bullet to cure it.

You  have  to take tough measures.  But if you are fundamentally

sound,   like   a  healthy  Singapore  economy  or   a   healthy

Singaporean, sooner or later, you will recover.  But you  cannot

cure  it  with antibiotics, just as we cannot cure  it  by  pure

domestic stimulation.  The causes are external to us. So we have

to wait for demand to pick up before we can hope to recover.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs, indeed, I agree they are not all exporters and

equally  the  cost-cutting measures will be  of  help  to  them,

because  they  will be able to stay in business  and  they  will

continue  to  be  able to employ.  So the cost-cutting  measures

affect  everybody, not just exporters.  But  we  hope  that  the

exporters are the important components because they are the ones

generating foreign income and foreign exchange for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On measures to help unemployment, the question has been

addressed  earlier this morning during Question Time in  that  a

Tripartite  Committee  has  been  set  up  between   the   NTUC,

Government and the Employers' Federation in which people who are

unemployed  will  be  helped  to  re-acquire  jobs  as  soon  as

possible.   If they cannot acquire jobs, they can be  helped  to

retrain.   So  at this stage, I do not think we have  reached  a

stage  where  there is mass unemployment.  There  are  selective

areas  where people will be redundant and this Committee is  set

up precisely for this purpose.  Government will continue to help

fund  all  the  programmes necessary to  re-employ  or  re-train

workers.  There is no shortage of funds.  What we need are  good

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker has suggested that we should show more sympathy for

individuals who own two properties.  I am afraid that  I  cannot

show much sympathy.  If you already own two properties, you  are

quite rich.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok has asked whether we are confident that the

programmes  are going to restore confidence.   I  hope  so.   It

certainly  should be.  Let me just start from  square  one.   We

have all the resources necessary.  I just do not want to splurge

it  unnecessarily.  If necessary, we will continue to  introduce

whatever  measures are required to restore the  economy  but  we

cannot  influence external demand.  So we need  to  do  all  the

things necessary to keep our economy going during this difficult

period,  which basically are cost-reduction, retraining and  re-investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of Dr Mahathir, I think he is expressing, of

course,  a  concern from the Malaysian point of  view  which  we

fully

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>

appreciate.   If  money  continues to leave  Malaysia,  interest

rates  will rise because of liquidity problems.  But we are  not

the  ones responsible for that.  I think that is the difference.

He,  of course, is very worried.  Quite rightly, he should.  But

we do not influence the outflow of money.  It is a problem which

is  not  peculiar  to Malaysia but also affects other  countries

which  face  economic problems.  I hope you understand  that  we

have  no  incentive  to  undermine the  Malaysian  economy.   If

Malaysia  recovers as quickly as possible, all  our  investments

will increase in value, and that is really the only test.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a final question on GST, whether we should not

make  a  gesture.  Although the percentage is small, the  amount

collected  is  not small.  GST is 3%, but the  total  amount  of

money  collected is not small and therefore if there is no  need

to change it, we should not do it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Under what circumstances should we

change?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We will see when the moment arises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau has asked about LEFS. So far the take-up

rate  has  been  very  encouraging.  I do  not  have  the  exact

figures.   But  we  will  increase  the  amount  available  from

$1.1billion to $2 billion, and any amount necessary if  we  need

to.   Shortage  of funds is not a problem.  It  is  the  take-up

rate.   And  there should be no constraint.  If  more  companies

need more money, we will provide it.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> The Minister

also announced that some of the public sector projects would  be

brought  forward, and he mentioned about schools and so  on.   I

would  like to find out whether, for example, the Main Upgrading

Programme,  which had 15 precincts last year, and  it  has  been

reduced  to  10,  will be increased?  And also for  the  Interim

Upgrading Programme, will there be more precincts?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I would like to know what measures

the Government will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>

take  in  order to attract more foreign investments to Singapore

so that we can create more jobs for our workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> What contingency measures do we have in case we

run into a recession by the end of the year?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I want to say that actually I had a flu

a  few  days ago and I saw a doctor.  He gave me medicine,  like

the  Minister said, antibiotics for the phlegm and so  on.   Now

after  a  few  days, I am cured.  I want to  say  that  for  the

Singapore economy, I have trust on Dr Hu.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> May I ask the Minister whether

he  will  consider  providing  additional  grants  to  voluntary

welfare  organisations  which are facing difficulty  in  raising

funds  in  the present situation?  Perhaps the Government  could

increase the 50% operating grant to 80%.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> On the Main Upgrading and Interim

Upgrading programmes, I think that is an issue which I will pass

on  to the Minister for National Development.  But whatever that

can   be  brought  forward  will  be  brought  forward  on   the

infrastructure side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we use new methods of attracting foreign

investments?  I think the EDB is actively doing that.  They  are

stepping up their programmes and trying their level best to  try

to  attract as many new investments as possible.  This is why we

are  continuing to reclaim new lands in Jurong Island which will

accommodate  all  the  new  industries  in  petrochemicals   and

refineries  and so forth.  So we will not stint  and  hold  back

investments   which   are  necessary  to   provide   the   basic

infrastructure to attract new investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of additional grants for voluntary welfare

organisations, we can consider this but each case will  have  to

be looked at on its own merits.  I cannot give a blanket promise

on this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I was watching the television

programme, Business Day, and almost every other company's annual

report  shows a loss.  I was waiting for somebody to ask whether

the  Government  would, in fact, lower the  corporate  tax.   In

fact, they had been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>

asking for it already last year.  I wonder why it was not asked,

for those other companies having difficulty.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Indeed, of course. If you do not

make profits, we cannot tax you.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Of course. I just bring home the point ---

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I agree. I know what you mean.

Why  have  we not moved corporate taxes?  Corporate tax  affects

you the year after.  What we want to do is something which helps

you  now.  So cost reduction is the most effective.  We may have

to  consider  corporate  tax if things  get  worse.   I  am  not

excluding it.  But right now, we do not need it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> The Minister has not answered my question about

contingency measures if we run into a recession.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We have a whole package of measures

we can use.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Manpower,

in  view  of  the  initiatives taken to  expand  both  financial

services  and  manufacturing services, how he will  ensure  that

Singapore  has the necessary competencies, in terms  of  trained

manpower,  to  support these initiatives, both in the  immediate

and long term.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a limited labour pool. In the last ten years, we

have  to  constantly augment with foreign workers  to  meet  the

needs of growing industries.  It is hence a key priority of  the

new  Ministry  of  Manpower to ensure as close a  match  between

labour  supply and labour demand, not just in numbers, but  also

in terms of trained manpower.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the industry level, various Government agencies such as

the  EDB, NCB, and the MAS, have their own manpower plans.   For

example, in planning for the expansion of manufacturing services

under Industry 21, the EDB has worked very closely with industry

to  map  out  the  skills  profile  for  the  new  manufacturing

workforce.   Industry 21 has several initiatives to address  the

need  for  trained manpower to support the expansion.   The  MAS

also  has  its  plan  to meet the expected growth  in  financial

services.  A national plan for manpower is now being drawn up by

a Manpower 21 Committee comprising the captains of industry, the

Government,  and  the  trade  unions.   This  multi-agency   and

tripartite  approach  to manpower planning  and  development  is

necessary  to  cope with the needs of different industries.   My

Ministry will coordinate the effort of the Manpower 21 Committee

to  develop a workforce that will be able to meet the  needs  of

the Singapore economy and enhance our competitiveness.

such  as  those  relating to utilities, telephone,  Housing  and

<div align="center"><b>PERSONS AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CRISIS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr R. Ravindran</b> asked the Prime Minister whether

the  Government will issue a directive to Government Ministries,

statutory  boards  and other related revenue collection/charging

agencies  to  be  sympathetic  and  understanding  to  families,

individuals and companies who have been affected by the  present

economic crisis and are facing financial difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is sympathetic to the individuals and

companies  which  face  difficulties  because  of  the  economic

situation. But it cannot help them by having Government agencies

defer or forgive charges.  Government agencies have to work on a

proper  basis. Building up arrears with JTC and PUB,  etc,  will

not  solve  the  problems  of  families  and  businesses  facing

financial difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies will be helped by the supplementary budget

measures  being  announced  in the ministerial  statement  later

today.   There  is also available a range of assistance  schemes

administered  by EDB, PSB and other agencies.   There  are  many

schemes  to  help families which have difficulties paying  their

rent, utilities bills or other fees and charges.  For example:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial assistance: The CDCs and MCD offer financial

assistance  to individuals or families who need short-term  help

to tide them over difficult periods.  People's Association's CCC

provides  financial  assistance  to  needy  residents  from  its

Welfare Fund.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of rent and utilities: The CDC has a Rent and

Utilities Assistance scheme to help families residing in 1-room,

2-room  or  3-room  HDB  rental flats who  need  help  on  rent,

utilities and S&C charges.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of mortgage loans: HDB allows lessees in financial

hardship  to  reschedule the mortgage loan payment period.   For

deserving cases, where there is a sudden loss of income  due  to

circumstances beyond control, they may even be allowed to  defer

payment of their loan instalments.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of medical bills: Medifund can help Singaporeans

in  genuine  financial difficulties pay their medical  bills  at

public hospitals, on top of subsidies already given. Ministry of

Health  will  also  consider remission or waiver  of  outpatient

charges at polyclinics.

<div align="center"><b>RAISING OF INCOME CEILING FOR ELIGIBILITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TO PURCHASE HDB FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether he will soon be raising the income  ceiling

for  eligibility to purchase Housing and Development Board flats

from the present $8,000, which has not been reviewed since 1994,

so as to help the younger and first-time applicants.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time last month, I asked HDB to review the $8,000

monthly  income ceiling for the purchase of HDB flats.  HDB  has

completed  its  review, and the findings are  that  the  monthly

incomes of some 90 percent of Singaporean households in the  age

band  of  25 to 39 years fall below this income ceiling.   HDB's

study also shows that 94% of new applicants who applied for  HDB

flats in 1997 have household incomes below $6,000 a month.   The

current  income ceiling of $8,000 is therefore still  sufficient

to  meet  the  needs  of  the younger and first-timer  families.

There  is no immediate need to raise the income ceiling for  the

purchase  of  HDB  flats.   However,  HDB  will  exercise   some

flexibility to allow those with household income slightly  above

the income ceilings to apply for new HDB flats.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those with incomes exceeding $8,000 per month are also not

unduly  disadvantaged by the current HDB income  ceiling.   They

can  buy resale HDB flats as these flats do not have any  income

ceiling.  They can also buy Executive Condominiums, which have a

higher   monthly  income  ceiling  of  $10,000,  or  a   private

condominium or apartment according to their own preferences  and

financial capabilities.  For the first-timers purchasing ECs  or

resale  HDB  flats, they are also eligible for the  $40,000  CPF

Housing Grant.

<div align="center"><b>GRANT FROM SKILLS DEVELOPMENT FUND</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether the 70% grant from the Skills Development Fund (SDF) for

worker  training could be directly paid by SDF first instead  of

by  the  employers,  thus alleviating the  financial  strain  on

employers due to the present economic slowdown.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform the Member for Bukit Batok that such

a  scheme is already in place to help employers.  Under the  SDF

Training Voucher Scheme, a company need not pay the full fee for

the  approved training programme.  It pays only its share of the

fee.  The SDF will reimburse the training provider directly  for

the subsidised portion.  This eases the cash-flow for companies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Training Voucher Scheme (TVS) helps employers to gain

access  to  a wide selection of skills training courses.   These

courses are supported at up to 80% of the course fee.  There are

presently  a total of 423 TVS programmes offered, covering  both

technical  skills and productivity improvement modules.   In  FY

1997,  a  total of 9,933 applications were supported  under  the

Scheme.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSB will extend this Scheme to cover all publicly

offered training courses. This will reduce the training expenses

of  employers, and encourage them to consider more training  for

their staff.

<div align="center"><b>CASES OF ENTEROVIRUS-71 INFECTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health (a)

whether there are cases of Enterovirus-71 infection in Singapore

at  the  moment;  (b) whether his Ministry will make  laboratory

tests  available to doctors for early diagnosis of the  disease;

and (c) whether there are suitable quarantine wards for affected

patients if the need arises.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterovirus infections, including enterovirus type 71 (EV

71)   occur   worldwide,   including  Singapore.    Asymptomatic

infections  are  common.   EV 71 is frequently  associated  with

hand,  foot  and  mouth disease, which is usually self-limiting.

It  affects mainly children and is characterised by rapid  onset

of  fever and sore throat. Small, superficial ulcers develop  in

the mouth, followed by rashes on the hands and feet. There is no

specific  treatment.  Occasionally, serious  complications  like

inflammation of the brain and heart muscles can occur.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In Singapore, surveillance of enteroviruses has not

shown  any unusual pattern of EV 71 infection. So far this year,

there is no confirmed case of EV 71 infection in Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In view of the recent outbreak of EV 71 infection in

Taiwan, the Ministry of Health has taken the necessary action to

strengthen  surveillance of EV 71 infection and has advised  all

medical practitioners to be vigilant for possible cases of EV 71

infection,  especially  those  who  have  travelled  to   Taiwan

recently.   Laboratory  tests  are  available  to  doctors   for

diagnosis of the disease. It takes at least one week to  confirm

an enterovirus and between 4 and 8 weeks to determine the strain

of  the  virus.  The time taken depends on the amount  of  virus

present in the specimen collected.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Hospital staff have been alerted and advised on the

handling  of  patients and to observe proper  infection  control

practices.  Isolation wards for affected patients will be set up

at   KKH  and  NUH,  the  two  hospitals  with  paediatric  care

facilities, should the need arise.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health is working closely with the Ministry

of  the  Environment to monitor the incidence of EV 71 infection

in Singapore.

along  public roads; by HDB and URA for parking offences  within

HDB  and  URA  carparks;  and by LTA for flouting  traffic  laws

relating to vehicle usage and regulation, such as Area Licensing

Scheme  and  Electronic  Road Pricing Scheme,  and  emission  of

excessive exhaust fumes.

problems  of illegal parking of foreign vehicles, in  particular

motor cycles, in HDB estates.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

organisations  to  address the problem of foreign  vehicles,  in

particular  motorcycles,  which  are  parked  illegally  in  HDB

estates.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal parking in HDB estates can take various forms, such

as  along public roads and footpaths, in HDB car parks or at HDB

void  decks.   Police have always taken, and  will  continue  to

take,  enforcement  action against vehicles, including  foreign-registered  ones,  that are illegally parked  on  public  roads,

especially  where  such  parking causes serious  obstruction  to

traffic  flow.   HDB  wardens  and  Town  Council  officers  are

respectively responsible for enforcement action against vehicles

that  are illegally parked within HDB car parks and at HDB  void

decks.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police's assessment is that illegal parking within HDB

estates  is  generally under control.  Town Councils  have  been

able  to  deal with complaints of illegal parking  at  HDB  void

decks.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where illegal parking, be it by foreign or local-registered

vehicles,  is  rampant, Police and the relevant  agencies  would

jointly work out ways to address the problem. Solutions  to  the

problem  can  include public education, enhanced enforcement  or

even road scheme engineering.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as mentioned in my previous response in

Parliament, the various Ministries dealing with VWOs (i.e.  MCD,

MOE  and MOH) are working very closely with the National Council

of  Social  Service (NCSS) to monitor the impact of the  current

economic slowdown on social services and the ability of VWOs  to

raise funds for their programmes and services.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most VWOs are still able to raise funds although in smaller

amounts.   It  is important that they are clear in  their  aims,

focused in their programmes, and are seen by potential donors to

use  funds  effectively and efficiently.  Donors are  then  more

ready  to  give, knowing that their dollars will be  well  used.

The  success  of recent fund-raising efforts by National  Kidney

Foundation, Metta Welfare Services, Thye Hwa Kuan Moral  Society

and TOUCH Community Services bear this out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know some VWOs are reviewing their services and re-prioritising their needs and expenditures just as the Government

and  the  private sector are doing.  I urge all VWOs to  do  the

same.   The current economic situation poses a challenge to  the

VWOs to manage their resources more efficiently.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If VWOs still find themselves short of funds even after

tightening up on expenditures, the respective Ministries and the

NCSS  will  work  with them and assist them appropriately.   The

Government  has  not  cut  back  on  its  budget  for   approved

programmes  run  by  VWOs and which receive Government  funding.

They  will  receive  the  same  support  from  Government.   The

Government is also not cutting back on its development programme

for  needed  community-based social  services  (such  as  family

service  centres,  child care centres,  before  and  after  care

school care programme and others).  For FY 98, there is in  fact

an increase of 15.9% (or $9.37 million) over the FY 97 provision

for  both development and operating expenses for programmes  run

by VWOs.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is monitoring the situation together with the

NCSS and will certainly assist VWOs to fund their programmes and

services where necessary.

from  private homes, as long as their activities do  not  induce

additional  vehicular  or pedestrian traffic,  or  cause  noise,

smoke  or  dust  nuisances.  Planning  permission  is  also  not

required.   However, to safeguard the amenity of the residential

neighbourhood, persons outside the household are not allowed  to

work within the residence.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above guidelines also apply to HDB flats. Although

under the HDB lease/tenancy agreement, residents are not allowed

to  use  their  flats for any purpose other than as  residential

flats,  HDB does exercise some degree of flexibility.  It allows

residents to install commercial communication lines in HDB flats

such  as  facsimile,  telex  or telephone.  Residents  are  also

allowed  to carry out small scale home-based activities such  as

tailoring  service,  assembling  plastic  flowers,  etc.   These

activities  must not be a source of nuisance to  the  neighbours

and  the  residential character of the HDB  flats  must  not  be

compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA is not in favour of installing display timers for

traffic  lights  for  the  time being.  If  display  timers  are

provided  at  traffic  lights  to  let  motorists  know  of  the

remaining  time  before the green light  turns  to  amber,  some

motorists  may find it useful to slow down as they approach  the

traffic light junction.  But, there could be others who will  be

tempted to speed up to catch the green.  When they cannot  judge

properly,  they will end up either suddenly braking  or  beating

the amber and red lights.  Both these actions will endanger road

safety.   The current system of using a 3-5 second amber  period

before   traffic  lights  turn  from  green  to   red,   is   an

international practice, which has served us well and need not be

modified.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  how  the Traffic Police will overcome  the  problem  of

noise  pollution from incessant honking early in the morning  by

buses  and  lorries at the Singapore Immigration  checkpoint  in

Woodlands.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus and lorry drivers, and motorcyclists honk their horns

early  in the morning at queue-cutters along the Causeway Bridge

and  at  the road leading to the mini-checkpoint, which operates

between  6  and 9 am to clear motorcyclists entering  Singapore.

Some  motorcycles also spill onto the path of buses and lorries,

impeding their movement and posing an accident risk.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of the indiscriminate use of horns at the

checkpoint is queue jumping and spill over of motorcyclists into

the  paths of other vehicles during the peak period.  Police has

addressed  this problem by enhancing its presence  at  the  road

leading to the mini-checkpoint to deter drivers and riders  from

jumping queue, and from blocking the movement of other vehicles.

For  example,  its  officers are now deployed  at  the  Causeway

Bridge  one-hour  earlier,  from  5  am.   It  has  also  issued

summonses  to  motorists  who honk unnecessarily.  In  addition,

Traffic Police (TP) is working with the Land Transport Authority

to   put   up  more  signs  reminding  motorists  not  to   horn

unnecessarily.   Police is also preparing advisory  leaflets  to

remind motorists to drive in an orderly manner and not to  cause

a  nuisance  by horning.  These leaflets will be distributed  to

motorists entering and departing Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Police can only do so much. It is only

through public education that we can encourage our motorists and

motorcyclists to be courteous to other road users.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud horning is an offence if there is a gazetted "No

horning"  sign displayed. There is such a sign located near  the

Causeway Checkpoint.  This offence can be compounded with a fine

of  $50.  For severe cases, TP can charge the offender in Court,

for  which  he can be fined up to $1,000 or be jailed  up  to  3

months  for first time conviction, or fined up to $2,000  or  be

jailed up to 6 months for subsequent convictions.

hall  to  have  their  travel documents  endorsed  by  Singapore

Immigration  and  Registration (SIR) officers, the  buses  would

wait  for  them at the coach-parking bay located just after  the

arrival hall.  Due to space constraints, a maximum of nine buses

can park at the bay at any one time.  The other buses proceed to

Admiralty Road to wait for the workers.  It takes about  10  -15

minutes for a busload of workers to clear immigration.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peak hours for the entry of these Malaysian-registered

buses  are  from 5 am to 8 am, 1 pm to 2.30 pm, and 7.30  pm  to

<br>11.00 pm, reflecting changes in shifts at our factories. The

congestion  is aggravated by other peak hour traffic.   However,

there  is  no serious congestion to traffic flow along Admiralty

Road  because it is a three-lane road.  Frequent police  patrols

have   helped  to  regulate  traffic.   The  Police  also   take

enforcement  action  against buses and other  traffic  offenders

that obstruct traffic.

<div align="center"><b>THE SINGAPORE DOLLAR</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister (a)

what  steps the Government intends to take to check the  decline

of the Singapore dollar; and (b) how has the decline in value of

Japanese yen affected our dollar and trade.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What steps the Government intends to take to check the

decline of the Singapore dollar.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first 2 weeks of June, the S$ had weakened against

the  US$ from below S$1.6000 to US$1, to as much as S$1.7560  to

US$1  on 16th June 1998, when the Asian currencies, particularly

the Yen, plunged.  The Singapore dollar has since bounced back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the MAS manages the Singapore dollar against a

weighted  basket  of  currencies  of  Singapore's  main  trading

partners,  and  not  against  any single  currency.   While  the

Singapore   dollar   has  weakened  against   the   US   dollar,

Deutschemark  and  Sterling,  it has  appreciated  substantially

against the Ringgit, Rupiah and Baht.  On a trade weighted basis

therefore,   the  value  of  Singapore  dollar  has  appreciated

slightly. This is in line with the long-term fundamentals of the

Singapore economy - high savings rates and low inflation, fiscal

and  current account surpluses, large foreign reserves  and  low

foreign debt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding our fundamentals, some volatility in the

S$  exchange  rate  is unavoidable in the midst  of  the  large

fluctuations  in  the  other  Asian  currencies.   Any  further

decline  in regional currencies would affect the value  of  the

Singapore  dollar  vis-�-vis the US$, as  these  economies  are

Singapore's important trading partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS will continue to allow market forces to determine

the  value  of  the  S$,  consistent with Singapore's  economic

fundamentals.   However, market excesses in overly  pessimistic

conditions will have to be checked by central bank intervention

as  was  illustrated in the US-Japan joint intervention in  the

foreign exchange markets on 17th June 1998 to correct the sharp

decline  in the Yen.  MAS will take the necessary steps against

any  unduly  steep  fall  in the S$ and  stands  ready  to  act

decisively  against any unwarranted speculative attack  on  the

Singapore dollar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has the decline in value of Japanese yen affected our

dollar and trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, will reply orally to

a  similar Question from Mr Ang Mong Seng, MP for Bukit  Gombak,

in Parliament.)

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan is a significant export market for the regional

economies including Singapore.  It accounted for 18% of regional

(Indonesia,  Thailand,  Malaysia, the  Philippines  and  Brunei)

exports  and 7.6% of Singapore's total non-oil domestic  exports

in  1997. A falling yen would raise the prices of imported goods

and   further  dampen  the  weak  demand  for  regional  imports

including from Singapore. Japan is also an important market  for

Singapore's  services exports. For example,  it  is  our  second

largest  single market for tourism, accounting for 15% of  total

visitor  arrivals  in 1997. A continuing weakening  of  the  yen

would  lead  to  a  further  decline in  Japanese  arrivals  and

aggravate  the  slowdown  in the retail,  restaurant  and  hotel

industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region has also been a major recipient of Japanese

foreign  capital. Direct investments from Japan  have  accounted

for  an  increasing  share  of total FDI  approvals  in  ASEAN-3

(Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia), from 15% in 1992 to  24%  in

1996.  In Singapore, Japan contributed a significant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>

21.5%  of total FDI inflow between 1990-95. A weakening of  the

yen   would  adversely  affect  Japanese  companies'   overseas

expansion  plans.  This could have a dampening  effect  on  the

growth of Japanese investments in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a weakening of the yen is likely to exacerbate

the  weak balance sheet position of Japanese banks, which would

lead  to  a  further  consolidation of  Japanese  international

banking activities, including those in the Asian Dollar Market.

This would in turn adversely affect the growth of the financial

services sector in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a significant exporter of electronic goods, Japan also

competes with Singapore and some of the other regional economies

in   major  markets  such  as  the  US  and  EU.  The  continued

depreciation of the yen will therefore exert greater competitive

pressure  on  regional exports. Finally, as shown by  events  in

recent  weeks, a weakening of the yen has a tendency to unsettle

regional financial markets.

movies were re-runs, of which 12 titles had been shown more than

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-runs are unavoidable. The number of blockbuster movies

released by Hollywood in a good year is 10 to 15 titles. This is

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Home Ownership Scheme, HDB flats are sold for

long  term owner-occupation by the eligible purchasers and their

families. For this reason, new HDB flats are sold with a 99-year

lease  so  that  not  only the purchasers  but  the  second  and

subsequent  generations of the same household  can  continue  to

live in them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will ensure that public housing remains

affordable  to  the majority of Singaporean families.  There  is

therefore no need to sell HDB flats with a shorter lease to keep

public housing within reach of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privatisation of HUDC housing estates is meant to meet

the  aspirations  of  purchasers for  self-management  of  their

estates.  After  privatisation, the maintenance of  the  housing

estates would be funded entirely by the purchasers' payments  of

maintenance  charges and contributions to the sinking  fund.  As

HUDC  flats  are generally developed in well-defined boundaries,

it is also relatively easier to privatise them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, HDB flats are in public housing estates

with  shared  community  facilities and amenities  so  that  the

running costs on conservancy and maintenance of the common areas

are  kept within reasonable limits.  As HDB estates are made  up

of a combination of different flat-types, with less well-defined

boundaries,  there  is no immediate plan to  privatise  any  HDB

estate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's Book Prize was instituted in 1974.

Its  objective  is  to  promote excellence  in  bilingualism  as

reflected  in  students' performance in English and  the  mother

tongue.   The  mother  tongue languages  considered  are  Malay,

Chinese  and  Tamil  and the non-Tamil Indian languages,  namely

Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi, and Urdu.  Performance in the

foreign languages, French, German and Japanese is not considered

as they are not the mother tongue languages of our pupils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prizewinners for the 1998 awards will be announced at

the Special Academic Awards Presentation Ceremony on 14th August

1998.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for Education what

are  the  plans for new schools in Woodlands New  Town  for  the

years 1999 to 2003.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 7 primary schools and 5 secondary

schools   in  Woodlands Development Guide Plan (DGP) zone  which

covers Woodlands New Town.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two new primary schools will be completed in 1999. They are

Evergreen   Primary   and  Woodgrove  Primary.   The   scheduled

completion dates are March 1999 and July 1999, respectively. The

schools   will hold classes at Woodlands Ring Primary in January

1999  pending the completion of the school buildings.  With  the

completion  of  these  two  primary  schools,  there   will   be

sufficient school places up to Year 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four new secondary schools are proposed for completion from

1999  to 2002. These are Woodlands Site 15 (Woodlands Drive  16)

in  December  1999, Woodlands Site 25 (Woodlands Street  33)  in

June  2000, Woodlands Site 34 (Marsiling Road) in December  2000

and  Woodlands Site 21A (Woodlands Crescent) in September  2002.

These schools have not been named yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning to meet additional demand for school places after

Year  2002 in all DGPs is currently in progress. The  needs   of

Woodlands  will  be  covered  under  this  new  school  building

programme. The projections show that there will be  a  continual

need  to plan for more new schools in Woodlands  to be completed

after Year 2002.
