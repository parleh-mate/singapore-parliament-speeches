<div align="center"><b>SECONDARY IV EXAMINATION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Education)</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Yong, ministerial statement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I am pleased to

report  to Members of this House that today,  the  last

day of the first Government Secondary IV Examination in

the  Chinese  medium, the highest number of  candidates

which  sat  for the examination so far was  registered,

namely,  1,958  out of a total of 3,169 candidates,  of

whom  2,956  were  candidates  from  Chinese  secondary

schools   and  213  were  candidates  from  the   Adult

Education Board, that is, the Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran

Dewasa.  This  figure represents 62  per  cent  of  the

candidates  taking  the examination despite  determined

and concerted efforts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



by  political  agitators  to  boycott  the  examination

through picketing and other methods of intimidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to pay the highest tribute - and so will all

Members  of this House and the people of Singapore  who

stand  for  law  and  order and for  sanity  - to  the

thousands of students and their parents who refused  to

be  cowed  by intimidation. I wish also to  express  my

deepest  gratitude and appreciation  to  all  presiding

officials, invigilators, principals, teachers and staff

of  schools, and the staff and officials of my Ministry

for  their unflinching loyalty in the cause of national

education  in the Chinese medium in the face  of  great

provocation and intimidation that went on for the  past

five days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the stress and strain to which candidates

have  been  subjected as a result of the  picketing  of

examination  centres by those agitators  who  organised

the  boycotting  of this examination,  the  marking  of

examination   scripts   will   certainly   take    into

consideration  the  psychological  handicaps  and   the

unfavourable conditions under which candidates answered

the  examination papers. Whenever necessary, the school

records of candidates will also he taken into account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A supplementary examination in all subjects will be

conducted  next week, as announced yesterday,  for  all

candidate who were prevented from sitting for any of

the  papers  in the regular examination conducted  this

week.  Candidates are, however, advised not to sit  for

papers  next  week  for which they  have  already  sat.

Details  of  the  supplementary  examination   are   as

follows:-



<pre>

       Centre 1 - Teachers' Training College, Paterson Road;



       Centre 2 - Tanglin Boys' School     }   Off Tanglin Road,

                                           }   behind the Ministry of Education,

       Centre 3 - Tanglin Girls' School    }   Kay Siang Road.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time-table will follow the same order as the regular examination:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday, 4th December, 1961:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 to 11.30 a.m. - Chinese Language

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.30 to 2.30 p.m. - Chemistry

<br><br>Tuesday, 5th December, 1961:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 to 11 a.m. - Elementary Mathematics

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 noon to 2.30 p.m. - Art (Still Life)



<br><br>Wednesday, 6th December, 1961:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 to 11 a.m. - Chinese Literature

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 to 5 p.m. - Biology

<br><br>Thursday, 7th December, 1961:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 to 11 a.m. - Additional mathematics

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 noon to 2 p.m. - Geography

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 to 5 p.m. - National Language

<br><br>Friday, 8th December, 1961:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 to 11.30 a.m. - English

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.30 - 2.30 p.m. - Physics

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 to 5 p.m. - General Science



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Senior Middle III Examination, will be

held  as  scheduled  at  44 centres  from  Friday,  8th

December,  to  Thursday, 14th  December.  There  is  no

change in time-table or examination centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Teachers' Training College will now be used as

a  centre  for  the  supplementary examination  of  the

Government Chinese Secondary IV Examination from 4th to

8th  December, the T.T.C. Professional Part 1, Part  II

(all  language media) and T.U.O.S. (Trained under other

schemes) (all-years) examinations scheduled to be  held

from  the  week  commencing Monday, 4th December,  will

have  to  be  postponed for one week  to  Monday,  11th

December,  1961.  The detailed time-table  arrangements

from day to day will remain unchanged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in accordance with the principle of

equal  treatment  for  the  four  language  streams  of

education  in Singapore, I am pleased to announce  that

those who pass the Government Secondary IV examination,

in   Chinese,  will  be  eligible  to  apply  for   100

bursaries, which will be tenable for two years in Upper

Secondary classes, valued at $420 per annum. The  award

of bursaries will, as usual, be based on academic merit

and  financial need. This. Sir, is similar to  the  100

bursaries  now  available to students  in  the  English

secondary  schools  who  passed  the  Cambridge  School

Certificate Examination and are attending two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



years  of  upper secondary classes prior to taking  the

Cambridge Higher School Certificate Examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be pertinent to ask, Mr Speaker, Sir, why this

boycott  has failed and why the evil men who  tried  to

use  misguided students as cover for their sinister and

dangerous political operations have been reduced  to  a

state of impotent frustration. The first reason is that

the   Government,  in  tackling  this  delicate  issue,

steadfastly refused to fall into the pro-Communist trap

of  hitting  out  at the misguided and excited  student

picketers in order to get at the manipulators  who  hid

behind the students and who in their cowardly way  used

the  bodies  of  school children as their  shield.  The

second  reason  is that the stand of the Government  on

this issue was a just and sensible one. That being  so,

public  opinion  was  on the side of  the  Government's

stand which was that no one was compelled to take  this

examination.  It  is  quite clear  from  what  happened

during  the  past  one week that the vast  majority  of

students  wanted  to  take  this  examination.  Despite

intimidation   by   politically   manipulated   student

picketers,  more than half of the students  braved  the

pickets  to take the examination. If there had been  no

intimidation by hostile and unruly picketers, there  is

no  doubt  that the attendance would have been  higher.

This  is shown by today's attendance. As the dispirited

picketers melted away, more students turned up for  the

examination.  The third reason why this boycott  failed

is  that  students and parents on their own  initiative

decided  that  they were not going to be cowed  by  the

picketers and their cowardly leaders. Gone are the days

when  students and parents could be intimidated in this

fashion.  The  moment students and parents  decided  to

stand up to the picketers and to exercise their rights,

the  so-called boycott collapsed like a house of cards.

This  should  be  a  good lesson to  the  pro-Communist

conspirators  that the days are gone  when  they  could

intimidate  the  people  and  bamboozle  students   and

parents with false slogans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past week's events have shown clearly that there

is no real foundation for the myth that Chinese schools

are  centres  of unrest and indiscipline.  Last  week's

events  have proved that the vast majority  of  Chinese

school   students,  like  students  in  other  language

streams,   are  not  only  basically  law-abiding   and

responsible, but will not hesitate to stand up  bravely

for  what  is  right and fair, in standing  up  to  the

picketers, they were asserting their rights as students

to  take an examination which would not only equip them

educationally but also enable them as educated citizens

to  contribute  to  the welfare  and  progress  of  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's Free Press there is a picture, Sir, of

parents and supporters standing outside the Ministry of

Education to protect students, who wish to sit for  the

examination,  from the picketers. You  will  see,  Sir,

that  unlike  the picketers there are no  handkerchiefs

tied  around their faces to hide their faces.  This  is

because  they have nothing to be ashamed of. There  was

no reason for these people to hide their faces from the

people. But not so the picketers. They all had to  hide

behind handkerchiefs. They dared not reveal their  true

faces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students who sat for the examination and who

forced  their way through booing and sometimes  violent

pickets  are the kind of Malayans and citizens on  whom

we  base our hopes for a peaceful, prosperous and happy

Malaya.  Contrast them with the misguided students  who

were  tricked  into  picketing instead  of  taking  the

examination.  They have wasted a year  of  study.  They

have got nothing out of the picketing and their leaders

will  not be able to make good this loss. These leaders

will  abandon these misguided students and  seek  fresh

stooges and reckless adventures elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  seek clarification on one point? May I ask  the

Minister  the  reason  for the  hurry  in  holding  the

supplementary examination on Monday,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



and  whether  it  will not be better to  hold  it  when

conditions are more normal and tempers have subsided?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think, Sir, it is necessary to

carry  on because the people have shown that they  have

fight in them and they can therefore proceed next  week

because   the  other  Government  Senior   Middle   III

Examination will take place in any case from Friday. So

whether  there is tension or not, examinations will  go

on.  The  agitators behind this must realise that  they

are  fighting not just the Government but the students,

the  parents  and all the people of Singapore.  And  if

they  still  continue to do so, it  will  be  at  their

peril.

<div align="center"><b>MERGER (SINGAPORE/FEDERATION OF MALAYA)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Amendment

[21st  November,  1961]  to  Question  [20th  November,

1961],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, whereas it has always been the avowed objective

of   all   nationalists  of  Malaya  to   achieve   the

reunification  of  Singapore  with  the  Federation  of

Malaya and to remove the artificial division created by

the  British by their policy of "divide and rule", this

House affirms and declares that the first objective  of

all   true  patriots  of  Malaya  is  to  achieve   the

reunification of these two territories in a  merger  of

Singapore  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya.".-(The

Minister for Labour-Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To leave out from "a" in the second last line to the

end and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation as  the

twelfth  state and with all its Citizens automatically

becoming Federal Citizens of Merger Day".'

-(Dr Lee Siew Choh).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to

be left out, be left out."



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, yesterday I gave a resume of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



the   pre-war   history  and  the  post-war   political

developments of our fatherland. I also related  briefly

how   the  Communists  and  pro-Communists  in   Malaya

manipulated,  manoeuvred and posed themselves  as  true

Malayan  nationalists. Mr Speaker, Sir, at that  time,

the Malayan nationalist fighters were quite prepared to

struggle  in close co-operation with them  so  long  as

they  did  not  infringe  or transgress  upon  national

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the amendment of the Member for

Queenstown, I said yesterday that it has at least  four

veiled motives. It is evident that party interests  and

party  ideology  take first place, with  the  Communist

back-room  boys giving instructions. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

if  the  Barisan  Sosialis and other political  Parties

having  an identical political ideology are sincere  in

wanting a full and complete merger, why have the  words

"complete   merger"  not  been  inserted  without   the

necessity to accentuate citizenship? In other words,  a

complete   merger   means   the   acceptance    without

qualification of the present policies of the Federation

of  Malaya on citizenship, education, labour,  language

and other matters. But this is not what they asked for.

Their  contention is that the rights and  interests  of

the  people of the Federation are our rights, but, that

the  rights  and interests of the people  of  Singapore

cannot  be  interfered with by the Federation.  Surely,

this  is  not the spirit of give and take,  and  it  is

unjust.  Even  small children understand this  kind  of

arithmetical calculation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member for Thomson - he

is  not  here at the moment - posed at least 16 questions

which he himself answered. The questions posed were why

the people of Singapore could not get this and that and

whether   the  Nanyang  University  diplomas  will   be

recognised  by  the  Federation of  Malaya.  All  those

questions  are  just  like  asking  rights   from   the

Federation  of Malaya. This means that we are  prepared

to take but not to give.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a married man and my wife is my

wife,  of  course;  but if the wife of  another  person

becomes  my  wife,  this is not fair.  If  the  Barisan

Sosialis  and other political Parties which  share  the

views  of  the Barisan Sosialis are really sincere  and

responsible  in  their  desire for  merger,  they  must

openly   declare  their  acceptance  of   the   present

Federation  Constitution - chapter and verse.  They  must

also  be  prepared  to  give  an  undertaking  to  this

Assembly and to all the people of Singapore that  their

stand  is acceptable and that the people will be behind

them,  otherwise they should not try and hide behind  a

smokescreen  or attempt to fish in troubled  waters  or

try to poke at a hornet's nest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the points raised by the

Member for Queenstown in support of his amendment  have

already  been  adequately dealt with by my  colleagues,

but  all the same I wish to add a little here and there

to give it a finishing touch, just like adding a little

more  spice to the gravy to make it more appetising.  I

will be brief, of course, and do not intend to beat the

record of the speech of the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Queenstown was in a rage when he attempted to convince the House that he and his Party alone were the real saviours of Singapore. Let us

look  at  the  accusations that he hurled  against  the

nationalist fighters, independence through merger,  the

tabling  of  the  White  Paper, and  the  motion  under

debate. He said that Singapore has been sold, that  the

Tunku wants Singapore but not her people and that  when

British colonialism goes out of the front door, another

form  of colonialism will enter from the back door.  He

equated  Singapore to the position of a  mistress,  its

people   as  second-class  citizens,  and  many   other

hackneyed phrases such as those uttered by a prostitute

to her lover or to the man who keeps her.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to the linguist, it is evident that

the language of the Member for Queenstown is, according

to  an  old  Malay adage, "As the tree, so the  fruit."

Language reflects the mind. Your



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



demeanour  reflects your character. Now,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  everything  is clear to us. The  evidence  is  as

clear as daylight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the basis of unity and solidarity of

a  nation is the devotion and undivided loyalty of  its

citizens  to  the State. The absence of  these  factors

will  result in the destruction of the State.  "When  a

house  is on fire, the rats run helter skelter," - so

goes another Malay saying. Mr Speaker, Sir, therefore,

undivided  loyalty is one of the absolute prerequisites

for  a  strong  and united nation and  State.  Only  by

sacrifices  can we prove our sincerity and  loyalty  to

the  State.  Take an easy example - for the  benefit  of

Members  who claim themselves to be representatives  of

the Barisan Sosialis - the Russian Communist Party. Yuri

Gagarin, the first cosmonaut, was accepted as a  fully-fledged  member  of  the Russian Communist  Party  only

after  his  perilous performance of orbiting round  the

earth.  This was a sacrifice. Mr Speaker, when  I  say

that  the basis of unity and strength of a nation rests

on  the undivided loyalty of the citizens, it does  not

imply  that  I  am  accusing the people  of  Singapore,

whether  in  this  House  or  outside,  that  they  are

disloyal to the State. That is not my intention at all,

Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was listening attentively to the greater part of the

speeches  made by the Opposition Members,  particularly

from  the group of 13 who style themselves the  Barisan

Sosialis, and who have all the time been emphasising on

automatic citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Mr Speaker, that there is no one in this

Assembly who will not agree to automatic citizenship if

the  Federation Government is willing to  accept  this.

The  Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya,  Tunku

Abdul Rahman, rejected this demand, as contained in his

communication  dated  13th  November,  1961,   to   the

Singapore  Prime  Minister,  and  circulated   to   all

Members.  The decision of the Tunku, according  to  his

letter rejecting this demand, clearly reflects the view

of the people of the Federation of Malaya. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



view  is based on the Federation Constitution, although

Article  22  of the Constitution states that Parliament

can decide and determine the rights of the people of  a

new  State  on  joining the Federation.  But  can  this

demand  he  acceptable to the Members of Parliament  in

the  Federation? The views of the Prime Minister, Tunku

Abdul Rahman, represent the stand of his Government and

the Alliance Party, which is now in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this motion were moved in Parliament, I am sure the

Pan-Malayan   Islamic  Party  would  rise   in   strong

opposition.  There may be a handful  of  men  who  will

support the demand of the Barisan Sosialis in Singapore

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- people like Mr D. R. Seenivasagam, Mr Lim Kean Siew,

and  a  few  other puppets, representing only  a  small

minority in the Parliament. In facing a national  issue

that involves a multi-racial society like Singapore, we

must attempt to resolve it in a spirit of sincerity and

compromise   which  will  riot  adversely  affect   the

interests  of any particular section in the  community.

In  order to prove and demonstrate our loyalty  to  the

State, we should be prepared to make sacrifices.  There

is  no  struggle that does not call for  sacrifice.  We

must study the historical background of our fatherland,

and we should accordingly be guided in our struggle  to

achieve national objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we should not allow ourselves to be carried away by sentiments, because this will be detrimental to our national unity, which has been

developed by our nationalist heroes who have sacrificed

their  all  and  who  have  undergone  repressive   and

oppressive  treatment  in the  past.  Mr  Speaker,  no

struggle will be achieved in one day, just as Rome  was

not  built  in  a day. Therefore, we, as leaders  of  a

nation, fighters of the State, must have cool minds and

seek  all  avenues of approach in order to resolve  our

difficulties.  In  this way we can demonstrate  to  the

people  that we are citizens with an undivided  loyalty

to  the State and thereby convince our brothers in  the

Federation that we are truly their brethren of the same

nation and enjoying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



the  same fate. To true Malayan nationalists or to  the

self-proclaimed leaders, this should be the first  task

which  they must discharge. To be overcome by political

sentiments  and party ideologies in order  to  win  the

support  of  the  people will not  solve  our  national

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, to those who allege that

Singapore  has  been  sold to the Federation,  or  that

Singapore  will  he  colonised  by  Malaya,   or   that

Singapore   will  become  another  Manchuria,   I   say

categorically and in all frankness that such people are

insincere  and  that they do not regard Malaya  as  the

object  of their sole and undivided loyalty. I wish  to

repeat this, Mr Speaker - such people are insincere  and

they  do not regard Malaya as the object of their  sole

and  undivided  loyalty. My charge  is  justified,  Mr

Speaker, for we are all agreed unanimously that  Malaya

and Singapore are one, that is to say, one country.  We

are in the process of building a united Malayan nation.

Therefore,  those who regard themselves  as  aliens  or

regard  Singapore as an alien country clearly  consider

themselves un-Malayans. It is impossible for  a  nation

to  colonise its own people. The people in  Malaya  are

all  our  brothers, of the same kind and  enjoying  the

same fate. The same can he said for those who refuse to

acknowledge Singapore as being a part of the Federation

of Malaya. If Formosa reverts to the mainland of China,

does  it  mean that the Republic of China is colonising

Formosa  or  Taiwan?  It  is a different  case  if  the

Americans  go  to  Formosa or Taiwan.  But  if  Formosa

reverts  to Communist China, to me it is not a form  of

colonisation.  If  they really contend  that  Singapore

forms  part  of the Federation of Malaya  and  that  we

belong  to the same nation and are known as the  people

of  Malaya, then there is nothing to fear. I  feel  the

debate in this Assembly would have taken the form of  a

more sincere and sober note, and such diatribes as  "to

colonise", "sell-out", "Manchurian incident",  or  what

have  you, would not have been uttered in this Assembly

by  people  with  any sense of decency at  all  towards

their brothers in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, of course, we can discuss our rights and our grievances. Or we can even ask for complete merger and so on. This is in the true spirit of democratic

practice.  But  to  indulge in such  vituperation  will

certainly  result in explosive consequences detrimental

to  our efforts to bring about unity to our people, and

to  create  a united Malayan nation in our multi-racial

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I sincerely exhort and appeal from the bottom of my heart to all those who have found themselves astray at the end of the road to go back to

the  start  so  that they may not get  completely  lost

altogether.  The  allegation that the  Singapore  Prime

Minister has succeeded in persuading and convincing the

Prime  Minister  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya   with

frightening  stories  is,  I  believe,  tantamount   to

ridiculing  a  Government  which  was  elected  by  the

people.  It is also an insult to the people of  Malaya,

who have elected their Prime Minister, that their Prime

Minister can easily be influenced by the Prime Minister

of Singapore. I am saying this in the interest of unity

of  both the peoples of the two territories. There  are

people  who  say  that  this merger  proposal  was  not

written  in the P.A.P. Five-Year Plan and so  why  must

merger be accelerated? Does it mean that we shall  have

to  wait?  May I ask; until Mr D. R. Seenivasagam,  or

Mr  Lim  Kean Siew, or even the stooges, or  even  the

Malayan  Communist  Party,  hold  the  reins   of   the

Federation  government, who can achieve  merger  before

us? Answer yourself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the challenge that

general elections should be held both in Singapore  and

in the Federation, I feel that as regards Singapore the

challenge has already been answered but I will  further

answer it later on. With regard to the Federation,  let

the  people  of  the  Federation  themselves  give  the

answer. It is hardly becoming of us if we in Singapore,

as  one of the twelve States of the Federation, were to

demand our brothers in the other eleven States to  obey

our  beckoning.  This is yet another  instance  of  the

Barisan's own vileness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has posed this question:

"Has  our  Prime  Minister carried  the  fight  for  an

equality of status for the people of Singapore into the

Federation  Parliament?" I feel this question  is  like

the  nightmare of a person who is sleeping  during  the

day.  We are not as yet merged with the Federation.  We

have no representatives in the Federation Parliament to

voice our demands. Tarry a while until the time when we

can  send our representatives to the Federal Parliament

when  merger has taken place. In the meantime, I wonder

whether   the  Barisan  Sosialis  already  have   their

representatives or agents in the Federation Parliament,

in  the  persons of Mr Lim Kean Siew  and  Mr  D.  R.

Seenivasagam,  to  put forward their  demands.  That  I

would not like to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to "merger", several Members of the Assembly have given various definitions. There are those who say that merger is like a marriage. But

there  are  different kinds of marriages. I  am  not  a

doctor of matrimony, Mr Speaker, Sir, and perhaps that

is  why  I  find it somewhat perplexings to grasp  this

analogy. If the analogy of matrimony is advanced, I say

surely  you would not expect to beget yourself a  child

on  the  morrow of your wedding day. Unless, of course,

there are other ways of begetting legal children! I  am

not  a doctor like the Member for Nee Soon. For me, Mr

Speaker,  I would draw the analogy of a big river  with

twelve  minor tributaries. Eleven of these  tributaries

have been freed of obstruction and have joined the main

river.  But one of these tributaries has had a  harrier

placed at its confluence, so that its water is not free

to  flow  out into the main river. When the harrier  at

the  confluence is removed, the water will be  able  to

flow  freely to join the main river. However,  upon  so

doing,   the   water  from  the  tributary   will   not

automatically  change its characteristic.  That  is  to

say,  its  taste, its colour, and so on,  will  not  be

identical with those of the water in the main river. It

is only after it has undergone several phases of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



the  tide  that its identity will be completely  merged

with that of the rest, in the fullest sense of the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is anyone whose thinking is

confused  and  whose stand is wavering  and  uncertain,

that  person is the Member for Cairnhill. There  was  a

time  when he would thump his chest and proudly exclaim

that  only his Party could bring about merger with  the

Federation  of  Malaya. But now the hollowness  of  his

words  are  only too obvious. Nevertheless, the  Member

for  Cairnhill  has  other excuses to  put  forward  to

explain why he cannot concede that the basic agreements

as contained in the White Paper do, in fact, constitute

merger between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, he merely depends on the newspapers. But he did not take into consideration the paper-work that has been going on. We have not forgotten yet, Mr

Speaker, that the Secretary-General of the S.P.A.,  Mr

Lim Choon Mong, who was also probably an adviser to the

Member  for Cairnhill, and sometime ago that  only  the

S.P.A. could succeed in bringing about merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder how all this is relevant

to  the  amendment. All that the hon. Member is  saying

is,  probably  the Member for Cairnhill and  his  Party

failed to obtain merger. Where is the relevance to  the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I feel, Mr Speaker, that we

are now on the question of merger, and I am replying to

the  arguments that have been put forward by the Member

for Cairnhill, who is a representative of his Party  in

the  Assembly. Therefore, I was touching on  his  stand

and  that of his Party on the question of merger  which

we are now debating in this Assembly. But, Mr Speaker,

what  can the Member for Cairnhill say now? He can only

say, "If the S.P.A. were in power, we too would be able

to  achieve  what is contained in the White  Paper,  or

even more." As the Malay saying has it. "When the house

is  completed, the chisel is heard. When the matter  is

settled, you put in your word."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to speak a great deal about the Member for Cairnhill. It appears to me that the demeanour of the Member for Anson is no different.

Intentionally or unintentionally, he has been defending

his clients from the Barisan Sosialis who, according to

him,  are  in a pitiable state as the Barisan  Sosialis

have no legal adviser in this House. But the Member for

Anson  is  forgetting  that  they  have  many  advisers

waiting outside this Assembly. According to the  Member

for  Anson,  the amendment proposed by the  Member  for

Queenstown  is to make the definition of "merger"  more

complete.  What  is  surprising  is  this.  Why  should

citizenship  alone complete the definition  of  merger?

Why  not  say, "Full merger", which by itself  embraces

the   question  of  citizenship,  education,  language,

culture, internal security, etc.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is even more surprising is that

he  and  his own Party have not yet decided on a  clear

stand  on  the question of merger. In his  speech  last

Thursday,  he showed his considerable skill at  staking

his bets. His habit is to have a stake on all sides  so

that  he will not be a loser. If there are four digits,

he  will  lay his stake on all the four digits so  that

whichever  way  it goes, he will not be the  loser.  So

also is his strategem in politics. He wants merger with

the   Federation.  He  also  desires  independence  for

Singapore.  He  welcomes full internal self-government.

He  also welcomes an international status for Singapore

with the State being placed under the protection of the

United   Nations.  Indeed,  he  will  even  countenance

Singapore deteriorating into another Congo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech last week, he showed his true form once

again.  He said, "Curse the Communists!" He also  said,

"Beware of the Members of the Barisan Sosialis, who are

pro-Communists,  and  beware of  their  intelligentsia.

Then  he  went  on  to say. "Tunku Abdul  Rahman  is  a

foremost statesman, sincere and honest." But he did not

admit  to  having  played up the  theme  of  Communism.

"Support the special rights of the Malays." he said. In

the same breath, he said, "Cursed be those who say only

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



Chinese are Communists." Thus, where does he stand, Mr

Speaker?  He is here, and he is there, so  that  he  is

loaded  with stands which are all calculated to  be  to

his  good. This is the demeanour and disposition  of  a

Member  who brings a hammer into this House. Whom  does

he want to scare and hammer, Mr Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for

Anson  has  ever brought a hammer into  this  House.  I

would object to that.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, he may not

be  bringing  a hammer, but he brings the symbol  of  a

hammer. Mr Speaker, Sir, the time has come. Before  us

now  lies  the national issue to be decided by  us.  We

wish to see every Member of the Assembly declaring  his

stand - whether he is with the nationalists or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it was queer to note the Member for Nee Soon assuming the mannerism of a professor when he analysed the P.A.P. souvenir booklet - "The Tasks

Ahead."  He  made  himself out to be  a  truly  genuine

socialist  after having read only a few  pamphlets  and

booklets.  Unfortunately, he is not here.  He  analysed

the   P.A.P. struggle  in  the  manner  of  Khrushchev

analysing  the  struggle of Stalin and those  of  other

major leaders of Communist Russia. He then came to  the

conclusion  that  the  policy carried  out  by  Stalin,

Molotov, Malinkov and others have all deviated from the

true  Communist policies. Thus it was with  the  Member

for  Nee  Soon  when he analysed the  P.A.P. struggle.

Because  he  could not undertake the responsibility  of

collective  leadership, he came to the conclusion  that

the  P.A.P. has deviated from its true socialist stand.

This   is  the  same  deviationist  attitude   of   the

Communists. For our part, Mr Speaker, Sir, we who have

gone  through  political stress and  strain  understand

full  well  the techniques of people of the Member  for

Nee  Soon's  ilk.  In order to uphold their  precarious

stand,  they accuse others of having deviated.  Believe

you  me,  Mr Speaker, their seeming strength which  is

that of ice will not endure. It will of itself melt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



away without the necessity of anyone else breaking

it  up into pieces. I say, pray do not indulge  in

chest-thumping as is often done by Members of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  who  say  that  their  leaders,

especially   the  people  who  are  outside   this

Assembly,  are  ready  for  sacrifices  and   will

continue to make sacrifices and are not afraid  of

imprisonment  and so forth. We  too  are  so,  Mr

Speaker.  Do  they  think we are cowards!  History

will  yet  judge it. This is the attitude  of  the

people who could not ride us as their hobby-horse,

say things which are untoward and unbecoming -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member, I see, has the

habit of fishing for more bait from his seat.  May

I  remind him of the announcement I read?  It  was

rather  lengthy, but I will read the last sentence

again. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I invite Honourable Members to adopt the course

suggested, that is, to say, to subject themselves

to  self-discipline  and  so  to  see  that  their

speeches  are  not unnecessarily  lengthy  and  to

avoid unnecessary repetitions.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the speech made up till now

is unnecessarily lengthy.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I do not

wish  to speak at length so as to break the record

now  held by the Member for Queenstown, hut  I  am

merely  replying  to  some of the  criticisms  and

challenges brought out by Members on the  opposite

side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the hon. Member for Nee Soon stated in this House that merger would hinder the spread and development of socialism because the

merger proposals are sullied with politics, I felt

surprised. We are elected from political  Parties.

Surely the results achieved whether in respect  of

national   development  or  of  merger   are   all

political  achievements. If  you  plant  a  durian

tree,  the fruit you expect to gather will  surely

be durians. Similarly, you cannot expect a goat to

give birth to a duckling -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Possibly all these metaphors and

similes  are  making  the  hon.  Member's   speech

lengthy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

make short ones. With regard to merger hindering

the spread and development of socialism, we can

clearly see now why the Member for Nee Soon is

afraid of merger. I say without hesitation that

this merely shows the Member's lack of knowledge

of politics. I do not know if by socialism he

means Communism. The people of Malaya previously

were not very alive to socialism even though there

were several aspects of it practised during their

life-time. Even so, socialism has not made very

rapid progress then. Mr Speaker, socialism will

continue to spread whether during the colonial

regime or after Malaya has become independent and

Singapore has achieved self-government. The spread

of socialism will go on relentlessly like the tide

which no obstruction can hinder. It is only

novices in politics who are unaware of this

reality. We in the P.A.P., even after the

achievement of merger, will resolutely remain a

socialist Party - a socialist, democratic, non-Communist Party - and will forever adhere to this

ideology. So long as the struggle is on

constitutional lines there need be no fear

whatsoever. In Malaya itself there are labour

Parties claiming to adhere to socialism. The Party

Rakyat with their proletarian ideology. We cannot

see wherein lies the obstacle to the spread and

development of socialism that is feared by the

Member for Nee Soon. Perhaps if the struggle is to

be carried out outside this Assembly on Communist

lines, that is another matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Nee Soon drew attention to

chauvinism. What did he say'? He said in Singapore

there   was  no  longer  any  chauvinism.  As   an

instance, he said Malay Members in the Government,

including   myself,  were  returned   with   large

majorities  by  Chinese voters. I  do  acknowledge

that,  and  I  am  convinced that in  the  future,

whoever  stands for election, the result  will  be

the  same.  But why did the Member  for  Nec  Soon

bring up this matter here in this House? Is there

some  hidden  motive  behind  it,  or  is  he  now

attempting, as it were, to throw a brick and  then

hide  his hand behind him? To bring up matters  of

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



nature  is like imputing that it was we who had brought

about  chauvinism  and who were  not  grateful  to  the

voters  who had returned us. We would like to reiterate

that  we  always  appreciate the  stand  taken  by  the

voters.  Our stand is clear. Communalism is  the  enemy

and the main obstacles in our efforts to bring about  a

united Malayan nation. Therefore, I say those who carry

out the policy of communalism are indeed the enemies of

every  true Malayan nationalist in this young State  of

ours.  We  realise, and we are firmly  convinced,  that

only  a Party which is non-communal in outlook will  be

able  to  succeed in the efforts to save the State  and

bring about a united Malayan nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is a socialist, democratic and non-Communist Party fighting towards that objective. We

were elected to the Assembly on the P.A.P. ticket,  and

the  people  in  our constituencies have  placed  their

faith in the P.A.P. as a socialist Party which is  non-communal. We stand resolutely on that firm policy.  Mr

Speaker,  only waverers and saboteurs and cowards  will

undertake   to  run  away  from  their  very  important

responsibilities.  They merely make utterances  in  the

Assembly, and with typical bovine docility they serve a

purpose  like that of the proverbial cow which  gets  a

name for the milk produced by the buffalo. This is  the

attitude  of  people  who thump their  chests  in  this

Assembly like the blind man who has lost his stick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to Members of the

Barisan Sosialis, especially the Member for Thomson who

is not here, and who always says that the Government in

the Federation at the moment is a Right-wing Government

and  its  education policy is misguided, and  that  the

P.A.P.,  as  a Left-wing political Party, has  gone  on

bended  knees  to  this Government, implying  that  the

P.A.P. has deviated to the Right, I feel this shows the

true   colours   of  these  people.  This   shows   the

shallowness  of these people in political know-how.  He

and  his  comrades  are unable to  distinguish  between

national  and ideological matters. The merger of  these

two territories is a national matter. The State is like

an enterprise, whilst



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



the  political ideology is an instrument of  policy  by

which  that  enterprise organises and  administers  its

affairs.  Even  after  merger has  been  effected,  the

P.A.P.'s   stand   will  resolutely  be  non-Communist,

socialist  and democratic. There is not a single  Party

in  the  world  which can accept fully  the  policy  of

another  political  Party or another  government  whose

policy is diametrically opposed to its own ideology. We

say  that Communist China, Russia and Albania all  have

different policies. So to bring about a change  in  the

policy  of  a  State would naturally take a  long  time

until  the people of this State are prepared to  accept

the change in the policy and ideology of the Party.  We

are   living   in   a  State  practising  parliamentary

democracy.  For  instance. Party A may be  holding  the

reigns  of government. The next day, it may be Party  B

or  possibly  the  Barisan Sosialis.  Take  Kerala  for

instance.  After  the Communist Party  had  formed  the

Government,  in  the  following  general  election  the

people  of  Kerala resisted and rejected the  Communist

ideology and elected instead the Congress Party to form

the  new  government. This is the practical reality  of

parliamentary  democracy. If the Government  is  Right-wing  now,  this  should not be the reason  why  merger

should not take place. Merger should not be -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I hope the hon. Member is not getting

angry  with the Speaker. I suggest that if he looks  at

the Speaker, then possibly he will not lose his temper.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I beg your pardon, Mr

Speaker, Sir. The Member for Queenstown pointed  at  me

likewise the other day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should realise that one man's

meat  is another man's poison. Ours is not the kind  of

democracy  that is bragged about by Communist countries

where  the lives of the people are solely in the  hands

of the Communist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the rise and fall of any government

is  left in the hands of the people. The people give us

the mandate and they alone can take it away from us. So

let the Member for Thomson and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



other  hon.  Members  in the Barisan  Sosialis  realise

this: set yourself aright first before you start to put

other  people  aright; do not be  a  stooge  and  allow

yourself  to  be used as an instrument  or  a  tool  by

irresponsible elements who do not have the interest  of

the State at heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the sake of bringing about the

realisation  of  a  united  Malayan  nation,   in   all

sincerity  and earnestness, once again I say  to  them - and  appeal to them - "If you find that you have strayed

from  the  right path into the wilderness,  do  retrace

your  steps and come back to the highway." We  in  this

House  are some of the drivers on that journey. A  good

driver  is  one who drives his car with  care,  and  in

heading  towards  his destination he is  alert  to  the

environment along the way, always keeping a wary glance

to  the  right, left, front and the rear  so  that  the

safety  of  the car and of its passengers  is  ensured.

Therefore,  let  us face the national issue  with  true

inspiration   and   a   genuine   spirit   of   Malayan

nationalism. Perchance we will be able to discharge our

responsibilities to the utmost in the interest  of  the

security of the State and of the unity of the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion - although I have more to say, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, but I will heed your advice;  I  do  not

wish to break the record of the Member for Queenstown - I

challenge  each  and every Member of this  Assembly  to

declare  his stand on the national issue that  is  very

clearly and plainly before us. The national issue waits

to  be  resolved  by  the  decision  of  every  Malayan

nationalist. On which side of the line do  you  stand?

Are  you  on the side of the true Malayan nationalists,

or on the side of the anti-Malayan nationalists?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Am I right in saying that the hon. Member

is using the words "Barisan Sosialis" or just "you"?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Nationalists and not the

Barisan Sosialis, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Carry on.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, once more,

with  sincerity  and  earnestness,  let  us  face  this

problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



with  an open heart and with a full realisation of  the

interests of our State and our generations to come.



<br><br>3.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in our world there are often  imposters.

Therefore, amidst the nationalists there are also  such

imposters.  These  people arc false nationalists.  They

say   that  they  want  a  national  reunification   in

principle,  but  once reunification  is  achieved,  the

people  of  the  two territories will  continue  to  be

divided.  Where then is the reunification  of  the  two

territories'!  The P.A.P. are posing  as  nationalists,

but  there are others who are the genuine nationalists.

The  principal  aim  of these genuine  nationalists  is

this. Once reunification is achieved, the people of the

two  territories will be able to undertake an identical

life in the fields of politics, economics and culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our amendment is based on our

dedication  to  the  interest  of  many  thousands   of

Singapore  citizens. However frustrated  the  socialist

movement  may feel, we must have confidence to overcome

difficulties if only to safeguard the interest  of  the

people  of Singapore from being reduced to second-class

citizens. As followers of socialism, we should be  able

to stand firm in the face of great difficulties. In the

history of world revolution, only progressive movements

can continue to survive and the retrogressive ones will

always go backwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the actions of the Barisan Sosialis

are not for the interests of a few of us only. Whatever

we do is for the interest of the people of Singapore as

a  whole.  Our opinion is this. After a true merger  of

the  two  territories  is  achieved,  the  citizens  of

Singapore  and of the Federation of Malaya should  have

the  same citizenship rights. In other words, Singapore

citizens  should automatically become citizens  of  the

Federation  of Malaya on Merger Day. This  proposal  of

the  Barisan Sosialis is based on the interest  of  the

citizens of Singapore. But we have very often heard the

P.A.P.'s arguments. They claim to be representative  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



people.  They used to say that they wanted to sacrifice

for  the people, but now we have seen what they  really

are. The time has come when many thousands of keen eyes

are  watching whether the leadership of the P.A.P. are

really  sincere  in fighting for the interests  of  the

people  of  Singapore,  because the  destinies  of  the

citizens  of  Singapore  are  in  the  hands   of   the

leadership of the P.A.P. This is a very dangerous  time

for  the  future welfare and interests of  the  people.

This is a very important period. The leadership of  the

P.A.P. want  to  strengthen  their  own  interests  by

selling  out  the  interests of the people.  They  have

given  the  interests of the people of Singapore  as  a

gift  to  other people. This is a very evil action.  If

the  leadership of the P.A.P. has really worked for the

interests  of the people of Singapore, then  when  they

come  to  this important test, it will be seen  whether

they  will  endure the test of fire.  In  other  words,

their  real  faces  will be exposed - whether  they  are

foxes or angels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders of the P.A.P. are opposed to our amendment

to  the motion. They are opposed to our suggestion that

we  should  automatically become citizens  of  the  new

Federation after reunification. They have put the blame

on  us, but actually the blame should be On themselves.

Therefore, over 600,000 citizens will be sold  away  by

the  P.A.P. In this case, the history of Singapore will

tell  our offspring that the leaders of the P.A.P. are

the sellers of our citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a nationalist, seeking nationalism

at  a time when the two territories of our country  are

separated, will feel very sad about this because we are

part  of  an independent entity, although we  had  been

ruled by colonialists for so long a time; and therefore

in   an   independent  federation  this  aim  is   very

attractive.  We should try to be part of an independent

nation.  As  patriots  we  should  review  the  present

situation  when  the two territories  are  still  being

separated,   and   the  task  of  reuniting   the   two

territories  is the most important task which  everyone

of  us  should undertake. The reunification of the  two

territories  is  what we want. It is  not  a  dishonest

cheque.  We do not want to cheat the people. Therefore,

the Barisan Sosialis are never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



opposed  to  any  true  merger. On  the  contrary,  the

Barisan  Sosialis have always striven hard to seek  the

reunification  of the two territories.  But  since  the

sell-out of the people has been exposed, we the Barisan

Sosialis  have  very positively and  realistically  put

forward our stand on merger, and have announced this to

all the people.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What we really want is

a  kind of merger that looks after the interests of the

people,  and  not  after our own interests.  To  create

people of Singapore is not -



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Point of order, Sir,Is

he  is  repeating the whole speech. If he is,  then  he

will be out of order. Mr Tee Kim Leng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I have already deleted many words in my speech.  I

think perhaps it will take half an hour to complete  my

speech due to translation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we the Barisan Sosialis have

on many occasions stated publicly that upon a merger of

the   two  territories,  Singapore  should  become  the

twelfth  State  of  the Federation. Singapore  citizens

should  automatically become citizens of the Federation

and   the   ratio  of  representation  in  the  Federal

Parliament should be based on the number of citizens in

Singapore,     in     other    words,     proportionate

representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to spend too

much  time on the White Paper setting cut the heads  of

agreement   on  merger, but  when  the   Assembly   is

discussing this White Paper, I shall give my  views  on

it. I do not want to say too much about it now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of citizenship rights after merger,

once again we have very often given a statement on  our

views and our stand. We have always insisted on a  true

reunification of the two territories - that the  citizens

of  Singapore should automatically become  citizens  of

the Federation. That is to say, the present 600,000 and

more  citizens  of Singapore, irrespective  of  whether

they  come from the Federation, India, Indonesia, China

or  any other country, i.e. irrespective of their place

of  origin,  should, according to  Article  22  of  the

Federation  Constitution,  be  automatically  converted

into  citizens  at the Federation. This  is  the  basic

stand  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  on  the  citizenship

question.   This   is   the   basic   and   fundamental

prerequisite and we will never give way an inch because

this is the basic right of the citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have on many occasions heard the Prime Minister talk irrelevantly about merger and the citizenship issue, and not in accord with our

proposals  in  regard to citizenship rights  and  other

side  issues.  Instead  he has  tried  to  confuse  and

mislead  the people. The Prime Minister has very  often

said  that  complete merger will mean that  only  those

citizens who were born in Singapore could automatically

become citizens of the Federation, This comes from  the

horse's  own mouth. We the Barisan Sosialis have  never

said so. We wholeheartedly want to achieve what we have

advocated  and which is contained in the provisions  of

Article  22  of  the Federation of Malaya Constitution.

Under  Article  22  there is a clear  provision  saying

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If any new territory is admitted to the Federation in

pursuance of Article 2, Parliament may by law determine

what  persons  are to be citizens by  reason  of  their

connection  with that territory and the date  or  dates

from which such persons are to be citizens.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question of citizenship rights, the

Prime  Minister  of  the Federation has  expressed  his

views.  He  says that Singapore, apart from  the  three

Bornean  territories, i.e., Brunei,  North  Borneo  and

Sarawak, can be admitted in accordance with Article  22

of the Federation Constitution. The people in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



these   three  Bornean  territories  can  automatically

become  citizens of the new Federation. Why cannot  the

citizens of Singapore automatically become the citizens

of the new Federation? On 16th November, the Tunku said

at  the  Singapore Airport that Singapore is a  naughty

boy  because complete merger would cause unrest to  the

Federation.  That is why the Federation does  not  want

automatic   conversion  of  Singapore   citizens   into

Federation  citizens. But it is incorrect for  a  Party

which  professes  to  be acting  and  working  for  the

interests of the people of Singapore, to kow-tow to the

Federation,  to  sell out the basic  interests  of  the

people,  to make the citizens of Singapore second-class

citizens,  and  to let the citizens of  Singapore  have

obligations  hut  no rights, to do  such  things.  This

question is vital to the future and fate of the  people

of  Singapore. The question of citizenship in a  merger

must  be  solved  through discussions between  the  two

territories of Singapore and the Federation of  Malaya.

Our stand is this. During the course of the discussions

on  merger  between the two territories, the Government

should state, as our basic principle, that from the day

of    merger   all   citizens   of   Singapore   should

automatically become citizens of the new Federation. We

insist  that we should safeguard the interests  of  the

people of Singapore. We, therefore, maintain positively

that  once  the  two territories are  merged,  all  the

citizens of Singapore should not lose their citizenship

rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Barisan Sosialis want is that on merger, the

present   600,000  citizens  of  Singapore  should   be

automatically   converted   into   citizens   of    the

Federation.  This request is right and  reasonable.  On

the   question   of  general  elections  and   electing

representatives   to  the  Federal  Parliament,   every

citizen should have the Pan-Malayan right to stand  for

election  or  to  vote at any place in the  Federation.

This  merger will have no meaning and no value  without

these  rights.  It is no merger at all. Therefore,  the

P.A.P. type of merger can be said to be a kind of sell-out   merger.  In  fact,  it  is  not  based   on   the

reunification of the two territories, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



it  is  not  in the interest of the people of  the  two

territories. All Malayan nationalists and patriots will

resolutely  oppose this kind of merger. The  people  of

Singapore are now very concerned over this question  of

merger.  They are watching our progress.  Up  till  now

there  have been many classes and many groups of people

who  have  expressed  their views on  the  question  of

merger.  Yesterday  the  Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce

convened an Executive Committee meeting to discuss this

question.  They  urged that when  the  two  territories

merge,   the  interests  of  the  people  of  the   two

territories  should not be sold out.  They  decided  to

convene   a   meeting  of  representatives   of   civic

organisations in Singapore to discuss the  question  of

merger and other related problems. I believe they  will

reflect  the wishes and opinions of all the  people  of

Singapore. When the time comes -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Point of order. Can the

Member  read out any passage or any statement  made  by

any   member   of  the  Chinese  Chamber  of   Commerce

concerning the statement?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Member is reading out, then

it is out of order. But the Member was just quoting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Then he quoted falsely!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): By that time the

P.A.P. leadership will realise the importance of  equal

citizenship rights on merger. This is not entirely  the

demand of a few Barisan Sosialis Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, on 21st November, the Minister for Finance touched on the question of genuine merger of the two territories, in particular, on the question of

conversion   of   Singapore  citizenship   to   Federal

citizenship. He admitted that the demand of the Barisan

Sosialis  is  in conformity with the interests  of  the

people  of Singapore. He said that the reason  why  the

Government of the Federation of Malaya did not agree to

automatic conversion of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  citizens to Federal citizens is  that  there

were  Communist elements among the people of Singapore.

But I well recall what our Prime Minister said. He said

that there were only 300 Communist agents in Singapore.

How  is  it  that it has now been increased to  620,000

Communists? Is it not possible that the P.A.P. leaders

have   taken  the  opponents  of  the  P.A.P. to  mean

Communists? So they now try to make the 620,000  people

of  Singapore out as communists and they are  going  to

sell  out  the  rights of these people. If  the  P.A.P.

leadership  deny that the 620,000 people  of  Singapore

are  Communists, why then would they not fight for  the

automatic  conversion  of  these  citizens  to  Federal

citizens  just  for the sake of a few Communists?  They

would  be arrested under the Internal Security  Council

in  Malaya. Why should the Federation of Malaya  be  so

afraid? I think the situation is not that simple.  What

the  Federation  of Malaya want is not  the  people  of

Singapore.   What  they  want  is  the   territory   of

Singapore. What the P.A.P. is trying to do is  to  sell

out  the interests of the people of Singapore in  order

to  safeguard  their  position.  Therefore,  they  have

collaborated  with  each  other  to  fulfil  their  own

personal, interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for Finance has also said that after the merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, the people of Singapore will

retain  their  rights as Singapore citizens.  They  can

stand  for  election in Singapore. The  people  in  the

Federation can stand for election in the Federation  of

Malaya too. Does he mean that before the merger of  the

two territories, the citizens of Singapore cannot stand

for  election in Singapore? If so, how did  Members  of

this House come here?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> On a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Member will not give way. Mr

Tee Kim Leng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Even before the merger

of the two territories, the people of Singapore can

stand for election in any constituency in the island.

After merger Singapore citizens can only retain their

right to stand for election in Singapore. What then is

the meaning of this merger? The people of these two

territories will still continue to be separated. They

cannot participate freely in a common political life.

They cannot enjoy common economic benefits. Only

external affairs and defence will be in the hands of

the Federation Government. Furthermore, the people of

Singapore will have to hand over $90 million to the

Federation Government. If war were to break out in the

Federation of Malaya, or if the Federation wished to

send troops overseas, then the citizens of Singapore

would be conscripted. But the people of Singapore have

no right on a national basis. Does it mean that we are

giving up $90 million just in exchange for the right to

have a national passport?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in these past few days we in

this House have been hearing speeches concerning merger

with  the  Federation  of  Malaya.  Every  one  of  the

Ministers  has his own particular ideas.  For  example,

the  Minister  for Health and Law, speaking  about  his

idea  of merger between the two territories, based  his

speech  on  the  law.  But  the  Minister  for  Finance

admitted  that it is in accordance with Article  22  of

the Federal Constitution, hut due to the Communists  in

Singapore it is impossible to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have heard the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya admit on many occasions that with the reunification of the two territories,

Singapore  citizens will automatically become  citizens

of  the Federation according to Article 22, so long  as

it  is  passed  in  the  Federal  Parliament.  But  the

question  is  whether  the  Federation  Government   is

willing to do so. We the Barisan Sosialis have moved an

amendment to the effect that Singapore citizens  should

automatically become citizens of the Federation. In the

past  few  days, the P.A.P. leadership  have  found  no

material to refute our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



arguments. Their minds are confused and they have  lost

their  reasoning. The frank and sincere Prime  Minister

of  the Federation of Malaya has also been despised  by

the  P.A.P. leaders. Therefore, in the past  few  days

Government  Ministers have said that according  to  the

Federation Constitution, Singapore citizens will not be

able to become Federal citizens. They have to apply for

citizenship right or through naturalisation. In such  a

case, more than 600,000 citizens in Singapore will lose

their citizenship right. The P.A.P. maintain that  they

want to keep Singapore citizenship. These are but false

and  hypocritical  arguments. It is  just  like  a  cat

shedding  tears  at  the plight of  the  rat.  So  very

pitiful  are  the  P.A.P. leadership.  They   are   on

tenterhooks  and, at the same time, they have  offended

the  Prime  Minister of the Federation of  Malaya.  The

views  of  the P.A.P. Ministers conflict with those  of

the  Federation  on  the question of  citizenship.  The

Prime   Minister  of  the  Federation  has  said   that

Singapore  citizens could automatically become  Federal

citizens  according to law. It could be done.  But  the

P.A.P.  Ministers have always maintained that it cannot

be  done.  They maintain that the citizens of Singapore

will  have  to apply in accordance with the citizenship

provisions of the Federation. From this, it can be seen

that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Rajaratnam)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Point of order. It has struck me, Sir,

that  the Member is referring extensively to his notes,

since  he  is referring to the same page and  repeating

the same thing.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I do not think it is a point of

order, but maybe the Member can refer to his pages.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

from  this  we  can see that the P.A.P. Ministers  have

indirectly  accused  the Hon.  Prime  Minister  of  the

Federation of Malaya



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



of  not  understanding  the  citizenship  laws  of  the

Federation. The legal experts of the P.A.P.  Government

and the P.A.P. Ministers have perhaps been too confused

in their opposition to the Barisan Sosialis' amendment.

They  have  thus  offended  the  Prime  Minister  of  the

Federation of Malaya. The P.A.P. leadership  is  rather

pitiful.



<br><br>4.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  for  almost  14  days  we  have  been

debating  this motion on merger to which  an  amendment

has  been moved by the Member for Queens-town. In every

speech of the Members from the Barisan Sosialis,  there

is  not  one  argument put forth by them  that  can  be

considered  as genuine and sincere. In fact,  when  the

Member for Queenstown delivered his address, which took

him  7�  hours, I was under the impression  that  the

leaders  of  the  Barisan Sosialis,  whether  they  are

Communists  or pro-Communist groups, were  prepared  to

face  the hard fact that merger was inevitable. I  felt

that  they  were merely asking for the type  of  merger

which  they  moved in the amendment, that  is  to  say,

complete  merger  with automatic  citizenship  for  all

Singapore citizens, and Singapore becoming the  twelfth

State   in  the  Federation  of  Malaya.  However,   it

transpires  that  that  is not  what  they  asked  for,

because  after  the 7� hours' marathon speech  by  the

Member  for Queenstown on complete merger, citizenship,

basic  and fundamental rights, etc., it led us to think

he  did,  in  fact, want a complete merger. Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  this  means that he and the Barisan  Sosialis

want  independence through merger. Every Member of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  who  spoke  said  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis   would  struggle  for  full  internal   self-government for Singapore, if complete merger could  not

be  effected. Mr Deputy Speaker, the issue  before  us

and the State is whether we want merger as outlined  in

the  basic agreements contained in the White Paper,  or

merger as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



suggested by the Member for Queenstown. There  are  two

choices, Mr Deputy Speaker, and not three. The  reason

being  that  the third one mentioned by the Member  for

Queenstown  today  is obsolete, whilst  the  people  of

Singapore  and the people of Malaya are struggling  for

complete  independence through  merger.  What  did  the

Member  for Queenstown mean when he moved this  out-of-date  amendment,  that is to say, full  internal  self-government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, I have said that the Member for Queenstown

and  his Party are insincere and dishonest. I mean that

they  know that their demand for merger, with  all  its

implications,   is   unreasonable   and   cannot   find

acceptance  by  the  Federation  Government.   In   the

circumstances, they are aware that the demand  will  be

rejected.  Therefore, the demand has been  deliberately

brought  up.  The  second proposal,  that  is  to  say,

confederation,  is  also  a  proposal  which   is   not

acceptable to the people, so they go back to the  third

proposal,  that  is, a self-governing status  with  the

I.S.C. abolished  and  responsibility  for   internal

matters  being placed in their own hands. What  is  the

meaning of this? If the I.S.C. is abolished and  placed

in  the hands of the Barisan Sosialis, then there is no

need   for   me   to   relate  the   consequences   and

implications.  That  is the sincerity  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,   Sir,  by  introducing  this   false   merger

proposal,   the   P.A.P. leadership   have    exposed

themselves. All the people in Singapore know that  they

have  sold  their interest. When politicians are  faced

with  a  desperate  position, they  will  continue  to

maintain their political line by hook or by crook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this

merger  motion by the P.A.P. was actually  unnecessary.

In  this Session of the Legislative Assembly, the  most

important  thing  is  to  debate  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's speech. From the very beginning of the speech,

there is mention of merger and it occupies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



about  one-third  of  the  whole  of  the  speech.  The

contents of the motion of the Minister for Labour could

have  been  included in the text of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech. What was the intention or the  motive

of the Government for not having done so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of the Prime Minister on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech seeks to ask the Assembly to

express  its thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  for

his  speech. But when the Government came to know  that

we  were  going  to expose them with our  amendment  on

merger,  they  resorted  to other  means.  We  want  to

express  our regret that the Government is  pursuing  a

merger policy which is contrary to the interest of  the

people  of  the two territories, and we  urge  them  to

reorientate  its policy in conformity with  the  ardent

desire of the people for a genuine reunification.  What

did  the  Government do when we tabled  our  amendment?

They were at their wit's end. They did not know whether

to attack us or retreat, knowing that their merger is a

sell-out  of  the interest of the people. Are  they  to

agree with our amendment? If they do so, the Federation

Government  will be offended, as this  is  contrary  to

their policy of selling out the interest of the people.

What  should  the  P.A.P. Government  then  do  on  the

amendment moved by the Barisan Sosialis? So they  think

that  it  is  necessary to raise a motion to  kill  two

birds  with  one  stone.  On the  one  hand,  they  can

hoodwink  the people by offering them false  hopes  for

their  happiness  and comfort, and on the  other  hand,

they can please the Federation Government. In order  to

please the people of Singapore, they are attempting  to

whitewash  the terms of their motion so as to  make  it

appear  very  nice.  They accuse the  British  of  many

things so that they may appear to be anti-colonialists.

In  order to please the Federation, they have to attack

the  Barisan  Sosialis  in  the  course  of  debate  by

alleging that it is a communal Party. That is why the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



Government  have  raised this  motion,  to  attack  and

embarrass us. But the dream of the Government has  been

smashed  by  us.  On the face of it, the  motion  looks

nice,  but  between the lines there is  something  else

which is the height of treachery. They want to give the

people  some  false impression because  they  have  not

inserted   the  correct  adjective  before   the   word

"merger". The Government do not indicate whether it  is

a  true  or a phoney merger. Therefore we now  have  an

opportunity  to counter-attack the arrogant  P.A.P.  We

have taken them unawares by tabling an amendment to the

motion.  By adding the word "genuine" before  "merger",

this is to prevent the P.A.P. from distorting the facts

and bamboozling the people. The effect of our amendment

is  that  all  Singapore citizens should  automatically

become  citizens of the Federation on Merger  Day.  But

this hurried adroitness has caused the ruling clique of

the  P.A.P. to bring up some other form  of  trickery.

They have tabled a so-called White Paper on merger. One

can well imagine the many trickeries and manoeuvres  of

the P.A.P. No matter how resourceful they can be in the

playing  of  words, terms and the introduction  of  new

trickeries, the people of Singapore know that basically

the  contents of the motion are very treacherous.  They

amount to a sell-out of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today when we are debating the question of merger

which   affects  everyone  in  Singapore  and  in   the

Federation of Malaya irrespective of skin and religion,

we  see  the self-professed socialist ruling clique  of

the P.A.P. fanning the sparks of communalism and trying

to  arouse suspicion among the different communities in

order to sour their relationship with one another. Now,

they are fatalist; they are no longer true followers of

socialism.  They  have already forgotten  the  promises

they  made  in  the  l959 general  elections.  At  the

sitting of 21st November, the Minister for Finance said

that  the period 1954 to 1959 was a phase in the  anti-colonial struggle. How correct this is. It follows that

in   1959,   when  the  P.A.P. ruling  clique   became

Ministers,  this  phase  of the anti-colonial  struggle

should have come to an end.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, you will remember the many policies declared by

the P.A.P. to all the people of Singapore in 1959. I

hope all the P.A.P. members and Assemblymen will take

another look at their Five-Year Plan. We can then

understand clearly why they now want to push through

this phoney merger with speed and vigour. On 19th

April, 1959, at the Jalan Limau mass rally, the present

Minister for Culture had this to say. He was

responsible for reading the policy -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is

quoting  from a booklet or a newspaper, he must  inform

the  House  from  which  booklet  or  newspaper  he  is

the hon. Member was responsible for

reading  an article which is entitled "The Path Towards

a  Malayan  Nation".  There is a  passage  relating  to

communalism.  This  is  something  which   the   P.A.P.

promised to the people of Singapore in the 1959 general

elections.  This is from Part I of the  P.A.P.'s  small

pamphlet  entitled  "The Task Ahead".  The  passage  is

entitled  "Class and Communalism". I hope the  Minister

for  Culture  will listen carefully. This  is  what  he

himself said.

<div align="center"><b>MERGER (SINGAPORE/FEDERATION OF MALAYA)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I was

saying  just now that the Minister for Culture  had  on

19th  April,  1959, made a speech entitled  "Towards  a

Malayan Nation". This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



could be found in the P.A.P.'s "The Tasks Ahead".  Now,

I  want to throw at them their own words. It appears on

page  8  of the Chinese version, and on page 14 of  the

English version. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In fact the intervention of the racialist merely

tends  to  distract attention from the real  causes  of

economic  discontent.  For  this  reason  the  communal

politician often becomes the tool of reactionary vested

interests   who  want  to  divert  the   attention   of

impoverished workers and peasants from the real  causes

of poverty.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Chinese, Malay and Indian workers and farmers can

be  led  to believe that economic conflict is based  on

racial rather than class interests, then, so the forces

of  reaction  calculate, there will  be  no  danger  of

Chinese,  Malay and Indian workers uniting on  a  class

basis  to resist exploitation by Chinese, Indian, Malay

and  British  capitalists. Thus it is significant  that

left-wing and socialist parties in Malaya are organised

on  a  non-racial and non-communal basis. On the  other

hand  communal parties in Malaya, by and  large, stand

for  the economic status quo - that is for a capitalist

society.'





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that on the 21st

December  the  Minister  for  Finance  said  that  "the

purpose and true aim of our merger is to overthrow  the

Right-wing  reactionary Government of the  Federation."

It  is truly so. It is well said. We thank the Minister

for Culture very much if he could use the words he used

in 1959 to explain to the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, "the suspicion between the different

communities  is  due to the discontent and  fears  over

economic  situations."  Can the  Minister  for  Culture

recall this statement - "Poverty knows no Race"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now continue to talk about the

struggle  for the reunification of the two  territories

and  the  problem of nation-building. The  Minister  at

that time said that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We, of the P.A.P. also believe that an essential part

of  the struggle to build a Malayan nation is to  bring

about  the merger of Singapore and the Federation.  The

separation of the two territories was partly the result

of  communal fears on the part of Malay leaders in  the

Federation.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think the hon. Member's quotation is

not quite complete. Will he read the whole paragraph?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  been  quoting this passage from an article  which

deals  with the problem of working "Towards  a  Malayan

Nation". There are only a few sentences more:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They [i.e., the leaders in the Federation] tear that

the  acceptance  of Singapore as one of  the  political

units  of  the Federation would result in  the  Chinese

being in the majority. We, of the PAP, reject the  myth

that  political actions are determined on the basis  of

race.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will repeat this, as stated by the

Minister for Culture in the last general elections:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We, of the P.A.P. reject the myth that political

actions are determined on the basis of race.'



<br><br>He continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some of our political enemies have alleged that the

PAP, is  a stumbling block to merger because  our  so-called  "extremist" attitude has frightened  Federation

leaders.   If  what  is  "extreme"  is  our   political

ideology - i.e. the    ideology     of     democratic

socialism - then  merger  is being  refused  not  because

there   is   doubt  about  our  devotion   to   Malayan

nationalism  hut  because  of  our  allegiance   to   a

socialist philosophy.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will reiterate this because it  is

very important - the reason for refusal of merger is "not

because  there is doubt about our devotion  to  Malayan

nationalism  but  because  of  our  allegiance   to   a

socialist  philosophy" - and  that  is  why  they  have

rejected it. He continued to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If our right-wing opponents arc right in this then it

would  be  another  illustration  of  our  thesis  that

communalism is often used as a cloak to cover up  class

interests.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, let me repeat - "communalism is  often

used  as  a  cloak  to cover up class  interests."  The

Minister for Culture then continued to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'However, we believe that merger will come about not

by   political  leaders  in  Singapore   and   in   the

Federation, making a decision on the matter,  hut  only

when  the  people of Singapore and the Federation  want

it.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  this is the heart of  the  problem.  The

realisation  of  merger does not  depend  on  what  the

political  leaders  in  Singapore  and  the  Federation

decide, hut rather on what the people of Singapore  and

the Federation want. But today



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



the  ruling  clique of the P.A.P. have  forgotten  what

they  promised to the people in 1959. The Minister  for

Culture then continued to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the people of Singapore want merger, the people of

the  Federation,  in particular the Malays,  have  been

frightened  into  believing that merger  means  Chinese

domination.  We  in  Singapore should  by  our  actions

remove  such fears. When we do that and when people  in

the  Federation  realise that race  and  religion  have

nothing  to  do  with politics or economics,  then  the

merger   of   Singapore  and  the  Federation   becomes

inevitable.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, this was said in 1959. But today, the

P.A.P. leadership  have  forgotten  it  entirely.  You

cannot  use it to fool the people because this was  our

promise to the people in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we use the above quotations to

advise those who play with communalism. In other words,

only  when  we  and  the people of the  Federation  can

understand  that religion and race have nothing  to  do

with   politics  will  the  time  come  when  the   two

territories  can be merged. There is another  quotation

by him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the reactionaries the end of communal politics

will  pose new dangers. It will not longer be  possible

for   them  to  divert  people's  attention  from   the

political  and  economic causes  of  social  unrest  by

playing up racial issue.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  is  it  not very clear  from  all  these

quotations  that today the leaders of the  P.A.P. have

forgotten all these entirely? The most important  thing

is  that they have not only forgotten this but they are

now turn-coats. They are no longer socialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chairman of the Barisan

Sosialis,  the  Member  for Queenstown,  has  raised  a

series of questions. I think it is not necessary for me

to  remind the P.A.P. leadership of this. One  thing  I

regret very much is that all these questions which have

been  raised by us have not been answered by the P.A.P.

leadership.   They  were  answered   instead   by   the

Parliamentary  Secretaries. The answers  too  were  not

complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-professed theoretician of the P.A.P., the

Minister  for Culture, has avoided these questions  and

has not answered them. Instead he has used the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



Straits  Times,  a  colonialist  newspaper,  to  answer

us - using  the  tone  used by this newspaper.  He  said,

"Will  you  please tell us the reason why you  are  not

detained?" He used this question to counter us. He  has

been many years a -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of order. Sir, an

allegation has been made -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. When a Member rises on a point of

order the Member for Havelock must sit down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> It is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Havelock is not the

Speaker! Perhaps he would like to be the Speaker? Mr

Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I was quoted as saying that some

people would be put into prison or something like that.

He  quoted from the Straits Times. I want to  know  the

reference where and when.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the point is well taken. An

allegation has been made that the Minister has  made  a

statement which he now says he has never made.  Perhaps

the hon. Member for Havelock will be able to quote from

a newspaper or from any other document.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Can I answer a few words in English?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry. The hon. Member has chosen to

speak in Mandarin. He must carry on in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, what

I  said just now was that the Minister for Culture  has

adopted  colonialist tactics. That is what I  meant.  I

did not mean that they wanted to arrest anybody.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Unless the interpretation was not

correct,  I  think there was a definite statement  that

the Minister for Culture said in so many words that  he

wished  to  put  certain Members into prison.  If  that

statement  is not correct, then, of course, the  Member

for Havelock can say he never said that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I did not say so just

now. I only said that he used this sort of tactics,

because I remember when I was detained, the colonial

rulers asked me to answer why I should not be detained.

According to the general method, if you want to detain

a person, you must give what reason you have to detain

him. But the Government did not do so. The Government

would ask the person detained to give reasons why he

should not be detained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I mean to say is that the Chairman of the Barisan

Sosialis,  the  Member  for Queenstown,  has  raised  a

series  of  questions.  But  the  Government  have  not

answered  these questions directly. Instead  they  have

used this tactic to deal with us, namely, the tactic  I

mentioned just now. It is the duty of the Government to

answer  our queries. How can the Government  shift  the

burden  of replying on to our shoulders? If they cannot

answer  them,  then, Mr Speaker, I call upon  them  to

resign.  Step  down  and let the people  elect  another

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the henchman of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Culture, said that we -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of order. Is the term

"henchman"  a  term  of abuse,  in  which  case  it  is

unparliamentary;  or  is it a term  of  endearment,  in

which case it is unbecoming?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The answer is that if the term "henchman"

is  used  in  a  certain context  and  is  said  to  be

offensive, then, of course, it is unparliamentary. Then

if  the Minister says it is offensive, I will certainly

rule  it  as being unparliamentary. I do not think  the

Minister has said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In which context would it be meant?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the interpretation of a word must

be the interpretation of the Member offended.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It is truly so. What I

said  was "henchman". He said: "We are not dealing with

citizenship rights in an abstract way."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



If  so,  why then do they not accept our view which  is

realistic in relation to the problem before us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the self-professed theoretician of

the  P.A.P., namely the Hon. Minister for Culture,  has

requested us to declare our stand whether we accept the

education   and  labour  policies  of  the   Federation

Government,  whether we accept the policy wherein  they

control  our trade and economy, and whether  we  accept

the  ratio  of  4: 1 for recruitments  into  the  civil

service which is now being practised in the Federation.

He has also said that our request for automatic Federal

citizenship is only used to sabotage merger.  All  this

pretence of sincerity in wanting merger cannot cover up

the  true facts. The Minister for Culture says that  we

use  all this to camouflage our true desire to sabotage

merger.  I want to ask our respected Hon. Minister  for

Culture [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There have been several epithets thrown

across the floor, one side to the other and so on.  But

these  epithets  can become offensive if  repeated  too

often  and  repeated  in  a  tone  of  voice  which  is

offensive. Mr Low.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we

the  Barisan Sosialis find it necessary to restate  our

stand  on  merger.  I hope all hon.  Members  will  not

distort  these facts or pick phrases at random  without

regard  to  their  context.  This  should  not  be  the

attitude  of a person who is in a responsible position,

especially the leadership of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 28th of August this year, we issued a statement

of  our  stand on merger. Although the Chairman of  the

Barisan Sosialis has mentioned it, I want to mention it

again. This is because the

P.A.P.  Ministers have very often distorted our  public

announcements.  Let me quote from our  booklet  on  our

stand on merger in the Chinese version:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We fully support the reunification of the two

territories.  The  separation  is  the  result  of  the

colonial  rulers' tactics. We want to try our  best  to

build  a  new Malayan nation. We resolutely oppose  any

form  of chauvinistic consciousness .We will fight  for

the  consolidation and reunification  of  all  workers,

farmers,  and  intellectuals of all races.  We  support

Malay as our national language.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



I  will  repeat, Sir: 'We support Malay as our national

language.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We will try our best to promote and foster the

formation  and development of a common culture  of  all

races of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also say that if the representatives of the

Federation of Malaya adopt the same steps on merger  as

we  have  adopted,  and  agree to  the  realisation  of

complete  merger, then we are prepared to persuade  the

people  of Singapore to agree that Singapore should  be

the twelfth State of the Federation. Like the other  11

States,  we  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  new

Federation,   with  Singapore  citizens   automatically

becoming  Federation  citizens  and  with  proportional

representation in the Federal Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a general election in Singapore to

enable  the people to make an open choice and to decide

on this question, in this general election, we can seek

a  mandate from the people for the realisation  of  the

immediate establishment of a true and complete  merger.

Let  the  Federation Government tell us in  unequivocal

terms  whether they are prepared to persuade the people

there  to accept Singapore as the twelfth State and  to

bring about a true and complete merger before 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the many policies of the present Right-wing

Federation Government are what we cannot accept -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think that statement has already been

read  about  three  times  by Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis.   If   the   hon.  Member  paraphrases   that

statement,  it will be much better. We cannot  have  so

much repetition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

before making this quotation, I told you just now  that

I  was  going to repeat. The reason is that the  P.A.P.

Ministers used to distort our stand on merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is all very well, but all the Member

need  say is that his Party's policy statement has been

read in this Chamber and he invites the Members on  the

Government  side  to read that policy statement  again.

But  I  do  not think that policy statement  should  be

inflicted on this House three or four times.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if

you say so, well, it is not necessary for me to repeat.

But I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



hope  that, as a responsible Government Minister,  when

he  quotes the speeches made by others, he will  do  it

faithfully and honestly and not distort the facts.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Minister for Culture - he  has  just

disappeared - on  the  22nd of November  said  that  this

stand  taken by the Barisan Sosialis on complete merger

was not a true merger. He said the real purpose was  to

ask  for  full internal self-government, which includes

control  over internal security. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

Tunku in the Federal Parliament last month very frankly

told  us  that he did not want a true merger.  What  he

wanted   was   that   Singapore  should   have   closer

association  with  the  Federation  on  the  basis   of

partnership. Therefore, we the Barisan Sosialis on  the

3rd of November issued a statement. The last passage of

the  statement clearly tells the people the path of the

present constitutional struggle. Let me quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We want to stress once more that merger is our main

objective.  If merger can immediately be  realised,  we

are  prepared  to persuade the people of  Singapore  to

accept this opportunity to reunite all the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Tunku has clearly stated his stand, our

request for immediate merger cannot be realised in  the

near  future. Therefore, we must consider other avenues

of constitutional advance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that we should have some form of relationship

with  the  Federation. This should be on the  basis  of

full  internal self-government, including control  over

internal security, as one step towards eventual merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are awaiting to establish closer relationship

with   the   Federation,  the  people's  constitutional

struggle must not be stopped.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, let me repeat, while we are awaiting

to  establish closer relationship with the  Federation,

the people's constitutional struggle should not now  be

stopped.  When the people want to be united to  resolve

our  many problems, we cannot forget the fact that  the

existence  of  the colonial power is  the  main  factor

which   contributes  to  the  separation  of  the   two

territories and the separation of the people of the two

territories.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I had better read the

relevant  Standing Order, because  I  do  not  wish  to

appear to be obstructive, but I am bound by Standing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



Orders which have been passed by this Assembly.

Standing Order 44, which says inter alia:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...a Member shall not read his speech, but he may read

short extracts from books or papers in support of his

argument, and may refresh his memory by reference to

notes.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, in support of his own arguments. I do not

want any extracts, which appear to be the arguments of

some other people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> This is exactly what I am doing,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member has gone much

further than reading short extracts. He is now reading

an opinion on the whole topic expressed by somebody who

has written that pamphlet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this

is a statement issued by the Barisan Sosialis on the

road towards the present constitutional struggle.

Because on the 22nd of November, the Minister for

Culture said that the demand by the Barisan Sosialis

for complete merger was not a true merger. I therefore,

find it necessary to reiterate our stand on this. There

is only a very short passage left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The divide and rule policy of the imperialists needs

no explanation. Any form of anti-colonial struggle is

not inconsistent with the unity of our people. But, on

the other hand, it is complementary to it. In marching

towards the consolidation of our people, we have to

exert ourselves to eliminate colonialism in Singapore

completely. Therefore, if we cannot establish a good

and complete relationship with the Federation of Malaya

in the immediate future, we must struggle for full

internal self-government by 1963.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 27th of November, the

Minister for Home

Affairs mentioned something about me in the Nanyang

Siang Pau of 28th November. I quote here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Member for Havelock was Secretary to the PAP.

Tanjong Pagar Branch. He convinced the Branch Executive

Committee meeting and pledged before all the Executive

members that he would resolutely stand together with us

to meet all storm and hurricane coming. How brave were

these words he uttered! But when the storm and

hurricane really came, the Member for Havelock and his

few friends hid themselves away in the Federation.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I did make such a pledge, but we

were making it before our P.A.P. banner and not before

any P.A.P. Minister or any individual of the P.A.P. We

followed the principles of the

Party. We were not doing this to please any individual

of the P.A.P. If we did all these for our own personal

interests, then I should not be standing here today in

this Assembly. But the ruling clique of the P.A.P. have

today forgotten what I have said. This was all done at

the general elections in 1959. There was no falsehood

in my quoting. It is in black and white. But today when

they have become Ministers, they have forgotten their

promises made to the people in the general elections in

1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been debating the question

of  merger  for  many days. The ruling  clique  of  the

P.A.P. today  are  still insisting on  saying  that  a

partnership  relationship is merger. Now,  whether  the

ruling clique of the P.A.P. are sincere or not has been

exposed  today.  The Tunku has on many  occasions  said

that  the  negotiations between the two Prime Ministers

of   the   two  territories  are  only  on   a   closer

relationship and not on merger. It is not  merger.  All

political Parties in Singapore, irrespective of whether

they  are  Left-wing or Right-wing Parties,  have  said

that  these arrangements are not of a true merger. Only

the P.A.P. have said that it is a merger. I wonder very

much why the P.A.P. leadership nowadays do not honestly

and  frankly want to confess this. I cannot  understand

the  ruling clique of the P.A.P. Do they want to  throw

the  reputation  of the P.A.P. into the night-soil  pit

and  let it stay there and stink forever? Though we  do

not  agree with the Tunku's views, we at least find him

honest and frank. He has honestly disclosed that he  is

anti-Communist  and does not want merger.  The  present

arrangements  are only to prevent the  Communists  from

controlling Singapore. Why does our Prime Minister  not

want  to learn from the Tunku? If he does so, at  least

he  will  not  be  accused  by  the  people  of  being

dishonest and his name will not stink in future years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, the phoney merger

proposed  by the ruling clique of the P.A.P. has  been

thoroughly  exposed today. All the people of  Singapore

know that this is a kind of sell-out merger. The ruling

clique  of the P.A.P. have been playing about with  the

word   "citizenship".  They  are  fishing  in  troubled

waters. They want to hoodwink the people if they can. I

want  to  avail myself of this opportunity to  admonish

them.  The people of Singapore have experienced many  a

political   struggle.  They  have   now   become   more

intelligent  and they are not so gullible. They  cannot

be deceived so easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the P.A.P. leadership will give up their

attempt and walk on concrete ground. They should  think

in  terms  of  the daily lives of the people  and  they

should   rack  their  brains  to  improve  the   future

livelihood  of  the  people. I  hope  they  will  check

themselves. There is still time for them to turn  back.

They  are  now faced with a situation where  all  their

friends  have rebelled against them and their relatives

have  deserted them. They are now with their  backs  to

the wall. They are now at the end of their tether. They

are  now  trying to attack us erratically  to  maintain

their  political power and position. This is  wrong.  I

hope  they will turn back. There is still time for them

to do so.



<br><br>6.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  a  few days ago, the "General"  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis proposed his amendment to the motion.

I  oppose this amendment, Mr Speaker, Sir, because  he

is  opposed  to  a  merger between  Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of order,

Sir.  Just now I clearly stated the views of my  Party,

and  at  this very moment an hon. Member here wants  to

distort our views saying that we are anti merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. No Member

should  get  up  on  a point of order  and  then  start

debating.  The  Member  for Tiong  Bahru  is  perfectly

entitled  to put forward his own opinion. Mr Lee  Teck

Him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Members opposite -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Tiong Bahru must not

lose  his  temper. He has a Speaker who is  controlling

the  tempo and the temper of this sitting. Mr Lee Teck

Him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We have our own will

and  we  try  to be righteous. Of course, sometimes  we

cannot help but be angry. The hon. Member says they are

not opposed to merger. I think they want an independent

Singapore.  But Singapore is a small island State.  The

land  is  very limited and the population is  not  very

big.  How  then  can it be independent?  It  is  really

nonsense  to want it to be so. There is not  enough  of

natural produce.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a

point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It must be a point of order, otherwise

the hon. Member will be dealt with very strictly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. We are now

discussing merger and not independence.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This present debate has been so

intertwined  with the other debates that  I  have  said

time  and  again that I am being very lenient in  these

matters.  The incidental reference to independence  has

been  allowed  in several speeches and  will  still  be

allowed by the Chair. Mr Lee Teck Him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  should  be  a merger between Singapore  and  the

Federation  of  Malaya because the people  of  the  two

territories are just like fingers of the hand. They are

like  brothers  and  they cannot be separated.  In  the

past, the colonial rulers separated the two territories

to  rule  over  them.  But why should  the  Member  for

Queenstown oppose merger now? I think he opposes merger

now  because  he has had a cup of tea with  the  United

Kingdom Commissioner in Singapore. He is willing to  be

made  use  of  by the British. This is a  kind  of  the

British



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



divide-and-rule  policy. For the  cup  of  tea  he  has

sipped,  he tries to sell out Singapore and its people.

But  he  turns round and accuses us of selling out  the

people.  Of course, since the Barisan Sosialis are  now

separated from us, they want to attack and ridicule us.

They  met with defeat. As they were only 13 in  number,

they  wanted to pull us over to their side. But we  are

26  in  number and they are now only a minority. It  is

very  pitiful.  They  could not achieve  their  purpose

which  was  to make one of them the Prime Minister.  If

they  could have mustered 26 Members, then perhaps they

could  have  formed the Government with the Member  for

Queenstown as the Prime Minister. He wants very much to

be  the Prime Minister. [Interruption] I do not want to

be the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid I do not know

Mandarin.  So I am missing all these pleasantries.  But

let us try to have some order. We might be able to save

time if there is some order. Mr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Barisan  Sosialis also claim that many  people  support

them. If there are no people to support them, then,  of

course, they will not be doing what they are now doing.

When  the Barisan Sosialis applied for the registration

of their Party, they copied out the Constitution of the

P.A.P. and used it as their own Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the fact that the

Barisan  Sosialis is alleged to have copied the  P.A.P.

rules   has   anything  at  all  to  do  with   merger - [Interruption] Order. I had better repeat  that.  I  do

not  think  the alleged fact that the Barisan  Sosialis

copied  the rules of the P.A.P. has anything whatsoever

to do with merger, unless the hon. Member is suggesting

that the Barisan Sosialis and the P.A.P. should merge!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

mean  to  say  that the Barisan Sosialis  consider  the

P.A.P.  Constitution to be so good that  they  copy  it

into  their  Constitution.  This  constitution  is  the

P.A.P. Constitution. Are they not trying to deceive the

people by using the P.A.P. Constitution?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the two territories want merger, but the

Barisan  Sosialis want to oppose it. This is a kind  of

sell-out  by  the Barisan Sosialis. Today  we  have  to

regard the Barisan Sosialis as one Mr Kao-kung who was

a turncoat in Communist China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the day before yesterday, the Member for Changi said that in every coffee-shop and at every street corner of Singapore, the people are saying that

the P.A.P. are no good. All this is not true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon)</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> It does appear that the Member for

Tiong Bahru is reading his speech - or referring far too

much to it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have not noticed that at all. Mr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If I were reading my

speech,  I  would not have had the time to gesticulate.

in  fact,  the  people  are  saying  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  are  no  good and that they should  not  have

defected from the P.A.P. The people in coffee-shops and

at  street corners are saying that they should riot try

to  sabotage the P.A.P. They are now like worms  trying

to  destroy the P.A.P. I will continue later on  as  to

whether this is correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the time of the Hong Lim by-election, the Members of the Barisan Sosialis climbed

on  to the election platform to say that the P.A.P. was

very  good and they appealed to the electorate of  Hong

Lim  to  vote  for the P.A.P. candidate, Mr  Jek  Yuen

Thong.  But they now turn round to say that the  P.A.P.

is  no  good. They are now slapping themselves  on  the

other  cheek. Once they said that the P.A.P. was  very

good but now they turn round to say that the P.A.P. is

no  good. This is only trying to slap their own  cheek.

[Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): And the so-called 42

trade  unions also appealed to the electorate  to  vote

for the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all these unfaithful former P.A.P.

members will one day support the British. Now they  can

be treacherous to the P.A.P. But in future, perhaps Mr

Lim  Ching Siong and his friends will do the same thing

again.  This  is only a kind of cause and  effect, and

because this is the opportune time for them, they  came

out  and  formed the Barisan Sosialis. Their  stand  on

politics  is not stable, like a ship without a  rudder.

Therefore,  the  ship can never reach  its  goal.  They

claim  that  they want to fight against the colonialist

rulers  and  achieve  what-nots.  But  they  can  never

realise these things, because their ship has no rudder.

So  how  can  they  sail  on  to  their  self-professed

objective?  This ship will surely ram into a  rock  and

sink.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis today appear to be very "nice and

beautiful", but I say that in no time they will  perish

because they are arrogant, and I despise them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today let me say that the Member for Choa Chu Kang

used  to  criticise the Deputy Prime Minister. We  know

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang in the past had long been

following our Prime Minister. He had been together with

our  Prime Minister. Everybody knows this. His  present

knowledge of politics has, been acquired from the Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. For a moment I thought the hon.

Member was shouting at the Speaker. I trust he was  not

really shouting at the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, will

you please repeat? I cannot hear very well.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I said that the last remark made

by  the  hon. Member was such that I really thought  he

was shouting at the Chair. I trust he was not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  is  a common saying in Chinese - a girl has  asked

her mother to cut out - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This time I think I must be very

strict.  The Member for .Nee Soon has been interjecting

in  spite of my asking him to keep order. I ask him not

to int6rject any further.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

can the Member for Choa Chu Kang be more capable

than the Prime Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to support the motion moved by the

Minister for Labour. Today, the two territories of

Singapore and the Federation must merge. There  is

no  other  way out. Today the Chinese  Chamber  of

Commerce  has convened a Preparatory Committee  to

discuss  this  problem. In  principle,  they  have

supported  this merger. Our Deputy Prime  Minister

has  said that when all the details of merger have

been  settled, this question will be  put  to  the

people and be decided by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has said that our

merger  is a kind of sell-out; that it is a phoney

merger.  Mr Speaker, of we want a phoney  merger,

then  we need not have to debate this question  in

the Assembly. We have already spent about one week

over  this question alone. This shows that we  the

P.A.P. have no intention to sell out the interests

of  the  people of Singapore. Now I say  that  the

people  who try to sell out the interests  of  the

people of Singapore are the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>6.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to clarify the problem

with  which  we are faced in this Assembly.  As  a

Malay, and as an U.M.N.O. member, let me say,  be

it to the P.A.P. which is in power today or to the

Barisan Sosialis which has moved the amendment  to

the motion, this is a moment, in my opinion, which

is  crucial  to our mutual interest. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, from what has been interpreted into Malay  of

the  exchange of correspondence between the  Prime

Ministers  of Singapore and the Federation,  there

is   one  phrase  used - to  effect  the  merger  of

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya in the new

Federation  of Malaysia. From this,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,   all  accusations  made  of  my  colleagues,

particularly  the  Member for Geylang  Serai,  for

having  adopted  a  communalistic  attitude,   are

completely improper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the issue, Mr Speaker. The Barisan

Sosialis   have  been  wavering  right  from   the

beginning.  Although the Member  for  Thomson  has

stated the views of his Party, the challenge  made

by  the Publicity Officer of U.M.N.O., Malaya, has

not  yet been taken up outside this Assembly. They

should  take  it  up  so that the  people  of  the

Federation  and  Singapore  may  know   what   the

Barisan's stand is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I very much regret to hear the Member for Changi saying in this Assembly something to the effect that there are people in

Singapore  who will oppose any attempts by  people

to  sell  the island of Singapore. May I  ask  the

Member for Changi this, and if he has no chance of

replying as he has already spoken, he could convey

his  reply  to  his colleagues who  have  not  yet

spoken,  or he could reply outside this  Assembly:

who  has the right to sell Singapore, and who  has

the right to demand Singapore? I am fortunate that

the  Prime Minister has just entered to listen  to

what  I  have to say. I will not accept  in  their

entirety  the arguments put forward by the  Member

for  Thomson, whether they be true or not. I  want

to  know once and for all whether it is true  that

the  Tunku was referred to as ayah. I am surprised

the  Prime Minister of Singapore should, at a time

when  the Tunku was away in London, have expressed

openly - and  this  was witnessed  by  thousands  of

people  of Singapore - that the Tunku is,  in  fact,

the  father of independent Malaysia. If  that  was

the opinion of the Prime Minister of Singapore,  I

am quite sure he will categorically deny that such

an allegation is untrue. But if the Prime Minister

of  Singapore could declare openly that the  Tunku

is  the  father of independent Malaysia, then  we,

U.M.N.O., will support to the hilt the opinion  of

the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I will not be the stepson of Mao Tse-tung or Khrushchev, because I will oppose the amendment and support the father of independent

Malaysia,  i.e. Tunku Abdul Rahman  Putra  Al-Haj.

People  have said that Singapore has been sold  to

the Federation of Malaya. If it is true, then the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



time  is  opportune that the Tunku must take Singapore,

just as Raffles conquered Singapore with pen and paper.

So  the  moment is ripe for the Tunku to take Singapore

into  the Federation. This has been made clear  by  the

Tunku.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.N.M.O. particularly did not at one time wish for

merger,  but now the Tunku wants merger. What  are  the

reasons,  Mr Speaker? The reasons are as  reported  in

the  newspaper, Berita Harian of 20th October, that  if

Singapore  gets independence, then there is the  danger

of   undesirable   elements   infiltrating   into   the

Federation. There is no need for me to go into details.

This  is  the reason why Singapore wants to be in  much

closer relationship with the Federation of Malaya. I do

not  wish to involve my friend, the Member for  Geylang

Serai,  by  mentioning the long "parang" or unsheathing

the  traditional Malay weapon, the kris or  dagger,  if

the  Communists dare to rule Singapore. I have  already

explained  at  U.M.N.O. meetings that  a  conflagration

will  ensue  if Singapore is given full internal  self-government. If Singapore rejects the Internal  Security

Council,  it means, Mr Speaker, that communal  tension

will  be intensified in Singapore. Therefore, we oppose

the  abolition of the Internal Security Council. We had

already  opposed that line before the Barisan  Sosialis

was registered in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question the answer to which I wish

to  know.  When the Alliance and U.M.N.O., particularly

in Malaya, struggled for independence, whether with the

inclusion  of  Singapore  or  otherwise   - I  am  not

supporting  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the  Prime

Minister,  but  I  agree with his  view  that  we  were

fighting  colonialism  with the  seed  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  at  that  time.  I  seek  clarification.  Mr

Speaker,  I hope this clarification will be forthcoming

from  Members of the Barisan Sosialis who have not  yet

spoken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to come back to another matter which

has  been  the  subject of an allegation,  particularly

against the Malays. The Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



Thomson  said  that  U.M.N.O., as  represented  by  the Member  for Geylang Serai, in his capacity as a member, is  a  communal organisation. If U.M.N.O. is  really  a communal  political organisation, what communal  demand has  U.M.N.O. put to the P.A.P. Government?  What  has been  given  to  us? I hope the Barisan  Sosialis  will

reply  to this. What had the Member for Geylang  Serai,

as an U.M.N.O. representative when he was a Minister in

the Labour Front Coalition Government, done to give the

impression that he was communal in outlook? I hope  the

Member for Thomson will clarify this.

Or  is it his intention to spread communal feelings  in

Singapore? We are against communalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is an important matter because many among us who have accepted Malay as the national language merely pay lip service to it. I observe that

it  was  reported in the news-paper using the  national

language, the Berita Minggu dated 5th November,  1961,

that  at  the Delegates Conference of U.M.N.O., Malaya,

all  U.M.N.O. members discussed the question of  Merger

heatedly.  They were opposed to' the idea of  Singapore

being  merged with the Federation. As explained by  the

Tunku and Tun Razak, the Mentri Besar of Malacca, Inche

Ghaffar  Baba, opposed the view of the Tunku  and  Tun

Razak  at  the conference. Why is it that, on our  part

today,  we  view  with suspicion the  struggle  of  the

Malays for independence? If we are still suspicious  of

the  Malays  and  accuse U.M.N.O. of being  a  communal

organisation,   the  P.M.I.P. is   also   a   communal

organisation. May I say to the Member for Thomson  that

Inche  Ahmad Boestamam is a Malay, and that he  was  at

one  time the  leader  of  the youth  organisation  who

fought  against British colonialism years back.  So  do

not  pay  tribute to one side when we do not know  what

the other side is doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the dangers which will

befall us in our struggle in Singapore if we still feel

that  U.M.N.O. is a communal organisation. I would like

to state here, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I do not agree at

all with the view that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



there should be local autonomy in education and labour.

But  viewing  it  from the larger  and  more  important

aspect,  the P.A.P., by these means, is trying  to  get

benefits for the Chinese people. We can, if we want to,

oppose  that  stand,  because  that  will  be  to   the

detriment  of  the  Malays. But  we  have  to  come  to

agreement  from  time to time. I doubt if  the  Barisan

Sosialis  will  agree to accept 100 per  cent  what  is

enshrined  in  the  Constitution of the  Federation  of

Malaya  regarding the Federation policies on  education

and  so  on. This is merely a political stunt on  their

part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has also

stated that the leaders of U.M.N.O., particularly those

in  the  Federation,  come to Singapore  for  political

reasons and to give political lectures here. This is  a

small   matter,  Sir.  Why  did  the  Barisan  Sosialis

members,  when  they were still in  the  ranks  of  the

P.A.P.,  fail  to order the Registrar of  Societies  to

refuse  registration  of  our  Constitution?  If   they

accepted   our  Constitution,  why  then   cannot   the

Federation  U.M.N.O. members come down to Singapore  to

give  political  talks to U.M.N.O. members  here?  But

after  they have come out of the P.A.P., they  now  say

that  U.M.N.O. members from the Federation cannot  give

political lectures here.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> On a point of order. I did

not  object to Alliance leaders coming to Singapore and

delivering  speeches. I did point  out  that  they  are

welcome  as our brothers across the Causeway, but  that

we want the same rights.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): So, Mr Speaker, on he

other hand, why cannot political experts from Singapore

be  allowed to go to the Federation? My answer is  that

the  people of Singapore, including myself,  are  still

under the wings of the British. That is the reason  why

we should not try to teach the people in the Federation

on political matters. They are already independent. But

there will be open chances and when the time comes,  we

will  be able to breathe freely. We will then be facing

one another in our struggle on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



democratic basis. I shall await the day when  Singapore

and the Federation will be brought closer together, and

we  will have 15 representatives from Singapore in  the

Federation  Parliament. I hope there  will  be  Members

from  the Barisan Sosialis and from the P.A.P. who will

be  successful and who will sit together in the Federal

Parliament  in Kuala Lumpur. I believe if the  Alliance

and U.M.N.O. are successful in winning a few seats,  we

too  will sit there, and that will be the time when  we

will  show whether we are communal or otherwise in  our

efforts to oppose the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang in his

speech,  which was of considerable length, stated  that

perhaps there are some of them who will be arrested  by

the  Right-wing people. I am surprised. Why do we  wish

to  arrest the Left-wingers? Are they such devils?  Can

you tell me that, Mr Speaker, Sir? So, if they are  no

devils but ordinary human beings, the Right-wing people

will  oppose  them with words which come out  of  their

mouths.  If  they  force us to arrest  them,  then  Dr

Ismail,  in his capacity as U.M.N.O. representative  in

the  general  meeting, has already clearly  stated  his

stand.  I  do not wish to express here what  he,  as  a

responsible  Minister, has said he would  do  to  those

people  whom we can persuade by peaceful means  not  to

bring up communalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before the Tunku proclaimed the independence of the Federation of Malaya, he made an opening speech at the Second General Assembly of

U.M.N.O. on 2nd June, 1957, in

U.M.N.O.   House,  Batu  Road, Kuala  Lumpur.  At  that

moment,  a clash had taken place in Penang.  I  feel  I

should   tell  this  House  what  the  Tunku  told   us

representatives of U.M.N.O. who were all Malay members.

This  is  what  the Tunku said, "We all know  that  the

public  in  this  country  are  at  the  moment  making

preparations  for  celebrating  the  31st   of   August

becomingly. The people want to -"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid the hon. Member is reading a

bit too fast



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



because   the   interpreters  are  finding  difficulty.

Perhaps he could start again reading slowly.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

continue.  The Tunku said, "The people of this  country

want  to celebrate Merdeka. They do not want to have  a

blood-bath  as  is  intended by  the  enemies  of  this

country. I still remember what took place in Penang  in

January  this  year.  The cause of  the  clash  was  an

instigation   as   I   have  stated   earlier.   During

demonstrations there were arguments and  all  sorts  of

accusations  were  hurled back and forth.  The  Chinese

accused  the Malays of wanting to do certain things  to

the   Chinese.  As  a  result,  innocent  people   were

involved." The Tunku further stated that what had taken

place in Penang could well happen again. 'Therefore,  I

ask  members of U.M.N.O. and of the Alliance from  this

moment  onwards  to  work  hard  to  organise  goodwill

committees  in  the various villages,  irrespective  of

political Parties, so that all the people who  live  in

this  country  could work hard to bring about  goodwill

among  all  communities  who  live  together  in   this

country."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, it is clear from that speech made in

the General Assembly of U.M.N.O., which was attended by

100  per cent Malay members, that we were asked to keep

communal  feelings away. But in Singapore,  the  people

still  have  their  suspicions  and  doubts  about  the

intentions   of  U.M.N.O.,  both  here   and   in   the

Federation. Mr Speaker, Sir, by the grace of  God,  it

is  fortunate that the Tunku has now become the  leader

to  replace Dato Onn. But, Mr Speaker, if Dato  Onn -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let us not go into details of that

nature, introducing personalities, which really do  not

affect the merger issue.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): So, Mr Speaker, I feel it

is  fortunate that we have as our leader someone who is

keen  to  see  that we and the Federation  come  closer

together,  because  if  it is  any  other  leader,  the

position that will befall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  and the people therein will be a  lot  worse

for the people who are of various communities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although the Member for Anson is not

here,  I do not want him to show that he is a good  Red

Indian. We do not belong to such tribes and we are  not

a  community that is fond of clashes. But we would like

to  tell  the  hon. Member for Anson that he  seems  to

doubt  the  existence of Communist elements.  He  would

like   to  know  how  many  Communists  there  are   in

Singapore. The Government was keen to assist  him  with

information although it was of a secret nature. I  hope

the  Member  for Home Affairs could give clarification.

If  there  are Communists and there are elements  which

are  pro-Communist in Singapore, these  Communists  and

pseudo-Communists have not only have grand-children and

great-grand-children in this country.  In  other  words,

they have been here for many generations. So I hope the

Member for Anson bears this in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I do not touch upon what has been

said  by  one  of the Members of the Barisan  Sosialis,

then  I  feel  I will die like the Member  for  Geylang

Serai  will die and the Member for the Southern Islands

will  die,  without a grave. I say  we  will  have  our

graves here in our own soil. We cannot accept what  has

been   stated  by  the  Barisan  Sosialis  who   regard

Singapore  as a Chinese State. They liken Singapore  to

Manchuria.  I  am sure you yourself will not  agree  to

that,  Mr Speaker, Sir,If you agree, Sir, then surely

this matter will be -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member should not drag the

Speaker into this argument. Whether the Speaker  agrees

or not is something which he will not admit.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg your

pardon.  I  do not want to drag you into the  political

arena.  What I would like to say has a bearing  on  the

allegation  that Malays originated from Indonesia.  Mr

Speaker,  if  Singapore had come under  the  British  a

little  later, I am sure Singapore would have been  one

of the territories under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



independent Indonesia. Do they like to be treated  like

people  who are not sons of the soil of Indonesia  were

treated?  The  Chinese here should be grateful  to  us,

particularly to the Malays who are comprising by nature

and  who  cherish peace and tranquility. Let  them  not

revert  to the history of China, likening Singapore  to

Manchuria, and saying that Singapore is being  sold  to

the  Federation  of Malaya, because this  is  something

which will not be accepted by any Malay who is a son of

the  soil. The Member for Queenstown himself has stated

that  people are physically the same, but  that  it  is

only the texture of their skin that is different. If he

believes in that, then the time has not come  when  he

can colour the opinion of the Malays.



<br><br>7.17 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

the  Barisan  Sosialis are 13 in number today  and  the

Government  are 26. May I ask the Barisan Sosialis  why

not  even a single Malay in the P.A.P. has defected  to

the Barisan Sosialis? Perhaps it is because -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They are probably Communists.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): - they are Communists.

Perhaps this is an apt explanation. The Malays  in  the

P.A.P. cannot accept Communism in spite  of  the  fact

that  they  are  non-Communists. So it is  evident  and

clear  that  it  is the intention of the Communists  to

make Singapore a Communist colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to say

that if language reflects a nation, then henceforth let

us  demonstrate  that we are going to  build  a  common

nationality  within Malaysia and let us  not  turn  our

fatherland into a satellite of Moscow or Peking.



<br><br>7.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queens-town went to great lengths to put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



forward  the  Barisan  Sosialis' view  that  we  should

either have full merger or no merger at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped of all the verbiage, the only conclusion that

can  be drawn is that the Barisan Sosialis do not  want

merger  and that their amendment is just one  of  those

tactics to confuse the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown spoke with derision

regarding  the  vacant  seats  in  the  ranks  of   the

Government  Party.  May I remind  him  of  two  things?

Although   we  are  26,  we  are  strong  enough.   The

Government relies more on quality than quantity, and we

do  not require men of no political principles to  make

up  quantity. These seats have been vacated because  of

treacherous and ambitious men who plotted the overthrow

of  the  Government during the Anson by-election.  Sir,

these  men  plotted  against and  betrayed  the  P.A.P.

because  they were promised high positions.  They  were

led   into  believing  that  they  would  become  Prime

Minister,  Deputy  Prime Minister and  other  Ministers

overnight.  When  the  plot to capture  the  Government

failed,  these 13 Assemblymen found themselves  trapped

by  their  own  opportunistic ambitions. Now  in  their

despair,  they are resorting to acrimonious accusations

and wild statements against the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown has challenged the

Government to resign, and so have the lesser luminaries

of  the  Barisan Sosialis. May I remind them that  they

are speaking out of turn and have taken too many things

for  granted?  All the 13 Barisan Sosialis  Assemblymen

should  sincerely re-examine their own position  before

they  challenge the Government. Sir, were these  people

not returned by the voters because they stood as P.A.P.

candidates on the P.A.P. platform? Now that  they  have

so treacherously defected, can they still say that they

have a mandate from the people? Should it not be proper

that  they  resign their seats to seek a fresh  mandate

from the people instead of arrogating to themselves the

role of the champions of the people?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis accuse the Government of selling

out  the  people  of Singapore. They do  not,  however,

indicate  how  this sell-out comes about.  They  cannot

deny  that  the  Government Party  has  tried,  in  the

negotiations  with the Federation, to secure  a  merger

which  provides every safeguard for our citizens.  They

cannot  be  unaware of the promise that with merger  no

Singapore  citizen  will  be  worse  off.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  fear merger and they do not want it  to  come

about.   But,  Sir,  they  dare  not  go  against   the

aspirations of the people. They know that the people of

Singapore want merger. They therefore try their best to

confuse  the issue by insisting on what they call  full

merger.  They have changed their stand more  than  once

during  the  last few months. At the Anson by-election,

their  call  was for full internal self-government  and

the  abolition  of the Internal Security Council.  This

demand  is a sell-out because these champions of  anti-colonialism would rather live in a colony under British

rule  than to be free. Later, they supported the P.A.P.

request  for merger, retaining autonomy in  matters  of

education   and  labour.  They  calculated   that   the

Federation   of  Malaya  was  not  likely   to   accept

Singapore.  Unfortunately for them, their  surmise  was

wrong   and  the  Government  was  successful  in   its

negotiations  for merger on a special  basis.  Now  the

Barisan  Sosialis want full merger. Surely they  under-rate  the intelligence of the people if they think that

the  people  do not realise what practical  issues  are

involved. They forget that besides education and labour

policies  as  well  as our peculiar  entrepot  economy,

there are other fields such as social welfare services,

housing,  industrial development and the  provision  of

employment opportunities for a fast growing population,

and  so on, the problems relating to which are peculiar

to  Singapore and would best be dealt with on  a  State

rather than on a Federal basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen belaboured the point

that  with merger the 624,000 Singapore citizens  would

not  be able to vote in the Federation, and, this being

so, they would become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



second-class  citizens.  They  do  not  look   at   the

practical  side  of the problem and consider  the  fact

that  only a limited number of people in Singapore  are

likely to want to vote outside Singapore and that  more

people come to Singapore from the Federation than those

going  away from Singapore. The only adverse effect  is

that  politicians discredited in Singapore cannot  look

for  new constituencies in the Federation. Surely, they

are  making  a  mountain out of a molehill  about  this

citizenship issue. For the Member for Queenstown to wax

eloquent  on the issue of citizenship when only  a  few

weeks ago he betrayed his ignorance of the subject at a

radio  forum is surely straining our credulity. It  can

only  show that he is little more than a mouthpiece - His

Master's Voice in Hi-Fi. Unfortunately, it is true that

puppets  seldom realise that they are being played  for

suckers.  Sir, history abounds with thousands of  cases

where stooges and puppets and collaborators have on the

success  of  their  master's schemes  been  eliminated,

liquidated or laid to rest in unknown graves once their

usefulness  has  run out. These aspiring  to  be  Prime

Minister  or Deputy Prime Minister and other  Ministers

who  are prepared to be manipulated will find that when

their usefulness comes to an end, they are the ones who

will be relegated to oblivion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is possible to take the

extreme  view  and  say that unless  we  are  in  every

respect treated exactly the same as all the constituent

parts  of the parent body, we have not been merged.  It

is also possible to say that as long as we have a voice

in  policy making by the parent body, we have become  a

constituent  part  and have therefore  merged.  Between

these two extremes, any association or relationship  is

merger.  It  must, therefore, be' contended  that  when

Singapore  has 15 representatives in a House  of  about 100 Members who decide common policy, Singapore is part

of the Federation and there is true merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate in the last few days has brought up the

fact  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  having  failed  to

overthrow the Government in their abortive plot after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



the  Anson  by-election and having  made  a  series  of

blunders  in  miscalculating the speed  of  the  merger

negotiations,  are  now  in an untenable  position - that

they  do  not want merger and yet dare not say  so.  We

cannot  believe that the Barisan Sosialis do  not  know

that  they  have made a blunder. What we know  is  that

they  have not the political honesty to admit it.  They

prefer to render lip service to the request for merger,

but  to make their demands such that no merger will  be

possible. These are worn-out tactics by now,  and  they

do ring hollow in our ears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen do not or will not

face  the fact but keep on repeating such catch-phrases

as   "full   merger  or  no  merger",   or   "automatic

citizenship",  "second-class  citizens",  and  so   on,

without realising their true meanings and implications.

So   much  more  is  it  a  pity,  because  even  other

Opposition  Members credit them with some intelligence.

They  accuse the Government of perpetrating a  sell-out

when all along the Government has tried to work honesty

for  the benefit of the majority of the people. It  may

be  true that certain people, who are political  risks,

may  find that with merger the liberties which they now

enjoy  under the benevolent P.A.P. Government  will  be

drastically  curtailed, but surely the  aspirations  of

the people should not be held up because of these few.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I oppose the amendment to the motion because it

is   unrealistic  at  this  stage  to  demand  of   the

Federation  the type of merger proposed by the  Barisan

Sosialis. It is also unrealistic in view of Singapore's

special position which I mentioned earlier, and of  the

education  and labour policies as well as our  peculiar

enterpot  economy, our social services and our attempts

at  industrial  development for the provision  of  more

jobs  for  our people. I must emphasise that  with  the

merger  as  proposed  by the P.A.P.  Government,  every

Singapore  citizens will continue  to  enjoy  the  same

rights  and privileges that he now enjoys. In addition,

he  will be able to stand for election in Singapore  to

be  a Member of the Federal Parliament. Every Singapore

citizen will be able to exercise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



his  vote,  to  determine  as  to  who  should  be  his

representative  in  the Federal  Parliament.  With  the

P.A.P. merger.  Federation policies on  education  and

labour  will not affect us. We will continue to  strive

for  industrial peace-with justice and to create a more

just  and  equal society. The policy of equal treatment

for  the four language streams of education will  carry

on.  There  will  still  be all the  opportunities  for

parents to send their children to Chinese, Tamil, Malay

or  English schools of their choice. Chinese  education

will  continue  to  flourish with  the  continuance  of

Chinese  as the medium of instruction in our  secondary

and  higher  educational, institutions. Those  who  are

educated  in  Malay, Chinese or Tamil  would  be  given

opportunities  for employment in the  public  services,

and  our  public services will not be affected  by  the

Federation 4:1 ratio policy.



<br><br>7.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, we the Barisan Sosialis have  proposed

this  amendment  through the Member for Queenstown.  In

the  debate these few days we have clearly proved  that

our  amendment is justified. This is particularly  true

when  the  Ministers and P.A.P. Assemblymen  could  not

answer  the  questions raised by us. It  clearly  shows

that  the  merger  proposed by the leadership  of  the

P.A.P. is a kind of phoney merger, and our amendment is

proof  of it. The discredited leadership of the  P.A.P.

should  rise  up  to face the people  and  seek  a  new

mandate from them, so that the people could make a  new

decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the Minister for National Development

say   just   now  that  we,  the  13  Barisan  Sosialis

Assemblymen,  contested the 1959 general  elections  in

the name of the P.A.P. That is quite true. But in those

days  we  were of the opinion that the P.A.P.  principles

met  with  the wishes of the people, and therefore  the

people  elected  the P.A.P. to form the government.  My

colleague, the Member for Havelock, has replied on this

point,  and  you  cannot say that  we  now  oppose  the

principles of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. But the leadership of the P.A.P. have forgotten

their  own promises made in 1959. We have been  trying

to  seek the true principles but the ruling clique  of

the  P.A.P. do not want to discuss all these questions

in  a  democratic way. Instead they have  resorted  to

dictatorial ways, and that is why today 13 of  us  are

sitting here under the style of "Barisan Sosialis". We

have  not betrayed any election promises made in 1959.

We  the  Barisan Sosialis are ready to face the people

at  any time any place, if the P.A.P. Assemblymen  are

as  honest and courageous as we are, then they  should

be prepared to face the people at any time in order to

let the people make a new decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of merger is a national issue. It can

also  be said to have a very important bearing on  the

people  of  Singapore as well as  the  people  in  the

Federation  of  Malaya. It cannot  be  made  an  issue

pertaining  to the P.A.P. alone. It is not a  partisan

issue peculiar to any Party or group of persons. It is

not an issue which can be resolved by only a group  of

people  or a political Party alone. Our view is  this.

Merger  between the two territories of  Singapore  and

the  Federation  of Malaya should be  decided  by  the

people  in  both  territories, and it  should  not  be

carried out in the manner that the Prime Minister  has

done - by  secretly going to the Federation to negotiate

and   to  try  to  get  his  type  of  merger  without

consulting the people of Singapore, and then come back

to  tell  the people that merger is now in  view.  The

people  of Singapore, especially the political Parties

and  all trade unionists, have given many constructive

views  on  this  question.  Our  Prime  Minister   has

entirely  ignored all these views and  opinions.  From

this,  we  can come to the conclusion that  the  Prime

Minister is dictatorial and is not democratic  in  his

way of dealing with the problem of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for merger between the Federation of

Malaya  and  Singapore is that in  the  past  the  two

territories were under the rule of colonialists.  They

ruled over these two territories with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



divide  and rule policy, as a result of which the  two

territories are divided. That is why today  we  demand

the  reunification of the two territories and  seek  a

reunification of the people of these two  territories.

Therefore,  in  this respect this demand  should  meet

with   the   wishes  of  the  people  in   these   two

territories. The true way to achieve merger should  be

on an equal, just and reasonable basis. It should meet

with  the  true  wishes  and  interests  of  the   two

territories and with the true wishes of the people  of

the  two  territories. But our Prime Minister has  not

done so. Whenever he managed to have some kind of deal

with  the  Federation Government, he would  return  to

Singapore and make use of the radio and the newspapers

to talk about his phoney merger. This undemocratic way

of  handling  this matter cannot be  allowed  by, the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Prime Minister put forward this phoney

merger  proposal, the people of Singapore have clearly

seen  through what this merger means. The eyes of  the

people are bright and discerning. The people have come

to know clearly the kind of merger that is proposed by

the  Prime  Minister.  In order to  resuscitate  their

moribund   and   declining  political   fortunes   and

position, our sophisticated Prime Minister and several

of his colleagues have continued to issue all kinds of

saying  and pretexts. But from these declarations  and

speeches,  the  people can still  see  that  they  are

contradicting themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has said in this Assembly during the present series of sittings that the Member for Queens-town has raised this point, namely, that under Article 22 of the Federation Constitution, the constitutional points with regard to the future status and political rights of the people can be determined. The Minister for Finance says that this is wrong. He also says that the Prime Minister of the Federation

does  not  like  to accept the citizens  of  Singapore

because there are Communists in Singapore. This is the

reason  given by the Prime Minister of the  Federation

of  Malaya.  We regret the way he talked  and  argued.

According to information



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



given by Intelligence to the Prime Minister, there  are

only  about 300 Communists in Singapore. But under  the

present  arrangements for merger, there will  be  about

320,000  citizens of Singapore who will  not  have  any

right  to  apply for Federal citizenship. This argument

does not hold water. It is groundless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also heard from the Minister for Health and

Law  during  this  present series of sittings  in  this

Assembly.  He  quoted from documents and law  books  to

show that, according to the present Federation law, the

citizens  of  Singapore  cannot  automatically   become

citizens of the Federation of Malaya on Merger Day.  Is

this not in conflict with what the Minister for Finance

has stated?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for Culture

said  in this House that we were not sincere in  asking

for  automatic conversion of citizens of  Singapore  to

Federal  citizens  on Merger Day.  He  said  that  this

request  would  not  be acceptable  to  the  Federation

Government.  At  the same time, he  criticised  us  for

bringing  up  this  amendment.  He  further  said  that

because  of this we the Barisan Sosialis are a communal

Party.  He even accused us of being birds of  the  same

feather  with  the  Pan-Malayan Islamic  Party  in  the

Federation.  What  is his motive  for  making  such  an

accusation against us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Havelock has refuted him in a

very concrete way. The object of the Minister is merely

to  confuse the true nature of our amendment.  He  only

wants to continue to bamboozle the people of Singapore.

At the same time, he hopes that the people of Singapore

will  not  continue  to  seek  their  basic  democratic

rights. We the Barisan Sosialis have proposed a genuine

merger  of  the two territories. This is based  on  the

equality   of  rights  of  the  people   of   the   two

territories. It is to achieve a united nation  so  that

the people can share a common political life. When this

kind  of  merger is achieved, they can enjoy  the  same

equal rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Minister for Culture want to level

criticisms against us? His argument cannot be  accepted

by  anyone. His accusation only reflects the fact  that

he  himself  is communalistic. Mr Deputy  Speaker,  we

want  to  tell the Minister for Culture that since  the

Barisan  Sosialis' inception up till  now, our  stand,

views  and  policies have all along be clear-cut.  Just

now  my colleague has read out our stand. So it is  not

necessary  for  me  to  reiterate  it.  We   are   true

socialists. We are working along the true path  towards

the  building of a socialist country. We are  not  like

the leadership of the P.A.P. In name, they claim to  be

Left-wing   socialists, but,   in   fact,   they   are

compromising with opportunistic Right-wing elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of merger between the two territories,

we  have  noted clearly that this is actually a  phoney

merger  proposed by the P.A.P. But our  Prime  Minister

insists on telling the people that it is a true merger.

Our  very clever Prime Minister is trying to sell dog's

meat  by showing a lamb's head when he tells the people

that  this  is a true merger. But I want  to  tell  the

Prime Minister that the people of Singapore have bright

discerning  eyes.  The people have  gone  through  many

actual experiences. Therefore, they are now able to see

what  is right and what is wrong, and to make out  what

is  true merger and what is phoney merger. Last Friday,

when  the  Member for Nee Soon was exposing the  P.A.P.

phoney  merger in this House, he pointed out  that  the

leadership  of the P.A.P. had deviated from  its  Left-wing  socialist  stand. But our clever Prime  Minister,

our  cunning  Prime  Minister,  produced  on  that  day

correspondence  between himself and the Prime  Minister

of the Federation of Malaya. But we know very well that

the  contents  were out of date when he produced  them.

The  contents  related to nationality, citizenship  and

representation to the Federal Parliament. The Tunku had

clearly  given  his answer to these few points  at  the

Singapore  Airport. Therefore, when the Prime  Minister

of the Federation of Malaya



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



left  for  London, the Prime Minister of Singapore

produced  those letters. What was his  motive?  On

Saturday  there  was  no sitting  of  this  House.

Perhaps his intention was to have headlines spread

over the newspaper's front page.
