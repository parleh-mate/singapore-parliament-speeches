<div align="center"><b>IMPORTANCE OF UNRESTRICTED TRADE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BETWEEN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE AND CHINA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Commerce and Industry)</b></div>



<br><br>10.01 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek this

opportunity to clarify certain points made  by  the

Member   for  Changi  in  his  adjournment   speech

yesterday on trade with China.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in complete agreement with the hon. Member

that the separation of the Federation and Singapore

is artificial and that we are one economic unit and

must ultimately merge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore cannot reconcile this with his desire

that  we  ignore the request of the  Federation  in

this matter of temporarily assisting one of its new

industries.  He  questioned  whether  it  is   more

important  to  us  to  keep  a  Federation  factory

running than our trade with China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My statement yesterday morning expressed clearly

why  a temporary ban on certain textiles from China

only  was  considered necessary in the interest  of

the   Malayan  economy  as  a  whole.  Whether  the

particular industry in the Federation in this  case

merits  this  protection  is  a  question  which  I

suggest the Federation Government is more competent

to judge than the Member for Changi is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be deplored that the hon. Member seeks

to  confuse  a purely domestic economic  action  by

dragging   in   extraneous  issues  such   as   the

Federation's proposed action against  the  Bank  of

China  or cold wars between the East and the  West,

and  even  by  the absurd suggestion  that  we  are

trying to assist Japanese industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All actions on matters pertaining to our economy

are taken solely with our own economic advantage in

mind -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Not Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> - and not confused with

extraneous issues that the hon. Member has absurdly

suggested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member contended that exports to China

have  gone  up  by  600 per cent  since  1954.  The

reason,  of  course,  is  because  the  embargo  on

exports of rubber was lifted in 1956. However,  the

hon. Member's conclusions drawn from figures quoted

by  him  are rather confused. Percentages are  very

good  indeed for comparative purposes, but  in  the

final analysis, it is the actual amount that counts

for evaluating trading balances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore quote the Singapore/China trade

figures:



<pre>

    1954    Imports    $68     million

            Exports    $14        "

                      -----

            Deficit    $54     million

                      -----



    1957    Imports   $123.7   million

            Exports   $ 45.7     "

                      ------

            Deficit   $ 78     million

                      ------

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be clearly seen therefore that our

trading  deficit  with China has increased  by  $24

million  as  compared between  1954  and  1957 - that

though our exports increased by $31.7 million,  our

imports increased by $55.7 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are hard facts that cannot be denied and

the  hon.  Member would do well to study the  facts

and causes before launching into emotionalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to reiterate what I said yesterday,

and  that is that the Singapore Government  has  no

intention or wish to hamper trade between China and

Singapore  but  that it has got to give  its  first

attention  to  the  Malayan  economy  as  a  whole.

Perhaps I might as well, with your permission, Sir,

quote my reply to the Member for Kampong Kapor (Mr

Seah  Peng  Chuan) which was sent  the  day  before

yesterday  when he asked me whether the  Government

would  consider lifting the ban on  the  import  of

certain Chinese textiles. The reply, Sir, I gave to

the  hon. Member was dated 2nd December, before the

Member   for  Changi  made  his  emotional   speech

yesterday, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be recalled that when the Federation

requested our co-operation in this matter,  it  was

for   a   period  of  three  months   pending   the

finalisation  of the Federation's anti-dumping  law

to  protect  its industries. It was on  this  basis

that   the  Singapore  Government  agreed  to   the

Federation's request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government will therefore review

this suspension at the end of the year in the light

of the circumstances then existing and the progress

of the Federation's anti-dumping legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, import licences which have been issued

up  to  the  date of the ban are confirmed  without

hindrance on proof of commitment before the ban."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that this statement will help to

clarify the issues.



<br><br>10.06 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I just want to ask the

Minister for Commerce and Industry one question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards my speech yesterday, I admit that the

figures  are not in our favour, but what I want  to

point  out  is that the goods we import from  China

are  mostly foodstuffs and Chinese medicinal herbs,

and  if  we  are forced to import these  foodstuffs

from  other  territories, can the  Minister  answer

whether that will be in our favour or not?  Can  we

get much cheaper foodstuffs from sources other than

China?  Can  he  also assure us  that  we  can  get

Chinese  medicinal  herbs from  places  other  than

China?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the hon. Member has

forgotten  one thing, and that is the reported  ban

on  exports from China to Singapore is not  of  our

making. Secondly, we have no official intimation of

such  a  ban. Thirdly, according to Press  reports,

these goods can be available if payment is made  in

cash  in  Hongkong.  Fourthly,  according  to  this

morning's  Press reports which probably  will  come

out in the afternoon papers, it is likely that this

reported ban on exports from China - of which I  have

had  no official information - may be lifted shortly.

However,  on the point he made about the effect  it

might  have  on us, I made that very  clear  in  my

statement yesterday, and that is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The suspension of export of certain preserves,

salted  vegetables  and fruits  could  create  some

difficulty  in supplies for those who prefer  these

articles but it is unlikely to have any significant

effect  on the cost of living as a whole. It  might

perhaps  be  beneficial  by  switching  the   taste

preference of consumers to similar locally produced

articles."

<div align="center"><b>PIONEER INDUSTRIES (RELIEF FROM INCOME TAX) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of adjourned debate on

Question - [3rd December]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.08 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Changi was interrupted

yesterday.  I  do  not know whether  he  wishes  to

continue  with his speech. He need not  do  so,  of

course, if he does not wish to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I prefer to continue

with  my  speech. Yesterday. I pointed out that  it

was  high  time  for us to consider  the  important

question  of merger. If we believe that  merger  is

the  ultimate  goal  of both territories,  then  at

least  we should expect some sort of reaction  from

the other side; but up till now, Sir, our relations

with  the  opposite side of the Johore Straits  are

very, very cold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our energetic Minister for Commerce and Industry

once  again wants to boost up industrialisation  in

this  country. Of course, in principle  as  I  said

yesterday.  I wholly support the Bill but  we  must

face reality. I do not think that tax holidays  for

five years or even ten years will be sufficient  to

attract  any investor to invest his money  in  this

country except wealthy political refugees. I do not

think that any genuine businessman or industrialist

will  have the determination to dump his  money  in

this  country to create new industries. So, I admit

that  I  am quite pessimistic with regard  to  this

Bill, unless this Government can assure us that the

Federation  Government has something in the  nature

of  a  long-term  Pan-Malayan economic  development

plan  or  something like that; otherwise this  Bill

will  be a farce in the eyes of the public, because

many  industrialists in Singapore have had to  shut

down their businesses during the last few years  We

cannot  merely  say that this was a result  of  the

labour unrest. What about the imposition of tariffs

at  the Johore Causeway? If British-made goods  can

enjoy  preferential tariff treatment, I cannot  see

why   Singapore-made  goods  cannot  enjoy  similar

treatment. I am sure that the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry has received numerous representations

on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to conclude by saying that unless

this  Government can assure us that the  Federation

Government has already agreed to have a Pan-Malayan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



industrial  development plan, then he  should  stop

fooling  himself and the people if he  thinks  that

industrialisation in Singapore can be a reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, since no other

Member  wants  to  speak  on  this  Bill.  This  is

certainly, Sir, a contrast to the anxiety shown  by

everybody  yesterday in wanting  to  speak  on  the

Nanyang  University Bill, perhaps  because  of  the

reason  put  forward  by  the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar - for vote-catching purposes! An important Bill

like this, Sir, and so few speakers in this House!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tiong Bahru cited the City

Council  requiring  50 per  cent  of  the  cost  in

advance  to lay electric cables and its  effect  on

industrial expansion. I admit, Sir, that this might

have  adverse effects on industrial expansion,  but

beyond the statutory powers that the Government has

over  the City Council, the City Council is a fully

elected body and it has as much right to carry  out

its  own policies as the Government has. Therefore,

the  Government  cannot counter the City  Council's

actions. If there is a bad repercussion as a result

of the City Council's actions, then it is up to the

people to recognise it and throw the lot out at the

next elections, if they wish to; but so long as the

City   Council  acts  as  an  elected   body,   the

Government cannot do anything about it. That is the

proper   and   democratic   parliamentary   system.

Therefore, it is no use blaming the Minister or the

Government  for  what it has done or  pointing  out

that  the  City  Council is  taking  this  or  that

action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi, Sir, has been emotional in

the last two days. First, he launches into a tirade

against me about the trade with China. Then he goes

on  to talk about the Federation. In fact, what  he

says is that the Singapore Government must ram down

the  throat of the Federation Government  the  fact

that it has got to accept that Malaya and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  are  one economic unit.  Sir,  short  of

going to war with the Federation, I do not see  how

the  hon. Member or any Government in Singapore can

do  that. But what this Government is doing - this is

what the hon. Member does not like, and he made  it

very  clear yesterday - is trying to co-operate  with

the  Federation.  Co-operation begets  co-operation

and then -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Kow tow!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> That is quite clear, Sir. The

Member  wants us to go to war with the  Federation,

and  we are not prepared to do that because we  are

thinking  of  the future of Singapore,  and  not  a

short-term policy as thought of by the hon. Member.

We  are  democrats who try to get  co-operation.  I

feel that if persons like the hon. Member will  not

put  oil on fire by bursting into emotionalism,  we

have a good chance of making the Federation realise

that  it  is  in their own interests to  co-operate

with  us on economic matters. However, it is issues

which  the  hon. Member raises and  the  manner  in

which  he  raises them that are really causing  the

friction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> How long?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, beyond those two points,

there  are  no  real points made by any  Opposition

Member. I was rather sorely touched by one  or  two

points made by the hon. Member for Changi yesterday

when  he  was  talking about trade with  China.  He

referred  to industry and touched on the Minister's

announcement  of  protection policy.  What  has  he

done?  He  has been banging the table,  and  saying

that  we  have trade on the one hand and industrial

expansion on the other, and how do we reconcile the

two?  And  he  said this morning that the  Minister

should not fool himself and fool the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, to give the diary of events

after my statement on 13th August to this House  on

the  protection policy. On 21st August, at a  Press

conference, I announced the terms of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



reference of the Protection Advisory Committee - that

was seven days after - and by the end of August I had

announced  the  names  of the  Protection  Advisory

Committee Members, and that is very fast indeed. On

27th September we had the forms ready. Before that,

Singapore   had   never  thought   of   protection.

Therefore  everything had to  start  from  scratch.

Believe  me,  my officers, both past  and  present,

have  been working till very late at night  to  get

things  done. As I said, the forms were  ready  and

they were issued to those interested and who wished

to apply for protection. Just before I left for the

United   States   to   attend  the   Colombo   Plan

Conference,  we  had  received eight  applications.

Some  of them we consider are rather frivolous,  as

they have not given sufficient data; but there  are

three that we consider merit consideration and they

have been given immediate consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  must realise that in  a  democratic

system where there are Committees and so on, things

have  got to take their course. At times I do  feel

frustrated myself at the slowness of events, but if

you   are   not   going  to  have   a   dictatorial

regime - where the Minister orders "so  it  shall  be

done" and it is done -  we have got to go through all

the   procedures,   even   though   they   may   be

frustrating; and therefore it takes time, -  things

have  got  to  be evaluated in their proper  light,

Sir.  Every  application has to be  judged  in  its

proper light.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other comment which was made and which

touched  me rather sorely was why I am bringing  up

all  this  legislation at this late hour when  this

Government's life is about to expire.  Sir,  it  is

because  I feel that there is no time to  be  lost.

Economically,  Sir,  we are going  downhill  rather

slowly  now,  but that slow movement  downhill  can

develop  into  a much faster rolling  down  and  it

could  end in economic disaster for us. I am not  a

scaremonger,  Sir, but I see the position  clearly.

In  fact, it is now generally acknowledged that our

entrepot   trade   cannot   support   our   growing

population. It was I, Sir, who in this  very  House

in 1956 first stated this fact that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



"there are people who cannot see the writing on the

wall" - that "our entrepot trade cannot support  us".

At  that  time, Sir, I was accused of  adopting  an

alarmist attitude, but now I challenge anyone, Sir,

to  say that I was wrong. Our trading deficits  are

getting bigger; unemployment is increasing, because

the trade level is falling off, and also because of

the increasing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our trade depends on the economic and political

policies  of  other countries and the experience  I

have  gathered  from  my going to  conferences  and

meeting  various political leaders  and  commercial

leaders of other countries -  even though the  Member

for  Telok Ayer might say it is all a waste of time

for  Ministers  to go to conferences,  even  though

other   countries   do  send  Ministers   to   such

conferences - it  does give me an  insight  into  the

ways  of  thinking of the countries with  which  we

have  got to trade. That is very important,  and  I

would suggest to the next Minister for Commerce and

Industry,  whoever  he may  be,  that  it  is  very

important  for  him to go out and meet  leaders  of

other  countries with whom we are  trading  and  to

evaluate  their  economic position, their  policies

and  so  on.  Sir, from my experiences gathered  at

such  meetings  and mixing with  other  leaders,  I

cannot  foresee a brighter future for our  entrepot

trade  than  it is now. Every country is  naturally

out  to  do what is best for itself. It is a  cold,

hard, competitive world and we must wake up to this

fact and fight to survive. There is not a moment to

lose  in  this fight. Sir, if you will only realise

the long hours we work behind the inscrutable walls

of Fullerton Building, or even in Empress Place, to

keep this fight going; how the other Ministers give

me  their full support by attending meetings at odd

hours    and   perusing   lengthy   papers   during

holidays - all to keep this fight going. And even the

Attorney-General,  Sir,  has  been   overtaxed   in

preparing  all  this complicated and  controversial

legislation - I must take my hat off to him, Sir. And

why? Does anyone like to work late at night and  on

holidays, when he can go to Changi beach and  swim?

It is because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



we  recognize the responsibility that  we  have  to

carry  on  this fight. Sir, as long  as  I  am  the

Minister for Commerce and Industry, I am determined

that  this fight shall go on. This legislation  may

perhaps be too late for me to make effective use of

during  my present term of office, but it shall  be

ready to enable me to continue this fight if  I  am

returned  to  the  same  office  of  Minister   for

Commerce and Industry next year. If another  person

occupies  that office, his task will be  made  much

easier  because the legislation will be  there  for

him to make use of if he wishes to. If he does not,

it can lie dormant. It is harmless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not believe in letting things slide. I

have been a businessman and I know that you have to

push  things  along to get anywhere in this  world,

but  it  is  not so in politics, as the Member  for

Tanjong   Pagar  would  suggest,  Sir.  There   are

politicians  and  parties  who  take  a   defeatist

attitude. Their only answer to all this is  "merger

with  the  Federation and until that  merger  takes

place, it is futile to do anything". I do not  take

that  attitude.  I recognize that merger  with  the

Federation is the answer to our problems.  Sir,  at

the  same  time I do not believe in letting  things

slide and taking a defeatist attitude. I believe in

doing  something  in  the meantime;  and  all  this

legislation  is  for  that purpose.  The  fight  to

survive must continue to prevent our tumbling down.

Defeatism is not good for anyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I hope hon. Members will give me

their full support whenever I bring up this sort of

legislation to this House. In fact, there are  some

more measures coming up to this House which I,  the

Attorney-General, and my colleagues are  trying  to

rush through as quickly as possible. Perhaps we may

not  make  use  of  them. If  some  other  Minister

occupies my office, he may make use of them. But  I

love  Singapore, Sir - it is my home - and I  say  that

anything done for the good of Singapore is good for

<div align="center"><b>BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.26 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Sir, I do not have much to say on this

Bill  since it is just a consequential Bill to what

has  gone  before on the Order Paper. I have,  Sir,

His  Excellency the Governor's consent  to  proceed

with  this Bill, and I move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill, which can be regarded as

being   complementary  to  the  Pioneer  Industries

(Relief from Income Tax) Bill, is to encourage  and

stimulate  the expansion of existing industries  in

Singapore   by  means  of  the  grant  of   special

allowances for income tax purposes for a period  of

five  years  in respect of new capital  expenditure

incurred by an industry for expansion purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only approved enterprises manufacturing approved

products  are  entitled  to such  tax  concessions.

Where  the  Minister for Commerce and  Industry  is

satisfied  that  the  increased  manufacture  of  a

product  would  be  to  the  economic  benefit   of

Singapore and generally in the public interest,  he

may  declare  by order that such a  product  is  an

approved  product.  Before making  such  an  order,

however, full account will be taken of all relevant

considerations, including the existing capacity for

manufacture in relation to the demand, and  whether

increased  manufacture would utilise raw  materials

or skills available in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria to be applied for approved enterprise

status  to  be accorded to a firm which intends  to

manufacture  an approved product will  be  that  it

will incur new capital expenditure of not less



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



than  $10,000;  it is adequately financed;  it  has

adequate trained personnel in its employ or is able

to  obtain the services of such personnel;  it  has

access  to the necessary technical information;  it

is  able  to  obtain  adequate  raw  materials,  it

possesses  or  will possess the necessary  factory;

and  it will be able substantially to increase  its

production capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discretion to grant or refuse approved status

to  a  product  or  enterprise  is  vested  in  the

Minister for Commerce and Industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of the special income tax allowances

will   be   in   proportion  to  the  new   capital

expenditure  incurred  by the  approved  enterprise

during  the  period of three years from the  coming

into  operation of the Bill. These allowances  will

be  granted  in addition to allowances which  firms

are   already   eligible  to  receive   under   the

provisions  of sections 16 to 22 of the Income  Tax

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

had  no  intention  to speak at all  for  the  very

simple  reason  that those who now bring  up  these

Bills  are not going to remain in or see this House

again - and  this  will  happen very  soon!  Although

these Bills will be passed, the new Government will

follow its own policy and will replace them, and do

whatever   they   want  in  the  light   of   their

requirements.  Therefore,  there  is  no  harm   in

passing these Bills. I could not see the reason for

the Minister for Commerce and Industry bringing  up

my  name  when  I have not talked at all  on  this,

except in connection with travelling abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have seldom criticised the Ministry of

Commerce  and Industry all these three and  a  half

years. The reason is obvious. If I have criticised,

I  have  done so because of the deficiency  of  the

Ministry  as a whole and I will do so  as  long  as

they  stay  in office. The people will  judge  what

this Ministry has done or what the other Ministries

have done.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



The  voters will know that while these people  were

in  office,  the  people were made  to  pay  higher

taxation and higher prices on everything else so as

to relieve the economy of the country.



<br><br>10.34 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  I say now can apply to both Bills - the Pioneer

Industries Bill and the Industrial Expansion  Bill.

Sir,  the  Minister for Commerce and  Industry  has

given us a grim picture of rising unemployment  and

the difficulties which we shall have to face, and I

think  all of us must also realise, and in our  own

hearts  must agree, that the picture for  Singapore

in  the coming years is very grim. We all know that

our  entrepot  trade is shrinking, our unemployment

figure  is  rising and, added to that,  we  have  a

population  of nearly 30,000 every year coming  out

to look for work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I support these Bills and every Bill

which  is  designed to help and encourage  industry

and  trade, I must say this: that the prerequisites

for  more  factories or expansion in factories  are

peaceful  conditions  and security  and  only  with

these prerequisites can industries thrive and grow.

Sir,   there   must  be  peace  with   neighbouring

countries, peace in this country, that is, internal

security,  and peace in industry itself. That  last

item,  Sir,  is our biggest problem today - peace  in

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the dignity of labour. After all, all

of   us  in  this  country  are  the  children   of

labourers.  I dare to challenge anyone  who  claims

that  he was descended from a Mandarin who came  to

this  country.  We  are not far  removed  from  the

labourer.  We  admire him, and  we  agree  that  he

should  be adequately remunerated for the  work  he

does,  and  that he and his family should  live  in

reasonable  circumstances. But whatever  we  do  in

this country, we cannot isolate ourselves from  the

countries  around us. Whatever conditions  we  have

here   we  have  to  compare  with  the  conditions

prevailing  in  the countries around  us.  Whatever

wages  we  get in this country, they must  also  be

related to the regions around us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in this country there is industrial strife, I

am afraid there will be no encouragement for people

to  put  up capital for new industries or to expand

existing  ones.  We  in Singapore  are  in  a  very

precarious position, because we live on  trade  and

we  must  remain a free port if we are to exist  at

all.  To  be a free port, there are very few  goods

which  we  can  stop  from coming  into  Singapore,

otherwise  that action will endanger  our  entrepot

trade.  We  can  only  do so when  there  is  clear

evidence  of  dumping to upset the economy  of  the

country.  Bearing that in mind, I  would  ask  both

capital  and labour to realise that they must  come

to  an  understanding so that goods can be produced

at  prices competitive with those of goods that are

being imported into Singapore. From what I can see,

Sir,  wishful thinking and Bills and Acts  are  not

going  to help us at all. What is going to help  us

is  an understanding between capital and labour for

them  to  meet round the table and work out between

themselves how to run an industry and produce goods

so  that  there can be some return for the man  who

invests  his money and an adequate return  for  the

man who produces the goods.



<br><br>10.40 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Federation Government has had the foresight  to

introduce a Tax Holiday Bill for their industry  in

the  Federation. After the introduction of the Bill

by   the   Federation  Government,  the   Singapore

Government decided to introduce this Bill.  I  must

congratulate the Federation Government, because  it

is  a land of plenty. But the Singapore Government,

after  looking  at and studying the advantages  and

disadvantages  of  the  Bill  introduced   in   the

Federation,  decided  that we  should  introduce  a

similar Bill in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singapore is an island, and that

we have no resources whatsoever. No matter how deep

we  dig,  we  will only find water. The  Government

should have introduced this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



Bill  much earlier and not now. It should have been

introduced  three  or  four  years  ago,  when  the

Government  first took office, in order to  protect

the   factories   and,   ultimately,   to   provide

employment for the people of Singapore. Look at the

unemployed  today,  Sir.  The  figure  is  mounting

higher and higher, and what are we doing about  it?

I   remember   some  time  ago  the  Rubber   Goods

Manufacturing  Companies appealed to  the  Minister

for Commerce and Industry to prohibit the import of

shoes  into  Singapore because of  the  dumping  of

cheaper-priced shoes. The Bata Employees Union also

appealed   to   the  Minister  to  introduce   such

legislation.  But his reply was,  "Singapore  is  a

free  port and we either live by it or die by  it",

and he said he was not going to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have this policy of protection from income

tax. Sir, look at the answer the Minister gave this

morning. He was talking about the new ruling of the

City  Council.  He  said the  City  Council  is  an

elected  body. What has the Minister done?  Has  he

approached  the  City Council and pointed  out  the

defects  of  the  new ruling? Sir, any  person  who

wants  to build a factory, as I said yesterday,  if

the  cost is $1 million, the City Council wants him

to  pay 50 per cent. Who will invest money to build

a  factory  if  he  has to pay  this  sum,  whereas

previously  he was not asked to pay?  We  have  the

case  of  tariffs  also. The Federation  Government

levy   a  tariff  on  all  goods  manufactured   in

Singapore  crossing  the causeway.  Shoe  factories

have  closed  down  here. They have  moved  to  the

Federation  where  they know  the  Government  will

protect them and safeguard the manufactured  goods.

May  I  ask the Minister for Commerce and  Industry

how many shoe factories operate in Singapore today?

How  many  of  the  people working  in  these  shoe

factories have been thrown out of work? How many of

these families has he visited? Look at those people

who  crowd  around  the  compounds  of  these  shoe

factories! Has he visited their dependants?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We have had trouble, I think,

with  the  loudspeakers,  and  we  will  have  more

trouble  if  the hon. Member will not modulate  his

voice.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> No, Sir, he has not done that. It

is  up  to him to do so, if he has the interest  of

the workers at heart. It is no use blaming the City

Council  or any other body. Why should the Minister

waste  our  time by introducing this Bill  in  this

House? The Minister is always fond of words,  words

and  words.  May I remind him that we want  action,

not words?



<br><br>10.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

in  Singapore  will have to admit that  to  a  very

large  extent we are at the mercy of the Federation

Government.  The Federation Government has  thought

fit to impose tariffs on certain manufactured goods

of  Singapore  imported into the Federation.  These

tariffs  have  caused  a  certain  number  of   our

factories to close down in Singapore and to  remove

to  the Federation. I refer in particular, Sir,  to

the  20 per cent tariff duty imposed on soap.  This

has  resulted  in  a  terrific  loss  to  the  soap

manufacturers  in  Singapore. In addition  to  this

tariff, Sir, the Federation has been able to export

its soap into Singapore without tariff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about dumping, Sir, I understand one of

the largest soap manufacturers in the Federation of

Malaya  is also doing some dumping here. For  every

10  cases of soap sold, three cases are being given

free,  to the grave detriment of soap manufacturers

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what can we in Singapore do except to

appeal to the Federation Government to be merciful,

to  allow  his little brother at the  foot  of  the

Federation  to be able to earn a living to  support

its  increasing population! We cannot challenge the

Federation.  We  must,  therefore,  appeal  to  the

Federation, before the merger - if they will allow  a

merger - to  give Singapore a chance to carry  on  to

feed its own population.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  air  of hysteria, the wild  moaning  and

bewailing  of  some of the speakers that  we  heard

this  morning, are signs that time has run  out  on

this  Assembly,  and  more  and  more  they  become

anxious for their immediate future. These last  two

Bills -  the Pioneer Industries (Relief from  Income

Tax)  Bill and the Industrial Expansion (Relief from

Income  Tax) Bill - illustrate one simple point.  The

Federation  Government sets the pace, because  that

is  the  body of the Malayan economy, and there  is

very little of principle for us to debate. For  the

benefit  of the Minister for Commerce and  Industry

(who  is as agitated as all the other speakers this morning)  as  to  why his issues have  not  aroused

public attention and interest, I have this to  say.

However  hard  the Minister and all  his  officials

work  into the night, businessmen who invest  money

want  to be sure that the conditions proferred them

will   be  honoured.  The  one  thing,  which  this

Government cannot do, is to offer them., guarantees

which  are  acceptable. Whatever the  Minister  for

Commerce and Industry may think about his political

future,  people with a lot of money to invest  have

considerable  doubts as to the  continuity  of  the

policy of the present Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one single factor under our control, which

will  set at rest the uncertainty of those  wanting

to  invest  capital, is a firm decisive  government

with  a clear-cut majority, and it is my hope  that

the  next elections will produce such a government.

A  Government  which  in four years  has  not  only

changed  its name and changed its component  parts,

but   has   from  time  to  time  shown  signs   of

disintegrating,  is  not  one  that  is  likely  to

inspire confidence anywhere in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the City Council, let me say this for the

benefit  of the Minister for Commerce and Industry.

He  must  be  aware that the business of  the  City

Council  is to run public utilities on an efficient

basis. It is not the business of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



the City Council to subsidise housing estates,

business, factories or other undertakings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

will have plenty of time to reply. The trouble with

the  Minister is that very often he cannot  contain

himself. If he would only contain himself and  hear

me  out  to  the  end, he might  save  himself  the

embarrassment of having made a rash statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the business of the City Council to

sell electricity and run the public utilities on an

economic basis. If the Government believes that  in

the   interest  of  economic  expansion  it  should

subsidise  industry, or should subsidise those  who

build  housing estates, there is nothing to prevent

the Minister from taking a large slice of money and

paying  it  to the City Council for the electricity

consumed by the interested parties concerned. If he

thinks that that is justifiable, let him do so. But

the  business  of  the  City  Council  is  to  sell

electricity and run public utilities on an economic

and husbandlike basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the Bills, all the attractions, and all

the  bribes  that the Government can hold  out  are

only  worth  it,  if  the man  for  whom  they  are

intended believes that the Government will be there

to honour its pledges or its promises. I hope, when

we  reach the last item on today's Order Paper,  we

will  set at rest the speculations that are  taking

place  as  to when we are going to have a  new  and

fresh  government; first, with the will to  govern;

secondly, to govern in the interests of the people;

and  thirdly, with the drive and ability which this

Government has not evinced.



<br><br>10.50 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have, in

fact,  spoken quite enough this morning, but  after

listening to the Member for Tanjong Pagar, to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



statement   that  he  made  that  only   a   strong

government  can  solve  all  the  problems   facing

Singapore, I cannot contain myself. Sir, the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar forgot what he  had  repeatedly

said - that all problems must wait until the question

of  a  merger with the Federation has been  solved.

And  now  he  has the cheek to come and  tell  this

Government  that  all  these problems  have  arisen

because the Government is weak and because  it  has

changed its name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming from such an important political

leader as the Member for Tanjong Pagar, this  is  a

most  harmful  and irresponsible comment.  This  is

going  to  mislead  the people  of  Singapore  into

believing  that if you vote for the P.A.P. at  the

next    general    elections,    then    all    the

questions - including unemployment -  can  be  solved,

because the P.A.P. can assure you of a very  strong

government - a    government   with    purpose    and

principles.  But the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has

forgotten  what  he  has  repeatedly  said  on  the

P.A.P.'s  platform - that the only  solution  to  our

problems   is  linked  with  a  merger   with   the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to hear the Nominated Member, Mr

R. C. H. Lim, point out certain facts in connection

with  the  soap and shoe factories in Singapore.  I

raised  a  question  about  industrialisation  this

morning,   but   unfortunately  the  Minister   for

Commerce and Industry did not reply to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill. I do not care if

accusations are levelled at the Government that its

period of office is short or long. What I wish  the

Government  to do is to assure us if  it  is  able,

either  openly  or  secretly,  to  arrive   at   an

understanding  with  the Federation  of  Malaya  to

formulate  a  long-term  Pan-Malayan  economic   or

industrial  development plan.  If  Malaya  is  more

suitably  placed  to produce soap  and  shoes,  all

right,  let it do so. If the Federation  of  Malaya

does  not want to set up certain industries, or  it

can  do without them, it can let us have them. That

is  the  sort  of  long-term policy  to  formulate.

Without  such a plan, a local investor who puts  up

money to set up a plastics



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



factory  may find, reading the papers a few  months

later,  another plastics factory being  established

in the Federation. This Federation plastics factory

may  be  much bigger than his own, it may  even  be

supported by R.I.D.A. or the Colombo Plan.  He  may

even  find that since a Federation plastics factory

has  been  set  up, the Federation  Government  may

impose a tariff on plastics entering its territory.

In  the  face  of all this, the local investor  may

either  have to shut down his factory or remove  to

the  Federation.  The money spent  on  installation

will  have  been  wasted.  Of  course,  labour  can

emigrate  to  the  Federation  since  there  is  no

passport  or  visa system yet in force.  But  money

will have been wasted on installation. And all this

happens  because there is no Pan-Malayan industrial

development plan. So I wish to repeat the  question

which I have earlier asked the Government: is there

any  possibility  of this Government  to  reach  an

understanding with the Federation Government in the

near  future  on the formulation of  a  Pan-Malayan

industrial development plan? Let us be fair to  the

Federation. "All right, we agree you have to  solve

your  unemployment problem. You can reserve certain

items of goods for manufacture. But there are other

items  which  you  do not want, and  which  we  can

manufacture  in  Singapore. Let us have  them."  If

that  understanding is reached, a  proper  solution

will have been achieved.



<br><br>10.56 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Bill  today has one aim, and that  aim  is  to

attract  more  capital into  this  country  and  so

create  more  opportunities for employment.  It  is

strange,  Sir, that the tune which we hear  now  is

very  different from the one we have heard  one  or

two  years  ago.  Those who have  been  loudest  in

crying   out,   "Down  with  capital!   Down   with

capitalism!", are now also joining in the  song  of

asking  capital  to come into Singapore.  They  are

asking  capital  to watch out as to  who  would  be

coming into power in the next elections. But all of

them want capital to come in in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



order  to  help Singapore! I suppose as politicians

live   and  learn,  they  become  wiser  and   more

responsible;  but  if we recollect  what  has  been

going on all these years, we can pinpoint where the

trouble  comes  from and how the  problems  created

have arisen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, coming back to this Bill, I would like

the   Minister  to  note  that  at  present   every

undeveloped  country  is  holding  out  a  lot   of

promises to capital, giving it as attractive  terms

as possible in order to induce it to come and build

factories  here. I just want to make  a  comparison

between Singapore and our immediate neighbour,  the

Federation  of  Malaya.  Both  countries  hold  out

promises; both of them have tax holidays;  both  of

them  have  all  sorts of other things  which  give

benefits  to the manufacturers. But we  must  think

from the investors' point of view. "Two territories

asking us to invest our capital there. Where  shall

we go?" The investors will definitely weigh all the

factors.  Which  territory is  more  beneficial  to

them?  Factors  favourable to  the  Federation  are

tariff  protection,  a large and  expanding  market

and,  most  important of all,  a  stable  political

climate. What do we have in Singapore? We have easy

means  of transport, but that is about all. We  are

the  focal  point  of  communications.  We  are  an

entrepot.  We  have nothing more to offer  them.  I

think  the  only  thing which Singapore  can  offer

those who want to come and invest their money  here

will  be  a  sense of security. That  can  only  be

achieved  with Government in the lead  creating  it

and  the people of Singapore following sanely.  The

people  of Singapore must realise that the  problem

of  unemployment is one that is facing them and not

those  people  with  money. We must  see  that  our

children have a means of earning their living  when

they grow up, and the only way of doing that is  to

see that sensible people will always hold the reins

of  government,  not  those who  shout  slogans  to

frighten  away people who wish to come to  give  us

jobs  and  to give us prosperity in the  matter  of

business.  I  have always said that I  am  all  for

labour,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



and  yet you may ask me, Sir, why I am saying this.

I  say  this in order that we might give capital  a

little benefit. Yes, Sir, we must give capital some

benefit  in  order that we might benefit ourselves.

We  are helping capitalists not because we want  to

help  them  just for the sake of helping them,  but

because  by  helping  them,  they  will  help   the

labourers. We want to give them a fair share of the

profits  so  that  we may have a  fuller  share  of

employment and the people of Singapore will have  a

chance of feeding themselves and not rely on social

welfare benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next general election is about the most

important  in  Singapore.  By  that  election,  the

people  of  Singapore will know whether their  rice

bowl  will be broken or whether it is going  to  be

filled. If those who have proved themselves  to  be

irresponsible  and  have chased  away  capital  are

going  to come into office, there will be no future

for   the  workers  of  Singapore.  They  will   go

unemployed and whatever money Government will  have

will be insufficient for social welfare benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look, Sir, at those other facilities that

Singapore can offer. Previous speakers have  spoken

about  the  City Council. I personally  feel,  Sir,

that if the Government is responsible for promoting

business   and   bringing  happiness   and   fuller

employment   to   the  country,  then   the   local

government  should also be as responsible.  If  the

Government wants to attract capital knowing that it

is  good  for the people, I believe, Sir, that  the

local government too should realise that. They  are

just  as responsible to the people and if they  put

obstacles in the way of progress, then I think they

are  not  serving the people. They are only looking

on  the symptoms of a disease to effect a cure  and

not  curing it by knowing what actually causes  the

disease. If a person is suffering from T.B. and the

doctor says, "Take a cough mixture because you  are

coughing",  then  he is doing the patient  a  great

deal  of harm. But if the doctor knows that  it  is

T.B. and  then  treats him for that  so  that  the

patient has a chance of recovering then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



he  is  doing his duty. If the doctor knows that  a

person is suffering from T.B. and yet gives  him  a

cough  mixture, that doctor ought to be struck  off

the register and not be allowed to practise! If the

City  Council want more employment for  the  people

but   yet  obstruct  opportunities  for  increasing

employment,  then  they are not a responsible  body

and are not beneficial to the people!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to this Bill, I certainly feel

that  it  is  one  which shows that the  Government

today  is aware of what it is doing and that it  is

striving to do its best in order to attract  people

to  build factories here. However, I would like the

Minister  to note that although we want to  attract

new  factories into this country, we must also help

or protect our existing industries. Let us conserve

what  we  have and at the same time strive to  make

new  gains.  Let  us tell the Industrial  Promotion

Board,  which  has  received the blessing  of  this

Assembly,  to  go  ahead with the  job  of  helping

locally established industries, or those industries

in Singapore that need financial assistance. Let us

help  the  shoe factories; let us help the  beehoon

factories;  let us help all the existing  factories

that  need  a  helping hand from the  Minister  for

Commerce and Industry.



<br><br>11.06 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir, I am glad that

at  this late stage I have been able to arouse some

debate  in this House on economic matters.  Usually

it  is political matters which appeal to the public

and the Gallery and which arouse a lot of debate. I

am particularly glad, Sir, that I have been able to

draw  out  the Member for Tanjong Pagar because  up

till now he has been a big question mark as far  as

economic matters are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I come to the serious part of the

debate,  I just want to correct what might  perhaps

be  a misapprehension in the mind of the Member for

Telok  Ayer,  and that is I have no inclination  to

criticise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



or attack him. I was only giving a  factual

reply to a reportedly actual statement which I read

in the Press on my return. Sir, I have great regard

personally  for  the  hon, gentleman - for   obvious

reasons - but not for his politics, and I  would  not

want him to get the impression that I attacked  him

personally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tiong Bahru in his usual way

tried  to  give the credit to somebody else  rather

than  to the Government. He proclaimed loudly  that

he  thanked  the  Federation  for  introducing  its

Pioneer Industry Bill first, and that we were  mere

stooges  who followed the Federation. But in  point

of  fact  that is not correct because - memories  are

not  short - it was in November 1956, in a  statement

on industrial policy which I made to this House (if

I  remember the date rightly, it was 11th November,

1956)  that I announced amongst other things,  that

capital  repatriation would be  guaranteed,  profit

remittances would be guaranteed, and so on. I  said

then  that  the question of giving tax holidays  to

industry was being considered. Since income tax  is

a  Pan-Malayan  subject,  we  then  approached  the

Federation. In fact, I can truthfully say  that  it

was  our  move first, We approached the  Federation

first and put the idea to them. Whether or not they

first  originated the Bill is immaterial. The  time

difference  is very small. I am not trying  to  say

this to steal the credit from the Federation, but I

am  just trying to correct an impression which  the

hon.  Member tried to create, and that is  that  we

just  followed  the Federation like  "stooges".  In

fact, it was our idea first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member then waxed and waned over the

delay  in  introducing this Bill. I can  only  say,

Sir, that the machinery of government does not  run

as  quickly as an individual's can run. Because  it

is  a  Pan-Malayan subject, there  had  got  to  be

consultations between the Federation and Singapore,

and that of course has meant delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member asked, "Has the Ministry

approached  the  City Council  on  the  electricity

problem?"  That was the stage, I think, Sir,  where

you  indicated that the microphones  might  not  be

able to bear up with such a loud voice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



Sir, on this question of the City Council, how does

he  know?  Has he access to my files? How  does  he

know  that we have not approached the City Council?

Has  the  Minister got to inform the Opposition  of

every    action   performed   by   him   and    his

officials - that  I have done this and  my  officials

have  done that? There are hundreds of actions that

we  have to take. Even matters which are beneficial

directly  to  the trade and which have resulted  in

great  profits, and matters where we try to  smooth

out  difficulties  that  arise  in  our  day-to-day

transactions with Indonesia, are not  heard  of  by

the  public  at all, because those are  matters  of

routine for us. If we start making a song and dance

about  it, you will have to sit here for  days  and

days listening to a recital of what we have done in

the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changi - I will come to the

Member for Tanjong Pagar last because that is the

juicy part of my reply -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> A great man!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> - has repeatedly tried to pin

me  down  on  one question, and that is whether  we

have  approached the Federation on the question  of

consideration  of  economy on a Pan-Malayan  basis.

Sir,  I  wish  I  could give  him  all  the  inside

information but I am afraid I cannot do that. It is

not  considered right for me to do that, but I  can

just  tell him in one word, and that is, 'Yes'  and

that yes is pregnant with meaning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> We have made such approaches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I come to the Member for Tanjong Pagar.

I  am sorry, Sir, to see that he is not here and  I

do  not like to talk behind a person's back, but  I

suppose he will be able to read what I have to  say

in  the  Hansard, or his hon, colleague will convey

to  him, I hope, without due embellishment, what  I

say and in its proper perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing, Sir, was that he launched into a

tirade  against me for attacking the City  Council,

but  if he had only let me elucidate at that moment

he would have saved his breath and would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



have  been  saved the embarrassment of  showing  to

others  that  he  had not followed the  debate.  In

fact,  I defended the City Council. Sir, the attack

on  the City Council came from the Member for Tiong

Bahru.  I  defended the City Council and said  that

they are an elected body, that whatever they do  is

their  business, and that the Government cannot  do

anything  about it. However, as a result  of  that,

Sir,  he  has given me an opening which I  had  not

taken before in past debates, and that is that  the

P.A.P. have never come out with what their economic

policy  is  or  is going to be if  they  come  into

power; and if what is happening in the City Council

during the last year is an indication of what their

economic policies are going to be, then the  P.A.P.

Government will have no hope of attracting  capital

at  all.  Sir,  in  the past - I would  not  say  the

P.A.P. - but  sources  closely  connected  with   the

P.A.P. have been responsible for alleged anti-White

and  anti-capital activities - especially anti-White

activities. Let me make it very clear, Sir, that  I

have  no  love  for the British but the  PAP, must

recognise  this fact and, in spite of  running  the

risk  of  being unpopular, I am going  to  ask  the

House and the public: who are the capital exporting

and  importing  countries today in  the  world?  No

Asian  country has got surplus capital. Every Asian

country,  whether  it is India, Ceylon,  Indonesia,

Malaya  or  any  African country for  that  matter -

Egypt and Ghana - is capital importing. They all need

capital.  The exporting countries are the  European

countries - the  Whites - that  is  West  Germany,  the

United  Kingdom, the United States of America  and,

to  a  certain  extent, Australia and Canada.  Now.

Sir,  I remember distinctly the day the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar turned round to Mr Sutherland,  who

represented  British capital interests,  and  said,

"You wait till we come into power." That, Sir,  had

a very great scaring effect on capital.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Good show!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Now, Sir, I do not say that I

love  the  British  any more than  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



does, but I am in my right senses. Sir, I recognise

where   the  benefits  come  from  and  where   the

exploitation  is, and I will fight exploitation  at

every  step,  for example, my plan for  a  People's

Cigarette Factory, but where they are beneficial to

us,  we  want their co-operation and we  must  give

them  that  co-operation without strings  attached,

because  if  you  attach strings, there  are  other

countries which are willing to give them  that  co-operation  without strings attached. It is  to  our

own  advantage.  The  real reason  why  capital  is

scared  and  is not coming here is not because,  as

has  been  suggested that this  Government  is  not

stable and subject to permutations and combinations

in its composition, but it is because of the P.A.P.

The  investing public are scared as  to  what  will

happen to them if the P.A.P. come into power.  That

is a big question mark which the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  has  never  thought fit in the  interest  of

Singapore - never  mind  his Party,  Singapore  is  a

bigger  interest - to answer and to inform the public

what  the  P.A.P. attitude to foreign capital  will

be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can conceive of one Party being in power in two

bodies - both in the Government and the City Council.

If the City Council is only thinking of how to sell

electricity  at  an economic price, without  caring

that   the   Government  is  trying  to   encourage

industry,  the  policy of the P.A.P. in  the  City

Council  may come into conflict with the policy  of

the  P.A.P. in the Government. The hon. Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar has suggested that the City  Council

will  only consider their job: and that is  how  to

sell electricity at an economic price, and if their

Government  policy was, if they were in  power,  to

encourage industries, then what would happen,  Sir?

The City Council would say, "Sorry, we will put the

electricity  rates up." The Government  would  tell

the  City Council, "Please do not, because we  want

to  encourage industry." What would happen then? If

their  policy in the City Council is an  indication

of  the  shape  of things to come in  the  economic

field,  the people will be scared. They are  scared

not  because  of the present government  not  being

stable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member also suggested that if the

Government  wished, it could subsidize  industries.

In fact, this Bill is for an indirect subsidy. That

is  exactly  what  we are doing.  We  are  inviting

capital.  Government says, "Go ahead, come  in  for

five years. You do not have to pay any taxes." That

is an indirect subsidy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, I have said enough on this subject,

but  I am glad that I have been able to excite  the

interest  of Members on such subjects.  I  hope  in

future we will have more views from the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar on economic matters, especially  his

Party's policy on the economic front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee Wednesday, 14th January, 1959.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT AGENCY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.18 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Tun Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Governor has signified

his consent to this Bill being proceeded with and I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago reports appeared in the Press of

exploitation by employment agencies of job seekers.

Some of these bogus employment agencies have closed

down  as a result of Police investigations. It  has

been found that in the absence of legislation it is

extremely  difficult to investigate the  activities

of  these  bogus agencies and bring to  book  those

responsible for exploiting job seekers. Hence,  the

introduction  of  this Bill for the  regulation  of

employment agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Bill, Sir, every employment agency must

obtain  a licence; charge only prescribed fees  for

registering  a worker for employment;  keep  proper

registers,  and submit monthly returns. Appropriate

penalties  are provided for; in particular,  it  is

sought  to  prevent such agencies  being  used  for

trafficking in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



women  and  girls. As it is intended to  apply  the

provisions  of  the proposed Ordinance  to  certain

types  of  workers  only,  it  is  hoped  that  the

Government  Employment Exchange will be the  normal

and  only avenue for all other types of workers who

wish to register for employment. This will make the

employment exchange a more effective instrument for

placement  of such workers and, at the  same  time,

prevent the exploitation complained of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the placing of this Bill on the Statute Book

will  not  only  bring Singapore in line  with  the

recommendations in the relevant convention  of  the

International Labour Organisation, but it will also

mark  another  milestone  on  the  road  of  social

progress in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the implementation of this Bill is expected

to  cost  the  Government about $2,500  per  annum,

which will be the salary for additional staff. Sir,

I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.20 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

introduction of this Bill is most welcome, although

it  is  a  known  fact that job  seekers  or  those

unemployed  in  Singapore have  been  exploited  by

these bogus agencies. The Minister himself has just

admitted that during the last one or two years  the

Police  have been making investigations, and unless

some  kind of legislation is introduced,  it  would

not  be  possible to investigate into  these  bogus

agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, after much trouble in the past one and a

half  years,  got the Government to introduce  this

Bill.  My first attempt was in April last  year.  I

will  quote,  Sir,  from the Hansard,  my  Question

tabled  on  the 24th April, 1957, which appears  in

col. 1491 of Vol. 2, No. 21:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Lee Choon Eng asked the Minister for Labour

and  Welfare whether he is aware that some  private

employment  exchanges in Singapore  are  exploiting

employment seekers, and what does he propose to  do

about such concerns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Lim  Yew Hock: Sir, I am aware of one  recent

case  in  which  four aggrieved employment  seekers

made a report to the police which led to the arrest

and conviction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



of   a   man  who  had  been  operating  a  private

employment  agency. I have good reason  to  believe

that although some private employment agencies  are

long established, there are others which exist only

to  exploit  employment seekers. I am looking  into

the  possibility  of  introducing  new  legislation

under  which  private employment  agencies  can  be

effectively regulated. However, most of  the  bogus

agencies  which exploit the unemployed are mushroom

growths,  here today and gone tomorrow. The  remedy

in  such  cases is not new legislation but for  the

intended  victims  to  make early  reports  to  the

police  so that prompt action can be taken  against

them under the existing law."



<br><br>Sir,  my  second attempt was made in July  1957.  I

waited  for  a  few months because I  expected  the

Government  to  introduce such  legislation.  Until

July,   Sir,  there  was  not  a  step   taken   by

Government.  Therefore, on the 17th July,  I  again

tabled another question. It appears in Vol. 2,  No.

29, col. 2081 of the Hansard. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Lee Choon Eng asked the Minister for Labour

and Welfare-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether he has taken steps to investigate the

activities of private employment exchanges;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether he is aware of any complaints made to

the   Police   against   private   employment

exchanges; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) whether he has taken or will take steps

to protect the public from exploitation."



<br><br>A very short reply was given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, the activities of the

employment  exchanges  have  been  investigated  by

officers  of the Labour Department on an unofficial

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to (b) and (c) of the hon. Member's

question, I would refer him to the answer I gave to

a  similar question he asked on 24th April, 1957. I

have  nothing  to add to the reply I made  on  that

occasion."



<br><br>I  had  the  patience, Sir, to wait, and wait,  and

wait  until  June this year when I  was  forced  to

table  yet another question on 11th June this year.

It appears in Vol. 3, No. 5, col. 324:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Lee Choon Eng asked the Minister for Labour

and  Welfare  what  progress he  has  made  in  his

examination  of the possibility of introducing  new

legislation whereby private employment agencies can

be effectively regulated and controlled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr   Braga  (for  the  Minister  for  Labour  and Welfare,

Dr  Lim Yew Hock): An Employment  Agency

Bill is now in its final stage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



of preparation and it is intended that this will be

introduced at the next sitting of the Assembly."



<br><br>That was in June 1958. Sir, I was expecting that  a

Bill  of  this nature would be introduced in  July.

This  is  now December - five months after the  "next

sitting  of  the Assembly". However, it  is  better

late  than never, because this Bill, although late,

seeks   to   protect  the  job  seekers   and   the

unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to this day there are still unemployed

persons  who  are being exploited  by  these  bogus

agencies,  although the Minister said  that  during

the year quite a number of them had closed down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bogus agencies, Sir, have gone to the extent

not  only  of  exploiting  unemployed  persons  but

luring  innocent young girls into the  social  evil

profession. This is a known fact and in  support  I

will  quote,  Sir, from the Week-Ender,  which  has

taken    the   trouble   of   making   a   detailed

investigation -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is it

right  and proper for the Member for Queenstown  to

bring  into  this  Assembly,  and  quote  to   this

Assembly semi-pornographic material?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think I am in a position to

judge until I have heard the passage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know

the nature and quality of the Week-Ender, though  I

imagine  most of us will only admit to having  seen

its outer cover. It must border on the very risque!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the hon. Member is

really  asking me to anticipate what will be placed

before  the Assembly, but I take it that  the  hon.

Member  for Queenstown, as an honourable Member  of

this House, will be careful as to what he reads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will be

very careful. In this particular case it refers  to

the  investigations made by a reporter of the paper

and  does not refer to the pictures as expected  by

the Member for Tanjong Pagar!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the thorough investigation by the reporter

of  this  newspaper, it exposed certain facts,  and

this is what it said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"During this series of articles, compiled from the

files of our investigators this newspaper has tried

to  show  its  readers how thousands of  them  when

searching  for a job can be tricked by  the  ghouls

who prey on the workless."



<br><br>And these are a few of the facts exposed:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"WE REVEALED how poor handicapped ..." -



<br><br>X-I will not mention her name -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and hundreds more like her are considered 'fair

game'  by  the  mobsters running  phony  employment

agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WE EXPOSED the smarties, who told how their

'immediate vacancies' existed in the columns of the

daily papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WE PICTURED what happened when an astute

investigator asked for time to read 'a registration

form' only to be shown the door on the plea of:  'I

have no more time to spend on difficult people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WE WARNED readers to beware of the smooth-tongued

scamp with the pal, who, 'for ten bucks can fix you

up with a job in no time.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND WE HAVE ADVISED you to seek the aid of the

Government  Employment Exchange should you  need  a

job."



<br><br>A bouquet to the Government!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now WE UNCOVER the more sinister side of the

phony  employment  racket - THE USING  OF  OUR  YOUNG

WOMEN AS HUMAN BAIT TO CULL DOLLARS FROM THE POCKETS OF THE MORALLY WEAK.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PERHAPS IT IS HARD FOR DECENT FOLK TO ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE PREPARED TO SINK

SUCH SLIMY DEPTHS."



<br><br>This  was  reported in the Week-Ender and  that,  I

think,  is decent enough for the Member for Tanjong

Pagar!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> A great man!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> A great man! Sir, this Bill is

a  very good one, but after going through it I find

it  is  not adequate enough to deter some  hardcore

professional criminals. A matter of $500  fine  for

the  first  offence  is not heavy  because  it  can

easily  be  met  from an income of a  few  thousand

dollars  a  month. In Singapore, Sir, we have  many

types of crimes - robbery, etc. -  but exploitation  of

the  unemployed  and the luring bf  innocent  girls

into  this  social evil profession is more  serious

than crime. Robbers can only rob



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



those  who have. But to exploit the unemployed  who

do  not  even have funds is certainly  a  far  more

serious   offence  than  robbery.  Some  of   these

unemployed  might  have  borrowed  money   to   get

themselves  registered  [Laughter].  This   is   no

laughing  matter,  because I  was  once  unemployed

myself  and I know how difficult it was to get  not

only   a  dollar  but  even  ten  cents.  For   the

unemployed to get themselves registered, a fee  has

to  be paid, and they might have to borrow or  even

go to the extent of pawning their wives' jewellery.

[Laughter] This is no laughing matter at all. These

are  real facts. I have even known of cases of  the

unemployed who have had to sacrifice the milk meant

for their children or even the rice meant for their

family  just to get themselves registered. Sir,  is

this exploitation by employment agencies not a  far

more  serious crime than robbery? As I  have  said,

you   can   rob  only  those  who  have,  but   the

unemployed,  who  do  not  have  money,  are  being

robbed.  Only by strict control and heavy penalties

can  you  deter  such criminals  from  establishing

these  bogus employment agencies. When a person  is

unemployed, Sir, he is definitely downhearted,  and

it  is  really  disheartening to learn  that  after

trying   to  get  a  few  dollars  to  get  himself

registered,  he is being exploited and cheated.  In

case  he  has  borrowed the money,  what  will  his

family think if, by getting himself registered,  he

finds  that  the  money  is going  into  somebody's

pocket  without getting anywhere? Some may even  go

to  the  extent  of trying to commit suicide  after

having  gone  through so much trouble  to  get  the

money to get themselves registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill becomes law, Sir, I hope the

genuine  employment agencies will  co-operate  with

the  Government by coming forward and informing the

Government of the existence of any bogus employment

agency.  It is only through such co-operation  that

we can maintain the existence of genuine employment

agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this Bill, I see that it is only envisaged

to  control  employment agencies. There  should  be

some provision for exemption of charitable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



organisations or trade unions. This matter has  not

been  looked into. As far as I know, the  Singapore

Ex-Services  Association  helps  its   members   in

obtaining   jobs.  I  also  understand   that   the

Trafalgar  Home  for lepers and  S.A.T.A. make  an

attempt  to find employment for those patients  who

are cured. The After-Care Association, which is  an

Association  for ex-prisoners, also tries  to  find

employment for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I read in the papers that the President

of  the  After-Care Association, the  Acting  Chief

Justice,  Mr  Tan Ah Tah, made an  appeal  to  the

public   and  to  big  commercial  firms  to   find

employment  for these ex-prisoners. In  some  trade

unions  and voluntary organisations like  community

centres    and   the   Straits   Chinese    British

Association,  they have set up employment  sections

within the organisation itself. Certainly all these

organisations  cannot be considered  as  employment

agencies,  because they function within  their  own

organisation  and  do  not cater  for  the  general

public. These organisations also do not charge  any

fee for registration because it is only confined to

the  members  themselves, in clause 4 of  the  Bill

there is a provision which enables the Minister  to

make  exemptions, but the clause is not very  clear

to  me.  I  hope the Minister, in his  reply,  will

enlighten me on this point.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must realise

that  we  are now debating the Second Reading,  and

that  he  must confine himself to the principle  of

the  Bill. These details are details which he could

raise in Committee. The hon. Member knows that  the

Minister  proposes to go into Committee today,  and

if he had any amendments to suggest to the Bill, it

was  his  duty to give notice of those  amendments.

But  in  any  case,  it does not prevent  him  from

commenting on the details in Committee, of  course;

but  at  this stage, will he please confine himself

to the principle of the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I will try my best to confine

myself  to  the  principle of the Bill  or  to  the

clause itself. What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



I  was  trying to point out is that in this  clause

the interpretation of the words "employment agency"

is  far  too wide and it does not, in fact,  exempt

charitable  or voluntary organisations.  Since  you

have  ruled  that I have to confine myself  to  the

principle  of the Bill, Sir, I will not then  speak

on  clause 4. Sir, if there is no provision in this

Bill which will cover these voluntary or charitable

organisations,  then  all the sections  devoted  to

seeking  employment  for  the  members  within  the

charitable  or  voluntary organisations  will  come

within  the  meaning  of  employment  agencies.   I

certainly believe that the Minister does  not  want

to   classify  all  these  sections  as  employment

agencies.  As  I  have pointed out, these  sections

within  the organisations do not charge a  fee  for

registration,  and, apart from this, the  officials

of  these organisations work without any pay.  They

help  the  members to get employment. So I  do  not

think  it  is fair that these sections should  come

within the meaning of "employment agency".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this Bill becomes law, I hope that the

newspapers  will  give it the widest  publicity  so

that  the unemployed will know that Government  has

introduced  it  and  there is legislation  for  the

control of such agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this legislation comes into force, job

seekers   should  always  try  to   ascertain   the

reputation  of the firms with which they  register,

because  in most cases, although there is  control,

some  of these firms do ask for a deposit for  some

type  of employment; for instance, bill collectors,

cashiers  and  so  on.  If the  unemployed  do  not

ascertain  the  reputation of the firm,  they  will

find  that,  after paying the deposit or  the  cash

security  or whatever it is, that firm will  vanish

after a few months. Big and reputable firms,  I  am

sure,  do  not  require cash  deposits.  What  they

require  is  either a security bond or  a  fidelity

insurance, and if that be the case, well and  good.

Wherever  a cash deposit is demanded, I  appeal  to

all  the  unemployed to look into  the  nature  and

reputation  of  the  firm  before  paying  such   a

deposit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is a very important Bill. It is

being  introduced in the interest not only  of  the

job  seekers  themselves but also  of  the  genuine

employment agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in mind, Sir, to ask the Government to

allow  me to refer this Bill to a Select Committee,

because  it  will give a chance to those unemployed

who   have   been  victimised  to  come  and   make

representations. It will also give  an  opportunity

to the genuine employment agencies who have studied

the  Bill to make improvements. May I then formally

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Employment Agency Bill be referred to a

Select Committee with you, Mr Speaker, as Chairman

and  such other members as may be nominated by  the

Committee of Selection.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is not the Member too previous? We

have not even completed the Second Reading!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> He must have been reading the

Week-Ender!



<br><br>11.41 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  strongly  support  this Bill,  but  I  think  if

Government  has the interest of the  unemployed  at

heart, it is not necessary to introduce this  Bill.

We  have a Labour Office in the Ministry of  Labour

and Welfare at Havelock Road. Unemployed people  go

there to get themselves registered for jobs. It  is

the  responsibility  of the Government  to  provide

jobs for these unfortunate people. Such people  got

themselves registered, and after registration  they

made  daily calls at the Labour Ministry to see  if

they could get jobs. In spite of the fact that they

had  spent time and money in going there, they were

told  that  there were no jobs for them. They  came

back  feeling frustrated because the Government  is

not   in  a  position  to  solve  the  problem   of

unemployment and to provide jobs for them. So  they

eventually got fed up and lost faith in the  Labour

Office to find jobs for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what happens? A group of unscrupulous

private  employment agencies have cropped  up  like

mushrooms all over the City to exploit the jobless.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



These  unemployed  are  asked  to  pay  $5  to  get

themselves registered in order to get a  job.  Some

have  even to contribute their first month's salary

to  these  agencies.  In spite  of  the  ridiculous

demands  made  by  these employment  agencies,  the

unemployed  still go to them, with the result  that

they  are  squeezed  dry. These unfortunate  people

with   so   many   dependants  to   support   have

experienced the pangs of hunger. I wonder how  many

hon.  Members  sitting  opposite  have  experienced

these pangs of hunger. As the Member for Queenstown

has asked, what did these unemployed people do when

they  were  jobless? They turned anything  valuable

into  cash. They pawned their goods. Some even sold

their  children to support other members  of  their

families,  just  to  keep them alive.  A  few  very

desperate people, at their wits' end - what did  they

do? As my good friend, my colleague on this side of

the House has said, they committed suicide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is doing a proper job, it is

its  duty  to  find jobs for these  people  and  to

control  these private employment agencies so  that

they  could not exploit the jobless. The unemployed

have  no  faith in the Labour Office, Sir. I  also

have  no faith in the Labour Office, and it may  be

as well for the Government to close down the Labour

Office and not waste the public's money.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In reply, Sir. We are indeed

entering  more  and more interesting  times  as  we

approach the elections which will take place  early

next  year.  The Government, in moving  the  Second

Reading  of  a Bill to look after the interests  of

job seekers and to see that they are not exploited,

took  just  three  minutes on  the  Second  Reading

without  making  a political speech;  whereas  some

Members of the Opposition - the Member for Queenstown

and the Member for Tiong Bahru - stood up to tell the

people  of  Singapore  how sad  they  were  at  the

spectre  of  unemployment, how bad this  Government

was, and what the Government should and should  not

do.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the speech of the Member for Tiong

Bahru first. He said that Government should do  its

duty  to  find  jobs for all those  who  apply  for

employment. Surely no government in the  world  can

find jobs for all those who apply for employment if

jobs are not available. We are just trying to do  a

service  free  of charge - to try to help  place  the

unemployed in employment and we have to seek the co-operation  of employers. So long as the  employment

potentiality  is  not there, the Government  Labour

Exchange  cannot find a job for each  and  everyone

who  applies for employment. The Member  for  Tiong

Bahru also said that if the Government had done its

duty  properly, then there would have been no  need

for  this  law. Then in the same breath, he  asked,

"What  is  the  Government doing about  controlling

these  employment agencies to see that they do  not

exploit job seekers?" Sometimes, Sir, in the desire

to  make  a  political speech one does  say  things

rather  recklessly without considering what one  is

saying   and   in  the  next  breath  contradicting

oneself.  He said, "There is no need for employment

agencies  if the Government Employment Exchange  is

doing  its job properly", and then he said that  we

must control these employment agencies -



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> After the Government has failed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - if job seekers are not to be

exploited.  Then we have the Member for  Queenstown

who  took  about 174 minutes trying to explain  how

good  he  is to the poor and the unemployed.  Quite

rightly, he pointed out that he took this matter up

as  far back as last year but he must remember also

that since then I have been getting my Ministry  to

get  on  with the job and it takes time to draft  a

Bill  for  my  consideration. He even went  to  the

extent  of  quoting The Week-Ender. He also  stated

that   perhaps  the  newspapers  could  give   wide

publicity to this Bill. I therefore hope  that  The

Week-Ender will in its forthcoming issue  give  him

full coverage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though I

originally  intended  to move  that  this  Bill  be

referred  to a Select Committee, it appears  to  me

that  the  Minister and his Government  are  rather

unhappy about it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member either moves

or  he does not. Is the hon. Member moving? If  the

hon. Member is moving he should move simpliciter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the  fact  that I do not intend to move  that  this

Bill  be referred to a Select Committee, may I move

that it be discussed -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member either moves,

"That  the Bill be referred to a Select Committee,"

or  he  does  not  say anything. He  will  have  an

opportunity to say what he wants to when we go into

Committee.  Is  the hon. Member  moving  under  the

provisions of Standing Order 48 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a Bill has been read a second time it shall

stand   committed  to  a  Committee  of  the  whole

Assembly  unless the Assembly on motion commits  it

to  a  Select  Committee.  Such  motion  shall  not

require notice, must be made immediately after  the

Bill  is read a second time and may be proposed  by

any  Member;  the  question thereon  shall  be  put

forthwith and shall be decided without amendment or

debate."



<br><br>I trust that that is clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I then

seek  your  guidance?  I  would  like  to  ask  the

Government  to defer consideration of the  Bill  in

Committee  until  14th January,  1959,  instead  of

going through the Bill today in order to give me an

opportunity  to  table  amendments,  if  necessary,

because I have not prepared my amendments to any of

the clauses.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I continue then with the Standing

Order which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the Member in charge of a Bill asking for the

committee stage of the Bill, to be taken forthwith,

he  shall move "That this Assembly will immediately

resolve itself into a Committee on the Bill" and  a

debate may arise thereon.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill committed to a Committee of the whole

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Tun Lim Yew Hock, Committee stage,

what day?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,  "That this Assembly will immediately resolve

itself into a Committee on the Bill."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

very   much  for  your  guidance.  Although  I   do

appreciate that the Minister would like to push the

Bill   through  today  in  the  interest   of   the

unemployed,   I  feel  that  some  amendments   are

necessary  to  two  clauses in  the  Bill.  I  have

indicated earlier that I propose to move  that  the

Bill be referred to a Select Committee but since  I

have  an indication that the Minister is not  happy

about  it,  I  will  ask the  Government  to  defer

consideration of the Bill in Committee today  until

14th  January,  1959,  when  I  can  be  given  the

opportunity to move amendments if necessary. I have

not prepared any amendments today and even if I had

done  so  I would have had to give two clear  days'

notice,  and  this would disqualify me from  moving

any  amendment  now.  May  I  then  appeal  to  the

Government to defer consideration of this  Bill  in

Committee until 14th January, 1959?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Order of

the  Day  has been in the hands of the hon.  Member

for  some  time  and he knew, when  this  Bill  was

introduced  last  month, that  the  Second  Reading

would  take place today. If, I respectfully submit,

Sir,  the  hon.  Member  had  spent  more  time  in

studying  the Bill than The Week-Ender, perhaps  he

would  have  been  in a position  today  to  submit

amendments  which  he  thought  were  necessary  to

strengthen the Bill and to look after the interests

of the organisations which he has named.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure the hon. Member that all the

points  brought up by him can be easily met in  the

"exemption" clause - clause 4. I can assure the  hon.

Member  that  it  is  not  the  intention  of   the

Government to make things difficult, or to  require

that the organisations named by him should have  to

go  through  the  process of keeping  registers  to

observe the requirements of this law. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



that  is satisfactory to him, Sir, I will ask  that

he   let   us  go  into  Committee  on  this   Bill

straightaway  so  that, as from  1st  January  next

year,  all  employment agencies  will  have  to  be

registered in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 18

stand part of the Bill,"



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, I wonder whether the

Minister would consider, in view of the seriousness

of  the  offences under clauses 16 and  17,  he  is

prepared to increase the fine of $500 on conviction

in  respect of the first offence to $2,000 so  that

this will deter people from running bogus agencies?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Debate on that matter cannot take

place  unless  there is a motion to amend.  If  the

hon. Member wishes to comment on it, he can do  so.

On  the other hand, if the Minister considers  that

the amendment should be made, then he can act under

Standing  Order 23 which dispenses with  notice  of

amendments with the consent of the Speaker and  the

general assent of Members present. Perhaps the hon.

Member  would like to comment further on clause  18

before the Minister replies.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> As we all know, Sir, these bogus

agencies are exploiting the jobless and I feel that

a  fine  of $500 is inadequate. In order  to  deter

this  exploitation  of  the unemployed,  would  the

Government consider increasing the fine?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> A fine of $500 is intended for

a  first offence. After that, it will be a fine  of

$1,000  and  imprisonment for a term not  exceeding

six months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I also have

the  same point in mind but, as I have said,  I  do

not  like  to  obstruct the passing  of  this  Bill

today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



I am prepared to accept it as it stands today but I

would  appeal  to the Government, if there  is  any

necessity  of increasing such penalties, after  the

passing  of this Bill, not to hesitate to introduce

an   amendment  to  this  clause  so  that  heavier

penalties  could be imposed on subsequent offences,

even  to  the extent of imposing the same penalties

as  for  murder,  because, as I  have  said  in  my

speech,  the  exploitation of the unemployed  is  a

crime  which  is far more serious than robbery  and

murder.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, when this Bill is passed,

it  will  give my Ministry the necessary powers  to

investigate  thoroughly  into  allegations  of  the

existence of mushroom or bogus employment  agencies

which  have  not  been properly  licensed.  At  the

present time, it is because of the absence of  this

law  that  employment agencies could function  with

impunity, but once the law is on the statute  book,

they  will  not dare to do so. They  will  have  to

apply  for  a licence before they can operate,  and

once  licensed,  they  will  have  to  observe  the

conditions of the licence, otherwise they too  will

be   deprived   of  the  means  of  earning   their

livelihood  and  they might have  to  go  to  other

employment agencies to register for employment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do

appreciate  that  these bogus employment  agencies,

after  the  implementation of this Bill,  will  not

dare  to  function; but, as I have said, there  are

hard-core  criminals who are prepared to  take  the

risk.  After the passing of this Bill,  as  I  have

said,  if the Government do find that this Bill  is

not  adequate enough to exercise sufficient control

over these mushroom employment agencies which might

operate  in  the  dark,  then  I  appeal   to   the

Government   not  to  hesitate  to  introduce   any

amendment to impose heavier penalties.

<div align="center"><b>NOTARIES PUBLIC BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>12.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Governor  has  signified   his

consent that this Bill be proceeded with, and I beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill, as shown by its long title, seeks

to  provide for the appointment, powers and  duties

of  notaries public for which there is  as  yet  no

local  legislation.  A  notary  public  is  a  duly

appointed  officer whose office it is, among  other

matters,  to  clear, attest or  certify  deeds  and

other  documents, including conveyances and  powers

of   attorney;  to  note  or  certify  transactions

relating  to  negotiable  instruments;  to  prepare

wills and other testamentary documents, to draw  up

protests  and formal papers relating to occurrences

on  the  voyages of ships and their navigation,  as

well  as the carriage of cargo in ships. His office

is  one  of great antiquity and has been recognized

in all civilized countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing notaries public in Singapore, Sir,

are  English  notaries  public,  appointed  by  the

Master  of the Court of Faculties of the Archbishop

of Canterbury in London, and are also advocates and

solicitors  of  the  Supreme  Court.  Such  English

notaries  public will be allowed to carry on  their

powers  and  functions in Singapore  but  power  is

given in the Bill for the Attorney-General to  make

a  declaration that an English notary  public,  who

has been struck off the roll of notaries public  in

England,  or  has  been  struck  off  the  roll  of

Advocates  and  Solicitors of  the  Supreme  Court,

shall no longer be entitled to have and to exercise

the  powers  and  functions of notaries  public  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Malay States, notaries public have been

locally  appointed under local enactments, some  of

which  date  back  to 1898, and the  Malayan  Union

Notaries  Public  Ordinance  of  1947  consolidated

these  enactments and extended the power to appoint

notaries public to the whole of the Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Sir, follows closely the Notaries

Public  Ordinance,  1947,  of  the  Federation   of

Malaya.  It  provides for the  appointment  by  the

Attorney-General, after consultation with  the  Bar

Committee,  of local notaries public  who  must  be

practising advocates and solicitors of the  Supreme

Court  of  at least seven years' standing;  and  it

also  provides for the exercise of the  powers  and

functions  of  notaries  public  in  Singapore   by

English  notaries public and local notaries public.

Power  is  given to the Attorney-General to  revoke

the appointment of a local notary public where such

person  has  been struck off the roll of  Advocates

and Solicitors of the Supreme Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the draft of the Bill has been approved by

the Singapore Bar Committee. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. [The Chief Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to move the motion standing in my name,

namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that it is of the

opinion  that election writs be issued for  General

Elections to the Legislative Assembly under the new

Constitution on or before April 2, 1959,  and  that

an  address  be  presented to  His  Excellency  the

Governor  to  fix the date for the introduction  of

the  new  Constitution in accordance with paragraph

54  of  the  Report of the Singapore Constitutional

Conference  1957 contained in Sessional  Paper  No.

Misc. 2 of 1957.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 2nd April, 1955, 25 Members of this

Assembly  were returned amidst tumultuous applause.

One  has  since left us. The motion that I seek  to

move  today is to end the life of these 24  elected

representatives and the 25th who has joined us as a

result  of  a  by-election. As the last  record  is

being put on in this round of musical chairs, it is

likely  that  there will still be many  more  turns

before the curtain finally drops and the music runs

out.  But what I want to remind the House today  is

that  according  to  section 67  of  the  Singapore

Colony  Order in Council, 1955, the music is deemed

under the law to run out on 2nd April, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like briefly to take Members through

the legal and constitutional position so that there

would  be no doubts in our minds as to what we  are

debating.  We are going to be asked to approve  the

Budget  in the next two weeks. Once that Budget  is

approved,  the  Government  has  legally   equipped

itself  with finance for a period of one  year  for

the  whole of 1959. According to section 67 of  the

Rendel Constitution, subsection (1) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Governor, after consultation with the Chief

Minister, may at any time prorogue or dissolve  the

Assembly by Proclamation published in the Gazette."



<br><br>Subsection (2) of the same section reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Governor shall dissolve the Assembly at the

expiration  of  four years from  the  date  of  the

return  of  the  first writ at the  last  preceding

election,   if  it  shall  not  have  been   sooner

dissolved."



<br><br>What  it  means,  Sir,  is that  the  Governor  can

dissolve,  after consulting the Chief Minister,  at

any  time. But in any case, he shall dissolve after

four  years  from  the return of the  writ  in  the

preceding  election, and this writ was returned  on

2nd  April,  1955. Unless, therefore, something  is

done  to  alter that, this Assembly  fades  out  in

exactly 119 days' time - 27 days in December,  31  in

January,  28  in  February, 31 in March  and  2  in

April.   What  is  interesting  to  note  is   that

Ministers do not fade out on the 2nd of April. Sir,

according to section 22 of the Rendel Constitution,

subsection (3) (b) reads:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The office of an appointed Minister shall also

become  vacant if he ceases to be a Member  of  the

Assembly  for  any reason other than a  dissolution

thereof."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will all cease to be Members of the Assembly

on  the  2nd  April, 1959, but the offices  of  the

Ministers are not dissolved. They carry on, because

they  have been appointed by the Governor.  We  did

not appoint them. So they will be able to carry  on

without an Assembly. The only disadvantage  of  not

having an Assembly is that you cannot get votes for

money,  because that is the right of the  Assembly.

But  if the votes for money have already been given

in  this  Budget,  then  it  will  save  a  lot  of

embarrassment and unnecessary debate. The Ministers

could,  legally, carry on until three  months  from

the  2nd of April. That is contained in section  68

of the same Constitution which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There shall be a general election at such time

within  three months after the appointed  day,  and

thereafter   within   three  months   after   every

dissolution of the Assembly, as the Governor  shall

by Proclamation publish in the Gazette appoint."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming for one moment that there is no

complication in this new Constitution, the position

is  this. If we want, so to speak, to live out  our

lives  to  the bitter end, we go on to the  2nd  of

April,  1959. Then the Governor, unless he receives

orders  to the contrary and there has been a change

in  the  law,  will have to dissolve the  Assembly.

Under the present law a general election will  then

have  to be held within three months from the  date

of  the dissolution. Presumably the Ministers  will

carry  on  as  a  caretaker Government  without  an

Assembly  whilst  proceedings  are  taken  for  the

holding of an election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under the new Constitution - the Singapore

(Constitution)   Order  in  Council,   1958 - it   is

provided in section 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Order may be cited as the Singapore

(Constitution)  Order in Council, 1958,  and,  save

where otherwise provided, shall come into operation

on   such  day  as  the  Governor  may  appoint  by

Proclamation  in  the  Gazette  of  the  Colony  of

Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the Governor so appoints by

proclamation, section 3 of the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



Order   will  come  into  operation  revoking   the

Singapore Colony Orders in Council, 1955 and  1956.

So  under  the new Order in Council the moment  the

Governor   names   an   appointed   day   the   old

Constitution dies. The new one springs into  being,

presumably on polling day under the new Legislative

Assembly  Elections Ordinance - which we are supposed

to  pass  in the not too distant future before  2nd

April,  1959. Sir, this is not provided for in  the

Constitution itself. It has, however, been provided

for  in  the Report of the Singapore Constitutional

Conference held in London in March and April  1957,

published  and  tabled in this House  as  Sessional

Paper  No.  Misc.  2 of 1957. Section  54  of  that

Report, to which the then Governor was a signatory,

together  with five other Members of this Assembly,

provides for this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was agreed that the date should be fixed by

the   Governor   after  he  was  satisfied,   after

considering   an   address  from  the   Legislative

Assembly,   that  a  reasonable  period   for   the

registration, as provided in paragraph 50  of  this

Report,   of   persons   eligible   for   Singapore

citizenship had elapsed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the House will bear with me if I read

the  whole  of that paragraph because it  is  quite

some time since we last debated this Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was the view of the Singapore Delegation that

elections under the extended franchise which  would

result  from their citizenship proposals set  forth

in  paragraph 50 must precede the coming into force

of  the new Constitution. We therefore agreed  that

an  exact  date  for the introduction  of  the  new

Constitution could not be determined at this stage,

but  that it should be brought into force on a date

after the 1st January, 1958."



<br><br>and  then  follows the sentence which I  have  just

read. It means simply that what was agreed was that

in  any  case  the new Constitution which  we  then

expected was not to come into operation before  1st

January,  1958.  But, any time after  1st  January,

1958, we in this Assembly have the right to present

an  address to the Governor to ask him to  fix  the

date  for the introduction of the new Constitution.

The Governor has two things to consider: first, the

address; secondly, the fact that he must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



be  satisfied  that  a reasonable  period  for  the

registration  of  the  new Singapore  citizens  has

elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a reasonable period for the registration of

Singapore  citizens has elapsed. In fact, electoral

registers  have been compiled with their  names  in

them. They have been open for viewing by objectors.

All objections that can be made have been made, and

I  imagine the registers should be ready for use at

any  time. Therefore, there are no obstacles to our

presenting this address. What I am seeking to  move

in  my motion, Mr Speaker, Sir, is to express  the

opinion  of this Assembly "that election  writs  be

Legislative  Assembly  under  the  new  issued  for

General Elections to the Constitution on or  before

April 2, 1959, and that an address be presented  to

His Excellency the Governor to fix the date for the

introduction of the new Constitution in  accordance

with paragraph 54 of the Report...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the House agrees to this motion without

amendment, as I hope it will, it means that  on  or

before  the  2nd  of April - if everybody  wants  the

extra  few  odd days of the 119 days  left,  so  be

it - the  Assembly will be dissolved by the Governor.

Then  under the new Legislative Assembly  Elections

Ordinance which we will have to pass, the  Governor

will  issue writs for general elections.  The  writ

will also name the date for the return of the writ,

which  will  be  polling day. This will  presumably

also  be  the  appointed  day  on  which  the   new

Constitution springs to life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the factors which has prompted my

Party  to  table  this motion  is  the  concern  in

certain  quarters at the talk of certain  wild  men

connected  with a certain new Party.  Sir,  it  has

been  openly  said by men, who ought to  have  been

responsible enough to know better, that there  will

be  no difficulty in winning the next elections, if

the P.A.P. or any other Party is not in its way. If

I  may  quote  the Minister for Communications  and

Works - I am not quoting him for what was supposed to

have  taken place - in his description of two  former

Presidents of the Labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



Front, who both became Chief Ministers and who both

now   lead  new  Parties -  I  think,  of  all   the

astonishing things the Labour Front has ever  done,

this  deserves a gold medal! In the short space  of

four  years, to quote the present Secretary-General

of  the  Labour  Front: two Presidents,  two  Chief

Ministers,  both leading two new Parties!  Sir,  we

are not concerned with the last turn of the acrobat

as  the elephants dash by. But we are concerned  to

know  that beyond any doubt one Chief Minister said

to  another Chief Minister - we are not sure who said

to  whom - "Why  not  let us scrap the  P.A.P.?  Then

there  is  nothing  to stop the Singapore  People's

Alliance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I bring this up for one specific purpose;

just to tell the world at large, first, that we are

not  so easily intimidated; and secondly, to remind

those  who  might be foolish enough to  believe  in

such  idle talk that the power to proscribe is  not

in  the  hands  of  elected  Ministers  alone.  The

ultimate   responsibility  is  with   the   British

Government  who  will have to answer  for  it.  The

portfolio   is  that  of  a  nominated   Government

official  and ex-officio Minister, and  that  there

are certain repercussions which the head of the ex-officio, the Minister in Westminster will  have  to

consider  if  he  were ever advised  to  weigh  the

advisability of such a course of action. Let me put

it  bluntly this way. May I preface my remarks, Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   by  saying  this?   The   British

democratic system is deemed to be superior to a non-democratic one because in a democratic state things

are done publicly and above board. The public knows

what its rulers are doing, and will support them in

what  they are doing because they know the  reasons

for doing it are right and proper. I wish openly to

crush  this  mad talk because I think an atmosphere

of  plotting  and  conspiracy is  inimical  to  the

continuance of the democratic spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put it bluntly like this. If it is the

British  who  want  to ensure  that  the  so-called

extremists do not win the elections - let us  put  it

bluntly that they do not want the P.A.P. to win the

elections - there is nothing to prevent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



them  from  scratching us out from the race.  There

will  be  certain  long-term and certain  immediate

repercussions.  The immediate ones  can  be  looked

after  by the Armed Forces; but the long-term  ones

cannot.  There  is one weakness  in  that  line  of

thinking   because,  whilst  you  can   prevent   a

particular group or Party from winning, you  cannot

make  another  Party  win. Putting  it  in  simpler

words:  assuming one scratches out the  P.A.P.,  then

one  has got to do something about the leaders.  If

the  leaders are at large, then, in the public eye,

there  is  no difficulty for them to muster,  rally

and  fight back. It would then become necessary  to

put  away the leaders. If some leaders are put away

and  others are not, then the others who  have  not

been  put  away will fight for those who have  been

put  away. If all are put away, there is still  the

problem of making the people vote for those who put

those  leaders away. Ultimately the result is  zero

for those who hope to win by adopting such tactics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say this for the Chief Minister - that I do

not  believe  for one moment that he is politically

an  imbecile. I think he is one of the most cunning

politicians  who ever graced this Assembly.  For  a

man  to  bridge  three eras - 1948, as  a  nominated

Governor's  man, into the Rendel era as an  elected

Minister of the first semi-elected Government - is an

achievement   not  lightly  to  be   dismissed.   I

therefore  credit  him with more intelligence  than

the people who spread this kind of wild talk credit

him  with. But there are other Ministers not  known

for  great political dexterity and skill  who  have

also joined in such wild discussions, and it is for

their  benefit that I have raised this  matter  and

brought it into the open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, once everybody understands what is on the

time-table,  two things can happen. The  wild  talk

ceases   as   reality  is  brought  home,   or   in

precipitate haste then proceed with their nefarious

schemes.  I am quite confident that these wild  men

will  be  swept  into the limbo  where  all  wicked

politicians,  I  hope, will ultimately  be  put  to

rest -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> With you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - and a saner and cleaner

atmosphere  will  prevail.  Once  this  motion   is

passed, it will be your task, Mr Speaker, Sir,  to

convey this address to the Governor. And, according

to  paragraph  54  of the Report of  the  Singapore

Constitutional Conference held in London  in  March

and April, 1957, it will be his duty to set at rest

all  the doubts and speculations as to the date  on

which  the  new Constitution will come into  force,

and a new Government will take over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, three years ago, when this Assembly first

met,  there was an atmosphere of promise. Today  it

is  a stale and a dreary Assembly. There is nothing

that  can  happen between now and 2nd April,  1959,

which  is  likely to alter the views of  those  who

have  had  to  sit  through  dreary  and  sometimes

disheartening hours watching men who can never grow

up  politically. There are some speakers who  mount

the platform and who do not know when it is time to

stop. Therefore, it is useful, when one starts  off

a meeting with such people, to have a sign by which

we  give  them an extra two minutes and  cry  halt!

This  is  what we are doing today. Members of  this

Assembly  can  take it that my arithmetic  has  not

been  weak. In exactly 119 days from today,  if  we

pass this motion the bells will be rung. We hope to

get  a  reply  from the Governor in the  very  near

future.  Then we will have the last act in which  I

believe  there will still be many more  twists  and

turns, but none of which will turn this tragicomedy

into  either tragedy or altogether comedy.  Let  us

hope  this play has a quiet and peaceful close.  If

there is one thing that we hope could happen anyway

in  this  Assembly, it is that they go out  quietly

and  peacefully - and then the hustings. We hope that

all  wise,  brave, honest, and truly good  citizens

will  receive tumultuous acclamation and  applause,

and  come back with new life and new vigour to open

a new chapter in the history of this little island.

<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that Government should do

something  immediately to clear up  the  prevailing

uncertainty about the date of the general elections

to  bring  in  the new Constitution for  Singapore.

Mere   statements   by  the  Chief   Minister   and

Government  spokesmen to the Press indicating  that

the   writs  and  other  things  for  the   general

elections  will be issued before the  date  of  the

expiry  of the Rendel Constitution are not  enough.

We want more positive action than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My leader has just now moved a motion which is to

bring in the new Constitution, and this is to  give

the  Hon, the Chief Minister an opportunity to  say

openly  and publicly the Government's intention  in

this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public of Singapore, Sir, have been amused

and confused by the gymnastics that have been going

on  in  political  circles recently,  and  the  new

Alliance which has been formed and known to the man-in-the-street  as  the Rojak  Party  has  succeeded

beyond  all expectations in making confusion  worse

confounded!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the midst of this shabby political

manoeuvring,  the  Government still  maintains  the

strictest silence about its intentions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

used     the     expression    "shady     political

manoeuvring" - or    "shabby",    it     makes     no

difference - but if that expression has any reference

directly  or  indirectly  to  any  Member  of  this

Assembly, then he must withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I did mention

"shabby" just now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is not the

point.  The point is does that expression have  any

reference  to any hon. Member in this Assembly?  If

the  hon.  Member thinks it has, then he  ought  to

withdraw the expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, I will withdraw it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is believed, Sir, that all that the

Government wants to do is to remain in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



power longer than the time allowed. If this is  not

what  the  Government  is  trying  to  do,  Sir,  I

challenge Members of the Government to state  here,

openly   and  publicly,  that  the  Government   is

committed  to  initiating action  to  hold  general

elections   to   bring  the  new  Constitution   of

Singapore  into being, and even before  the  expiry

date  of  the present Constitution on  the  2nd  of

April next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am instructed by the Hon, the Chief

Minister  to  say that the Government  accepts  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support  the  motion moved by the hon.  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar. I am very happy to learn  that  the

Government has accepted this motion. This  has  cut

down much of what I originally intended to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I must say, and that is that the U.K.

Government  is  the  only  colonial  power  of  any

consequence  left  in South-East  Asia.  They  have

offered  this  constitution and if anybody  hinders

the  progress  of  Singapore, he is  a  traitor  to

Singapore.  In any country, once a constitution  is

granted,  it is accepted immediately. There  should

not  have been such a long wait. Sir, the  past  is

past. Let us face the electorate who will judge  us

by what we have done in this House for the past few

years.  I  am  very  glad that the  Government  has

accepted this motion.



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker. I thank you very

much  for  calling me. I was hesitating  trying  to

pick  out  the  most  fitting  and  most  beautiful

phrases  to echo the lovely speech which  has  just

been  delivered  by the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar.

Sir, I must thank the hon. Member for giving me the

opportunity to speak on his motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, Sir, my health has been

troubling  me;  so I consulted a doctor  and  after

making  an examination, he said, "Mr Lim, you  had

better  be careful. Your heart is rather weak."  He

asked  what caused my condition to be like this.  I

could  not  think  of  any  reason  then.  Later  I

consulted  my  wife and she said, "Maybe  you  have

been hearing too many speeches from the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar!"  Sir, I am sure that,  vice-versa,

the Member for Tanjong Pagar must have been getting

headaches  and feeling disgusted lately because  of

my  speeches! As a result of this motion, it may be

that  next April the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar

will  remain here; or maybe I will remain here;  or

maybe  both  of  us  will be  very  happy  to  have

departed  from  this place! Maybe I should  address

the hon. Member as the most honourable man, a great

man,  the  decent  gentleman from Oxley  Road,  the

champion  of  the  underdog,  the  saviour  of  the

prisoners of Changi Jail; and, of course, the  most

honourable the regular Island Club golf player.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what the

honourable nicknames being given to the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar has anything to do with the  motion.

Perhaps  the  hon. Member should  go  on  with  his

speech on the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, what I have been

addressing  the  Member for Tanjong  Pagar  is  not

irrelevant to my speech which follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Sir, I happened to pass in front of

Government  House.  I  do  not  know  whether  hon.

Members  observed that the Military and the  Police

were holding a joint security exercise, with troops

heavily  armed  and  the erection  of  barbed  wire

barricades. I must thank the Commander-in-Chief  of

the Army and the Commissioner of Police for holding

this  exercise.  If  it was not  done  on  purpose,

surely  it was a coincidence to hold it on  such  a

beautiful  day - on the same day as the  hon.  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar is moving his motion. This joint

manoeuvre by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



Military  and  the Police will, I  hope,  serve  to

remind  the hon. Member and other Members  of  this

House of the status, of Singapore today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was just now interrupted by you. I

forgot to add that the Member for Tanjong Pagar  is

the    most    honourable   anakan    tanah    ayer

Singapura - that means the most honourable son of the

soil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next year we will have to address the

occupant of Government House as either His  Majesty

or  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, but still  we  are

going  to be protected by British tommies  and  the

Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very happy with this motion because it

will  fix  a  date  which will decide  whether  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar or I will be sitting  in

this  House next year. The Member for Tanjong Pagar

used  the  opportunity  in  moving  his  motion  to

deliver his Queen's trained English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many months have passed since the hon.

Member  made  three trips to England  to  negotiate

this  new  Constitution. He said that actually  the

agreement arrived at was set for January 1958. I am

sorry that he did not enlighten us sufficiently  as

to  why he waited until today, 4th December,  1958,

to move his motion urging the Government to set the

date. It has taken him eleven months to do so.  But

let me tell you why. I have been asked thousands of

times  by  people, "Mr Lim, when can the  election

date  be  fixed?"  I  told  them  that  I  was  not

qualified to answer that question. The only two men

in Singapore who were qualified to do that were the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar and the Hon, the  Chief

Minister. They were the "abang adek" who could  fix

everything for us. "If abang says, 'Set it  later';

yes, that date will be set." But I hope that is not

true. Sir. What I wish to say is that the matter is

in the hands of the P.A.P., in the hands of a petty

dictator,  as  I have once addressed it.  "We  only

want the elections when our house is in order."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the secret I am going to tell. The

people most anxious for the P.A.P to be returned to

power must be the British. I will explain why, Sir.

There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



is  a Chinese story - a travelogue - called Si Yu  Chi

[A  travel  to the West]. There was a monk  called

Sien Chuang Pang Teng, and there was a monkey  God

who  was  very  clever and popular.  He  could  do

everything. But unfortunately this monkey God  had

a magic ring at the top of his head. When the monk

thought that the monkey God was playing too  much,

he  simply chanted, "O li toh, o li toh!" and then

the  monkey God had to kowtow and obey the  monk's

orders!  The  monk was very weak but very  clever.

The  monkey God was very clever and very powerful.

And  who is the monkey God in this instance,  Sir? - I  hope you will not rule me out - it is the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar! Who is the monk, Sir? The monk

is  the  British Colonial Office in  London  whose

head  is  the Rt. Hon. Sir Alan Lennox  Boyd.  And

what  is the magic ring on top of the monkey God's

head?   It   is   this  so-called  party-supported

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why worry if the P.A.P. are returned to

power next year; or even Mr Chin Peng becomes the

Prime Minister of Singapore next year? So long  as

this  Constitution exists, the British do not care

at  all.  They can suspend the Constitution.  They

can   even   ask  the  Federation  Government   to

interfere. So this is the secret - those who are  so

eager and even anxious to let the P.A.P. come into

power are not only the P.A.P. themselves, but also

the British!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second secret is this, Sir, that within this

year -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we have heard of one

secret  which, to me, does not appear to have  any

relevance to the motion. I hope the second  secret

will have some relevance to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir, that you

think  it  is  not  relevant,  but  at  least  the

Government does not think so. I am sure it is very

relevant because I want to challenge the sincerity

and  the motive and judge the reactions after this

motion  has been carried. What benefit there  will

be  for this country once responsibilities lie  in

the  hands  of  the P.A.P. Sir, the P.A.P.,  after

having



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



successfully   put   right  their   own   domestic

affairs - some have been sent to Changi Prison; some

have  been  struck  off the citizenship  register;

some  are,  I think, on the black list  and  after

having  strengthened their Party executive,  think

that  this  is  now the right time  to  move  this

motion,  and  that  this is for their  benefit.  I

believe  it is my duty to let the House  know  all

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another secret which is also very

relevant.  They  hope to succeed  in  fooling  the

Malay  masses  that only the P.A.P. are  the  anak

tanah  ayer  Melayu [sons of Malaya]. The  Malays

must  support the P.A.P., because the  P.A.P. are

genuine Malayans, and no other people. The  P.A.P.

support the Malay language as the lingua franca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I quote from the Straits Times of

Monday, 1st December?



<br><br><div align="center">"MAKE CHINESE AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE</div>



<br><br>M.C.A. Leader: Call from Loyal People Whose Hopes Are Tied Up In That Question



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lim Chong Eu,

President of the Malayan Chinese Association,

said here last night."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. are trying, by some clever means, to

convince  the masses in Singapore to  prepare  for

the   taking   over   by   the   P.A.P. of   the

administration next year. If there is any  trouble

or  failure  faced by the present Government,  the

P.A.P. say that it is because we cannot achieve  a

merger  with the Federation. Because  you  do  not

support  Malay  as  the lingua  franca,  there  is

therefore  a failure. Sir, this motion only  suits

the  interests of the P.A.P. and not those of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was very careful to notice that the hon.

Member  for Tanjong Pagar in his speech  just  now

was  simply  interested as to  when  the  election

writs  will  be  issued, his call  for  a  general

election. What we would like him to do is to  give

us  a  clear-cut picture of the future  elections.

Why  does he want elections? Is it merely  because

this  new  Constitution  is  going  to  bring   us

stability and solve our unemployment problems?  Or

is it to achieve a merger with the Federation? The

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore would like to hear from  him.  But  I

could not find anything connected with these issues

from  the  speech he made just now. I  agree,  Sir,

that  it was a beautiful speech; but there  was  no

substance  in  it. Although the motion  is  closely

linked with the relationship with the Federation of

Malaya, not a single word about this was mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a news report in the Straits Tunes

of Monday, 1st December, which I will quote:



<br><br><div align="center">"MERGER CLAUSE </div>

<div align="center">'MAY BREAK ALLIANCE'</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuala Lumpur, Sunday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Commerce and Industry, Mr Tan Siew Sin, tonight warned that one of the objects of

the  new  M.C.A. constitution for  a  merger  with

Singapore might break up the Alliance."



<br><br>On  what grounds did Mr Tan make his statement? He

said  that  Tunku Abdul Rahman has repeatedly  said

that he does not want an immediate merger with  the

Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have purposely quoted these two instances

which  I think are sufficient to support my charges

that  the mover of this motion moved it for selfish

party   interests.   Sir,  serious   problems   lie

ahead - our  economic  stability  and  our  political

stability.  As  the hon. Member for Ulu  Bedok  has

said,  we must not play communal politics. Yet  the

P.A.P. are the champions at it. He says  that  the

Malays fear the Chinese. Why dues he not defend the

Chinese who fear the Malays? And the language -

carefully  and  try to relate his  remarks  to  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>3.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I think it is about time

for  me to end my speech. As to the statement  made

by the mover



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



of  the  motion that there was some  wild  talk  to

proscribe the P.A.P., I would think that if such an

action were taken, it would be wrong. The power  to

proscribe the P.A.P. does not lie in the  hands  of

any individual, or even in any political Party.  It

lies  in the hands of the people of Singapore.  Let

the  people of Singapore decide when it is time  to

take action to proscribe the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as indicated

by  my  colleague,  the Minister  for  Health,  the

Government accepts the motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have on many occasions said publicly to the

Press  that  the  Government  does  not  intend  to

continue in office beyond 2nd April, 1959. It would

appear that statements of this kind given by me  to

the Press are not accepted by the hon, seconder  of

the  motion as public statements. He has  therefore

challenged me to state here openly whether  or  not

the  Government intends to advise the  Governor  to

hold  elections  on or before 2nd  April,  1959.  1

would like to correct any wrong impression that the

members of the public may have because of the  wild

talk  by  members of other political  Parties  that

there is in my mind an idea to proscribe the P.A.P.

and thereby make the whole thing clear and easy for

my  Party,  my  coalition partners and  other  more

democratic  political Parties in Singapore.  It  is

ridiculous even for me to have to stand up here and

refute such wild rumours coming from the enemies of

democracy.  If  it  had been the  intention  of  my

Government to proscribe the P.A.P., the time  would

have  been in 1956 and 1957, but not now. In  fact,

the  strong  action  my Government  had  taken  had

helped  the P.A.P. to survive today. Therefore  any

talk of the Government's intention to proscribe the

P.A.P. is definitely groundless. We have done  all

we  could for democracy. We have even tried to help

the P.A.P. to become more democratic and have given

it the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



opportunity to behave democratically, to the  exent

of  putting in prison those subversive elements who

has  been the despair of the present leaders of the

P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what he meant when the hon. Member

for  Tanjong Pagar said, "If you put some of us  in

prison,  others  who are outside will  be  able  to

muster, rally and protest and will certainly  fight

for  those who are inside the prison." Did he  mean

to  include those ex-members of the P.A.P., who are

now  in prison, detained as subversives? I am  sure

the  general public would be very anxious  to  know

the  stand of the P.A.P. today as to whether or not

they  are still of the firm opinion that those  ex-comrades  of theirs in Changi Jail are still  their

comrades-in-arms.  A  statement  from   them   will

definitely  clear the air so that  the  democratic,

peace-loving voters of Singapore, will know how and

why,  if  they feel that they should vote  for  the

P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allegations have been levelled at my

Government  that we desire to continue  in  office.

Members of the Opposition seem to think that it  is

a lovely thing to be Chief Minister. I have on many

occasions  in  this Assembly said that  it  is  the

greatest  cross that I have had to bear  when  this

Chief Minister-ship was thrown at me. It is because

of my sense of duty to the people of Singapore that

I  am  continuing  to carry this cross,  and  I  am

indeed  glad that I will not be called upon,  under

the  Rendel  Constitution, to carry it  beyond  2nd

April, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insinuations have been made too in the speech of

the  hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar  that  the  new

Alliance  that we have formed is not strong  enough

to  beat  them. It is not for me to reply to  these

insinuations, Sir,It is for the electorate  to  do

that. The verdict is theirs, and not his.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the hon. Member knows that the

electoral machinery will require about six weeks at

the  quickest  for elections to be held  after  the

Assembly   is   dissolved.  Under  the  Legislative

Assembly Elections Ordinance, writs will have to be

issued as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



soon  as the Assembly is dissolved. It may  take  a

day or two, and then under certain sections of this

Ordinance  the  Governor  will  have  to  name  the

polling  day. He will be guided in this,  depending

on  the number of candidates that have been put  up

for the contest and the length of time required for

the  election  campaign  to  be  held.  The  period

granted  for this under the Ordinance is  not  less

than three weeks and not more than eight weeks.  In

regard to this, Sir, I give an assurance to Members

of  the Opposition that they will be consulted  not

long  after this sitting as to whether three,  four

or  five  weeks is enough; and after this, I  shall

advise  the  Governor that it  is  felt  that  four

weeks - or   whatever  the  period  may  be - for   the

election campaign is sufficient. He will then be in

a  position to inform this Assembly of the probable

date of the general elections which will bring into

force the new Constitution.



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though this

is  a  very important motion, I am really surprised

that the tone of the debate this afternoon has been

very mild, except for that of the Member for Changi

who gave us some very amusing stories and disclosed

some  secrets. We could understand him in spite  of

his  Teochew  accent, which the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar criticised. He did create a lively atmosphere

in  this House. The Member for Tanjong Pagar has no

trouble  about his English because he has  had  all

the chances of studying the Queen's English and  he

can  certainly easily express himself in such a way

that  it can be understood that he is speaking  the

Queen's  English  and a colonial  language.  It  is

surprising  that he should criticise  a  Member  of

this House for his English, when he knows very well

that most of the Members here did not have the same

privilege  and chances that he had of studying  the

Queen's   English.  Furthermore,   his   livelihood

depends on his ability in this respect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most important, Sir, is the context of the

motion itself. I remember when the Preservation  of

Public  Security  Ordinance  was  debated  in  this

Assembly,  the leader of the P.A.P. - the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar - said  that he would  introduce  this

Ordinance  when his Party came into  power;  but  I

believe  three and a half years ago when  the  same

Ordinance was debated, he was very much against it.

Why  is  it  so, Sir? May I ask him: is  he  really

sincere   when  he  says  that  he  will  certainly

introduce  the  Preservation  of  Public   Security

Ordinance if his Party comes into power?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the hon. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  tries to answer that  question,  he

will  be  ruled  out  of order.  It  is  completely

irrelevant  to  the  motion. Please  stick  to  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am sorry about this, Sir. I

said that because it struck me that this motion was

introduced today for some purpose. If not  for  all

the  somersaults of the P.A.P., I doubt  very  much

whether  this  motion will come  before  the  House

today.  As  the Member for Changi has  asked,  "Why

wait until this very hour to table this motion?" If

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar had been sincere,  he

could have done so much earlier. He was a member of

the  All-Party Delegation that went to  the  United

Kingdom for the constitutional talks. He knew  very

well  what  the new Constitution would be,  and  as

soon  as  he  came  back he could and  should  have

tabled this motion in the Assembly. Why wait  until

this day to do so?



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee Kuan Yew, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir,

there is only one point worth answering, and it  is

the question which the Chief Minister has posed  me

about  my ex-comrades in Changi. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

there  is one thing about the P.A.P. which  perhaps

those  who  form,  un-form  and  re-form  political

Parties do not understand. When we form a Party,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



there  are certain abiding principles that bind  us

together.  They  were my comrades in  1954  when  I

formed  that  Party. They are my  comrades  now  in

1958.  They will be my comrades next year.  If  and

when  anyone  departs from the Party programme  and

Party policy, then he ceases to be my comrade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that the Chief Minister has chosen

to  remain  silent  on  the story  that  two  Chief

Ministers  had met and one had said  to  the  other

certain  things  which should not have  been  said.

However, I am obliged to him for having been honest

enough  not to have denied something which he  must

know to have been true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope when you convey the address of this

Assembly to the Governor you will indicate  to  him

that  we  would be grateful if he could give  us  a

reply  in the not too distant future. This is  like

the trigger of the atomic bomb. Once this motion is

passed,  assuming that no new laws  are  passed  to

intercept the proceedings which will be set  afoot,

this  Assembly  will  logically and  systematically

come to its close on 2nd April, 1959. I am grateful

to  the Chief Minister for having indicated that he

is prepared to consult the Opposition on the length

of the election campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr, Speaker, Sir, I beg to move my motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that it is of the

opinion  that election writs be issued for  General

Elections to the Legislative Assembly under the new

Constitution on or before April 2, 1959,  and  that

an  address  be  presented to  His  Excellency  the

Governor  to  fix the date for the introduction  of

the  new  Constitution in accordance with paragraph

54  of  the  Report of the Singapore Constitutional

Conference  1957 contained in Sessional  Paper  No.

Misc. 2 of 1957.

<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Assistant Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> Sir, I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>THE EDUCATION MINISTRY AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>THEIR REPUTATIONS IN THE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>LIGHT OF RECENT DISCLOSURES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to

have  to  torment the Minister for Education - he  is

such a likeable fellow in many ways. But I was very

much  shocked by his declaration yesterday that  he

was going to be his own judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us have been outraged by his

statements that the school certificates and all the

passing-out  certificates would not  be  worth  the

scraps of paper that they are written on. We  often

wondered  why  he said it. We thought that  perhaps

the  Minister for Education did not understand  the

purpose  of education. But when the leak about  the

examination   papers  came  out,   the   conclusion

naturally was drawn that, of course, it was because

you  could buy these scraps of paper! That  is  why

the  Minister said that it was not worth the  paper

it is written on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been three minor scandals: one,

the   English   examination;   two,   the   Chinese

examination;  and  three, a story  of  embezzlement

involving a sum of money in the region of a million

dollars.  I  was  told by the Minister  during  the

luncheon  adjournment that he  strenuously  refuted

this story which was carried in an English language

newspaper,  and I would be glad if he  would  touch

upon it in his reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the machinery of State falls to bits in this

way, little flywheels fly off from the axle and  go

into  nothingness; papers can be sold  and  bought;

money  is  missing; and the Minister  says,  "I  am

looking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



into  the matter - I have a clear conscience  and  my

Permanent   Secretary  has   a   clear   conscience

too," - then I say that those of us here who have  to

listen to this twaddle would like to know from  him

why  he  thinks he has got such a clear conscience.

If  I  were  the Minister for Education  and  these

things  happened in my Ministry, I would be a  very

troubled man indeed. It is no use just telling  the

public  that  you have got a clear conscience.  You

have  got to tell them why your conscience is clear

and,  furthermore,  why the public  should  believe

that  the  Minister should be allowed to  carry  on

looking  after what he obviously had not been  able

to look after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I promised the Hon, the Chief Minister

yesterday  that  I  would not  unduly  prolong  the

debate today. I would therefore like to shorten the

proceedings  simply  by  asking  the  Minister  for

Education  to  tell us frankly why  he  thinks  his

conscience is clear; how much money is missing; and

when he intends to tell us the real story behind it

all.



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I had intended to keep

quiet,  but  after  listening  to  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar I would like to say a few words.  It

is  a  pity that a criminal lawyer like the  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar should have picked  out  a  few

words  from the statement delivered only  yesterday

morning by the Minister for Education, namely,  "My

conscience  is  clear and my Permanent  Secretary's

conscience is also clear", and made it the  subject

of  a  debate on the Motion for Adjournment  today.

The  Member for Tanjong Pagar should have  made  up

his  mind about bringing up this matter at least  a

few days ago. Sir, I think it is most improper. But

it  cannot  be helped, since it is the custom  with

the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar. Only statements  or

speeches  delivered by him or  his  Party  are  not

"wild"  talks!  In  the case of  others,  they  are

merely  for  the purpose of vote-catching.  Sir,  I

wish  to  state that this debate on the Motion  for

Adjournment is 100 per cent vote-catching.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I stated categorically yesterday

the   reasons   for  the  leakage  in   the   first

examination,  namely the English  Secondary  School

Entrance   Examination,  and  where   the   leakage

occurred.   As   regards   the   second    leakage,

investigations are still proceeding and, as I  have

said,  for obvious reasons, I do not want to  state

more  than that. I will give a fuller story perhaps

at the next sitting of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has been posed to me as to why I said

that   my  conscience  and  that  of  my  Permanent

Secretary is clear. Doubts have been raised  as  to

why  I  should investigate matters myself. I  would

like   to  tell  hon.  Members  that  my  Permanent

Secretary and I are taking every step to look  into

the matter. The Police have been brought into this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as regards embezzlement, there was no such

case. I refuted that in a public statement on  21st

November in the Straits Times, the heading of which

reads  "MINISTRY DENIES INQUIRIES ON EMBEZZLEMENT".

I  have  also been asked: How much money  has  been

lost? What is the real story? There might have been

irregularities.  Sir, but "irregularity"  does  not

mean fraud or misappropriation of funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Money is missing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> There is no money missing. The

Director  of Audit has been asked to go into  these

reported  irregularities and he is  checking  every

case.  The Grant-in-aid Regulations came into force

in  1957.  Many  Chinese schools  could  not  apply

earlier than 1957 for provisions to be made in  the 1958 Estimates. Under Regulation 88 of the Grant-in-Aid  Regulations,  90  per cent  of  these  Chinese

schools would not have been eligible for payment of

capital  grant. This would have created a situation

contrary  to  the recommendation of  the  All-Party

Committee.  One  of those recommendations  is  that

where  schools  are below standard, every  facility

must be afforded to them by Government in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



order  to  assist them to come up to  the  standard

required.  In  view of that recommendation  and  in

view  of Government's policy formulated as a result

of that recommendation, there has been a relaxation

of  Regulation  88,  thus making  it  possible  for

Government to pay, in 1958, bills dated as far back

as  1955 and 1956. Now we must realise that in  the

past Chinese schools have been neglected for a long

time,  and  so  they  are in  a  special  category,

especially  during  the  first  few  years  of  the

operation  of this school grant-in-aid  scheme.  At

some  of  these Chinese schools, work of a  capital

nature was carried out prior to 1957 and the  bills

were  sent  to Government for payment in  1957  and

1958.   The  Public  Works  Department  could   not

therefore  check  and certify that  such  work  had

actually been carried out; but as I said, allowance

must  be  made  for  such cases and  I  accordingly

authorised  payments to be made  to  these  Chinese

schools.  The  payments were very small - it  may  be

boring, Sir, but I will quote here several  of  the

schools and the amounts given to them:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



<pre>

                                                $  c.



                    Way Sin School             305 00

                    Chiang Teck School         822 48

                    Ban Lay School           4,105 00

                    Pei Mi Public School       822 28

                    Loke Yung Public School    246 93

                    Sin Min Public School      676 58

</pre>



and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These might be termed irregularities because, as I

said,  the  P.W.D. could not check or certify  that

the  work had actually been done; but there was  no

doubt  that  bills were presented  by  the  schools concerned to the Ministry for payment. As  I  said,

no  public  funds have been embezzled at  all.  The

Police  have  been told. The Director of  Audit  is

going  into every case. Sir, I hope to be  able  to

give  a  fuller story at the next sitting  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
