<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate - [21st September]:



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, as I explained yesterday, this  Bill

is divided into six Parts dealing with a number of

different  matters which all have this in  common:

that  they are additions to our permanent criminal

law   which  we  consider  necessary  in   present

circumstances, and they are all measures which  we

hope  will only be required for a limited  period.

So  we  have  brought them together in  this  Bill

making  temporary provisions to amend our criminal

law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referred yesterday evening, Sir, to Part I,

the  Definitions, and to Part II,  which  contains

stern    measures   directed   against   Communist

terrorists and secret plots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come, Sir, to Part III of the Bill. This

also is directed against Communist terrorists, but

against those in the Federation. It is designed to

give  full  assistance  to  our  friends  in   the

Federation  in denying supplies to the  terrorists

in  the jungles of Johore. It provides for control

of  the  movement of persons and  vessels  in  the

Straits   of  Johore.  Clause  10  (1)   prohibits

movement in the main Strait between the island  of

Singapore and Johore during the hours of darkness.

Clause  10 (2) prohibits absolutely at all  times,

whether  by  day or night, movement between  Pulau

Ubin  and Johore. Clause 10 (4) exempts from  that

control  the  area south of Pulau Ubin  which  is

roughly  opposite to Changi Point. The  effect  of

clauses 11 and 12 is to declare this area  in  the

Straits a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>

port under the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, and to

apply  to  it certain provisions of that Ordinance

which relate to administrative control of shipping

and  the issue of clearances and so on. Clause  12

gives  power  to the Harbour Master,  who  is,  in

fact,  the Fisheries Officer, to issue permits  to

fishermen  and other people who need to use  these

waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas to which these various clauses refer

are  described in the first five Schedules of  the

Bill.  Those  descriptions are not  very  easy  to

follow,  and I have had a map prepared, a copy  of

which  I will table, Sir, and another copy I  have

had placed in the Library in case Members wish  to

refer to it. These areas have been prescribed  now

for  many  months and are, I think, well known  to

all   persons  who  use  those  areas.  All  these

arrangements have been working for some time,  and

we  are  confident that they have  achieved  their

main purpose of denying supplies to the terrorists

in  Johore.  It  is necessary that  this  control,

which  was imposed to help the Government  of  the

Federation,  should be continued as  long  as  the

authorities  in  the Federation are  carrying  out

food denial measures in Johore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill, Sir, is quite simple. It

prohibits  the  public display of  foreign  flags,

except  by  accredited Commonwealth  and  consular

representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V is more controversial. It makes it

necessary  to give 14 days' notice of a strike  or

lock-out  in  an essential service. The  essential

services to which this Part applies are listed  in

the  sixth  Schedule. We have, Sir,  limited  that

Schedule  to  services which we  consider  to  be

vitally necessary for the health and life  of  the

community. Hon. Members will probably notice  that

we  have  not  included  in that  Schedule  public

transport.  Now  a  sudden  stoppage   of   public

transport   in   this  city,  as  we   know   from

experience,  must  cause very grave  inconvenience

and  hardship to the community; but, nevertheless,

we  reached  the  conclusion that  we  should  not

regard it as being vitally necessary to the health

and  life  of  the community, and so we  have  not

included public transport in the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would emphasise that this Part of the Bill

does  not,  of course, prohibit strikes.  It  only

requires  that 14 days' notice should be given  so

that  some sort of emergency arrangements  can  be

made to ensure a minimum service necessary for the

well-being  of  the public. I expect  it  will  be

argued  that  this  Part is restriction  on  trade

union activities. Of course, that is so, but it is

our  view,  Sir,  that workers in these  essential

services,  and  indeed  the  Government,  have  an

obligation  towards  the  public  which  must   be

recognised,  because a strike  in  these  services

does  not only affect the workers in the industry,

but  it affects the daily life of everybody in the

community. A strike in these services can only  be

carried  out  at the cost of harm to  the  public.

These  workers, after all, are, in the  main,  the

employees    of    responsible   organisations - the

Government,    the    City   Council,    statutory

authorities - organisations which can be expected to

follow  a good employer policy. They are primarily

concerned  with service to the public rather  than

with  seeking profit, and their general policy  is

considerably   under   the   direction   of    the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, of course, that this period of 14

days  gives  the employing organisations  time  in

which  to  arrange to carry on their  services  to

some  extent, and to this extent the sharpness  of

the strike weapon is blunted. But, as I have said,

we  feel  that  the over-riding interests  of  the

general public cannot be ignored, and I think  the

House  will  agree  that  recent  experiences   in

strikes  in the City Council have shown  that  the

strike  is  still  a very potent weapon  and  must

still  cause  great hardship, and,  ultimately,  a

danger  to public health, even after the 14  days'

notice has been given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is right, too, that in these services

where  so much more is at stake than the interests

of  the  employers and the employees, there should

be  a  compulsory period during which  efforts  at

conciliation can be made and during which the full

implications  of  a strike can be appreciated.  In

these   days,  unfortunately,  we  have  hot-heads

amongst  our  labour leaders who,  for  their  own

ends, will provoke strike action before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



all efforts to reach agreement by negotiation have

been  tried and exhausted. Their technique  is  to

reach a quick snap decision and force an immediate

strike. Surely these tactics should not be allowed

in  essential services, and the l4-day period may

well   give  time  for  wiser  and  more  moderate

counsels  to  prevail  over irresponsible  leaders

without,  I suggest, doing any damage to the  real

interests of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI is general and contains powers of search

and arrest, and provides for matters of procedure.

I  think  the most important clause is clause  30.

That  gives a special power to disperse assemblies

at  times  of  tension  when  passions  are  being

aroused  and  there is a danger of a  crowd  being

turned  into a rioting mob, as we have experienced

recently  and  in 1950. The clause  provides  that

whenever  the  Chief Secretary  declares  that  an

immediate threat to public peace exists, then  any

police officer not below the rank of Inspector may

disperse any assembly of ten or more persons.  The

point  of  this clause is that there  must  be  an

immediate threat to public peace. There must be  a

situation  where  tension and emotions  have  been

aroused and there is an atmosphere of crisis,  and

there is a danger that a spark could set light  to

a serious conflagration - circumstances in which any

gatherings  present  a  real  threat   to   public

security.  Then the declaration can be  made.  The

provision  is  designed  only  to  deal  with   an

immediate threat, to provide time for passions  to

cool  off, and so Members will see that subclause

(2)  provides that the declaration can only remain

in force for a maximum of 48 hours, though it can

be renewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers and penalties provided throughout

this Bill, Sir, are, as I have said, supplementary

to  those  contained in the permanent  legislation

dealing   with   these  matters,   and   we   have

deliberately refrained from amending the permanent

law   in  the  hope  that  these  new  powers  and

penalties  will  only be required  for  a  limited

period,  because  we hope that as  the  people  of

Singapore  gain  experience  of  the  working   of

democracy  under  the wise, restrained  and  sound

leadership of Members of this Assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



and  other leaders, and as workers and their trade

unions  gain  experience of  sound  and  effective

trade  unionism and begin to appreciate the danger

to  their own interests of violent and precipitate

action: - as these things happen, Sir, we hope  that

the  people of Singapore will no longer be at  the

mercy  of Communist terrorists and will no  longer

be  stampeded  by  irresponsible leaders  headlong

into hasty and violent action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that hon. Members of this House can

have  full time to consider these clauses  in  the

light of this debate, I shall not ask to take  the

Committee  stage today but shall put it  down  for

our next sitting on 12th October.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, on a

point  of  elucidation on the sixth Schedule.  The

Chief  Secretary put forward a point that all  the

services   there  listed  are  either  under   the

Government or City Council or public corporations;

and that they are model employers and unlikely  to

behave as employers solely out for profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will he explain the appearance in that Schedule

of  No.  11 - "Bulk  distribution of  fuel  oil  and

lubricants"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I may have been guilty of a slip of

the  tongue, Sir. What I meant to say was they are

"in the main". Whether I left "in the main" out or

not I cannot recall, but, of course, the employees

in  the  bulk oil fuel industry are not Government

employees, or employees of statutory corporations.

They  are,  on the other hand, employees  of  very

large  and  responsible concerns who do  have  the

interests of the public very much before them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

direct  my  remarks on this Bill  to  the  section

which  deals with strikes and lock-outs.  To  take

the  point  which  the Chief Secretary  has  just

taken, I must say that I profoundly disagree  with

his view of the responsibility and good conduct of

the  organisations which distribute fuel oil  and

lubricants  in  bulk. As a matter of  fact,  I  am

closely associated with the unions in two of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



companies  which distribute these  lubricants  and

fuel oil in bulk. I must say that my experience of

them has been somewhat disappointing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, the moment a union was formed in

their  companies,  the employers  issued,  without

consultation with the union or union officials,  a

directive  listing  the employees  who,  in  their

opinion,  should  not join the union,  the  people

they considered either supervisors or confidential

stenographers, who should not participate in trade

union  activities. In the light  of  the  somewhat

acrimonious correspondence that arose between  the

union  and these employers, my impression is  that

to allow such a company the added protection which

the  Chief Secretary has justified on the  grounds

that   the  employers  are  more  or  less   model

employers - to  allow  them  to  have   this   added

protection   is,   in   my   opinion,   completely

unwarranted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Chief Secretary in

his  remarks  has completely overlooked  the  main

point - his omnibus point - that all the sections have

been  collected together in one Bill because  they

are  of a temporary nature, and that with a change

of  circumstances  in the, we all  hope,  not  too

distant  future, they may become unnecessary.  But

when  he  propounded his arguments  why  in  these

services  the strike instrument should be blunted,

he  did not indicate that it should not be blunted

when  the Emergency has passed away. The arguments

that  he  propounded would hold  equally  well  if

there  were  no emergency situation. His  view  is

that these services are essential to the life  and

benefit  of  the  community and  that,  therefore,

there  should be a time-lag to allow  this  strike

weapon  to  be  blunted and to allow  conciliation

proceedings. It is pertinent to remind him that if

his  main  argument still holds that this  law  is

only  for  the period of the Emergency,  then  all

those other arguments that he has put forward  are

irrelevant  and cannot hold water as  they  stand,

because they contradict his main point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more or less a trade unionist myself, one who

has been in close association with the unions,  I

cannot, of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



subscribe  to  the  view the Chief  Secretary  has

expounded,  that  the leaders  in  many  of  these

unions in the essential services are irresponsible

hot-heads.  Very often, my feeling  was  that  the

venerable  and  elderly  managers,  who  met   the

workers  over trade disputes, were quite  ignorant

and foolish people who did not know that they were

dealing  with  a human problem. These  people  are

only  concerned  with their  workers  as  cogs  in

operating their purely mechanical system for which

they are responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour will be the first to

agree  with  me when I say that the strike  weapon

can    be   abused   by   anyone - responsible    or

irresponsible leaders. I think he will also  agree

with  me that the leaders in these unions -  water,

gas,   electricity,   public   health -   are   not

irresponsible  leaders. I should hate  to  imagine

the   fire   service  leaders  are  irresponsible,

because  if they are, then a prominent  member  of

the Labour Front must be responsible for that.  We

have nothing to do with that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Postal and telegraph services and undertakings,

port,    dock,    and   harbour    services    and

undertakings - to  many Members  in  this  Assembly,

they  just  list  up  particular  categories   and

groups. But to me and to my colleagues, they refer

to  certain persons and certain committees, and  I

resent very much the suggestion that they have  in

the past acted in an irresponsible manner, or that

they  are  likely  in  the future  to  act  in  an

irresponsible  manner.  I  think  some  of   these

unions,  like  the  water,  gas,  electricity  and

public  health unions, were former clients of  the

Hon. the  Chief  Minister, and he  would  be  the

first,  I  think, to stand by the good conduct  in

the past of his clients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government feels that it is necessary to

take this step, we shall not resist it, but we ask

them  to remember that it is not democratic,  that

it is not fair to blunt the strike instrument, and

that    all    these   extraordinarily   stringent

regulations  should  be  set  aside  as  soon   as

conditions permit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, talking on essential

services in reply to the Member for Tanjong  Pagar (Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



Lee  Kuan  Yew) who brought attention to  bear  on

item  11  in the sixth Schedule -"Bulk distribution

of  fuel oil and lubricants" - the answer to  that

is  this,  Sir, that it would not be  possible  to

maintain all the other essential services - all  the

other  ten listed - if distribution of fuel oil  and

lubricants  is not also under similar control.  To

my  mind,  Sir, the best solution to this question

of strikes in essential services could be resolved

in  a different manner, instead of having it in  a

temporary provisions law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as strikes in essential services are

concerned,  I  think, in the interests  of  public

health  and  public life, that they should  not  be

allowed to take place without a notice period, but

protection  for the worker should be provided  for

by   compulsory  arbitration.  That  is  the  only

solution.  There should be compulsory  arbitration

in  essential services, and if the awards  of  the

arbitrators are not satisfactory to the unionists,

then,  of  course,  the  unionists  will  want  to

strike; but before then, there will be that safety

valve - that  all disputes as regards conditions  of

employment  could  be  referred  to  a  compulsory

arbitration  board  where  all  matters  could  be

resolved  in  a friendly spirit, or  in  a  proper

manner, instead of having to resort to a strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar has said that I know

that  the leaders in the unions in these essential

services are not all irresponsible men. Sir, there

are  all  types  of leaders - some are  responsible,

some  are  not  responsible,  no  matter  in  what

organisation  they  may be.  The  object  of  this

measure is not to blunt the strike weapon at  all.

In  fact, the strike weapon has never been blunted

in so far as the essential services are concerned.

A  14-day strike notice is necessary in order that

my  Ministry can bring both parties together in an

endeavour  to  settle the dispute  amicably.  When

that  cannot be done, then, of course, the workers

will go on strike.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The employers have got a

separate labour force!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> No. The City Council, for

instance, Sir, have had two strikes - one last  year

and one this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



The  labour force that they employed was not meant

to  break  the strike. It was meant to look  after

the  health  of the public, so much so  that  even

with  the employment of a temporary labour force,

this  did  not  prevent the  City  Council  Labour

Unions  Federation from winning their strike  last

time.  More-over, Sir, these requirements  do  not

deprive the workers of the strike weapon at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committee stage, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> 12th October, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PENAL CODE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a short Bill which is designed to

make  it an offence for any person to make, print,

possess,  post  or distribute, or have  under  his

control, any document containing any incitement to

violence  or counselling disobedience to the  law,

or to any lawful order of a public servant, or any

document  likely  to lead to  any  breach  of  the

peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, Sir, a simple Bill which I hope requires

little elaboration. I would, however, wish to  add

this  in  moving the Second Reading, and  that  is

that  the  making and circulation of documents  of

this  kind, which is not by any means uncommon  at

the  present  time,  and indeed,  Sir,  it  is  an

activity which finds much favour with the  Malayan

Communist  Party - such  an activity,  Sir,  clearly

constitutes  a  threat to law and order.  On  this

ground,  I  venture  to hope that  the  Bill  will

commend itself to this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a very

simple Bill which requires little elaboration,  as

the Hon. the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



Attorney-General said, but I cannot understand why

it  should  have  been necessary  to  include  it,

first,  in the Penal Code, and next, after section

151, which deals with unlawful assemblies:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whoever knowingly joins or continues in any

assembly of five or more persons likely to cause a

disturbance  of  the  public  peace,  after   such

assembly  has been lawfully commanded to disperse,

shall  be  punished  with imprisonment  of  either

description  for a term which may  extend  to  six

months, or with fine, or with both."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is just a preliminary point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point of substance is that it should not be

necessary to tamper with the Penal Code which  is

part  of  the  permanent legislation  and  of  the

normal   laws  of  this  country  more   than   is

absolutely necessary. Anything special  which  we

all  hope  will become unnecessary in a few  years

time  should not be included in the  Penal  Code.

The Indian Penal Code is a much more comprehensive

piece  of legislation than our own, and even  they

have  not  included this, or any such section,  in

their own Penal Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Butterfield, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> In reply, Sir. With regard to

the first point which was raised by the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar, that is, the place of the proposed

new  section in the Penal Code, that was  a  point

which  occurred  to me too when I first  saw  this

Bill;  so I examined the Penal Code and considered

where  it might more conveniently come. It  seemed

to me, all things taken into consideration, that it

appeared to be a most suitable place. But I do not

propose, Sir, to move that this Bill should go  to

the  Committee  of this House until 12th  October,

and  I should be very glad to reconsider that  and

possibly move an amendment to put the clause  into

what  may  be  a more suitable part of  the  Penal

Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point of substance which was

made   by  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar,   the

Government  does  not  accept  the  view  that   a

provision of this kind need only be temporary. The

position, as I understand it, Sir, is that neither

the  Sedition  Ordinance, which, of course,  deals

with  seditious publications, nor the  Undesirable

Publications



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance  adequately  covers  activities  of  the

kind which this Bill is designed to meet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that is all I wish to say now with

regard to the points made by the hon. Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this Bill is to enable the

Governor  in  Council to make better provision  by

rule  to give effect to the provisions of the Arms

and  Explosives Ordinance. It is,  of  course,  an

Ordinance  which regulates the manufacture,  use,

sale,  import and export, and so on  of  arms  and

explosives in the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the particular purposes for which it is

desired  that there should be power to make  rules

should,  I  think, be referred to by  me  at  this

stage, and they are three in number. Firstly,  the

regulation of the transport of arms; secondly, the

authorisation  of officers by name  or  office  to

arrest without warrant, and to search persons  who

are reasonably believed to have committed offences

against  any  rules made under the Ordinance.  The

third  purpose for which it is desired that  there

should be power to make rules is the provision  of

increased  penalties  for  offences  against   the

rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those amendments, Sir, are provided for by clause

3  of the Bill, and I think I should refer to  the

amendment  which is proposed in clause  2.  Quite

shortly, Sir, the effect of that amendment will be

to  provide that no dealing in or handling of arms

and  explosives  on behalf of the Crown  shall  be

exempt from the operation of the Ordinance, as  is

at  present  the case, unless it is in  accordance

with rules made under the Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, shortly, Sir, the purpose of this measure is

to  enable control over arms and explosives to  be

more  effectively exercised in Singapore. I  hope,

therefore, that this House will give the Bill  its

Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<div align="center"><b>CORROSIVE SUBSTANCES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is designed to provide

specifically  for  a  most  aggravated   type   of

assault - that is, acid throwing. It is, Sir, a type

of  assault  which all must regard as  of  a  most

cowardly  and revolting kind and one which  merits

severe  punishment. So, Sir, what this Bill  seeks

to  do  is to create certain offences relating  to

the  throwing of acid and to provide penalties for

those offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, and I am now referring to

clause 3, the Bill seeks to make it an offence  to

carry  any  corrosive substance  in  circumstances

which  raise  a  reasonable presumption  that  the

corrosive substance is to be used for the  purpose

of  causing hurt. The penalty prescribed for  that

offence   by  clause  3  is  a  maximum  term   of

imprisonment of ten years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second offence which the Bill seeks to

create, Sir, and I now have in mind the provisions

of  clause 4, is the actual or attempted use of  a

corrosive  substance for the  purpose  of  causing

hurt;  and  the  punishment  prescribed  for  that

offence is a term of imprisonment which may extend

to   imprisonment  for  life.  The   clause   also

prescribes that the convicted person shall also be

liable to whipping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also seeks to create two further

offences  which are connected very  closely  with

the  two  offences to which I have referred.  They

are the offences of consorting with, or being in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



the company of another committing one or other  of

the  offences referred to in clauses 3 and 4.  The

consorting,  Sir,  must be in circumstances  which

raise  a  reasonable presumption that  the  person

consorting intends to act, or has acted, with that

other  person  in the commission of one  of  those

offences to which I have already referred. In such

cases,  Sir, the person consorting will be  liable

to  the same punishment as the person with whom he

has consorted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other provisions, Sir, of the Bill

to which I would wish to refer, and I refer to the

provisions of clauses 6 and 7. Clause 6,  Sir,  is

designed  to confer wide powers of search  on  any

police  officer who has reason to believe that  an

offence under the Ordinance - and I refer now to the

words  of  the clause - "has been, is being,  or  is

likely to be committed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of clause 7, Sir, relates to

statements  made by accused persons.  That  clause

provides  that  a  statement made  by  any  person

charged with an offence under the Ordinance to any

police  officer of or above the rank of Inspector,

shall  be admissible in evidence provided that  it

has  not  been induced by any threat  or  improper

inducement,   and  that  the  accused   has   been

cautioned at the earliest possible time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may wish to notice, Sir, that it is

expressly  provided  by the  Bill  that  a  person

accused  of  an offence under the Ordinance  shall

not be obliged to answer any questions at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said a few moments ago, Sir, the type of

offence dealt with by this Bill is a most cowardly

one, and I therefore ask this House to accept this

Bill as a proper measure to deal with offences  of

that kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committee stage, what day?

<div align="center"><b>PROTECTED PLACES AND AREAS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is designed to make permanent the

provisions of the Protected Places Ordinance which

was  enacted in 1948, and, in addition, to provide

for  the  protection  of areas  in  which  special

measures are required to control the activities of

persons who are in those areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Bill therefore provides, Sir, is that

the  Chief  Secretary may declare any premises  or

any  area  to be a protected place, or a protected

area,  as  the  case may be, if  he  considers  it

necessary or expedient in the case of any premises

or  any place to prevent the entry of unauthorised

persons into that place; and if in the case of  an

area  he  considers it necessary or  expedient  to

control the movement or conduct of persons  within

that area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the consequence of such a declaration by the

Chief  Secretary  is  that,  in  the  case  of   a

protected  place, special permission  is  required

before a person may enter and in the case of  both

protected places and protected areas, any guard on

duty  is  empowered to fire if  necessary  on  any

person  attempting  to  enter,  or  who  is  in  a

protected place or area, if that person  fails  to

stop after being challenged three times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, Sir, too, there is a further

power  conferred on the Chief Secretary - and  I  am

referring   to  clause  9.  The  Chief  Secretary,

Members  will  see if they care to  look  at  that

clause,  is  empowered  to authorise  the  use  of

methods  of protection for any protected place  or

area  which may involve danger to life to  persons

entering or attempting to enter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are numbers of premises in Singapore

which   require   special   measures   for   their

protection of the kind provided by this Bill,  and

this  protection, Sir, has been found to  be  very

effective in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise not to

speak  against  the  Bill but  to  point  out  that

sometimes powers which are given in this way can be

abused.  When they are, they have very  unfortunate

repercussions,  and  the person  against  whom  the

powers have been used in an improper way loses  all

confidence in the whole process of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to bring to the attention of whoever may

be   responsible  for  gazetting  these  protected

places, a particular incident which arose  in  the

case  of  the  recent  City  Council  strike.   It

concerns the City Council gas works which,  quite

properly, is a protected place. In a corner of the

gas  works is a block where some 20 to 25 families

reside.  They work in the gas works and  they  are

completely fenced off from it. There is a concrete

wall  which cuts them off from the gas  works,  a

wall  in which there is a solid steel gate.  There

is  also  a  corrugated metal fence,  fencing  the

quarters from the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ordinarily a person who works in the gas

works and occupies these quarters has to go to his

place of employment not through that special steel

gate, which seals him off from the gas works,  but

he  goes out through the normal corrugated fencing

gate,  goes round to the front along Kallang Road,

and  then  enters the gas works. When he  finishes

his  work, he goes out by the main gas works  gate

and then back to his quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the strike began, the employers sealed off

the  quarters  from  the  road.  They  closed  the

corrugated fencing gate and opened the steel  gate

which  was  in  the middle of this  concrete  wall

between  the  quarters and the gas works,  and  no

worker who was on strike could leave his quarters,

or,  having  left the quarters and gone  out,  was

allowed to return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it was a fine point, first, whether or

not  the quarters form part of the protected area;

and,  in fact, the employers tried to bluff  their

way  through  and said: "Well, it is part  of  the

protected  area." Of course, had  that  point  got

known to the workers -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



that  protected areas and boundaries of  protected

areas  were elastic things which could  be  pushed

backwards    and   forwards   as   the   employers

choose - then I would say the result would have been

unfortunate,  to say the least. An injunction  was

threatened against the City Council for preventing

their  men  who  were on strike from  going  back.

Their  solicitors  were  consulted.  The  question

whether they were licensees or tenants arose;  and

very  fortunately  just at  about  the  time  when

action  was  going  to be taken which  would  have

brought  quite  a lot of publicity to  this  high-handed  action,  which  was  quite  unlawful,  the

strike was settled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that it is important that when a

piece of legislation has given certain powers to a

Government  department or a  Government  official,

these   powers  should  not  be  abused   in   any

circumstances. If they are, then you are likely to

bring  the  whole process of your legislation  and

your whole process of law into disrepute.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> I would like to make one comment,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, on the very  admirable  speech

which  the Member for Tanjong Pagar has just made,

because  I  do feel that he has gone a little  bit

too far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has himself just demonstrated that the

legislative  process can take  note  of  wrong  or

doubtful  actions by employers. He  has  raised  a

most  interesting  point with  reference  to  this

corrugated  gate that was sealed off,  and - correct

me  if  I  am wrong, Mr Speaker - it is within  the

power  of  any Member of this House to  raise  any

matter  of  that sort by way of a  question  or  a

motion  or  in other ways to bring it  before  the

Legislature and have public attention drawn to  it

and,  if necessary, to get the assent of the House

for  necessary  action. There  is  no  reason  for

saying  that  the  whole  democratic  process   is

brought into contempt because some junior official

has  acted in a foolish way. It is this House that

has  the over-riding authority and can control the

junior official.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is designed to remedy two defects

in  the Undesirable Publications Ordinance,  1938,

which, in its present form, is designed to prevent

the  importation of undesirable publications  from

abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first of these defects is that the

Ordinance    does   not   apply   to   undesirable

publications made within Singapore by the  use  of

unlicensed printing presses, and clauses 2, 3  and

4 of the Bill are designed to remedy that defect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second defect is that the Ordinance

does not provide for action to be taken in respect

of  publications  which constitute  a  danger  to

security  where  they are made  outside  Singapore

until  after  they  have been  imported.  That  is

because,  Sir,  it  is  not till  then  that  they

ordinarily  come to the notice of the authorities.

Clause  5,  Sir,  has therefore  been  drafted  to

remedy this second defect. What that clause  does,

Sir,  is  to provide machinery for the examination

of  packages coming into Singapore, and  also  for

the  examination of travellers entering Singapore,

together  with their baggage. It further provides,

Sir,  for  the  detention  and  confiscation   and

destruction  of publications which  may  be  found

during  the  course of such examination  if  those

publications   are,   in  the   opinion   of   the

Controller,    - and  I  use  the   words   of   the

Bill - "prejudicial to public safety in  Malaya  and

the maintenance of public order therein."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, I think I should invite

the  attention of this Assembly to the  concluding

provisions  of  the  Bill - the  last  part  of  the

proposed new clause 13 - which provide that  in  the

exercise of their powers and in carrying out their

duties  under the Ordinance, Controllers shall  be

guided  by  such general or special directions  as

may,  from  time to time, be given  by  the  Chief

Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, the Bill is designed to

prevent  the importation, sale and circulation  in

Singapore  of  documents  prejudicial  to   public

safety  in  Malaya and the maintenance  of  public

order therein, and the need for this, Sir, I hope,

requires no emphasis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

difficult to disagree wholly with this Bill. It is

difficult  also  to  agree  to  give  such   wide,

discretionary  and  absolute powers  to  officials

whose sense of what is likely to be prejudicial to

public  safety  may not coincide with  that  which

obtains  amongst right-thinking domiciled  persons

in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should have been some check on the

exercise of these discretionary powers, some check

by   which  this  House  and  the  public  can  be

acquainted  how  these powers have been  exercised

from  time  to  time.  There is  nothing  in  this

Ordinance, as it stands, which requires the  Chief

Secretary or the Controller to say what particular

publication or publications, document or documents

he  has  impounded or sent back to  its  place  of

origin,  or destroyed. There is no reason  if  the

powers are properly exercised why the public,  and

in  particular  this Legislature,  should  not  be

informed of the manner in which these powers have,

in fact, been exercised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government will give this matter

further  thought so that it can be  considered  at

the Committee stage of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

can  assure  the  House that there  is  never  any

question  of  this Government seeking  lightly  to

wide powers without some curb.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill, Sir, is to deal with

and  protect the public from unscrupulous  vendors

of  medicines and quacks. It requires  vendors  of

medicines  to  publish  the  ingredients  of   the

particular  medicine they sell. Advertisements  in

the Press, and particularly in the vernacular,  of

secret  remedies  make  fantastic  claims  in  the

treatment of certain diseases. These are likely to

beguile persons suffering from these diseases  and

to  deter them from seeking proper medical advice.

These advertisements are a danger to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect is the extraordinary

claims  on wrappers and pamphlets which  go  with

the  medicines.  Fantastic prices are  also  often

charged  for  these medicines.  If  a  proprietary

medicine  is  a  genuine product, with  reasonable

therapeutic action in the treatment of an  ailment

for  which it is recommended, then the makers have

no   excuse  whatsoever  for  not  disclosing  its

contents.  Even before the 1941 Act was passed  in

England,  most medicine manufacturers had  already

taken  steps to disclose the formula and  to  sell

under a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



protected trade mark. It may perhaps be said  that

the  disclosure of the composition of  a  medicine

may  mean very little to the general public.  This

may be so, but it certainly does mean something to

the   medical   profession  as   a   whole,   and,

furthermore, the public will gradually be educated

and  pharmacists will be in a position  to  advise

their  customers of the value of the medicine.  It

is  not  unknown for proprietary medicines  to  be

made  to two different formulae according  to  the

market,   especially  if  the  medicine   contains

substances which are scheduled as poisons in  any

particular country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one aphrodisiac preparation states

that  it contains Yohimbine. But Yohimbine is  not

scheduled   as  a  poison.  In  Malaya,   however,

Yohimbine  is a scheduled poison, and the  formula

is not disclosed here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another preparation - Strychnine - is distributed

not  only  by pharmacists, but also by  unlicensed

medicine vendors under two different formulae.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another which purports to have encased

in its capsules cosmic rays falling from the outer

depths   of  space  and  blessed  with  miraculous

curative  powers  for T.B.! On  examination,  only

oils  mildly carminative are the ingredients  used

which could be purchased for a few cents! This so-called  marvellous medicine - a miraculous cure,  as is claimed - is being sold at $40 per bottle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a practice for local patent medicine

importers  to  import tablets and pills  from  the

United   Kingdom  or  elsewhere,   or   from   the

continent,  in  bulk  and to pack  them  in  small

quantities, selling them with extravagant  claims.

Sometimes indecent advertisements assist the  sale

and  high  prices are charged for  such  products.

There  is  no disclosure of the formula,  and  the

health   authorities  have  no  idea  what   these

medicines  contain.  The  disclosure  of  formulae

would  considerably  assist  Government  to  check

medicines  for  poisons, and  the  food  and  drug

authorities could more readily be ensured that the

medicine,  in  fact,  is in  accordance  with  the

disclosed formula.

would like to move an amendment to clause 4 by

adding the words "or high blood pressure" after

hypertension"  be  inserted after  "blindness"  in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think this

amendment  is  unfair to those who- are  suffering

low  blood pressure. It is real because  a  doctor

told  me that I have it! I think that may  be  the

difference in the policy and practice -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point Mr Braga proceeded to leave the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is all right. We know the word is "hypotension".

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If we are concerned with the

exploitation  of those gentlemen who,  either  for

reasons  of too good living or otherwise, have  to

seek    a    remedy   for   their   ills   through

advertisements  in  the  newspapers,  surely   one

should  also  give  thought to  those  who  suffer

because  they are not so flamboyant or  impetuous?

These, I believe, according to a little booklet  I

read, are the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



manifestations of "hyper-" as opposed  to  "hypo"-tension, which is what I am supposed to have,  Mr

Chairman! Those who suffer from this other kind of

disease,  of course, are much more phlegmatic  and

naturally much slower in reaching decisions. But I

am  told, Mr Chairman, that it is safer,  on  the

balance,  to  be  "hypo" than  "hyper".  For  that

reason  I  would  not move an  amendment  to  this

amendment.  I would not add the word "hypotension"

too,  because, being phlegmatic and somewhat slow,

we  are unlikely to respond to blandishments  made

in advertisements as to how we can be cured by the

purchase   of  a  bottle  of  expensive   tablets!

However,  I  do wish to point out that  there  are

people  who  suffer  from just the  reverse.  They

should not pass without notice.

<div align="center"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 19 of 1955)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's

authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolve that the sum of

$2,000,000  should be supplied to  the  Government

under  the  Heads  of  Expenditure  and  for   the

Services specified in Sessional Paper No. Cmd.  19

of 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a very full explanation of the reasons for

this  request for funds is given in the  Sessional

Paper,  but hon. Members will perhaps wish  me  to

draw attention to the main points in the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the War Damage Fund was drawn up in 1949,

the   Malayan   Governments  were   hard   pressed

financially.  Her  Majesty's Government,  although

itself  hard pressed, agreed to finance the  Fund.

This  financial assistance took the form of a gift

of $171.4 millions and an interest-free loan of up

to  a  limit  of $160 millions. It was  understood

that, when the time came to draw the interest-free

loan,   the  financial  position  of  the  Malayan

Governments  would be reviewed. If  the  financial

position  had  changed  for  the  better  in   the

meantime, they would be expected to contribute  to

the  Fund,  thus easing the heavy  burden  on  Her

Majesty's Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Her Majesty's Government agreed

that  a sum of $19.4 millions should be paid  from

the  War  Damage  Fund to the  War  Risks  (Goods)

Insurance Fund to enable the latter Fund  to  meet

its estimated liabilities. This payment was agreed

on  the understanding that the Malayan Governments

would,  between them, contribute $8.6 millions  to

the  War Risks (Goods) Insurance Fund. Singapore's

share  of this contribution was estimated at  $4.3

millions,  and  this  sum was actually  voted  and

placed in reserve in 1949.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position in these two connections has changed

materially  in the meantime. In the  first  place,

the  finances of the Colony have improved  greatly

since  1949  and  substantial reserves  have  been

built up. In the second place, instead of the $4.3

millions  which Singapore originally undertook  to

contribute  to  the  War Risks  (Goods)  Insurance

Fund, only $1



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



million  has, in fact, been paid, due to the  fact

that in the event the liabilities of the Fund have

fallen short of the estimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the question of drawing the last instalment

of   the  interest-free  loan,  amounting  to  $21

millions,  was  raised  earlier  this  year,   Her

Majesty's   Government  drew  attention   to   the

improved financial position of the Colony  and  to

the  fact that the actual contribution made to the

War Risks (Goods) Insurance Fund had proved to  be

considerably less than what had been  agreed  when

the  contribution of $19.4 millions from  the  War

Damage  Fund had been decided upon. Her  Majesty's

Government    therefore   asked   if,    in    the

circumstances,  the Government of Singapore  could

see  its  way to make a contribution  to  the  War

Damage  Fund,  thus  easing  the  burden  on   Her

Majesty's Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the improvement to the financial

position of the Colony since the War Damage scheme

was  drawn  up,  and the heavy  burden  which  Her

Majesty's  Government has borne and  continues  to

bear  in connection with Commonwealth defence  and

economic development, the Government has  come  to

the  conclusion that it is under an obligation and

that   it   would   be   in  fulfilment   of   the

understanding   reached  in   1949   to   make   a

contribution to the War Damage Fund at this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the amount of this contribution,

it  is  considered that it would be reasonable  to

contribute the balance of the sum which would have

had  to be paid to the War Risks (Goods) Insurance

Fund  if the liabilities of that Fund had, in  the

event,  proved  to be as large as  was  originally

estimated. As I have said, this sum amounts to  $2

millions, has already been voted, and is now  held

in reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to make it clear that

this  contribution will go to reduce the  Colony's

liability in respect of repayment of her share  of

the  interest-free loan. The total amount of  loan

money  required for the Fund is estimated  at  the

present  time to be about $140 millions, of  which

Singapore's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



share  will,  I  think, be of  the  order  of  $35

millions.  This contribution of $2  millions  will

reduce the liability by a corresponding amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  entirely agree with this motion. It will  be  a

good  gesture  on our part, because  we  have  had

considerable help from Her Majesty's Government at

a  time when the finances of the Colony were  low.

Now  that we are in a fortunate position where  we

have built up a considerable reserve, I agree that

we   should  do  what  we  can  to  reimburse  Her

Majesty's Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolve that the sum of

$2,000,000 should be supplied to the Government

under the Heads of Expenditure and for the

Services specified in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 19

of 1955.

of 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purposes for which provision is required

are  explained in the Sessional Paper, but I shall

be glad to answer any questions which hon. Members

may wish to raise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask

the   Financial  Secretary  for  some  information

regarding   item   No.  292 - Subhead   44 - Singapore

Polytechnic - for  $290,000? I  see  that  there  is

provision  for  the  purchase  of  six  flats   at $255,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like some information as to where these

flats  are,  and  for  whose occupation  they  are

intended. It is stated there that it is meant  for

the staff



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Singapore Polytechnic, but I  would  like

some   information  as  to  the  class  of   staff

occupying these flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the provisional

plans   for  the  construction  of  the  Singapore

Polytechnic were drawn up, a liability in  respect

of   quarters   for  the  staff  of  approximately

$1,000,000 was noted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, steps are being taken to

recruit  the Principal and four principal teaching

officers of the Polytechnic. It is hoped that they

will  arrive  in the Colony early next  year,  and

these quarters are required to house them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quarters themselves are, I think, situated

somewhere  in  the  Grange Road Chatsworth  Avenue

area. They have been designed by an hon. Member of

this  House. They have been examined both  by  the

Government Valuer and by the Government Architect,

and  are  regarded as suitable for  staff  of  the

Polytechnic. The price which has been  asked  is

regarded as fair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolve that the sum of $1,289,359 should be supplied to the Government

under  the  Heads  of  Expenditure  and  for   the

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE TELEPHONE BOARD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

section 102 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1947 (No.

39   of  1947),  as  amended  by  the  Income  Tax

(Amendment) Ordinance, 1948 (No. 20 of 1948),  the

Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance, 1950 (No. 44  of

1950), the Income Tax (Amendment No. 2) Ordinance,

1950  (No. 46 of 1950), the Income Tax (Amendment)

Ordinance,  1952 (No. 29 of 1952), the Income  Tax

(Amendment) Ordinance, 1953 (No. 40 of  1953)  and

the Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance, 1954 (No. 34

of  1954),  resolves that the Singapore  Telephone

Board be added to the First Schedule to the Income

Tax Ordinance, 1947.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an application has been received from the

Singapore  Telephone  Board  for  exemption   from

income  tax under section 13 (1) (e) of the Income

Tax  Ordinance.  This  exemption  is  effected  by

inclusion of the name of the Board in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



First Schedule to the Ordinance. For this purpose,

a  resolution  of this Assembly is  necessary,  in

accordance with section 102 (1) of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Telephone Board was set up under

the Singapore Telephone Board Ordinance, 1953 (No.

21  of 1953). The Board consists of five persons - a

Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, two members appointed

by  the  Governor  in Council, and  the  Financial

Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main functions of the Board are, firstly, to

operate a good and sufficient telephone service in

the  Colony for the Government, public bodies  and

the  public  generally; secondly, to  promote  the

economic  development of the telephone service  in

accordance,  as  far  as  practicable,  with   the

recognised  international  standard  practice   as

public   demand;  thirdly,  to  make   regulations

governing the telephone service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the duty of the Board to exercise and

perform its functions under the Ordinance so  that

the  total  revenues of the Board,  which  consist

mainly  of charges for telephone services and  the

hire  of  equipment, are sufficient  to  meet  its

total   expenditure  properly   chargeable   under

revenue   account,   including  depreciation   and

interest on capital. Any surpluses of revenue over

expenditure left after the obligations laid on the

Board  under section 23 (1) of the Ordinance  have

been  fulfilled, will be applied to  set  up  such

reserves  as  the Board considers necessary,  and,

thereafter,  to  the payment of such  interest  on

shares and stock issued by the Board as the  state

of  the undertaking and financial position of  the

Board  appears  to warrant, but not  exceeding  an

average  of  6  per  cent, taking  one  year  with

another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is required to keep proper accounts and

to  prepare  an annual statement of  accounts  for

audit  and  trans-mission  to  the  Minister   for

Communications and Works. It has also to  transmit

to   the   Minister  annually  a  report  of   its

activities.  A copy each of the accounts  and  the

report   will  be  laid  on  the  Table   of   the

Legislative Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is a non-profit making public body

whose activities are directed by a Board nominated

by the Government of the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precedents for inclusion of such a public body

in  the  First Schedule are, amongst  others,  the

Malayan   Railway  Administration,  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board, the Penang Harbour Board  and  the

Central Electricity Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Board of Income Tax, constituted

under  the  Ordinance,  has recommended  that  the

Singapore Telephone Board may properly be included

in  the  First  Schedule to  this  Ordinance  with

effect  from 1st January, 1955, and the  Government

accepts this recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1)

of  section 102 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1947 (No. 39 of 1947), as amended by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



the  Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance, 1948  (No.  20   of   1948),   the  Income  Tax   (Amendment)

(Amendment  No.  2) Ordinance, 1950  (No.  46  of  1950), the Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance, 1952

(No. 29 of 1952), the Income Tax (Amendment)

Ordinance,  1953 (No. 40 of 1953) and the  Income

Tax  (Amendment) Ordinance, 1954 (No. 34 of 1954),

resolves  that the Singapore Telephone  Board  be

added  to  the First Schedule to the  Income  Tax  Ordinance, 1947.
