Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for his question. The operator
inspects sections of the track each night to check if the tracks
and its components are in good condition. This includes the rail
clips that secure the running rails to the timber sleepers. Any
clip that is observed to have broken off is replaced immediately
upon detection.</p>

time to time. However, as the clips are connected at intervals along
the entire running track, a single broken clip ought not to affect
the safety of rail operations significantly, as the other clips
continue to secure the track. Following the dislodgements, SMRT
carried out a check of the entire system and assessed that the safety
of the system had not been compromised and that normal train operations
could continue. To ensure that safety of passers-by, temporary safety
nets have also been put up between Dover and Jurong East Stations
to minimise the recurrence of the rail clips dropping from the viaduct.</p>

precautions as a result of the dislodgements. LTA has asked the
operator to send the broken rail components from the dislodgements
to a laboratory to analyse how the damage may have occurred as an
additional check. The operator will also be required to give LTA
a full report on the incidents in due course. </p>

the operator on those aspects of the rail infrastructure which require
Government funding for replacement. This includes major track replacement

for checking and maintaining the rail system regularly, including
the replacement of individual parts or components that may show
signs of wear and tear. </p>

both LTA and SMRT had already assessed that certain stretches of
the MRT system along the North-South Line would need to have the
timber sleepers replaced. The implementation details are currently
being worked out. Let me assure the House that LTA will continue
to work with the operators to ensure that the safety of the system
is not compromised.</p>

I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply. With
regard to the dislodgement, other than clips, there has been some
feedback as well from areas where the tracks are curved that some
of the lining of the undercarriage of tracks have also occasionally
dislodged. Are these also under the purview of the SMRT or the operators,
or are these under LTA?</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expects
all financial institutions in Singapore to have in place risk management
processes and security controls to safeguard their systems and operating
capability. Banks are required to take prompt action to rectify
any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in their systems. </p>

the financial institutions since 2010 on a comprehensive programme
to strengthen the security of payment cards. The programme includes measures
to reduce the risks associated with the use of magnetic stripe ATM
cards. Following the recent incident, the Association of Banks in
Singapore (ABS) announced, in January 2012, that the industry will
adopt the EMV standard in ATM cards to address the risk of card
skimming. EMV stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa. It is a global standard
for payment cards based on chip card technology. The industry has
said that it intends to adopt this standard to address the risk
of card skimming by 2014. Its implementation will require infrastructural
changes to the ATM networks, and will take two years for completion.
In the interim, banks are putting in place additional layers of security
to enhance the protection of their customers' bank accounts. These
include disabling overseas withdrawals unless requested by the customer,
SMS alerts for cash withdrawals above a certain threshold and replacing
ATM cards that are assessed to be at risk. Banks are also strengthening
their internal surveillance. MAS has urged banks to implement the
new measures as soon as they can, even ahead of the industry's target timeline,
where possible. </p>

it is treating the issue of fraudulent withdrawals with utmost priority.
MAS has required that the bank reviews all control processes to minimise
the risk of ATM fraud, and will assess the adequacy of the measures
being taken. MAS will continue to work with the industry to enhance
security measures to safeguard the integrity of consumers' bank
accounts.</p>

Thank you. So there is a distinction between the magnetic stripe
technology which has been the prevailing method and the EMV chip-based
cards which they are moving towards. They intend to move by 2014.
This roadmap to increase the security of the system has been worked
out, together with MAS, over the last few years. We expect all banks
coordinated by the Association of Banks (ABS) to comply with this
new standard by 2014 and preferably earlier, if possible.</p>

the CPC gives Police the powers to ask an accused person to surrender
his passport as a condition of bail or personal bond. For accused
persons who are assessed to be a flight risk, Police will set the
bail or bond, commonly referred to as "police bail", at a higher
amount. This is during an investigation. Flight risk is assessed holistically,
taking into account multiple factors such as whether the accused
person has roots in Singapore and the extent of these roots, the
gravity of the offence, the behaviour of the accused person in the
course of investigations and whether the person had attempted to
abscond previously.</p>

I thank the Minister. As the Minister mentioned earlier, the bail
depends on the ties that the accused person has with the country.
For foreigners, they definitely do not have deep ties with Singapore
and the likelihood of them fleeing Singapore is definitely high.
So, will the Ministry consider putting in a Standard Operating Procedure
or law to ensure that regardless of what the characteristics or
the risk of this person is, that the passport be impounded till
the Court has made a decision whether to acquit the accused or to
charge the accused further? As shown in this instance, the foreigners
have fled and this have led the victims left in Singapore feeling
very unjust about what has happened to them.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, fundamentally,
this case illustrates the challenges of ensuring that the accused
persons, whether they are Singaporeans or foreigners facing trial,
do not abscond. As they have not yet been convicted of a crime,
the presumption of innocence limits how far we can restrict their
movements. Ultimately, the discretion rests with the Court to decide
whether an accused person should be allowed to leave our jurisdiction
taking into account submissions by both the prosecution and the
defence. The accused, as Ms Tin has pointed out, has not been convicted
yet. Of course, if he has been convicted, then it is quite clearcut.
But if he has not been convicted yet, then we have to balance the
different requirements.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Chan Chun Sing</strong>
                  </span>: Sir,
the casino self-exclusion programme was launched in November 2009.
As of 31 January 2012, there were 42,700 self-exclusions in force.
About 35,200 were foreigners, while 7,500 were citizens and PRs.
Self-exclusion, for both locals and
foreigners, is voluntary under the Casino Control Act. We recognise
that foreign workers, particularly Work Permit Holders, may need
assistance with the self-exclusion process. The National Council
on Problem Gambling (NCPG) has worked with the Ministry of Manpower
(MOM) to allow employers to print self-exclusion application forms
via the Work Permit Online System and for the employers to help
workers submit the signed form to NCPG. The Migrant Workers' Centre
also assists foreign workers who come to their drop-in centre to
submit self-exclusion applications. </p>

reached out to 30,000 foreign workers through talks and roadshows
at companies and workers' dormitories, and in partnership with the
Migrant Workers' Centre. It also carries out efforts to raise awareness,
such as regular reminders to employers through the Work Permit Online
system.</p>

problem, casino exclusion will help them in their recovery. Unfortunately,
some patrons may not recognise or acknowledge that they are addicted to
gambling. For this reason, we have also provided family exclusion
orders to allow families to exclude them. So far, about 900 such
orders from families have been issued. </p>

Act (CCA), the onus is on the casino operators to keep excluded
persons and minors out of the casino premises, and their failure
to do so would constitute a breach liable for disciplinary action.
The Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) has and will continue to take
the operators to task when they fail to comply. Last month, action
was taken against both operators for failing to prevent excluded
persons and minors from entering and/or remaining in the casino
premises. The Government also takes a serious view on impersonation
as well as the use of false IDs for the purposes of entry into the
casinos. It is an offence under the Penal Code which carries a fine,
an imprisonment of up to five years, or both. </p>

Casino Control Act in the second half of this year. MCYS will work
closely with MHA to ensure that any targeted measures we introduce
can and will be implemented effectively by the casinos. My ministry
has started discussions with both casinos in this regard. Both casinos

two supplementary questions. First question: does the Minister think
that there is a conflict of interest as casino operators were to
bring in more gamblers? How do we make sure that they diligently
carry out what they are supposed to do, for example, stop identified
frequent gamblers and stop those who are not supposed to go in from
going into the casinos? Second clarification is that will the Minister
consider subjecting foreign workers to the $100 entrance fee, same
as Singaporeans and PRs?</p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">
                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Chan Chun Sing</strong>
                  </span>: Sir,
let me take the first question about the potential conflict of interest.
Yes, we recognise that the casino operators would like to have more
patrons on their premises. Having said that, the casino operators
– there are two in Singapore – are very clear in their RFIs ever
since they got into this, that they are not to target the local
patrons; that means Singaporeans and PRs. Their efforts are to focus
on attracting the foreigners rather than the locals. In this regard,
we have spoken to the casinos. They are also forthcoming to acknowledge
that it is not in their interest to target the locals. It is also
part of their responsible gambling programme to make sure that our
locals, especially the Singaporeans and PRs, do not get into trouble.
Because they acknowledge that they have a social responsibility
towards Singapore and Singaporeans as well. We will step up measures
to work with them to see how we can identify those people that may
have issues with controlling their gambling habits. We are also
looking at the experiences of how other jurisdictions have done
this. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b9a29725-77bc-48d5-a01d-0bf46b09b482">
                  <a name="id-b6312994-fbfb-4d3c-9df3-7a95c6437347__id-b9a29725-77bc-48d5-a01d-0bf46b09b482"><!--a--></a>On the second issue, about
the $100 entry fee, we have done this many years ago, when we first
started the casino because we wanted to send a very clear signal
to all Singaporeans that gambling at the casino is not a way to
make a living and to deter our people from getting into this habit
where they frequent the casinos. On the issue as to whether we would
impose the $100 entry fee to the foreign workers, especially those
on work permits, we will have to consider that holistically as to
where we draw the line between which groups of foreigners we allow
exemption from entry fee, and there are also implications on what
are our contractual arrangements with the casino operators. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-402bb460-6ca2-41cd-b52d-f5e921edad2d">

that step is: we will step up measures to encourage the employers
of the work permit holders to actively encourage the work permit
holders to apply for the self-exclusion orders, where possible,
when they apply for the work permits. So we are trying to make it
a seamless process – when you apply for your work permit, there
is a mechanism there for you to easily apply for the exclusion order
in just one more step.</p>

Sir, I understand that the casinos are not supposed to target local

to a vulnerable group. Could Minister consider having an automatic

Sir. We thank Mr Ang Wei Neng for the question. At this stage, we
have not gone down the road to implement what the Member has called
the automatic exclusion. But we believe that, at the end of the
day, whichever exclusion method that we use, the individual must
have a sense of ownership of that decision and the responsibility.
Otherwise, we also risk running into another set of problems where
people try to circumvent the exclusion orders imposed upon them, which
is why we started off on this basis of working closely with employers
to encourage work permit holders
– the foreigners – to take ownership of this entire process. If
we do it the other way, it is not impossible, but there are also
side effects that we have to be concerned with. </p>

the rules or circumventing it by other ways, this is a serious problem,
which brings me to two points. First, it goes back to the point
I mentioned just now about the sense of ownership. Even if we force
people to sign the exclusion order, if there is no sense of ownership,
then that individual might find all sorts of way to circumvent this
which is unhealthy. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-58588941-e7ce-467d-b5ea-11dc81546c88">
                  <a name="id-b6312994-fbfb-4d3c-9df3-7a95c6437347__id-58588941-e7ce-467d-b5ea-11dc81546c88"><!--a--></a>The other part of the
equation, as the Member has rightly alluded to, is that we will need
to strengthen our enforcement to make sure that when such cases
happen, we will have to take serious actions because they are not
taking care of themselves and, at the same time, affecting the wider
environment.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-625d11e8-5ce1-4a21-a5e0-15ff2810f17a">

are few layers, as the Member has suggested. One, if the employer
knows the individuals concerned breaking this rule – that means
they are going to the casinos, despite the fact that they have signed
on to the self-exclusion orders – then the employers can work very
closely with us to make sure that these names are given a higher
signature so that we really look at them very carefully and take
a serious look. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7fd93a08-3639-4a16-a7e6-58f229202890">
                  <a name="id-b6312994-fbfb-4d3c-9df3-7a95c6437347__id-7fd93a08-3639-4a16-a7e6-58f229202890"><!--a--></a>The other measure that
we would need to step up is with the casino operators to make sure
that their list of exclusions are kept up-to-date and that it is
always the latest that they can possibly have and to step up the
enforcement. We will need to do a few steps in order to manage the
problem. But at the end of the day, I must emphasise that we want
to do all these to protect our people, to help the vulnerable groups.
But the people involved must also take a certain sense of ownership.
It will be very sad for us to see those examples that the Member
had given, whereby they sign the self-exclusion order, yet they
find all sorts of ways to bypass the exclusion orders themselves.
Because the larger issue is not just casino or not casino. The larger
issue is one of gambling. How do we manage and help curb the irresponsible
gambling behaviours of some individuals.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6fcdc975-4285-4fe9-875b-36272faf6633">

is the obvious form of gambling that we would like to seek to control.
On the other hand, we must not rest on our laurels and be complacent
that if we just resolve and manage the casino issues, that the rest
of the other issues will not be there. Of concern to us, going forward,
would be things like online gambling, which is even more addictive,
does not have an entry levy, can be done anywhere, anytime. Those
are things that we really have to take a serious look to see how
we manage this, to manage the entire gambling habits.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I thank Mr Low for the question. The answer is "yes". There
are penalties and fines for them. That is why recently we found
out that people have breached their exclusion orders – that means
people who are not supposed to be in the casinos were found inside
a casino. When such data is available, we take them to task. The
answer to the Member's question is "yes". There are penalties and
we do spot checks to make sure that whoever they let in are not
inside the exclusion list because they have the data for us to sample.</p>

on 14 June 2010, Prof Linda Darling-Hammond, a Professor of Education
at Stanford University, she wrote about how Singapore had built
an education system that would assure every student access to strong
teaching, an inquiry curriculum and cutting-edge technology. She
complimented the quality Singapore education for empowering students
to use their knowledge in inventive ways. She cited a visit to Nan Chiau
Primary School and how she found eager Primary 4 and Primary 5 students eagerly
displaying their science projects which they have designed and conducted. Students
study plants, animals and insects in the school's eco garden; they
run their own recycling centre, they write and edit scripts for
Internet radio programmes that they produce, etc. Sir, I am sure
for those in this House who have children of Primary school age,
you will find that your children are also involved in the same kind
of activities.</p>

brought a sense of pride in me. That a Professor of Education from
Stanford University would be complimenting Singapore as a "high
achieving nation" in education is something for all of us to be
proud of. It suggests to me that even by the standards of a developed
country, the Singapore education system is really quite a strong
one. Of course, there are also areas where we can improve upon.
But, overall, I would say that, on balance, I am satisfied that
we do have an excellent education system. </p>

the focus on values and character development in schools. It is
a topic that I have spoken about since I entered Parliament in 2006.
I am grateful that the importance of values and character development
is recognised at schools. During my dialogues with parents, many
parents have also expressed support for this emphasis. Without the
right values being inculcated, whatever academic subjects our students
may excel in, we may not achieve the desired outcome that we wish
to see in each of our students.</p>

Times</em>, there was a special report about values and what matters
most to Singaporeans. Values like honesty, kindness, gratitude,
fairness and forgiveness rank as the top five values which the survey
respondents hold close to their hearts. The survey also suggested
that parents play the most important role in character education
of a child, with teachers or schools ranked equally high. Sir, I
urge MOE to continue in its efforts to ensure that these values
are constantly affirmed by our schools to the students. School leaders
and teachers must take the lead to share such values at every teachable
moment with their students. And this can be done not just during
CIP events or Kindness Week but, on a daily basis, during CCAs like
sports, arts and music periods or during everyday class lessons.
Where possible, the schools should also rope in parents to be involved
in their child's character development as well. </p>

topic of schools and how they prepare our students for the future.
Sir, many parents are anxious about the schools that their children
get into. Thus, every year, during the Primary 1 registration process,
parents would be stressed as they wish to ensure that their child
enters into a good branded school. I am sure for many Members in
this House, July is the time when we all wait eagerly for such appeals.
About a week or two ago, the <em class="ph i">Straits Times </em>ran an article
about possible changes to the Primary 1 priority scheme. Since then,
many parents have expressed their concerns about the possible changes.
Sir, it is a sensitive topic. I can see both the strengths and weaknesses of
both sides of the arguments. In fact, I have parents who were thinking
of whether they should buy a property near a branded school because
they were wondering whether there would be changes to the priority
scheme. I do not think there is an easy answer. I would urge MOE
to consider a review of the scheme. So, I pass the buck back to
MOE. Perhaps, we can consider one of the suggestions, which is to
give slightly more priority to Singaporeans. </p>

is to realise the vision which the Minister had expressed during
last year's MOE Work Plan Seminar – that we should strive to ensure
that all schools in every neighbourhood are good schools. </p>

that whatever school they choose for their child, it is a school
that will help their child to develop into the best that the child
can be. This may mean more financial resources for the school and
sending excellent principals and teachers to the schools. We should
emphasise less on academic results and place more emphasis on the
kind of students that graduate from the schools.</p>

the selection committee for the President's Award for Teachers,
I note that several nominees came from schools in the neighbourhood.
As I read each referral from parents, students and teachers about
the nominee, I was touched and impressed at the dedication which
the nominated teacher demonstrated towards the students under their
charge. Sir, I believe that we have many such excellent teachers in
every school. As a member of COMPASS, over the past few years, I
have visited several schools and, from my observation, many of our
teachers do a great job in looking
after our children, imparting knowledge and skills to them and guiding
them in their lives. And we should acknowledge these teachers for
what they have done to mould the lives of our children.</p>

Sir, the vision of MOE is for every school to be a good school.
However, parents tend to perceive only a small group of schools
as being "good" and these are the so-called brand name schools.
This is why parents focus so intensely on access to these schools.
As a result of this fixation, the so-called "neighbourhood schools"
have a hard time convincing parents that they are good schools too.
They face several challenges, not least of which is their own neighbourhood's
demographics. If the neighbourhood has a higher proportion of low-income
or minority races, this tends to be reflected in the school population. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-49e6ac71-f704-4e45-af3c-e305b21c8828">

this problem head-on. If left unaddressed, this will lead to ever-dwindling
enrolment, and plunging morale of both staff and students in the neighbourhood
schools. Such public stereotyping can also lead to low expectations
and low self-esteem of their students. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a6876275-a336-45c0-ab71-08107e1badc0">
                  <a name="budget__id-a6876275-a336-45c0-ab71-08107e1badc0"><!--a--></a>Education is one of the
most powerful instruments of increasing social mobility, and we
must focus more attention on neighbourhood schools to ensure a level
playing field. Meeting this challenge calls for both a paradigm
shift and additional support for neighbourhood schools. Schools
with a higher proportion of disadvantaged students may not score
well in academic rankings. Their children may be bright, but it
takes greater effort and skill to help them reach higher levels
of achievements, compared to those from advantaged backgrounds.</p>

Qiaonan Primary School. One boy from a dysfunctional family came
to Qiaonan in his graduating year in Primary 6 last year. His attendance
in the previous school was erratic. His parents were undergoing
a divorce and a Police Protection Order had been served on his violent
father. His mother relocated to Tampines for a fresh start. The
teachers in Qiaonan took him under their wing and they provided
him with the support for his learning, behaviour and emotional needs.
They worked closely with his mother. </p>

in the school, he was temperamental. One outburst led to a fight
with a classmate. Where some might have given up on him, the teachers persevered.
Their efforts paid off as he steadied himself, made friends and
studied hard. He managed to graduate to a secondary school by year
end. Given his circumstances, this
was itself a real achievement. His teacher gave him high marks for
resilience and told me: "With such positive outlook, he will be
able to soar high in future undertakings." </p>

to the good work of the school. Neighbourhood schools like these
understand their mission and deserve more recognition. They also
need more resources. I would urge MOE to provide neighbourhood schools,
which have a higher proportion of disadvantaged students, a higher
pupil-teacher ratio above the "norm". They can then do more to deliver
tailored programmes to these students, engage the parents and also
have joint projects with the wider community to brand themselves better. </p>

to provide more funding to the struggling neighbourhood schools,

From the points made by the two hon Members earlier in asking for
MOE to look at what defines a "good school", Sir, the criteria by
which one defines "good" is often very subjective and also depends
on what the appropriate measure of success ought to be. The development
and inculcation of good character and moral values and resilience
in our students are intrinsic and cannot be easily quantifiable
or measured. Thus, could the Minister explain how it defines "good"
and the criteria by which that assessment is to be made? When setting
out the criteria and measuring success, there is often a temptation
to rank schools based on performance. Can the Minister explain if
the Ministry would encourage that practice? Further, what additional
steps will the Ministry be taking to achieve the vision of every school
in Singapore being a good school? Would the MOE be able to harness
and support the sharing of good practices across all schools without
being overly prescriptive? </p>

is a partnership between the school, the child's family and the community.
This partnership is essential because education is not only a classroom activity.
Learning in life is equally important. What can be done to better
cultivate this partnership and how can we enhance a student's learning
outside the classroom?</p>

and stringent set of rules and others. This is to be expected, as
teachers are seen to be the ones to impart not just knowledge and
skills but also values to their young charges. However, while moral
decisions and actions of teachers cannot be compromised, teachers
also cannot be expected to be the sole provider of values education
to children. Parents and the society at large have equally important
roles to play in demonstrating and nurturing desired values in our
children. Hence, the framework for Character and Citizenship Education
should not just require teachers to demonstrate desired values within
the curriculum and in school, but should also require parents' involvement
in imparting and nurturing these values in children, as well as
the commitment and participation of community partners and the society
at large. </p>

in our education system for students of different backgrounds and
abilities to ensure equity among them, such as the different educational
pathways for varied abilities, lateral transfers between academic
streams and assistance schemes, such as the School Breakfast Programme,
Learning Support Programme, Financial Assistance Scheme and Opportunity
Fund. However, there are still areas where work is to be done. For
instance, the establishment of the two specialised schools for Normal
(Technical) and the various specialised independent schools might
give rise to greater segregation amongst students of different abilities and
academic streams, unless there are dedicated efforts to ensure they
can integrate and work with one another. </p>

a review of the Gifted Education Programme where students as young
as nine years old are streamed, to select and smaller classes of
higher ability students taught by specially-trained teachers. First,
identifying such gifted students at that age is rather premature.
Second, if such high ability students deserve smaller classes and
specially-trained teachers, then so do Normal (Technical) students
in mainstream schools, who are at the other end of the academic
spectrum. In addition, I hope that the Ministry can review the entry
requirements for students into the Special Assistance Plan (SAP)
schools. It is recognised that SAP schools are top-performing schools
and the demand for entry is rather high. However, the main entry
criterion is that only students who take Chinese as a Mother Tongue
language are eligible for admission. This perpetuates the perception
of a lack of equity among those in the non-Chinese communities.
While the demand for places in SAP schools by students who do not
take Chinese as a Mother Tongue language may not be high, removing
the barrier to entry because of one's Mother Tongue will demonstrate
equity and fairness regardless of race, language or religion, as
enshrined in our National Pledge. </p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, we have received many good feedback since the Minister for
Education introduced CCE last year. As pointed out by many Singaporeans,
students are shaped by values demonstrated by adults in our own society.
Hence, it is important to use real life examples to teach our students. </p>

attitude demonstrated by a small number of residents in Singapore
when the authorities want to build elderly-friendly facilities in
their neighbourhoods. We understand these residents have their valid concerns.
At the same time, it appears that the majority of the Singaporeans
are of the view that it might be better for some of these residents
to channel their resources to engage the authorities to address
their concerns on the loss of use of communal space rather than
highlighting the fear that the value of their HDB flats would drop.
Some residents cited there would be more "deaths" in their neighbourhood
as one of the reason for a possible drop in their flat value. When
the dust on the debate on the Not-in-My-Backyard attitude versus
the need for more elderly facilities is more settled, would MOE
consider using such episodes as CCE teaching materials? </p>

                  </span>:
Sir, there is a concern that our school children are too stressed
over grades, and so burdened with school assignments, tuition and
enrichment classes that they are finding it tough to cope. The situation
has become so acute that, as a newspaper reported recently, some
parents are paying tutors to help their children complete their
homework. Some are also sending their children to psychiatrists.</p>

raise three questions. First, is the education system so competitive
that students cannot get off the treadmill? Second, how does this
picture fit into MOE's emphasis on character building as part of
the holistic development of our students? Third, how are we equipping
our children with the skills and values to cope with life's challenges?</p>

growing pressures in our society, we should not lose focus on the
central importance of character-building, as it lays a solid foundation
for the education of our young. If the foundation is firmly laid,
they would be better able to deal with the pressures of 21st Century
living. They are trying to find their place in the world, and to
carve out an identity in the face of increasing pressures from society.
Parents may add to their pressure by sometimes holding unrealistic
expectations. They are often too busy with work to spend time guiding
their children in forming values. At the same time, in this globalised
and wired world, our young are bombarded with all sorts of ideas through
the Internet. </p>

the better part of their day in school, teachers play a crucial
role in equipping our students with the reasoning skills and moral
values to face the challenges of living in a fast-changing world.
Teachers should use every opportunity to integrate moral values
into the curriculum and themselves provide a good role model. </p>

is more effective through the active participation of students in
putting these values regularly into practice. By constant reinforcement
and validation from a young age, a value taught in school will stay
with him throughout his lifetime. There are many community projects
that schools can get involved in which can impart life's lessons and
skills to our children. For example, help the frail elderly to clean
up their flats or to develop a programme to help keep an estate
clean and green.</p>

MOE needs to provide more support and incentives to teachers to

                  </span>:
Sir, in Budget 2012, education is put forward as one of the pillars
of an inclusive society. One of the best ways to invest in our children
is to continually improve and transform our system to meet the needs
of a new generation of children and equip them for the future. As
Minister for Education has said previously, "Education is a long-term
endeavour and we must be therefore long term in our vision and in
our planning. If we get our policies wrong, then the impact would
be felt by a whole new generation of Singapore citizens."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2143fcb5-6d7d-4345-b687-fc70c949fb3a">
                  <a name="budget__id-2143fcb5-6d7d-4345-b687-fc70c949fb3a"><!--a--></a>At the opening of Parliament,
the Ministry has made clear that values and character development
will be put at the front and centre of an education system which
will foster holistic development of our children. Sir, I hope that
policies will also be designed around this concept to build a sense
of shared values and respect and resilience so that we can appreciate
and celebrate the diversity in our country.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8bb47243-9f9a-4e74-9065-6a2644c1cadc">
                  <a name="budget__id-8bb47243-9f9a-4e74-9065-6a2644c1cadc"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Ministry's reaffirmation
at the opening of Parliament is timely but I would also say that
it is not a new policy. In 2006, we had the "Teach Less, Learn More"
movement. This movement involved, amongst other things, a focus
on holistic development beyond preparing for just tests and examinations.
Sir, we all agree that values and character development should be
placed at the forefront and at the core of any good system. But
the question is: how is it different from our earlier initiatives?
What worked in 2006
and what did not? And how is this going to be introduced and implemented
in schools today? It will be counter-intuitive, I think, to make
values and character development a teaching module because it cannot.
We cannot just set aside some time in the curriculum to teach core
values, character development or moral fibres. Instead, these concepts
have to be woven into the fabric of our system. It has to permeate
all that happens in schools. It cannot be taught like any other
subject or content-based curriculum. </p>

character traits have also to be experienced. It has to be lived and
imparted by example. It has to be demonstrated and exemplified by
our school principals and teachers on a daily basis and reinforced
by the community and parents at home. At the end of the day, character
is built and values instilled by giving our children an opportunity
to live life's experiences. In that context, what can the Ministry
do to better train and equip our teachers to meet this challenge?
Character development must be integrated into the curricula and
experiences of children and embedded into the culture of the school
and the classroom. I hope the Ministry can consider this approach and
realign our focus in our school curriculum so that the relevant
measure of our students is not just the academic grades achieved
but also in the student's fundamental precepts and moral values.
We might need to have a very significant mindset shift not just
of the school, the Ministry and the children involved but also of
the parents and the community at large to reinforce the message
that quality education is much more than just academic development.</p>

                  </span>:
We started the Integrated Programme (IP) in 2004 to allow higher
ability secondary school students to skip the "O" levels into the
"A" levels or its equivalent. I wish to propose an alternative IP,
from Primary 1 to Secondary 4. The current system puts huge pressure
on students, parents and teachers in Primary schools to prepare
for the PSLE. Various Members in this House, including myself, had
spoken on the excessive pressures in our school system. A <em class="ph i">Straits Times </em>article
last month reported more parents taking their Primary school kids
to see psychologists after doing badly in school tests, some as
young as Primary 2. The purpose of PSLE and other major exams appears
to be to sort students into different streams and into different
schools. Our highly competitive examination-driven system has resulted
in high dependency on tuition and drilling for exams rather than
education for the joy of learning.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-53e790a2-1822-42b3-8617-d4e8abd38d59">
                  <a name="budget__id-53e790a2-1822-42b3-8617-d4e8abd38d59"><!--a--></a>Sir, I understand this
is a difficult and emotive issue as there are parents who may feel
a competitive system is desirable. However, there are parents, like
myself, who can accept that our children need not fight to be in
the best schools. The current system offers us no choice at all
because of the dreaded consequence of the child doing badly in a
major examination at aged 12. Many parents feel their child's future
is determined by the PSLE. Many private schools globally already
through-train students from Primary to Secondary, including overseas
schools based on the Singapore curriculum. Some of these schools
have done well in international tests despite not subjecting students
to standardised examinations at Primary 6. Finland switched to such
a through-train system nationwide with encouraging outcomes. Its
PISA test scores are comparable to Singapore's.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-480a56e0-f15c-4bb8-bd73-0e9e4b2bccfc"><!--a--></a>I would like MOE to consider
piloting Primary through Secondary IP schools with the same level
of funding per student as any Government or aided school. With such schools, Primary education
need not be focused on grinding out results just for PSLE and schools
can spend more time on values-based education. The post-Primary
section will eventually prepare students for a recognised examination,
namely "O" levels, "A" levels or even the International Baccalaureate.
By that time, students are more mature and better able to handle
stress. Existing school groups may opt to run such a programme.
There are already aided schools in Singapore with affiliation schemes where
the majority of Primary students enter the affiliated Secondary
schools. Such schools have long histories and are trusted education
brands. They are potential candidates to kick-start the programme.
MOE has implemented holistic assessments since 2010. The experience
of holistic assessments can be incorporated to ensure the rigour
in learning throughout the years of studies in such pilot schools. </p>

                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, as I mentioned during the Budget debate, I believe
education in Singapore is increasingly becoming a positional good
that favours the well-to-do. Specifically, the PSLE examination
is marked on a bell curve; so there are winners and losers. You
can only get up if you force others to go down. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-31d310a1-6071-4988-8fc3-ae5af7484c32">
                  <a name="budget__id-31d310a1-6071-4988-8fc3-ae5af7484c32"><!--a--></a>The PSLE constantly forces
parents and teachers to work on, emphasise and reinforce the weaknesses
of children, which turns them off learning. The child's strengths
should rightly be emphasised instead. The system is too one-size-fits-all,
and does not fit the learning styles of many children. For example,
a child who is a kinaesthetic learner learns best through moving,
doing and touching. His or her learning gets compromised in our
current system. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e1c46cbe-c997-489d-ae99-42fced3ef88e">
                  <a name="budget__id-e1c46cbe-c997-489d-ae99-42fced3ef88e"><!--a--></a>There is a massive misallocation
of resources nationally. A high proportion of kids take tuition,
while poorer parents just do not have the resources to give their
children the extra help. I have estimated, using data from the Department
of Statistics' Household Expenditure Survey 2007/2008, that Singaporeans
are spending more than $820 million a year on tuition. This does
not include enrichment activities or the cost of homemakers spending
hours fetching their kids to multiple programmes, or parents essentially
sitting the PSLE examinations with their kids. What can $820 million
buy? More than 10,000 new teachers, with spare change to help renovate
schools to accommodate them.</p>

dislike the system but they are afraid to opt out and change their
existing practices. Some opt out by homeschooling their kids, but
MOE is now penalising those kids in Secondary school admission.
Some teachers have fed back to me that they, too, dislike the current
realities but feel helpless, while others resign either to teach
tuition, which is more lucrative, or to leave the education system
entirely. </p>

is how we are nurturing students for the future. I think the Minister
knows the issues. Employers are saying that our young are technically
very competent, but they lack passion, curiosity and a willingness
to try new things. I fear we are just going to be a nation of employees
and contractors, not entrepreneurs. </p>

on values and character education. But I think we need something
radically different. This is why I am suggesting that MOE consider
allowing an independent Primary school to be built from scratch,
so that we can experiment with a prototype Primary school for the
future that runs on an entirely different system.</p>

of the general demographic of our society so that it does not become

incorporate the best practices from our current system and other
systems, like the Finns' that Mr Yee has mentioned. I know the standard
reply is that our culture is different. But, Sir, our children are
born the same from a socio-cultural point of view. The synapses
in the brain are yet to be formed. It is us adults that make life
different for the children. </p>

instruction and abolish, I think, like Mr Yee said, standardised,
unified examinations within and outside the school like the Finns
have. I am not really fixated with the school being independent.
If MOE is willing to run the experiment on its own, within its own
control, that is fine, too. But what I am fixated on is a system
that is radically different because today's current dynamic is somewhat dysfunctional
and there is too much at stake to change the current system sufficiently from
within. </p>

effort is required to identify just 1% of the cohort. With centralised
GEP for Secondary schools already scrapped, much resources are now

three years. Based on the figures provided by MOE in a Parliamentary
Question (PQ) last month, the past 10 years' performance of GEP
students did not suggest that centralised GEP had generated better examination
results at PSLE and at "A" levels. We can continue differentiated
learning to develop students with stronger learning abilities. In
place of the current GEP, we can implement the following: </p>

own subject-based accelerated learning. Giftedness is often specific
to subjects as the child may be strong in one subject but average
in others. Schools can have their own methods to identify students
who are stronger in specific subjects and run accelerated learning
for these students. </p>

this trend is the Allied Educators Scheme that supports students

is the Pathlight Satellite School Model that integrates its senior
students with autism inside two mainstream buddy schools on a daily
basis, whilst supported by special educators. Both schemes are,
thankfully, well-supported by MOE and, though not perfect yet, are
very well appreciated, for MOE is moving in the right direction

they partake in non-academic activities, such as sports, music and
other CCAs; and common school events. This will not be the case
when the Normal (Technical) students are physically educated elsewhere.
NT late bloomers would not be able to move so readily to the NA and
Express streams. Not only do they now not study in the same classrooms,
they have lesser authentic opportunities to build identities and
bonds based on their strengths in non-academic platforms. This view
is even affirmed by Mr David Hoe, the top Normal (Technical) student
in 2005 and himself an LKY Award recipient.</p>

for the Minister's consideration:</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1fd81d87-0f76-45c4-aa3d-5a6793aa5cf0">
                  <a name="budget__id-1fd81d87-0f76-45c4-aa3d-5a6793aa5cf0"><!--a--></a>(1) Do not go ahead with
the plan to form the two Specialist Schools for Normal (Technical)
students. Do not. That is the path of least resistance – more efficient,
perhaps showing more academic results – but, certainly, non-inclusive
and box students way too early in their lives.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-388d8b94-1ff4-4f25-9fec-00b91e112612">
                  <a name="budget__id-388d8b94-1ff4-4f25-9fec-00b91e112612"><!--a--></a>(2) Pilot the design and
implementation of an Inclusive School Education Model that allows
for the co-education of students under one roof. Keeping to MOE's
base philosophy of "many pathways and peaks", make provisions for
customised programmes, education tracks to cater to the different
learning styles of the students. Consciously design common physical
and social space in non-academic pursuits, such as sports. Learn
from best practices in more inclusive school models, such as Darlington Education
Village in England and the Finnish education system, but localise,
where necessary, to create our uniquely Singapore model.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-87ea13ac-c4c8-4e32-9311-6aba5b1b0b64">
                  <a name="budget__id-87ea13ac-c4c8-4e32-9311-6aba5b1b0b64"><!--a--></a>(3) Next, extend the Satellite
School Model, currently practised by Pathlight School for autism,
to other special-needs groups, like the Down's Syndrome and the
hearing impaired and the visually impaired. The model which unpacks
integration to three levels – physical, social and academic – is
flexible enough for many special-needs groups. If academic integration
does not meet the education needs of the said students, then just stick
to physical and social integration. The "Many Helping Hands" approach
can still be deployed; and this Satellite School Model incorporates
the best of both mainstream and special education in terms of funding
and expertise.</p>

to enlarge and fund the Allied Educator Scheme to support milder
special-needs students in mainstream schools so that they can learn
even more effectively.</p>

2005. There is room to do more. Although there is now at least one

hire more AEDs, schools can leverage on the parents of students
with special needs. Some are stay-at-home mothers or fathers. By
being the primary caregivers, they have learnt how to handle their
own children. Some have attended courses on how to deal with challenging
behaviours. Schools can allow these parents, especially during transition
into Primary 1, to manage their children in class. I noted that
some schools do allow while others do not. I read an email from
a parent shadowing her Primary 1 child: "I am having a good time
shadowing Joshua. We still have challenges to overcome but the school,
principal, teachers and children, they are the best. Because of
that, Joshua is having a very good schooling experience, it helps him
a lot." Schools can even consider hiring these parents part-time
to assist other special-needs students. Some have left their jobs.
This can be a win-win arrangement. </p>

to encourage schools to generate innovative ideas of helping special-needs
students. I know of an aided school that will partner an external
service provider with autism expertise to provide intervention services
to special-needs students. Such initiatives are now left to the
schools and they find their own source of funds. We can establish
a special needs innovation fund where schools can apply to if they
have good programmes. </p>

society, we need to promote greater understanding of disability for
all students. Schools can strengthen the social emotional learning
of every student so that they can accept, learn and work with their
special peers. This can help build a generation with a heart for
the disabled. The special needs innovation fund can be used to fund
interaction activities of mainstream students with special-needs
community as well. </p>

Sir, the diversity of our Secondary school landscape provides ample
opportunities for our children to excel in niche areas even as they
receive a holistic education necessary to prepare them for their
future. These schools enable our education system to achieve "many
peaks of excellence". We have a number of Secondary schools offering
the Integrated Programme (IP) and the Gifted Education Programme
(GEP), and the four Specialised Independent Schools – the Singapore
Sports School, the School of the Arts, NUS School of Mathematics
and Science, and the School of Science and Technology. </p>

that we set up one more Specialised Independent School – for Mother
Tongues. It is important that we nurture a core group of young Singaporeans who
have an in-depth understanding of our region and biggest neighbours,
including China, Malaysia, Indonesia and India. Besides mastering
the Chinese, Malay and Indian languages,
the intensive programmes should also ground them in the understanding
of the history, geography, culture, literature, philosophy, politics
and socio-economics of these nations, while ensuring that they also
receive instruction in English and western culture. </p>

schools which offer the four-year Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese)
(BSP(C)) from Secondary 3 onwards which nurtures students in understanding
of both Chinese and Western cultures. Courses and electives offered
to BSP(C) students include Higher Chinese, Chinese Language and
Literature, China Studies in Chinese, Chinese history and philosophy.
In addition, the BSP(C) students may spend up to six months of immersion
in China and up to two weeks in a Western country.</p>

steps in the right direction. However, I would propose that we take
these programmes further and step up a few notches. At the other
four Specialised Independent Schools, we have no reservations about
allowing the students to immerse themselves in the training of their
niche areas starting at Secondary 1. There is no reason why we should
not adopt similar practices for Mother Tongues, particularly in
the light of the sheer sizes, complexities and the very long and
established histories of these countries that would be good to understand.
Furthermore, there are direct applications and benefits which the
graduates of such programmes can bring to the workforce and to the
country. These would include the realms of commerce and business,
and diplomacy, for both the private and public sectors. </p>

objective of this Fund and avoid obscuring the focus. To name it
a bilingualism fund reflects the desired outcome. The purpose of
setting up this Fund, as expressed clearly by Mr Lee himself, is
to enable our children to study Mother Tongue the earlier the better.
So, the focus of the Fund should be the learning of MTL, not "Bilingualism",
and certainly not the learning of English.</p>

not a small sum. It shows that Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the Government
have realised that Singapore is facing a serious language crisis.
From a bilingual, multi-lingual society that combines the advantages
of the East and West, our society is becoming an English-dominated
monolingual society. Now we have to invest heavily to salvage a
desperate situation. It still remains to be seen whether it is too

between national schools and <em class="ph i">madrasahs</em> are that firstly,
the <em class="ph i">madrasahs</em> have a religious curriculum in addition to
an academic syllabus that is similar to the one implemented in public
schools. Secondly, <em class="ph i">madrasah</em> students are made up of Muslim
students only while public schools comprise students from a multi-religious
and multi-racial background. Maybe these two factors are of a concern
to the Ministry of Education because these factors may undermine
the development of values stated earlier, that is, values that it
wants to inculcate in every Singaporean student. </p>

values will not be compromised and will still be applied in the
full-time <em class="ph i">madrasah</em> institutions. This is because the religious curriculum
taught in the <em class="ph i">madrasahs</em> heavily emphasises values of community
and cohesion, since the basic principle of Islamic knowledge is
to develop a person that will bring benefits to the public, especially
to the society in his resident country, regardless of race, language
or religion. </p>

issue of combating radical ideology that has been, and still is, going
on in Singapore. Religious leaders and religious teachers, mostly
graduates of full-time <em class="ph i">madrasahs</em>, have come forward as volunteers
in the form of the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) to provide
counselling to those who are beginning to be influenced or are already
radicalised, in order to uphold the common spirit and social cohesion

the main reasons why Muslim parents choose to send their children
to <em class="ph i">madrasah</em> institutions. Firstly, parents want their children
to master religious studies and they wish for their children to

parents want to inculcate Islamic values, specifically, in their conduct,

compassion. </p>

about the issue of covering one's modesty, that is, the use of the
headscarves for girls and long pants for boys. In early 2000, a
group of Muslim parents sent their daughter to a national school
wearing the headscarf but this was not allowed by the Ministry due
to certain reasons. Therefore, the <em class="ph i">madrasah</em> institutions
are the only avenue for Muslim parents to practise religious freedom,
as prescribed in the Constitution of Singapore. </p>

the six full-time <em class="ph i">madrasahs</em> in Singapore set out to be inclusive and
openly accepted the implementation of Compulsory Education without

inclusive society. Based on this inclusivity, I request the Government
to make a more meaningful assessment and reconsider the Edusave
scheme for full-time <em class="ph i">madrasah</em> students and, furthermore,
they are true Singapore citizens. </p>

commend the efforts of teachers and principals, and also the Ministry over
the years for having built this education system and also for putting

the neighbourhood, but a very good school in the neighbourhood which
focused on character building, value-based education during those days I was in
school, especially in the area of sports. So, I actually benefited.
I was very heartened to know that the Minister actually mentioned
about focusing in the direction of value-based education, character
building, and also that all schools in Singapore are good schools. </p>

that differentiate themselves – branded schools and neighbourhood
schools. In the past, it was just "top schools" and "other schools".
I was in those "other schools". But we never once felt any less
able or less proficient than the other students. Today, we have
branded schools and neighbourhood schools. One day, I was having
a dialogue with some young working adults. When I asked them what schools
they were from, some of them replied "loudly", I would say, and
quite prominently, wanted to showcase that they were from very good
schools and branded schools. But there were others who were actually
a little bit shy and said that "Oh, my school no longer exists."
When I probed a bit further, I then realised that they feel they were
"less proficient" and they were from the neighbourhood schools.
I think this neighbourhood school labelling, this connotation, has
in one way or another affected and influenced the behaviour of some
of our young working adults and students. As such, I was actually
quite heartened to know that the Minister feels that all schools
in Singapore are good schools. And I totally agree with that. </p>

the neighbourhood. In fact, I think all schools are in the neighbourhood;
so all schools are neighbourhood schools. Whether you are branded
or not, you are always in the neighbourhood. As such, I feel there
is a need, if possible, to slowly phase out this labelling of neighbourhood
schools. I want to ask the Ministry: are there any plans on how
we would manage this issue? Because if we want to align the schools
to be more value-based and less academic – or I would say still
academically-focused but more value-based – how do we get rid of
this connotation? Is there a way to do this and how do we manage
this issue? Moving forward, all students should be recognised and
treated in the same way, at the same level, and recognised for their abilities,
and different types of abilities at different levels.</p>

Tank that involves MOE, political and civil service leaders, parent

of the box; identify the triggers leading to this insatiable hunger
for more and more tuition; get rid of some high-stake exams and,
perhaps, even learn from the top-rated tutors in the industry. At
a macro level, the Think Tank will need to engage a larger population

Sir, the education received by children from low-income groups is
one of the best opportunities to move themselves and their families up
the economic ladder. This is the most egalitarian way to prevent
a permanent underclass. However, performance in school is determined
by many factors. Inherent capabilities and intelligence and home
environment all play important roles. Hence, if we want to ensure
social mobility, our schools may have to play a more proactive role than
providing lessons and preparing our children for exams. As a matter
of fact, children spend most of their waking hours in school, and
schools should be a great channel for the school system and teachers

be the first to notice such children. Missing textbooks, uncompleted
homework, crumpled school uniform, late payment of school fees are clues
that not all is well at home. I am aware teachers already have a
lot on their plate but I think we should have an infrastructure
and system for teachers to look out for these signs and then for
them to be able to coordinate with school counsellors to follow
up and investigate and, if necessary, help direct the families at
risk to the appropriate Government agencies, bodies or family service
centres to avail them of any social or financial assistance as soon
as possible. These problems have to be nipped in the bud. We are
all keenly aware of how difficult it can be to catch up on school
work. So, all these problems in the families should be looked into
as soon as we can.</p>

a mentoring programme was initiated to help children from families

a guiding adult and an environment to sit and do a few pages of
homework a day can mean the difference between continuing their
education and dropping out of school.</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
students from disadvantaged families face problems at home due to
a non-conducive environment. Sometimes, there is no suitable place
at home for them to study; sometimes, they face constant quarrels
amongst family members and – like what hon Ms Irene Ng says, sometimes,
the parent may be abusive towards them – some students may have
to work to help supplement their family income. For those in financial
difficulties, they struggle to pay for their meals, much less buy
books or supplementary materials to help in school work.</p>

situation, is MOE better able to support them? Can the teachers in
the schools pay more attention to these students and ensure that
they do not lose out due to lack of tuition? Is it possible for
teachers to do more in school so that there is lesser need for such
tuition? Many parents say that they resort to tuition because their children
cannot cope with school work. Some parents feel that the teacher
is not spending enough time on teaching and, hence, the need for
tuition as a supplement. Sir, in what ways can we make education
a social leveller such that children from disadvantaged families
have a fair opportunity to progress further in their education path?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, there
are 2,000 to 3,000 personal bankruptcies in Singapore per year.
The major reasons for poor financial health include abuse of credit
card, trading in stock market without professional advice and the
poor management of expenses. We can mitigate these social issues
by starting from a child's training days. One is never too young
to learn financial literacy. Children learn language, maths, science
and humanities in school. Outside school, parents enrol the children
for ballet, music, sports and so on. While these are beneficial,
one cannot neglect to teach a child how to manage their finances
in future.</p>

up Primary and Secondary school financial literacy courses. These
courses should focus on basic principles of savings and consumption.
Although they have the industry-led initiatives, such as MoneySENSE,
schools cannot find time to run such programmes. I would urge that
MOE consider prioritising financial management skills alongside
courses, such as moral education and social studies. By financial
literacy, I do not mean teaching kids the difference between a stock
and a bond. We can start with the importance of financial prudence
and building financial goals.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, after
completing my "A" levels, I applied to study Medicine in NUS but
I was not successful. At that time, I was very disappointed, and
felt worse when I realised that two of my classmates, an ASEAN scholar
from Malaysia and another from Hong Kong, whose "A" level results
were not as good as mine, were admitted. As I tried to console myself
that maybe NUS is distributing talents among faculties beyond Medicine
and wondered if I could have done better during my interview, I
could not understand why I, a Singaporean, was passed over for foreigners. </p>

for the EDB scholarship and I was fortunate that there are such
Government scholarships to allow Singaporeans like me to study for my
undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in London. In hindsight,
it probably turned out better for me. And for the record, my two
foreign friends have settled down in Singapore with their own medical
practice and have started their families in Singapore. </p>

student profile adds to the learning environment and helps the university
move up international rankings. However, I can understand why there
are sentiments and perceptions that Singaporeans are losing university
places to foreigners. Of course, there should be entry requirements
for each faculty, and not all applicants, including local applicants,
will make the grade, but we have probably moved too quickly in opening
up the quota for foreign students before new universities like SUTD
and SIT are able to meet the higher aspirations of our better-educated
young population.</p>

to fine-tune the scholarship scheme for foreign students and allocate
more resources to help needy Singaporean students and encourage
local students with deserving results. We should not turn off the
tap for foreign students or stop attracting global talents via scholarships,
but I hope the Government could moderate the numbers. </p>

for any scholarships, I recommend that we also follow new HR recruitment
practices to also look at their activities and comments in social media
as another avenue to assess the applicant. However, do not just
rely on Facebook. Do remember that in places like China, Facebook
is banned and platforms like <em class="ph i">weibo</em> and QQ are the platforms
to look out for.</p>

students are here in Singapore, we should make more deliberate efforts
to assimilate them better and more quickly in Singapore. I heard
that some varsity halls are fast becoming enclaves for foreigners
and, when there is a critical mass, it is very comfortable for anyone
to just socialise with their fellow countrymen. I propose that we
have home-stay accommodation for foreign students to live in HDB flats.
And for that, I do not mean renting the entire apartment with fellow
foreign students, but renting a room and staying with their Singaporean
landlords. If there is a programme to do such matching, it would
also help locals to monetise their flats with more rental income. </p>

have received heartfelt feedback and good suggestions from many
teachers, students, parents, the public and Members of this House.
There are many good ideas which we can implement. We should prioritise
and sequence them well. Changes made should be thoughtful and followed
through consistently. In my conversations with parents, some have
expressed that the system is overly competitive and stressful. Ms
Irene Ng mentioned this and so did Ms Denise Phua and others.</p>

many parents agree that we want to develop our children holistically.
We want them to have the values and character to do well in life,
to live in harmony, and to care for one another. We also want them
to have strong foundations to seize future opportunities and find
fulfilment and success. So how do we achieve this? First and foremost,
by holistic education, with values and character at the centre; second,
by creating opportunities for all, by ensuring that every school
is a good school; third, by ensuring as many as possible go on to
post-Secondary education, so as to build a strong foundation for
life-long learning and life-long success.</p>

A critical concern on every parent's mind would often be: "Will
education prepare my child for the future?", "Will she be able to
make a living and succeed?", "Will he be able to live his dream

minds in MOE as well.</p>

we live in is shifting very rapidly. A Primary 1 student entering school
this year will likely enter the workforce by around 2030 – into
a world that will be vastly different from today. To be future-ready,
education must develop the whole person. It is less about content
knowledge, as content will have to be re-learnt and even un-learnt
during one's lifetime. It is more about how to process information,
discern truths from untruths, connect seemingly disparate dots,
and create knowledge even as the context changes. It is about developing
an enduring core of competencies, values and character to anchor
our young and ensure they have the resilience to succeed. </p>

"I don't teach Physics; I teach students." Holistic education will
provide the foundation for a stronger and more united people. Developing

something which MOE has been doing over the years, as Mr Edwin Tong

play critical roles.</p>

Wei Neng emphasised the importance of learning in life using real-life
examples and incidents. I fully agree. Now, the Community Involvement Programme
(CIP) is an important part of CCE as it builds a spirit of volunteerism
so that students become active contributors and concerned citizens,
with empathy for fellow Singaporeans. We have thus reviewed how
CIP can be enhanced to allow students to demonstrate and develop
important values. After many years of efforts, almost all students
now participate in CIP programmes and learn valuable lessons - the
"learning in life" that we spoke of. Some schools are already going
beyond just participation, and have adopted Service-Learning approaches
or emphasised student-initiated CIP activities as this enables students
to take ownership and have meaningful experiences serving the community. </p>

across all schools on the inculcation of values through community
involvement, CIP will be reframed as "Values in Action" As part
of Values in Action, students will undertake personal and group
reflections. They will discuss their experience and the role that
they can play in the community. They will reflect on the values
that they have put into practice and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.
Such reflections will reinforce learning, make it more authentic
and help students internalise values. Curriculum time will be set

to develop four-year or six-year development plans in order to move
towards more coherent and sustainable learning through community involvement.
Students will be encouraged to choose community issues that they
are concerned about, understand the issues better, and then decide
on how they can make a difference in a sustained way. Development
will be done progressively. For younger students in Primary school,
they can start by taking responsibility for their own spaces in
class and at home. For our older students, they can initiate collective
action among their peers to improve the lives of others in school
and the community. </p>

of St Gabriel's Secondary School. St Gabriel's Secondary School
has a four-year plan guided by themes for each level, starting with "Love

in a focus on the elderly in Secondary 4 and 5. From learning to
take care of specific areas within the school, they progress to
service learning projects in the community thereafter. Students
do reflections in
their journals, and are given feedback by teachers on their development
in terms of life skills. </p>

a cornerstone of our education system. English will continue to
be a dominant working language internationally. Our Mother Tongue Languages

Contrary to Mr Low Thia Khiang's pessimism about the state of Mother
Tongue Languages, we are seeing more and more parents and students
placing great significance on the learning of Mother Tongue Languages.
And if you speak to many of our Singaporeans working in our region,
they are seeing that the fundamentals that they have built up over
the years, have served them very well. </p>

spending billions on tuition. Aspiring parents in the US and elsewhere
spend much to try and get their children into good colleges. </p>

To support this emphasis on student-centric and holistic education,
we will be making significant changes to the Edusave awards for which
I will elaborate later. </p>

what we consider to be a good school. A good school is not one that
is good relative to another, or good in purely academic terms. First
and foremost, a good school is one that cares for its students.
Therefore, it is one that studies and knows the needs, strengths
and interests of its students and motivates them to learn and grow. </p>

all students acquire strong fundamentals of literacy and numeracy
and develops them holistically, in character, knowledge and critical competencies.
A good school creates a positive school experience for each student, making
him a confident and lifelong learner. A good school has caring and
competent teachers who are steadfast in their mission to impact
lives. A good school has the support of parents and the community,
working together to bring out the best in our children. A good school
cares for and provides opportunities to all students, regardless of

support system, to ensure opportunities for all students. Going

middle-income families and through an integrated approach involving
five elements: first, significantly increase financial support for
needy students; second, resourcing schools to enrich the learning

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>Let me elaborate
on each of these. First, significantly increase the coverage of
financial support. Last year, MOE increased the coverage in quantum
of bursaries for post-Secondary education. This year, we will further
enhance support for needy students in two ways. The income limit
for eligibility for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) will
be raised from $1,500 to $2,500. We will also introduce a new per-capita
income (PCI) as a parallel assessment criterion to benefit students
from larger families.
This means that students from households with a PCI not exceeding
$625 per month will now be eligible. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2292</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e96895f3-2e21-4f4f-b5f0-113f399b8221">
                  <a name="budget__id-e96895f3-2e21-4f4f-b5f0-113f399b8221"><!--a--></a>For example, a family
of six comprising two children, two parents and two grandparents
living together, with a monthly income of $3,600 will now qualify.
These changes will benefit about 40,000 more students, double the
number today. We will also similarly introduce a Per Capita Income
criterion and update income tiers for the Independent Schools Bursary
(ISB), so that Independent Schools remain affordable to all. To
ensure our children start each day of school right, we have enhanced
support for the School Breakfast Programme (SBP) in Primary schools
so that each child on the FAS can have the right nutrition.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-f8575f05-38a2-4a03-a690-7af5e2ef3fe7"><!--a--></a>Now, while these financial
assistance schemes will cover most students, there will be circumstances
where some discretion is needed. Schools – who best know their students'
needs – will be given additional annual grants of up to $15,000
per school for the next three years every year. This will allow
schools to provide additional targeted support in specific ways
or to students who might have just missed the FAS criteria but are
deserving. </p>

help students from low-income families is to resource schools better
to meet the learning needs of these students. This could be in the
form of Learning Support Programmes, or co-curricular programmes
that can enrich their learning through the Opportunity Fund and
Trips for International Experience Fund. Our schools are creatively
using these opportunities to enrich learning and it has been heartening
speaking to many students who are inspired to excel after these
exposures. </p>

improving our Learning Support Programmes, which provide targeted
assistance for students weaker in literacy and numeracy. Our ongoing
research shows that these have worked well, and will allow us to
continue to improve the way we support students with weaker foundations
and to train our teachers and Allied Educators for these programmes. </p>

are also starting at pre-school. Aside from enhancing the quality,
affordability and accessibility of pre-school education, we have
also introduced FLAiR – or short for Focused Language Assistance
in Reading – which has helped some 6,000 students from disadvantaged
families level-up by increasing exposure to English. This year,
an additional 2,200 children will benefit from FLAiR. Minister of
State Lawrence Wong will update on the progress of our various initiatives in
pre-school. </p>

the coordination between schools and student care centres based
in schools. Student care centres provide additional supervision
and guidance to students after school. We will continue to improve
the quality, accessibility and affordability of school-based student
care centres (SCCs). To improve accessibility, we will increase
the number of school-based SCCs to 70 by the end of 2014, up from
57 currently. Schools that do not have an SCC can continue to make
use of community-based SCCs in their neighbourhood. We will enhance
the quality of school-based SCCs by strengthening the coordination
of the school's and SCC's programmes to align the support for students
from low-income families. MCYS will speak more about enhancements
to improve affordability of student-care later.</p>

community resources and other forms of support. Many schools are
strongly supported by their advisory or management committees, Community
Self-Help Groups, Clan Associations and other VWOs. They provide
bursaries and scholarships. Parent volunteers, too, play their part.
For instance, in Jurong West Primary School where they conduct recess
reading programmes. Initiatives by the corporate sector, such as
the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund and SembMarine SchoolBag
projects, have been running for years and have helped numerous children.
MOE will work with schools to enhance such support.</p>

achievements. We need to recognise the achievements of students
who do well and show resilience to overcome their circumstances.
I will elaborate on this later.</p>

support package to low- and middle-income families can be quite
substantial and would relieve some burden. But let me emphasise
that it is not just about money, but an integrated approach, addressing
financial, socio-emotional and learning support, in partnership
with parents and the broader community. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2c4d761d-afe3-480f-8527-048c7768a985">
                  <a name="budget__id-2c4d761d-afe3-480f-8527-048c7768a985"><!--a--></a>Let me provide an example
of how schools are making use of all these various measures and
the resources that MOE has been providing to creatively level-up
the students. I recently visited Kheng Cheng School, and saw how
their staff work hard to fulfil its founder's vision, I quote, "to
uplift the children in the community through education". Within
three days of a student joining the school, each form teacher makes contact
with the parent, and through this interaction is able to understand
her students better and can more actively reach out to needy students.
The school then adopts a comprehensive approach to the learning
of students from needy backgrounds, a point which Mr Baey asked
earlier. For students needing academic support – Kheng Cheng runs
effective Learning Support Programmes for Primary 1 and Primary
2 students weaker in literacy and numeracy. Now, this is an example
of a Learning Support Programme for Mathematics for Primary 1 students
and this class has seven students, a specialised programme to help
the students level-up in numeracy. There are similar classes for
the Learning Support for the learning of English. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2062c915-80fc-4c13-b94c-e7b0aeae3175">
                  <a name="budget__id-2062c915-80fc-4c13-b94c-e7b0aeae3175"><!--a--></a>Dr Intan would be pleased
to know that class sizes for these students are very small and,
in some Normal (Technical) course lessons, below 20. In many of
these schools, all below 16. I have seen one teacher to four students
in another school, helping the students to acquire the basics. Kheng
Cheng School continues to support those who need additional help
through Primary 3 and Primary 4, by creatively deploying its Learning
Support Coordinators to work closely with the respective Form Teachers
and Allied Educators. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3e741a80-170f-46ed-a04d-d1771526da12">

sustained at Primary 5 and Primary 6, where the school has arranged
for smaller class sizes for weaker students. As you can see in this
slide, a specialised class for the learning of English. Now, this
allows a continuum of help to be extended for students needing more
individualised attention. So, our schools are no longer the cookie-cutter
model that some of you might have the impression of.</p>

from special programmes and learning journeys which aim to build
up their self-esteem and increase their exposure. The school has
also organised overseas trips to China and Malaysia, and by tapping
on the Trips for International Experience and the Opportunity Fund,
it can provide higher subsidies to needy students, to ensure they
are not denied such opportunities. Let me emphasise that this is not just
happening in Kheng Cheng School, but in many other schools. As Ms Irene
Ng pointed out earlier, we must update the perceptions of parents. </p>

of students who need more support are those with special education
needs, whether in SPED schools or mainstream schools. In recent
years, we have been working to improve the quality of education
for these students, and will continue to do more. </p>

for students with dyslexia in our mainstream schools. At the same
time, we are doing more to integrate students with special needs
in our mainstream schools, with the deployment of more Allied Educators
and enhancing facilities for students with physical disabilities.
Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sim Ann will elaborate on these later.</p>

up students. Let me now touch on developing good schools across
the board, a point which Mr Lim Biow Chuan and several others have asked
earlier. Our approach is to develop good schools across the board,
not just a select few. We do this through: (i) resourcing schools
to offer customised programmes that best fit the needs of their
students, (ii) raising the professional standards of teachers across
the system, (iii) encouraging learning and innovation across schools,
and (iv) promoting partnerships between school and community. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e1cb6a0d-8a40-4ad9-8dd3-7e7a21362521">
                  <a name="budget__id-e1cb6a0d-8a40-4ad9-8dd3-7e7a21362521"><!--a--></a>First, resourcing schools.
Programmes, such as Holistic Assessment, Values in Action, Programme
for Active Learning (PAL) and bilingualism, are implemented across schools
and serve to build a strong foundation in holistic education for
all. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d8408abe-60f6-45d0-ad30-291c8674dbce">
                  <a name="budget__id-d8408abe-60f6-45d0-ad30-291c8674dbce"><!--a--></a>In addition, as part of
our student-centric approach in developing the varied interests and
abilities of our students, we have a variety of programmes in each
school, and a variety of schools across our system. For example,
one, to cater to different academic abilities and interests, we
have programmes such as the Learning Support Programme, N(T) Mark
II, Gifted Education Programme and the Integrated Programme. Various schools
also offer Applied Subjects, language elective programmes, Art and
Music Elective Programmes. Two, to encourage peaks of excellence
and allow schools to develop varied niches, we also have the Programme
for School-Based Excellence and Niche Programme. These niches can
be in terms of sports, aesthetics, national education or in cognitive
areas. Three, schools can also tap on funds such as "Time Out Fund"
and Opportunity Fund to support their initiatives to better engage
students. Four, we also have specialised schools catering to specific
talent in Arts, Sports, Mathematics and Science and Technology.
The Junior Sports Academies also nurture budding sportsmen and sportswomen.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1bb3713c-897c-4ba9-9596-ba7ca8e7af67">
                  <a name="budget__id-1bb3713c-897c-4ba9-9596-ba7ca8e7af67"><!--a--></a>We do not adopt a single
model in delivering these varied programmes in our schools. Rather,
our focus is on what is effective and developmentally appropriate. Some
programmes like the GEP, which Mr Yee Jenn Jong had spoken about,
require a centralised approach at the Primary level so that there
is a critical mass of students. What we learn in GEP is extended
to other high ability students who can benefit from it and I should
point out that it is not right to assess the success of the GEP
programme solely by the PSLE results. In fact, the GEP precisely
is to help develop different talents and different peaks of excellence
and allow a different form of learning.</p>

resourcing, across all schools and across all levels has been significantly
increased. We now have about 32,000 education officers, an increase
of 4,000 from five years ago. It is not just about more teachers,
but also better teachers – through more stringent selection and
professional development. </p>

new Allied Educator Scheme in 2009 and have grown the total number
of AEDs to 2,200 today. Ms Denise Phua will be glad to know we will
be further increasing this. This means that, over the past five
years, each school has, on average, about 10 more teachers. In addition,
each school now has an average of six Allied Educators. These additional
teachers and AEDs will further allow schools to benefit students
with a better learning environment and more customised experience.</p>

are levelling up across all schools is to raise the professional standards
of teachers. Teaching is a calling and it is about touching lives.
I know many of the teachers have gone beyond their call of duty
to go the extra mile for the students. In some cases, it takes hard
work and a long time before the students respond, yet, many teachers
do not give up. They stand testimony to the power of the mission
and make the learning experience meaningful to many of our students. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-22700385-accc-4fc3-986f-0f1eece255a6"><!--a--></a>A demonstration of this
calling in many of our teachers is the strong professional pride
teachers take in improving their craft. For example, since we started
the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST), almost 300 learning communities
have been established for teachers to learn from each other within
and across schools. The N(T) Professional Focus Group (PFG) is one
such platform where teachers expand their repertoire of strategies
to enrich their students' learning by learning from each other as
well as experienced practitioners and partners.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e076583c-2989-4eae-8809-eadec3007931">
                  <a name="budget__id-e076583c-2989-4eae-8809-eadec3007931"><!--a--></a>In addition, last year,
our teachers and Allied Educators collectively developed the ethos
of the teaching profession to signal their commitment to their calling.
With this dedication, it is no surprise that, every year, on Teachers'
Day, we see the outpourings of appreciation of the good work of
teachers by our students and parents. And I am very glad to receive
many emails commending the good work of our teachers. Sir, I want
to thank Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Dr Intan Azura as well as Ms Irene
Ng for the affirmation of the good work of our teachers earlier. </p>

are levelling up across all schools is to encourage learning and innovation
across schools. Schools share best practices through a variety of
platforms, including the annual MOE ExCEL Fest. For this year's
ExCEL Fest, over 20,000 educators, school staff and members of the
public will come together to share and learn about the many good
efforts and innovations in our schools. </p>

Platform was initiated at ExCEL Fest last year to facilitate collaboration
and diffusion of innovations across schools. Some interesting partnerships
were formed. For instance, Yishun Primary School shared its "Mobile Mind-mapping
iPod Touch Programme" with Raffles Girls' Primary School and Innova Primary
School. </p>

up when we help them to strengthen partnerships with parents and
the community. Over the past year, I have also had the opportunity
to meet many parents,
passionately involved in Parent Support Groups (PSGs) who asked
for greater support so they can do more. Senior Parliamentary Secretary
Hawazi Daipi will share more on what we do later. </p>

all schools, encourage innovation and help them form partnerships,
we now have greater diversity in our system to meet the varied interests and
learning profiles of our students. At the same time, we have been
able to maintain coherence and linkages across the system, and ensured
opportunities for all. </p>

about Primary 1 registration and getting their child into a good
school, a point that Mr Lim Biow Chuan has raised. We receive feedback
after every Primary 1 exercise and, for every rule that is currently
in place, there is feedback both for and against it. Now, if we
perceive that there are only a few good schools, no form of school
allocation can satisfy all parents. </p>

pointed out, a sustainable solution must lie in ensuring that every
school is a good school, and that parents perceive it as such. As
I have tried to show, many significant improvements are being made
across our schools. So, while we continue to consider the feedback,
our schools will make a concerted effort to reach out to parents
on the programmes they have and engage parents in developing our students
holistically. So, for now, let us concentrate on ensuring "every
school, a good school".</p>

debate, made interesting suggestions for more pathways and options.
Mr Baey Yam Keng, Mr Yee Jenn Jong, Mr Laurence Lien have suggested
more options. Mr Yee suggested having an Integrated Programme starting
from Primary 1. My concern would be that, far from removing pressure
at Primary 6, you will now transfer the pressure to Primary 1. South
Korea has abolished national examinations at the equivalent of Primary
6 but that has not taken away the pressure. Mr Laurence Lien and Mr
Yee Jenn Jong spoke about Finland – 40% of the students move on
to vocational track at Grade 9, equivalent to ITE. </p>

Mr Baey Yam Keng and Mr Yee Jenn Jong asked for diversity, Ms Denise
Phua was concerned about segregation and how that might have unintended
consequences. So did Dr Intan Azura, who raised concerns about segregation.
I agree with Mr Teo Ser Luck who said that we should not be apologetic about
neighbourhood schools. The truth is our schools are geographically
sited in our neighbourhood, so naturally they draw students who
are living in the neighbourhood. We have to ensure good schools
in every neighbourhood and not use the term "neighbourhood school"
as an apology. We must collectively change perceptions and change
mindsets, as Mr Edwin Tong mentioned.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5b5d4662-dc03-4ecf-82e9-eccba854962b">

suggestions. I gather, from your suggestions, certain common goals
of creating more options, choices, pathways as well as maintaining
a system that is inclusive and strengthens social cohesion. There
is merit in having greater diversity in our national school system
so that we can develop a range of talent better. And contrary to
what was mentioned by some Members earlier on, we do have, as I
tried to illustrate, many more options, many more pathways and a
greater diversity across our system, both within schools – where
even within the single school, the profiles of the pupils are different
and schools do their best to reach out to these different learning
profiles and customised
programmes for them, whether it is through PAL, learning support
and in bilingualism, and so on, and other forms of programmes. At
the same time, they are reaching out to students to help them to
develop socio-emotional competencies. So we have a variety within
schools and across schools. </p>

Phua and others that it is important to be inclusive. As in our
schemes, the key is implementation. Ultimately, being inclusive
is about giving each child the best opportunity to realise his or
her potential and, in turn, be able to fully participate in the
workplace and in society thereafter. In other words, focus on educational
outcome.</p>

of setting up NorthLight School (NLS). When we set up NorthLight
School in 2007, it was both a bold innovation and also a leap into
the unknown. The outcomes from its first batch of graduates are
encouraging – attrition has fallen to 10% compared with 60% for
this group of students previously, with 75% of the cohort graduating
with an ITE Skills Certificate, which prepares them for ITE or to
enter the workforce. </p>

show a measurable improvement in their maturity and their ability
to handle relationships with others. NorthLight has taken this group
of students who have not passed their PSLE, levelled them up and
made social mobility real for them – over 60% of NLS graduates have
achieved qualifications higher than at least one of their parents.
I have read the statements of many of the students, teachers and
others involved and I would say that it is a touching experience. </p>

has several winning elements, not least of which, the commitment

NorthLight has unlocked the potential in its students. </p>

corporations, it has provided an opportunity for other Singaporeans
to do their part for their fellow citizens. In all, it was an innovation
that is truly trail-blazing and gave us confidence to try out other
good ideas, including the setting up of two Specialised Schools
for Normal (Technical). These schools are additional options available
to our students. While some will give the new schools a try, the
vast majority of our N(T) students will continue to study in existing
secondary schools.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-12bcc142-5fb5-4f6e-bade-154cfedf5a24"><!--a--></a>Dr Intan Azura raised
the issue of SAP schools and Mr Baey Yam Keng suggested having a
school that focuses on the learning of languages and culture. Indeed,
we have SAP schools to provide a school-wide environment conducive
for the acquisition of the Chinese language and culture. We have
similar provisions for students who wish to learn Malay and Tamil
to a higher level, but these are implemented in different ways in the
form of programmes within schools or at the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language
Centre. Many good schools also have minority students and they thrive
in those environments.</p>

sentiments and our SAP schools will need to continually find ways
to enhance integration. Indeed, as we create more pathways, we must
continue to emphasise integration. For example, to enable students
to interact across schools, students from Hwa Chong Institution
work with students from various partner schools, such as Chestnut
Drive Secondary, Assumption English School, Westspring Secondary and Whitley Secondary
in a Racial Harmony Programme. Students jointly undertake a series
of activities over three months, including organising ethnic-themed
bazaars and performances. This gives students an opportunity to
interact with friends from other schools and, in the process, learn
about the various cultures. I am confident that our schools, including
SAP schools, will evolve their ways of enhancing integration as
part of our inculcation of values. </p>

to Edusave awards. Last Saturday, the media highlighted the achievements
of several "A" level students. Jason Chua was an EM3 student, went
on to Millenia Institute, and now aspires to study law. He shared
that he was motivated to study hard when his mother, a single parent,
was retrenched. Desmond Toh, from Hwa Chong Institute, despite being
of modest means, and having to be hospitalised a few times last
year, overcame that to be one of the top students this year. Yang
Xin Yi of Tampines Junior College showed resilience in the face
of her father's stroke. It spurred her on to do well and she did
well enough to pursue a life sciences degree at NUS.</p>

of students who excelled well beyond their studies. R R Pravin, who
was from ACS (Independent), is a gifted writer and wrote an award-winning
novel when he was 15, winning an award at the United States of America's
Best Books Award in 2008. He showed perseverance and overcame difficult
family circumstances, being from a single-parent family. </p>

entered Jurong Secondary as an N(A) student but, through hard work

the "O" levels. She was also a passionate volunteer who never forgot
the community despite her own obstacles. </p>

students whom I have met was Syasya Rifqah, winner of The New Paper
Schools Sports Star Award, from Teck Whye Secondary, who took care
of her family at a young age. And despite that, she led her school
to win multiple hockey and floorball titles. She was the captain
of the floorball team and was consistently a top student as well. </p>

achievements in our ITE students, too. Shuner Leong, who won the

that our principals and teachers, and in fact many of us have also
come across, who are not in the newspaper headlines or the media
headlines, but who have shown great determination. Now each of these
is a heart warming story of tenacity, grit and resilience. Each
is also an example of how character building, through school culture,
CCA and community service, enables our students to build confidence,
leadership ability and a sense of service. While they may be young,
they are already contributing to their families, and our community
and country. We celebrate their journeys, and congratulate them
on their successes. </p>

diverse home backgrounds and circumstances. But all of them, together
with their parents, have these things in common: they value education, they
believe in developing character, and they seek to achieve success
in their own ways, making full use of the pathways in our education
system. They show us the importance of a values-driven, student-centric
education. We must continue to encourage and support our students
and their parents.</p>

last reviewed in 2009. Today, our Edusave Awards are tilted towards
academic achievements. As we place more emphasis on holistic education
and character development, it is timely that we align our recognition framework.

who have shown exemplary values, character and civic responsibility
through their actions; who strive to overcome the odds; who excel
in academic and non-academic areas; and who display leadership qualities. </p>

details. First, we will introduce a new Edusave Character Award.
This will allow schools and ITE to recognise students who exhibit
exemplary values, such as resilience and tenacity, integrity, care
and respect, as well as civic responsibility. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d113c86a-a09b-4813-b1d1-63575f336a78">

with our emphasis on Character and Citizenship Education, and is
expected to recognise up to 10,000 students each year. Some of our
schools already have their own awards to recognise such students,
and the new Edusave award will serve to affirm that this is the
right way to go.</p>

give out EAGLES award. EAGLES is short form for Edusave Awards for
Achievement, Good Leadership and Service. We must continue to encourage
students to develop leadership skills and a sense of service, and
to pursue excellence in non-academic areas. Hence, we will double
the number of EAGLES awards and raise the value of the award. This
will signal a greater emphasis on developing the whole person. </p>

the income ceiling for Edusave Merit Bursary from $4,000 to $5,000
and introduce a new Per Capita Income Criterion of $1,250. The Edusave
Merit Bursary aims to encourage students from families of modest
means to persevere and do well. Last year, about 30,000 students
benefited from this. By raising the income ceiling and introducing
a per capita income criterion, we expect more students from lower middle-income
families, as well as larger families, to benefit. An additional
10,000 students are expected to benefit. </p>

the tiering of Edusave scholarships – so as not to have such a fine
distinction between the top 5% and 10% of academic performers. There

excellence. </p>

what Mrs Chua Yen Ching, the founding Principal of NorthLight School,
had shared with me: "In NorthLight School, the students used their skills
to render service to senior citizens staying around the school.
One group of students noticed that there was only one light bulb
in one of the homes. They fixed another light bulb so that even
if one light bulb were to blow, the house would not be in complete
darkness. The elderly man told the students: 'Today, you light up
my house, tomorrow someone will light up your lives.'"</p>

to have met many committed teachers over the recent months, who
work hard to nurture the students under their care and display this heart
ware. But I also know that teachers cannot be a substitute for parents.
I have also met many loving parents who want to do the best for
their children. Let us work together – we will deliver the best
education to our young, so that they, too, in time, will light up the
lives of those around them.</p>

Mr Chairman, our 2012 Budget featured a lot of emphasis on the continued
improvement of our human capital, especially on productivity and
innovation. But for that to work, our education policy needs to
be in sync with these goals. For our children and our future workforce
to stay ahead and to stay relevant, maybe our education system can
be stretched further, and we can perhaps look to test some new models.
I have mentioned the collage model in my last speech. I will briefly
mention it again today, and I also want to bring up the Finnish
model.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c1f0c520-35f5-4b47-9dc7-1d1530354490">

I stressed the need for our children to learn to innovate, collaborate,
think critically and also work effectively in an international environment.
So far, our methods of teaching may have been a little bit too linear.
As we grow up and enter the workforce, we are also a little bit
linear in the way we think and the way we act. The various examples
cited by my fellow Members of the House including very competent
professionals in Singapore who are able to work very well on their
own, do not seem to be able to collaborate or work effectively together
in teams. This is perhaps an outcome of our education system. Hence,
I introduced to the House to collage, which is a collaborative method
of teaching. It intertwines these different disciplines and it helps
the children to understand the relevance of what they are learning
and yet think innovatively and work collaboratively with each other
at a very young age.</p>

this very successful programme did surface it to the Ministry of
Education, to the Curriculum Planning and Development Division. Unfortunately,
Mr Chairman, Sir, the Ministry did come back with some comments
but no real follow-up. So I would urge the Minister to revisit this.
Whilst I understand and sympathise with the resource and space constraints
faced by the MOE, perhaps the Minister can look into this new method
of teaching and consider using even a distilled version of it in
Primary schools so that our children can benefit.</p>

other Asian countries produce great test scores. But have we looked

creative play and a lot of critical thinking. Finland is highly regarded
as an education superpower because of its apparent emphasis on equality
in its education system and, as I said, produces leading scores.</p>

let us not forget that we want to create citizens who are willing
and able to collaborate, innovate and think critically.</p>

Mr Chairman, I am heartened by Minister Heng's announcements of
the various initiatives to realise a holistic education that enables
our children to be future-ready. We have indeed invested in education
to equip our young people with future-relevant skills underpinned
by strong values. Singapore's education system is well admired and
scores highly in global rankings, such as PISA. While we have made
headway, we must make deeper investments for the future. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d73023e7-68b4-4026-9d69-2a4387bad6d1">

speech at Singapore Management University, Minister Heng shared
about employers' comments that Singapore's students seem to lack
drive and the confidence to venture out of their comfort zone. Yet,
these are the essential qualities for success in the competitive
global playing field. It has led me to ponder these questions: what
are some meaningful outcome indicators that show how well our education
system is nurturing our young for the unpredictable future? Besides international
rankings, are there measurable outcomes to indicate if our young
ones are indeed well prepared to meet challenges beyond academic
excellence? For example, will they be able to adapt nimbly to changes
and new demands brought about by global forces? Today, the playing
field for our young Singaporeans entering the workforce is being
re-drawn at a faster pace. Technology can make today's jobs obsolete
tomorrow. Thirdly, what benchmark should we set to give our children
the foundational skills that will prepare them for life? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c8179018-d321-4a28-a07d-26f2891d7223">

consider benchmarking our education efforts against the following
three indicators? Number one, our students' degree of self-motivation.
This inner desire is the engine house for lifelong learning. The
self-directed learner gains confidence and has the drive and curiosity
to explore and discover new things. Number two, state of mental
and emotional well-being in our students. Having a healthy mental and
emotional state will help our young people meet future challenges.
The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) revealed that more than one
in 10 Primary school students here had emotional and behavioural
problems in 2010. As pressure from studies and stresses of life
become an unbearable burden not only for children, and parents suffer,
our society and economy will also be adversely affected in the long
run. Lastly, a measure of outcome to consider is the love for learning.
This is the joy found in the pursuit of learning for learning's
sake. A passion for learning is a lifelong skill that will stand
our children in good stead. Even as adults today, we continue to
learn, unlearn and relearn.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-90a7e045-ea99-48f0-a6be-2699ef231cf6"><!--a--></a>I believe that MOE has
placed great emphasis on making our children future-ready. The three
benchmarks I have suggested are part of the skills and value that
MOE aims to impart. When our young ones are healthy, self-motivated
and armed with a lifelong love for learning, they will have the
confidence and agility to innovate and meet tomorrow's challenge.
To this end, if MOE can monitor and regularly review these three key
outcomes, it will help us stay on course and provide an education
for life and a better future.</p>

                  </span>:
Thank you, Mr Chairman, Sir. I thank Minister Heng for his earlier
address on our education system which focused on holistic, values-driven
and character development in our education system. I believe that
those core precepts and values are equally applicable to our early
childcare education.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2304</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-78bce5b1-de9f-47e9-ba24-f0c1a82f2eff">
                  <a name="budget__id-78bce5b1-de9f-47e9-ba24-f0c1a82f2eff"><!--a--></a>Pre-school education should not merely
be an extension of formal school system where numeracy and literacy
skills get emphasised at the expense of other developmental goals.
But I do believe that, in Singapore, we could do more to start the process
of inculcating core values and character development from an early
age. It is generally recognised that children between the ages of
three and seven have a strong developmental and cognitive ability
and that this can best be nurtured through play and interaction
at those ages. The pre-school years are thus a very critical period
for the development of our children. They lay the foundation for
our children's education, prior formal schooling. There have already
been recent movements by the Government to recognise and accredit
pre-school education through the efforts of SPARK and MCYS. Indeed,
it remains not compulsory, nor is pre-school curriculum currently
being regulated by the Government.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-51f43043-9ee5-49a4-8602-9d6ddb4f7327">

the Ministry consider developing and prescribing a curriculum for
pre-school education much along the lines of the models that we
have been talking about which are being developed for the Primary,
Secondary and tertiary school education systems? Sir, in particular,
as part of accrediting good-quality pre-schools, could the Ministry
also consider building and introducing character development programmes
which start a child's pre-school years?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a867654a-2508-44b3-867f-a50201eb3ce8">

mentioned earlier, our teachers are instrumental in the education
of our children. In that context, would the MOE also consider doing
more and investing more in training and equipping our pre-school
teachers so that they are better able to help our children in their
development of character and holistic values and concepts and in
building a strong value system at that age? Those are the formative years
of the child's learning and I feel we should not lose the opportunity
to seed the foundation of good-quality values and encouraging strong
moral fibre in our children from that time.</p>

However, I do not run kindergartens which are beneficiaries of this
proposal. MOE has earmarked $290 million to be spent on pre-schools

The intent is good. Investment should spread evenly to all participants

school fees affordable.</p>

for eligible kindergartens ranging from diploma to masters. Besides
the PAP Community Foundation, how many scholarship places have been
used by other kindergartens so far? MCYS has scholarships available
to all childcare centres, including private ones. Will MOE extend
these scholarship programmes to private operators too? We can attract
good educators into the industry through pre-service scholarships
that allow scholarship holders to work for any MOE-registered kindergartens
for a minimum period after graduation.</p>

awards some 1,070 undergraduate scholarships each year to foreign

four cohorts of students at any time, this is a large yearly expenditure.

Any scholar, local or foreign, should aim to graduate with at least
Second Upper. I am sure PSC sets high standards for our own local
scholars. If we cannot attract good enough foreign scholars, we
should immediately cut intake by 33% to admit only those with potential
for high honours. If scholars do not maintain the cumulative GPA good
enough for Second Upper, during their course, scholarship should
be suspended until they do well enough again. I hope MOE can explain
its criteria for selecting foreign scholars and review this decades-old
policy to see how many foreign scholars we actually need, how we can better assimilate
them into our society and how to better engage them after graduation.</p>

I am heartened by the Government's move to provide more opportunities
and pathways for Singaporeans to obtain a university education.
Our young people's aspirations and talents will inadvertently shape
the nation's future. The Committee on University Education Pathways
was formed to study and recommend ways to extend the university
sector. This strategic sector develops the necessary human capital
and equips Singaporeans with the skills and knowledge needed for
our economy. One of the committee's tasks is to look at how the
Cohort Participating Rate (CPR) can be extended to 30% by 2015.
Can I ask the MOE to provide an update on this, are we on track
to achieve this and what are its implications and effects?</p>

Straits Times</em> reported that a plumber in China earns five times
more than a fresh graduate there. The phenomenon is a worrying one,
not just for China but globally – where many young graduates find
it difficult to get the jobs they want and end up with lowly-paying
jobs. Some graduates become domestic workers in Shanghai. It is,
indeed, a sad situation of "axed-piration", where young aspirations
are being axed in the bud right after graduation. Over in Britain
today, one in four youngsters aged 16 to 24 years old have trouble
landing a job. The reasons for this situation in China and Britain
are bountiful. There are no easy answers or quick solutions as to
how governments can assure a perfect match between the skills that
employers want and the skills that our young graduates have.</p>

undergraduate degree programmes and exclude those who go overseas

then be centrally higher than those covered under this 30% CPR growth.

there enough graduate level jobs to accommodate the future increase
in graduates, and how do we avoid problems that other countries
are facing in terms of graduate underemployment and unemployment?
To this end, can we learn from the general model of apprenticeship
that has been successful in providing the young people with the
skills for employment? Will deploying more practice-oriented pedagogy
equip our students with more industry relevant skills? And can we
enhance and build
strong linkages with industries and professions to boost good employment outcomes?
Let us all do more to future-proof our young generations so that
they have a good chance of realising their aspirations.</p>

Singapore to have a sufficient number of good quality Singaporean

Sir, many Singaporeans aspire to have a degree. During my recent

4-year degree course at a private educational institution (PEI)
could be as high as $75,000. As his daughter could not get into
a local publicly-funded university, the cost of tertiary education
is a heavy burden to the family. </p>

sum of money. So, I did a quick scan on the Internet to check the
tuition fees charged by the various reputable private educational
institutions in Singapore. Indeed, $75,000 is at the higher end
of the range. The average is about $30,000 for business or business-related

family in Singapore, and they are not assured if they are getting
quality education from the PEI. </p>

could update us on the preliminary recommendations by the Committee
to Review University Education Pathways beyond 2015, particularly
if there are plans to certify the quality of the undergraduate courses
offered by PEI. Such plans, if implemented, would give the students
a better sense whether the courses offered by PEI are of value for
money. It could also pave the way for the Government to subsidise
some of the certified courses so that Singaporeans can have more
choices to obtain a degree with the help of the Government. At the

as higher order competencies, such as creativity, innovation, collaboration, communications
and cross-cultural awareness. Our post-Secondary institutions must
thus continually adapt. </p>

words on ITE. Since VITB was transformed into ITE in 1992, it has embarked
on a series of five-year strategic plans. The latest is in establishing
the "One ITE System, Three Colleges". We have invested in the state-of-the-art

also undergone significant changes in the past two decades. We established
two new Polytechnics during this period – Nanyang Polytechnic in
1992 and Republic Polytechnic in 2002. Today, our five Polytechnics
offer a broad range of courses and are well-regarded by employers
for equipping their students with practical, applicable and relevant

experiences for their students, be it in international competitions
across various domains, or in overseas experiences.</p>

ST Aerospace as a trainee senior technician in 2002 after graduating
with a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering. He underwent a one-year
technician training with the company and was subsequently enrolled
in ST Aerospace's four-year Certificate in Aircraft Maintenance

                  </span>: Mr Chairman, Minister Heng has spoken
about the need to equip our students with the right skills and values,
and to provide them with ample opportunities to fulfil their promise
and succeed in life. In this regard, let me speak about two vital
sectors – pre-school and tertiary or post-Secondary education. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-be11db0c-67f4-4acf-a807-9abfcb37748d">
                  <a name="budget__id-be11db0c-67f4-4acf-a807-9abfcb37748d"><!--a--></a>Let me start with post-Secondary
education. Here, our system is flexible and differentiated according
to the interests and talents of our people. Our students have multiple
entry and exit points, as well as various options in their learning
journey. Those who prefer a more academic pathway can go to the
junior colleges, and then articulate to the Universities. Those
who prefer a more practice-based education can go to the Polytechnics
or the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7da9687e-920e-47f0-a4c0-2868d0d758ba">

the importance of investing in the Polytechnics and ITE – "our crown
jewels of higher education", as he put it. I fully agree with him.
Both the Polytechnics and ITE are attractive options to meet our
students' educational preferences
and needs. They open up many possibilities for both personal and
career fulfilment and success. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-31c8701e-87a6-47a6-b5df-8f2fc888ca2c"><!--a--></a>After about 10 years of
broad education, some students are keen to experience a mode of
learning where they can clearly see the link between theory and
application. Not surprisingly, every year, about a third of "O"
Level students who qualify for junior colleges choose the polytechnic
route instead. Temasek Polytechnic's Ms Teh Zi Yun is one such student.
She has a strong interest in the hotel industry, and instead of
going to a junior college, as she could have done, she is now studying
Hospitality and Tourism Management at Temasek Polytechnic, which
she finds "more enriching and relevant to her work life". </p>

also offer students multiple pathways to develop their potential.
In the past, attending these institutions meant heading straight
into the workforce. Today, students have more options. Many ITE
graduates continue their education in the Polytechnics. Similarly,
many Polytechnic graduates want to progress to Universities. And
that is why we established the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT),
so that more Polytechnic students can get a publicly-funded university
degree. </p>

their studies, advancing directly into the workforce remains an
attractive path for many students. More than nine in 10 graduates
secure employment within six months of graduation. They get to apply
their knowledge and skills, and gain a clearer sense of where their
passions and talents lie. After working a few years, they can still
upgrade their skills in their preferred fields. </p>

ITE students enjoy these opportunities because of the quality education
they receive. Minister Heng talked about the various learning pedagogies
that our institutes are applying to enhance the learning environment.
Another important feature of our Polytechnic and ITE education is
the close linkages these institutions have with industry. This ensures
that our students have ample opportunity to equip themselves with
valuable skills relevant in today's global economy. For example,
ITE partners a wide range of local and international companies,
from Cisco to Sembcorp Marine, so that students can pursue recognised
industry and professional certifications, undertake jointly-developed
courses, or participate in practical attachments and internships.
The Polytechnics and ITE also regularly introduce new programmes
in tandem with changes in the economy. This year's offerings include
diplomas in sports coaching and mobile software development; and
ITE certificates in aerospace engineering and info-communications.</p>

the Polytechnics and ITE are doing more to provide holistic education
for their students, something which Mr Zainudin Nordin mentioned
as well. We are getting our students to think creatively, work collaboratively,
and communicate effectively. We are also giving them more opportunities
for overseas exchanges and community projects, so that they are
imbued with sound character and values. Last year, for example,
30 students from ITE College East visited the Al Husna Orphanage
in Surabaya, Indonesia. The students undertook various tasks, like resurfacing
roads and plastering toilets, to improve the living conditions of
the orphanage. In the process, they gained a stronger sense of what
it means to contribute to the community, and further developed their
character and resilience, as well as leadership and team spirit. As the students
later shared, their experience had "opened up their minds and views
to the opportunities to contribute to society as a whole."</p>

have proven that there are multiple pathways to success. According

their "willingness to learn €¦ they can pick up skills and knowledge

successfully started their own enterprises. For example, Mr Sivachandran,
who was previously an ambulance driver in Comfort Ambulance, went
on to ITE for his NITEC in Nursing. After graduating, he started
his own ambulance service company. Mr Siva said, "The ITE Certificate
is very well-recognised, and has enabled me to pursue my dream.

them to give our students a solid grounding to pursue their goals.
Our spending per ITE and Polytechnic student has risen by more than
50% in the last decade to about S$12,000 and S$15,000 respectively.
Let me assure Members that MOE will continue to invest in these
institutions, to keep them on the cutting edge, and to give our
young people the best possible vocational and technical educational experience
they can get anywhere in the world. </p>

the University sector, and address some of the issues raised by Members,
including Ms Low Yen Ling and Mr Ang Wei Neng. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ba20732b-65f1-412b-bac2-efc2a3c6fa46">
                  <a name="budget__id-ba20732b-65f1-412b-bac2-efc2a3c6fa46"><!--a--></a>Many young Singaporeans
aspire to go to University, as mentioned by Mr Ang. I see this in
my interactions with students and parents too. We are, therefore,
expanding publicly-funded University places over the next few years,
so that more Singaporeans can obtain a University degree. Last year,
12,000 Singaporeans were admitted into our Autonomous Universities
and the Singapore Institute of Technology. By 2015, we expect to
add another 2,000 University places for Singaporeans, equivalent
to the size of one additional SMU. We are kick-starting this increase
by adding over 1,000 University places for Singaporeans this year. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ee4ca340-487b-424f-9fc3-ea2e48593c6b">
                  <a name="budget__id-ee4ca340-487b-424f-9fc3-ea2e48593c6b"><!--a--></a>As we increase the number
of University places for Singaporeans, we will also continue to
monitor and control the intake of international students. Mr Yee
Jenn Jong and Mr Baey Yam Keng both spoke about this, and I understand
their concerns. It is something that we are watching very closely,
both in terms of the number and the quality of the students, and
we will be doing more to improve the integration of international
students on campus. Through the steps that we are taking, the international
students, including the scholars, will form a smaller proportion
of our student body over time. But let us manage this process carefully
and find the right balance. International students do contribute
to our Universities and add to the diversity of student life. I
think these are points which Members also acknowledge. Having international
students study alongside Singaporean students also helps our students form
links to the wider world, opening up new opportunities to the exciting
range of life experiences available to them. </p>

leveraging on external networks, our universities have succeeded
in attracting and retaining outstanding researchers and professors
from around the world, and in preparing our own students for global
careers. Today, NUS, NTU and SMU have built up strong reputations,
and are highly regarded by Singaporeans and employers at home and
abroad. Our fourth and newest university, the Singapore University
of Technology and Design (SUTD), will welcome its first batch of
students next month. SIT, along with its overseas partners, offers
yet another option for students, adding seven new programmes to
its existing 17, including in aerospace and early childhood education. </p>

developments, we believe that there is scope to further enhance the
University sector. I now chair a Committee studying how to provide
even more opportunities for University education. Over the past
six months, we have consulted widely and received much public feedback.
We also visited several countries to study their systems. I thank
those who have given us their suggestions, and would like to take this
opportunity to provide an interim update on my Committee's work,
and may I emphasise that these are still preliminary recommendations.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a4bd2083-c4ae-455e-a6de-ed5f3c1eda3e">
                  <a name="budget__id-a4bd2083-c4ae-455e-a6de-ed5f3c1eda3e"><!--a--></a>First, we recommend expanding
the University sector to cater to a wider spectrum of students while
maintaining the quality and standards of University education in Singapore.
As our economy grows in scale and sophistication, we will need more Singaporeans
with high-level skills. We also want to meet the strong aspirations amongst
young Singaporeans for a degree education. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-53d83d4a-6ae8-4610-a9ac-4c87ba0c8a5e">
                  <a name="budget__id-53d83d4a-6ae8-4610-a9ac-4c87ba0c8a5e"><!--a--></a>How far should we go in
expanding the state-funded university sector? One way is to benchmark
ourselves against other countries. Currently, about 27% of every
cohort goes to our publicly-funded Universities and this proportion
is expected to increase to 30% by 2015. Our provision for state-funded
degrees is already more generous than many of our Asian neighbours,
including the most developed amongst them, like Japan, Hong Kong and
South Korea, as this chart illustrates.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c514ec44-0410-4bf2-b94a-84dc8747212e">
                  <a name="budget__id-c514ec44-0410-4bf2-b94a-84dc8747212e"><!--a--></a>At the other end of the
spectrum, state-funded university participation rates tend to be
higher in Europe. Naturally, their citizens pay higher taxes to
enjoy highly-subsidised and broad access to universities. But there
are risks to raising university participation too rapidly. Often,
standards are diluted, and degrees are devalued. Then, far from graduates
acquiring valuable skills, they become under-employed, or worse, unemployed.
These were points which Ms Low highlighted earlier. For example,
the <em class="ph i">New York Times</em> reported last year that in Spain, Portugal
and Italy, almost one out of every four graduates cannot find a
job after leaving college. Indeed, we have also received feedback
from many Singaporeans, including from university students and alumni,
who worry that we may be going too far in expanding university places.
One member of the public wrote in through the MOE website to say
that we "should be very cautious in expanding university places,
and not jeopardise existing opportunities and the interest of individuals". </p>

University education are also associated with wastage and inefficiencies.
We saw this when we visited Finland and this is what their officials
told us. When we
were at Finland's University of Helsinki, for example, we learnt
that the average student takes almost seven years to complete a
degree. And because the places in these universities are taken up
by what they call "eternal" students, it creates a bottleneck for
new students, who have to wait around one to two years before they
can actually matriculate. Meaning to say, you apply, you have a
place, but you still have to wait one to two years before you can
actually start your studies in the university. And, meanwhile, while
around 65% of each cohort enters the Finnish universities, the attrition is
high, and only about 40% actually graduate. So, when you saw the
charts earlier, with high participation rates, these do not account
for attrition. Even with a high participation rate of 65%, the actual
attainment rate is only about 40%. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2315</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-c4444a46-38ba-4e01-84c5-94c66b3760ae"><!--a--></a>I have highlighted these
international comparisons just to give us a sense and perspective
of where we stand and how far we want to go. I think another useful indicator
to look at domestically is the proportion of high-skilled jobs in
our economy. Today, about a third of our resident workforce is employed
in professional, managerial and executive (PME)-type jobs. This
is a significant increase from a decade ago. As we restructure our
economy over the next decade, the profile of industry and jobs will
also change. PMEs will be the fastest growing segment of our workforce,
and so we can expect growing demand for graduates with high-level
skills. University participation rates for Singapore will, therefore,
have to increase correspondingly. </p>

broad considerations that will shape our thinking. The Committee
will continue to study this issue and seek public feedback to work
out how far to expand the university sector while maintaining quality
outcomes for the benefit of our students. </p>

places, we also need to think about developing new pathways for
entry into university. We want to add to the diversity and dynamism
of the university sector, and provide students with more choices
to develop and grow. Today, our publicly-funded universities are
largely research-intensive. Other countries, however, have a more
balanced mix – they have research universities as well as teaching
universities that are practice-oriented and share close links with
industries. Diversifying our mix of universities will increase the
routes and options that our students are able to take for entry
into them. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d17ab45e-f080-4ae7-91d8-59d8acc03db3">
                  <a name="budget__id-d17ab45e-f080-4ae7-91d8-59d8acc03db3"><!--a--></a>In Finland, I visited
Metropolia, their largest University of Applied Sciences. The Finnish
Universities of Applied Sciences offer mainly Bachelor degree programmes,
and in areas with clear industry demand and focus, such as engineering,
healthcare and social services. The entire curriculum is designed
with close industry inputs. Students go through a practice-oriented
learning pedagogy, and most professors have strong industry backgrounds.
They focus on applied research and collaborate with industry partners
to commercialise technologies. The students, therefore, graduate
with valuable, industry-relevant skills, and are better able to
apply their knowledge in a practical way. This is in Finland, but
other countries like America and Germany also have teaching universities
with such characteristics and features. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ad62149f-819b-4b0b-b895-871e4ff77a98">

believes that there is scope to develop a new university model in
Singapore – one that is teaching-focused and practice-oriented with
close industry ties. While these elements already exist in our current
universities, we want to integrate them and take them further, to
offer something that is distinctive and valuable for our students.
The mix of disciplines offered should have a strong industry focus, including
niche programmes not offered by the existing universities as well
as areas where we
need more skilled manpower, for example, in hospitality and tourism,
social services and allied healthcare. Such a university model can
also include elements of co-operative education, where academic
studies are fully integrated with practical, hands-on work experience,
and where students alternate between semesters of full-time study and
relevant paid work. Ultimately, for the students, this university
experience should be challenging, interactive and meaningful, combining
theory with real-world industry experiences that help them achieve
their full potential.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2316</p>

to implement these ideas. One possibility is to leverage on the
Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), which is already pioneering
some elements of such a model. Together with its overseas partners,
SIT today offers a number of applied degree pathways in disciplines
with strong practice-orientation, such as occupational therapy and
digital animation. It has also built close links with industry and received
strong endorsement from industry partners. Building on these foundations,
we can develop an innovative model of teaching-focused, industry-linked
and practice-based university education for Singapore. </p>

university sector, the Committee believes that there is some scope
to leverage on the private education institutions. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-515277b3-d7f4-420e-9dc2-cf9adbed2b7c">
                  <a name="budget__id-515277b3-d7f4-420e-9dc2-cf9adbed2b7c"><!--a--></a>Many Singaporeans obtain
their degrees through this route, and the private education sector
has grown into a diverse industry, comprising many different players with
different business models, catering to different needs. This diversity,
however, makes tapping on the sector a complex issue as quality
and standards are not uniform across the board. Today, the Government
subsidises students at selected private education institutions,
namely, UniSIM, which is the only local private institution with degree
awarding powers, and NAFA and Lasalle, which are specialised arts
institutions offering degree programmes in partnership with top
overseas institutions like the Royal College of Music and Goldsmith
College. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e01f74f2-bebd-48c8-9d02-bc4b581dcdef">
                  <a name="budget__id-e01f74f2-bebd-48c8-9d02-bc4b581dcdef"><!--a--></a>Mr Ang Wei Neng asked
whether the Government can consider subsidies being extended further
to students in other private institutions. Mr Zainal Sapari also
raised this issue in this House before and he mentioned it just
now as well. Indeed, the Committee is studying this matter carefully.
We recognise that there is a role for private providers to meet
the demand for University education in Singapore, but this has to
be managed carefully to preserve the value of university education
for our students. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f7c16509-245c-4897-84e4-e043a0df87a0">
                  <a name="budget__id-f7c16509-245c-4897-84e4-e043a0df87a0"><!--a--></a>I would say that we are
not alone in grappling with how best to leverage on the private
sector. Worldwide, there is a growing debate about the role of the
private sector in providing higher education. In the UK, the rapid
growth of private Universities has sparked concerns that the interests
of private providers may not be aligned with national interests,
that the private providers are "cherry-picking" the more profitable
courses and students, and that standards are being compromised.
In the US, the Department of Education is increasingly dissatisfied
with the value offered by for-profit private education institutions
and is clamping down with new rules to block government aid to such
institutions. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-28814fc6-548c-4724-8a6a-cdc47769a306">
                  <a name="budget__id-28814fc6-548c-4724-8a6a-cdc47769a306"><!--a--></a>In Singapore, we have
taken steps to raise the quality of our private education institutions.
We established the Council for Private Education (CPE) which sets
out mandatory baseline standards for institutional quality. CPE
offers a voluntary EduTrust Certification
scheme for higher-quality private institutions to differentiate
themselves. But this is just the first step in distinguishing quality
from baseline requirements. EduTrust provides prospective students
with a measure of confidence that processes are in place to run
a sound organisation and student interests are well looked after.
We will have to do more to encourage private institutions to focus
on quality outcomes. This is a challenge that regulatory agencies
around the world face. If the same quality benchmarks for public
universities are applied to private institutions, there may not
be a viable business case for many of the programmes offered in
such private institutions. We should, therefore, study the experience
of other countries very carefully, including learning from them
what is feasible and what not to do. </p>

to expand the routes for working adults to continue their education
and training by enhancing the pathways for them to get a degree. </p>

subsidised over 4,000 part-time degree places at NUS, NTU and UniSIM.
This was on top of the 12,000 publicly-funded full-time University places
for Singaporeans. We believe that more adult learners can benefit
from such part-time degree programmes. In a constantly changing
and increasingly sophisticated economy, continuing education and
training (CET) is a critical avenue for Singaporeans to continuously
upgrade their skill sets. </p>

not easy for adult workers to pursue a part-time degree. They have
to make personal sacrifices, to juggle work and family commitments
and study at the same time. To make CET more attractive, we must
address the challenges that part-time students face. This includes
diversifying the range of offerings to better cater to individual
needs and preferences, and enhancing flexibility in course structures
and programmes. More fundamentally, we will require closer cooperation
amongst the various stakeholders – whether they are education providers,
employers and the Government – to provide a more conducive and supportive
environment for CET. The Committee is studying how best to tackle
these issues so as to create many more opportunities for adult workers
to get a degree while continuing in their jobs. </p>

University pathways, we must ensure that these opportunities remain
open to all Singaporeans, and that University education remains
affordable, especially to those from lower-income families. </p>

of social mobility – I think many Members agree and have spoken
about this in their interventions. No Singaporean student admitted
to our universities should be deterred from pursuing a degree education
due to financial difficulties. Today, the Government subsidises
a large proportion of university education through grants and supplements
this with a full range of financial assistance schemes, including
loans and bursaries. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d451cbaf-cc8b-4939-83cf-6bd6dac3c167">

and enhances these schemes and will continue to do so to ensure
that they meet the needs of students, especially those from lower-income families.

its coverage to two-thirds of all families, based on household income,
and increased the quantum provided. </p>

community have also stepped forward to provide support. But some
of these schemes may not be as well-publicised. So MOE will work with
the universities and other post-Secondary institutions to reach
out more to the students

and are not unduly burdened by the financing of their education. </p>

where there may be scope to do more is the loan schemes that are
extended to students. In some countries like America, Canada and
the UK, university education is financed largely through student
loans. And to reduce the financial burden on students, many such
loans are subsidised by their respective governments, whether in
the form of lower interest rates, or extended interest-free repayment
periods. The Committee is studying some of these ideas to see if
we can adapt and apply them in the Singaporean context to make loan
schemes more attractive as an additional source of financing for
University education, on top of the direct grants and bursaries
provided by the Government. </p>

next few years, the Committee envisions a more diversified university
landscape with multiple "best-in-class" institutions, including
top-notch research- and teaching-oriented universities as well as
a good mix of full-time, part-time and work-study degree programmes,
to meet the wide spectrum of Singaporeans' needs and preferences.
At the same time, we must maintain the quality and affordability of
university education, and ensure good employment outcomes for all
our graduates. I have outlined the preliminary findings of the Committee.
The increase in university participation and the enhancements to
this sector will require a corresponding increase in funding for
the higher education sector, not immediately, but this will come,
and I hope Members will support all this in due course. There is

whether ITE, Polytechnic or University, serves as a launching pad
into the world beyond. But the value of higher education is built
on the foundations of the student's earlier educational journey.
The formative years before Primary education are critical for the
holistic development of a child. And several Members – Mr Edwin
Tong and Mr Yee Jenn Jong – have asked about the quality of the
pre-school sector. MOE too recognises the importance for our children
to get a good early foundation, and we have invested in pre-school
opportunities for all Singaporeans. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-357d4b78-336f-4313-b386-120a14496c5c">
                  <a name="budget__id-357d4b78-336f-4313-b386-120a14496c5c"><!--a--></a>We have made good progress
in recent years. Today, access to pre-school is almost universal
– more than 99% of Primary 1-going children attended pre-school.
We are now making a greater push to enhance quality. Recently, MOE
launched the Singapore Pre-School Accreditation Framework (SPARK),
a structured approach to assess the quality of the teaching and
learning, administration and management processes in our pre-school
centres, and to identify their strengths and areas for improvement.
This is what the SPARK logo looks like. So if you are looking for
a good pre-school centre, look out for the ones with the SPARK accreditation.
Today, 69 pre-schools are SPARK-certified. One example is Ascension
Kindergarten. The principal tells us that the SPARK assessment has
helped them to review their teaching environment and teaching strategies,
and thus improved their ability to meet the learning needs of every
child. I am glad to note that 53 more pre-schools have applied for
certification in this year's first application window, and I encourage
more to do so in the coming months.</p>

centres to enhance their quality. First, we do this by raising programme
standards. MOE had earlier developed the Kindergarten Curriculum
Framework and Guide as a reference for quality teaching and teacher-pupil interactions
in pre-school settings. This guide emphasises the holistic development
of children, including character-building. And in this regard, I
fully agree with the points made by Mr Edwin Tong that pre-school
education should not be an extension of formalised schooling for
our young children. Rather, it should be about creating an environment
for them to explore, inquire, play and discover; it should be about
instilling in them a sense of curiosity and creativity – abilities
that are even more important for learning in the long run. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9f52576e-2489-4c1d-93c3-a2ca2e8b0da6">
                  <a name="budget__id-9f52576e-2489-4c1d-93c3-a2ca2e8b0da6"><!--a--></a>With this in mind, MOE
is now in the process of updating our Curriculum Framework, with
further inputs from early childhood professionals, practitioners
and other stakeholders. The Curriculum Framework will be ready and
will be distributed to all pre-schools in the second half of the
year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-458fabea-c68d-457f-8b3c-8647677d87a3">
                  <a name="budget__id-458fabea-c68d-457f-8b3c-8647677d87a3"><!--a--></a>Second, we are also doing
more to invest in teacher quality, as suggested by Mr Edwin Tong.
In January 2009, we raised the minimum academic and professional qualifications
of pre-school teachers. Today, around 90% of teachers in our pre-schools teaching
nursery and kindergarten ages possess a diploma in Early Childhood
Care and Education, or are undergoing training to obtain one. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-db0736a6-7e7d-4774-86ba-be717c945782">
                  <a name="budget__id-db0736a6-7e7d-4774-86ba-be717c945782"><!--a--></a>MOE also invests in the
professional development of our kindergarten educators, through
various bursaries, scholarships and teaching awards. For example,
we will be offering awards for teachers to take up the newly launched
Wheelock-SIT Early Childhood Education degree programme, and also
the new certificate course in music and movement by Republic Polytechnic.
And I would like to assure Mr Yee that these awards are open to
teachers from all pre-school centres. Recently, we also developed
a guide as a reference for pre-school educators on career progression
opportunities, including the different options for them to upgrade
their skills. Through this guide, pre-school educators can learn
more about the education and career pathways available to them,
based on their varying areas of interest, their strengths and aspirations. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0fd62153-4822-464b-af8f-c163f901f7ec">
                  <a name="budget__id-0fd62153-4822-464b-af8f-c163f901f7ec"><!--a--></a>Overall, MOE will continue
to strive to improve the quality of pre-school education in Singapore.
We provide a broad range of support to all kindergarten operators
and, in particular, to the not-for-profit kindergartens, which cater
to all races and religions, and especially to children from the
lower- and middle-income groups. Through these investments, we will
build solid foundations on which our children can fully develop their
potential, and achieve success in life.</p>

and pre-school education may lie at the opposite ends of a student's
educational life cycle. But they both aim to achieve the same thing
– to equip the students with valuable skills to maximise their potential,
and thrive in a changing world. MOE will continue to invest heavily
in both sectors, to develop better pre-schools, and to build stronger
tertiary institutions – at the ITE, Polytechnic and University levels.
In so doing, we aim to create even more education opportunities
for young Singaporeans to pursue their dreams, and fulfil their
promise.</p>

suggestions:</p>

and national challenges as case studies to help students get a sense
of reality and cultivate a sense of shared responsibility?</p>

same old but embed social innovation as a cornerstone in the regular
curriculum to encourage students to think out of the box, while
channelling their energy and imagination positively into solutioning
for social deficits and national challenges. </p>

to a social enterprise or community organisation so as to inculcate
a self-reliant, hands-up and not just a hands-out approach. Perhaps,
to this end, could MOE consider setting up a unit in CCE itself
to match-make projects with SEs?</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member)</strong>
                  </span>:
Sir, at the outset, let me declare my interest as a nature and environment
educator. Sir, schools are increasingly, and in greater numbers,
sending their students for adventure camps both within Singapore,
as well as overseas, eg, to neighbouring countries like Malaysia.
And these programmes are sometimes for the entire cohort; sometimes
they are part of an orientation programme for new students, or leadership
programmes for student councillors or uniformed groups.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-40b10862-6374-4318-b828-6db6939466f9">
                  <a name="budget__id-40b10862-6374-4318-b828-6db6939466f9"><!--a--></a>This is a really laudable
move. It shows that schools acknowledge and recognise that adventure
activities have values to teach that will stand the students in
good stead, not just when they are in school but beyond as well.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-363756d1-e34e-4aba-917f-daad21b25acc">
                  <a name="budget__id-363756d1-e34e-4aba-917f-daad21b25acc"><!--a--></a>When students have to
sleep in tents, canoe down raging rivers or traverse a rock wall
50 metres above the ground, they learn that being outside their
comfort zone is scary, but yet when that fear is overcome, there
is a huge sense of accomplishment. It does wonders for their sense
of self-esteem. When students support each other through a rough mountain terrain,
or work in tandem as they navigate through white water, they learn
values like leadership, team building, and bonding. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2321</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-259c2872-9602-48d6-a40d-7b3961a6d6ff">
                  <a name="budget__id-259c2872-9602-48d6-a40d-7b3961a6d6ff"><!--a--></a>Indeed, many studies have
shown that two main values come up as a result of adventure education.
These are, firstly, more effective interpersonal relationships when people
learn how to get along with each other in difficult and uncomfortable
situations; secondly, a deeper intra-personal relationship, when
an individual gains confidence, a sense of accomplishment and achievement
as a result of having overcome fear and discomfort. The individual
begins to value himself that much more.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ae6d7822-da26-42f0-a7ab-7d19aabaf948">
                  <a name="budget__id-ae6d7822-da26-42f0-a7ab-7d19aabaf948"><!--a--></a>However, Sir, as an educator,
I have observed that one very important element is often missing
in such programmes. While these programmes are quite comprehensive in
their approach towards adventure education, often, there is little
or no component of nature or environment education.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a8821f13-733a-4c08-a6ce-3967e05db25f">
                  <a name="budget__id-a8821f13-733a-4c08-a6ce-3967e05db25f"><!--a--></a>Just to give one anecdotal
example. When my daughter was in JC1 last year, she went to Gunung
Ledang in Johor as part of her school's orientation programme. The students
had a great time, by all accounts, and one significant remark at
the end of it was made by all participants. They said they had a
great chance to get to know each other better and there was great
bonding between them, the instructors and the teachers. So when
I asked her what they had learned about Gunung Ledang and its rich
flora and fauna, she said, "Nothing – we saw birds and stuff, but
no one talked about nature!" As an environment and nature educator,
you can imagine my horror. Think of that lost learning opportunity.
Luckily for my daughter, she is already well exposed to the richness
of the natural world at a really early age. She did not lose too
much there.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-00b4cf95-d1c3-46fd-bb7b-c838b8b874cb">
                  <a name="budget__id-00b4cf95-d1c3-46fd-bb7b-c838b8b874cb"><!--a--></a>Sir, in my maiden speech
last Tuesday, I had shared what many young people tell me about
their feelings after experiencing nature-related activities. Some
of these include a sense of awe and wonder, a sense of love for
the places they visit, and a sense of their own place in the bigger
scheme of things, in the world and in the universe. They learn humility
and gratitude.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2563097e-a37e-4341-829d-1176b018a909">
                  <a name="budget__id-2563097e-a37e-4341-829d-1176b018a909"><!--a--></a>To expand on what I have
shared, studies have shown that when an outdoor programme includes
a well-facilitated environment programme, two more values emerge.
These are, firstly, eco-systemic relationship; secondly, ekistic
relationship.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c79df610-cdf8-4745-a7bc-d8db46d84c65">
                  <a name="budget__id-c79df610-cdf8-4745-a7bc-d8db46d84c65"><!--a--></a>Let me explain. An eco-systemic
relationship is when students learn of the inter-dependence of all
living organisms and how when one aspect of nature is destroyed, everything
else is affected. For example, when an environment education is
included in an outdoor programme, students learn, as they walk through
a forest or climb a mountain, how nature is interconnected.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5ed6a8c3-0adb-4af4-bccb-1dedd0af13ba">
                  <a name="budget__id-5ed6a8c3-0adb-4af4-bccb-1dedd0af13ba"><!--a--></a>When students learn that
in the forest, for example, "dead leaves" are not exactly "dead"
and indeed they are very useful by giving back to the forest in
the form of food and nutrients, thereby ensuring the health of the
forest, they see how nature is a giant web of life, one thing depending
on the other. And then when they learn about, for example, the <em class="ph i">macaranga</em> plant
that proliferates in our forest, they learn that there is a win-win
relationship because there are armies of ants in the plant that
actually protect the plant and receiving food and shelter at the
same time – again, an example of inter-connectedness.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2322</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-64617a6e-6c2d-4b60-85a0-18597efe771a">
                  <a name="budget__id-64617a6e-6c2d-4b60-85a0-18597efe771a"><!--a--></a>The second value, "ekistic relationship"
that I mentioned, is when students learn that in our tropical rainforest,
it is where all our plants and herbs are where we originally got our
food, how we fed ourselves, how we obtained our medicine – it is
not for nothing that our rainforests are called "the pharmacy of
the planet". They learn that humans depend on nature to survive.</p>

in the forest, the soil and the roots act like water storage tanks
preventing soil erosion, they see the connection between a healthy
forest and flood prevention, which then connects to their own well-being. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2f7b1c25-a0c0-4a5a-8f8a-32300d61e107">

realise that when the forests are destroyed, for example, by building
highways, so too are much of nature's free eco services destroyed.
They understand that their every action, day to day, has an impact
not just on the natural world but on their own lives as well.</p>

questions. First, what does MOE plan to do in order to ensure that
all adventure programmes include an equal emphasis on environment education?
And, secondly, how would we ensure the environment education programmes
are well facilitated? Let us not have young people who, when they
become decision makers, grow up to have the attitude in the words
of William Blake: "The tree which moves some to tears of joy is
in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way."</p>

Sir, I warmly welcome the Education Ministry's commitment to better

medium by which we can inculcate and nurture life skills and the
values of confidence, determination, team work, empathy and sportsmanship. Sports,

of sports in education. It can convey unwholesome values as well.</p>

Sir, sport in Singapore schools is important at the field level.
First, as part of MOE's ongoing broader framework and commitment
towards politic education, character and values building, school
sport is important. Team work, determination, humility, self-esteem,
achievement – these are just some of the intangible lessons which
can be gained through participation in sport.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e9dc5286-6a89-42f2-8ddb-9aa2d4cb1de2">

fitness, and there is a lifestyle choice which makes for a more balanced
and well-rounded person.</p>

excel in it, to make it their chosen pathway or even a career option.</p>

in Singapore, Singapore has not hitherto been well known as a sporting
power house in the international arena. Our relatively small size, however,
should not itself be a disadvantage. We should aim to nurture a
good sporting talent from a young age and provide the best resources
and facilities to nurture and develop that talent. Success on an

that the value of education is best measured in the values and belief

it is the close partnership between parents and schools which shapes
the educational journey of our children. Together with schools,
parents help to instil in our children the important values of life.</p>

School, for example, has taken a proactive approach to values education.
At the school's Sports Day in 2011, the PSG took the initiative
to raise some $3,000 for the victims of the Japanese tsunami. It
may look small but the amount was really quite meaningful. I applaud
this creative idea for three reasons. First, funds have been raised
for the victims. Second, awareness of global events has been raised
in our children. Lastly, and most importantly, parents and school have
planted the values of care, sacrifice and empathy in our children.</p>

as self-help groups, the People's Association, National Family Council,
Dads for Life, and many others, to reach out to parents more effectively
and coherently. </p>

I would like to give the following example where the identity of
the child has been changed for reasons of privacy. When John Lim
first enrolled in Primary school, both his parents were in prison.
He lacked basic numeracy, literacy and social skills for a Primary 1
child. Beyond financial and socio-emotional support, John was also
enrolled in the school's Student Care Centre (SCC) run by a VWO.
Over the past five years, John's teachers, the school counsellor,
MCYS officers and the SCC staff have worked closely together to
help him. John has shown tremendous improvement. He is the top scorer
of the school football team and now even helps his peers with school
work. Despite unfortunate circumstances at home, John has a secured
and conducive environment in school to grow.</p>

the support which our weakest students require often goes beyond

how the School Breakfast Programme (SBP) is part of the integrated

Zhi Yi, a Primary 5 student from Rulang Primary School, who is on
the SBP. She said:</p>

coupons, I felt very sad because not enough money to eat and eat only
instant noodles everyday, but after having breakfast coupons, I
feel excited because I get to drink hot Milo and eat bread with
eggs. In class, I can think better and not feel sleepy all the time." </p>

Primary 5 level. For children like Zhi Yi, a simple meal of Milo, bread
and eggs cannot be taken for granted. And we cannot take the nutrition
and well-being of our children for granted. Funding per student
has been increased since January 2012 from $180 a year currently
to $270. Together with the increase in the number of students eligible
for MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme, the amount allocated by MOE to
SBP will increase from $4 million to $12 million per year.</p>

community play a very important role in the education of our young,
schools can also play a role in uplifting the community that they reside
in. The Minister had earlier shared the examples of Tanjong Katong

learning projects, our students play an active role in identifying

JC, for instance, helped children with special needs through a specially
designed PE programme to develop their psycho-motor skills. Innova
JC students also conducted an eight-week reading programme with
kindergarten children from less advantaged backgrounds and followed
up with feedback to parents on their child's reading progress at
the meet-the-parents sessions. They organised meet-the-parents sessions

Universities also encourage their students to participate actively

for the students to develop innovative solutions to help solve social
issues even across other countries, and provide these students with

Sevapur from Singapore Polytechnic made trips to India where they
initiated schemes to generate funding for a non-profit organisation
Inba Seva Sangan (ISS) so as to run programmes to benefit the villagers

students to a range of sports beyond its niche sport of volleyball.
I know that they are very good at volleyball, winning national championships,

in the school. In fact, they are doing a lot more than just that.
These sports include hockey and netball. Yes, netball and the boys
play netball too! Students are taught the mechanics of these sports
in modules, meaning they are taught how to play the game and how
to play the game well and enjoy it. These modules focus on the various
mechanics of each sport. After all modules are completed, students
participate in an inter-class competition which is an excellent opportunity
for nurturing class, school and sporting spirit! Yes, there will
be competition but it is friendly competition among friends; between
classes, between houses.</p>

sports facilities not only enables all of us to better utilise these facilities
outside school hours, it has also brought communities and schools
closer together. Indeed, I would like to stress to Asst Prof Eugene
Tan that the value of sports to our children's education is not
in winning competitions. At Outram Secondary School, for instance,
a Sports Enrichment Centre (SEC) was formed last year for students
who had no CCA and required after school activities to engage them.
The students took the initiative to partner the Kim Seng Youth Executive
Committee to launch the "One Community"
project. Dr Lily Neo may be very pleased to learn about this. The
students organised games and fitness sessions and opened the school's
sports facilities to underprivileged youths in the Kim Seng Constituency.
Through such partnership efforts, our students will see themselves
as active citizens beyond the confines of schools. </p>

for our students to run faster, jump higher or become stronger.
With the right programmes in place, sports serve as an important
vehicle to nurture values of teamwork, sportsmanship, friendship
and respect. These are values which will shape the character of
our children. Far from just a race for medals and trophies, participation
in sports is an important avenue for character development and contribution
back to the community. So, Asst Prof Eugene Tan, we have a lot of
things in common here. </p>

into schools, we have also brought our students out to interact
with the community and the environment. I agree with Ms Faizah Jamal
that it is important for our students to care for the environment.
That is why outdoor education is one of the modules in Programme
for Active Learning (PAL) for all Primary 1 and 2 students. This
will be implemented in phases across all Primary schools by 2017, as
recommended by the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) Committee. </p>

a supportive environment for our children to learn. Communities
can support and enrich learning in many ways. Partnerships augment
the school efforts to meet the developmental needs of every student
placed in their care. Let us work together for the betterment of
our children's education. Mr Chairman, Sir, please allow me to reiterate some
points in Malay. </p>

many parents have come forward to help our schools even though they

(PSG) of Westwood Secondary School has taken the initiative to collect

Japan during their school's Sports Day last year. Three thousand

was collected by the parents, students, and also the school's staff
and teachers. I applaud this creative idea for three reasons. Firstly,
the funds raised helped the victims of the natural disaster in Japan. Secondly,
awareness of global events has been raised in our children. And,

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Alex Yam</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, in November 2011, it was announced that the Special Education
Schools will be sharing broad educational outcomes while preserving their
different approaches to cater to students with diverse needs. The
Ministry has also, in recent years, focused attention on channelling
over 8,000 students with mild special needs into mainstream schools.
For teachers, both in SPED and mainstream schools, the challenge
is a multi-faceted one due to the lack of local training opportunities.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ba76947c-4530-405d-a483-7c2eb77a80e4">
                  <a name="budget__id-ba76947c-4530-405d-a483-7c2eb77a80e4"><!--a--></a>Apart from the NIE diploma
in special education, which is offered only to those already teaching
in SPED schools, there is a lack of specialised local training facilities.
I therefore urge the Ministry to consider introducing other NIE
or full-time special education degree or diploma. This will increase
the number of teachers who may receive training locally to be equipped
to educate special-needs students. The problem of lack of local
training is also compounded as overseas training is often expensive
and an unfortunate barrier for those with a passion to educate our
special-needs students. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e457cc8c-1a40-4df9-bdb4-83b188186da3">
                  <a name="budget__id-e457cc8c-1a40-4df9-bdb4-83b188186da3"><!--a--></a>A family I spoke to last
year spoke to me about their frustrations in trying to find a place
for their child in a SPED school. During another recent block visit,
I met a young man, 16 years old, studying in Primary 6. His parents
were worried that at the end of his education cycle, whether there
will be vocational opportunities for him. The families I mentioned
are just a few of those that I had the privilege of meeting and
witnessing their passion and love in doing what they can for their
children. Many parents with children of complex special needs face
a constant struggle in finding a place for their children with little
certainty that they will be able to secure a place despite going
from school to school. I therefore also urge the Ministry to look
at introducing a holistic approach to assist parents with such children
so as to ease their burden and point them in the right direction.
That, Sir, is the mark of a true compassionate society and an enlightened education
system. </p>

Sir, the education system here is one of an inclusive one. With
different learning abilities, you are on a different track and at
a different pace. Even taking examinations, you can be given special
conditions because of your different abilities and because of some
medical conditions. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f8bfb556-b454-40ef-bf02-9192ffc883b7">

with me that such a special condition was going to be accorded to
his child who is going to take his "O" levels this year, as his
child has ADHD. However, he was anxious because there was a choice
that he has to make, whether to give the child a special condition
while taking the examinations. Because if the child passes the "O"
levels, in his certificate, there will be an annotation of a "special condition"
while taking the examinations. I can understand the system being
transparent and being very open and wants to be upfront about the
special condition given to the child when he takes the examinations.
But for the parents, they would think that it would make it more
difficult for the child in the future, whether it is for employment
or application for further studies. I would like to ask the Ministry
if an exception can be given to a condition, so as not to put in
an annotation in the certificate while allowing the child to take
the examinations in a special condition.</p>

with special needs in the mainstream schools, as well as in the
SPED schools, as stated in his speech earlier. At the same time,
we are very glad that the Government has also extended WIS to work-capable
PWDs and SEC to employers of PWDs. These are over and above what
the Enabling Masterplan 2012-2016 has recommended. </p>

good basic education and vocational training to PWDs so that as
many of the SPED school graduates can be work-capable as possible.
While MCYS would
address most of the recommendations contained in the Enabling Masterplan
2012-2016, there are quite a few good recommendations that concern
MOE in the report. In particular, I hope that MOE could address
the following areas: </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2332</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-e7863bc7-3af4-4b4b-98a2-92bedc31aa0b"><!--a--></a>(1) Currently, SPED schools
are managed by VWOs despite the significant funding from MOE. As
mentioned in my maiden speech, owing to the different aspirations
of the boards of the VWOs, the quality of education in different
SPED schools remain uneven. Thus, would MOE consider instituting
a governance structure, supported by NCSS and other stakeholders,
to improve the governance of SPED schools and appointment of SPED
leaders? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8ec9e303-d7fe-4fff-8ce5-79fcc2724d6d">

in Singapore have been trying to develop their own curriculum quite
independently of each other. Some are more successful than the others.
In November 2011, a draft SPED Curriculum Framework was introduced,
mainly due to the efforts by a working group chaired by Senior Parliamentary
Secretary Sim Ann. Moving forward, would MOE consider setting up
a sizeable SPED curriculum development unit to further develop a
core SPED Curriculum Framework as well as providing a platform to
share expertise and resources so that each SPED school could customise
for its own use and needs?</p>

groups of SPED students are funded to study up to 21 years old.
One group comprises students in the mainstream curriculum and another
group consists of students pursuing vocational certification. However,
most developed countries allow their SPED students to exit from
formal sponsored special education at the age of 21 years old, taking
into consideration their lower learning abilities. Hence, would
MOE consider extending the SPED school exit age to 21 years for
those who can benefit from the extended vocational training and

I would like to share two of my thoughts. Firstly, on the Bilingualism
Fund. Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew mooted the establishment
of the Bilingualism Fund, to which he personally donated $10 million.
The community rallied to his call. In particular, the Chinese community
leaders and organisations responded with great enthusiasm and donated
generously towards this national objective to benefit our younger
generation. Three months have already gone by since the Fund was
set up last November. I would like to find out from the Ministry
of Education how it proposes to manage and utilise these funds.
Are there any current plans and developments?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-64110333-5340-49c2-91db-00be7ef7b0cd">
                  <a name="budget__id-64110333-5340-49c2-91db-00be7ef7b0cd"><!--a--></a>Secondly, how to continue
grooming bilingual and bi-cultural talent. Everyone, from the Government
to the community, is diligently promoting the grooming of bilingual and
bi-cultural talent for Singapore. Language is the vehicle enabling
culture to be effectively transmitted; in this regard Mother Tongue
education is extremely important in instilling traditional core values.
Learning of Mandarin is a good example. When I was young, the anecdote
of Yue Fei's "精忠报国" or "Loyalty to the
Country" taught me about the meaning of national service; after
reading about "Oath of the Peach Garden" in Romance of the Three
Kingdoms, I deeply understood about maintaining trust and integrity
among friends; as I read Mencius' saying on "Of the three transgressions
of filial piety, the worst is severing the family line", I came
to understand the importance of filial piety and raising a family.
These moral values, having been deeply instilled in me while learning
my Mother Tongue, will never be forgotten.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2333</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-7e4edf6e-a736-4440-9cea-b57799582bd1"><!--a--></a>Former Prime Minister
Lee Kuan Yew mooted the establishment of the Bilingualism Fund with
the primary objective to enhance Mother Tongue language proficiency among
pre-school children. However, Mother Tongue language learning and
the transmission of culture is a long-term process which needs to
be vigorously pursued and sustained in an undisrupted manner. As
school children at the Primary and Secondary levels need to study
the Mother Tongue and face examination pressures, they naturally
work harder at learning the Mother Tongue in the hope of scoring
high marks during examinations. When they enter pre-Universities
or Polytechnics, Mother Tongue is no longer a compulsory subject.
Once the examination requirement is waived, many young people tend
to ignore Mother Tongue language learning. Chinese texts, which
they had studied in Primary and Secondary schools, would be set
aside, never to be referred to again.</p>

the Ministry of Education should consider reviewing the education
policy for post-Secondary school students. It should request and
encourage students in pre-Universities, Polytechnics and arts colleges
to participate in activities using Mother Tongue as the medium,
enabling them to continue their exposure to the language. In learning
and using the Mother Tongue, such oriental moral values as benevolence,
righteousness, graciousness and honesty can be deeply embedded in
the hearts and minds of young people through proverbs and stories.

Zaobao</em> published an article written by Mr Danny Yeo. After reading
it, I had many thoughts. This article, "Burn Chinese! Burn!", wrote about
how the daughters of two of Mr Yeo's friends burned their Chinese
textbooks after the examinations, because they can finally get rid
of learning Chinese. There was a deep sense of pain in my heart,
and what I was even more concerned with, is how we can quickly improve
the general environment and teaching systems for the learning of
the Chinese language, so that children can learn Chinese more happily
and, most importantly, more willingly. As the saying goes, all buildings
start from the ground; hence, pre-school education is a critical
phase.</p>

questions. Firstly, I would like to ask MOE, how will the Lee Kuan
Yew Fund for Bilingualism be used to develop more creative and interesting
pre-school curriculum materials and teaching systems, to encourage students
to enjoy learning the language and using is wisely. Secondly, whether
they will consider increasing the number of hours that children
use MTL in schools every day. Besides MTL lessons, can teachers
continue to use MT to converse with the children during break time,
so that indirectly, the children can listen more, speak more, learn more
and use the language more? Thirdly, we can broadcast cartoons produced specially
for local pre-schoolers through MediaCorp's OKTO Channel, to entice
them to learn MTL in an entertaining and relaxing way. Hence, how
should the children learn, so that they will be willing and love
to learn Chinese and Mandarin?</p>

is a life-long experience, to know about it and retain the knowledge
for life, to use it wisely and pass on the language to our next
generation. Examinations should not be the sole purpose of learning
Chinese, and one should not throw away this precious knowledge after
the examinations. This is an issue that we must be closely concerned
with and seek solutions to resolve.</p>

a full-time special education degree or diploma. Now, MOE has already
been actively expanding training opportunities for our SPED teachers.
All untrained teachers who join SPED schools have to undergo a one-year
full-time training programme at NIE − leading to the Diploma in
Special Education (DISE). Senior Teachers and Heads of Departments
in SPED schools can acquire management skills in the NIE Management
and Leadership in Schools (MLS) programme. We also offer scholarships to
SPED teachers to pursue Masters degrees at both NIE as well as overseas
universities. We
are exploring the possibility of working with overseas partners
to offer a SPED undergraduate degree programme. </p>

we are also strengthening curriculum development in SPED schools.
Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about this. The MOE launched the draft Curriculum
Framework for SPED Schools last November. It specifies a set of
Education Outcomes and Learning Standards that SPED students should
attain after 12 years of education. We are now working very closely
with schools and other key stakeholders to fully develop the Framework.
It has to be customised for every school to meet the needs of their
students. </p>

Teams will be formed in all SPED schools. Training by local and
overseas consultants will also be provided to help build school
capability in curriculum development, design and evaluation. We
must also attract and retain able staff, because this is a very
key pillar for quality so that expertise and knowledge in the SPED
sector can continually be built up. </p>

teachers are absolutely critical for SPED schools. So are the Allied
Health Professionals – the physiotherapists, occupational therapists,
speech therapists and psychologists – and the Vocational Education
and Administrative staff. Hence, the MOE will support NCSS and VWOs
in reviewing salaries in SPED schools, so that schools can continue
to attract and retain talented and committed teachers, Allied Health
Professionals and other staff members. Additional funding will be
available for SPED schools to effect salary increases this year. </p>

do more to improve access to SPED for families with children with
special needs. We are doing this in two ways: first, invest in expanding
the capacity of SPED schools where places are in short supply; and
second, streamline the enrolment process to improve waiting times
for admission, and certainty on the ground, particularly for cases
that are not so clear-cut. Mr Alex Yam spoke about the experience of
some parents in enrolment. MOE monitors the enrolment figures of
SPED schools closely to ensure that there are sufficient places
to cater to students of different disability types. We have committed
$150 million towards the upgrading and building of the 20 SPED schools
in the past decade, and will continue to invest in increasing capacity where
required. Metta School, which caters to students with mild intellectual
disability, will be able to take in another 150 students from 2013
after its new extension block is completed. With the refurbishment
of the former Chong Boon Primary School, Pathlight School added
an additional 100 places at the start of 2012 and will be able to
provide an additional 200 places by the end of 2013. </p>

we recognise the need to improve the experience of parents seeking
to admit their child into the SPED school that is appropriate to
his or her needs. MOE will set up a Multi-Agency Advisory Panel,
comprising specialists and professionals from MOE, the health sector,
the NCCS as well as the different SPED schools. The Panel will develop
a standard application process for all 20 SPED schools. And it will
help facilitate admission for children with less straightforward
learning profiles into the appropriate SPED school. With the standard
application process, parents would not have to make multiple applications
to different SPED schools − only one will be required. And we aim
to implement this fully by October 2012. </p>

efforts to improve quality and accessibility. Now, let me turn to
affordability. With effect from 1 March 2012, the household income
ceiling of the SPED
Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) will be raised from $1,500 to
$2,500 per month, in tandem with the MOE FAS revision for mainstream
schools. Similarly, larger families with a per capita income of
$625 or less will also be eligible for the revised SPED FAS. About
1,500 SPED students are expected to benefit from the revised Financial
Assistance Scheme, up from 600 students who benefit from the existing
scheme. We will also extend annual top-up grants to SPED schools
for the next three years, so that they will have the resources to
provide additional assistance, such as transport subsidies, to needy
students. </p>

more for the Special Education sector. We do so with a vision firmly
in mind, which is that these students will eventually leave school
and transit into adult life. And we want to prepare them as well
as possible for meaningful participation in society and a fulfilling
adulthood. But we are mindful that every child with special needs
is different. So, our approach is to support each child in striving
for the goals that he or she can achieve. Some of our students,
because of the severity of their disabilities, will require long-term
care in a variety of settings after leaving school. And we want
to equip them with self-management skills so that they can gain
as much independence as possible. Other SPED students have the potential
to participate more actively in the workforce and in society, with
varying degrees of structured support. Some of them are capable
of entering open employment, again, with appropriate interventions. </p>

that we share Ms Denise Phua's sentiments about the importance of
working towards an inclusive society. Indeed, I want to thank her

an inclusive society guides us in our approach for the SPED schools,
which is to equip the students with relevant skills, and strengthen
their transition to post-school settings. Let me talk about our
latest efforts in these directions. First, we will continue to expand
satellite partnerships of the kind that Ms Phua spoke so passionately
about. Since 2007, MOE has worked with some SPED schools and mainstream
schools to forge satellite partnerships that foster regular interaction between
students with special needs and their mainstream peers. For example,
students from MacPherson Primary School and hearing-impaired students
from Canossian School learn alongside one another in academic and
non-academic activities. Students from both schools have been enriched
by this experience. Shakeel, a Primary 6 student from McPherson
Primary, speaks fondly of his friendship with Wei Xian and Brandan from
Canossian School. Wei Xian and Brandan have also benefited − they
have more opportunities to practise their communication skills with
mainstream peers. Fernvale Primary School, a mainstream school,
and MINDS Fernvale Garden School, a SPED school which serves students
with intellectual disabilities, have also established a successful
partnership. Sir, we will continue to expand the network of satellite partnerships
between SPED and mainstream schools. </p>

the measures announced by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman to increase
the labour participation rate of Persons with Disabilities, including
the Special Employment Credit for SPED graduates, MOE will also
do more to prepare SPED students for future employment. We will
place greater emphasis on vocational pathways that lead to nationally recognised
certification, for students who can access open employment. And
we will also provide opportunities for students to gain work experience,
through a programme jointly run by MOE and the Singapore National Employers
Federation (SNEF).</p>

Denise Phua's point about Allied Educators in Learning and Behavioural
Support for helping children with mild special needs currently in

a similar point. </p>

our schools' capacity to identify and support students with mild
special needs, including dyslexia, mild autism and attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). All new teachers undergo a compulsory 12-hour module on
special needs at NIE to have a basic understanding of students with
special needs. Ten per cent of our Primary school teachers and 20%
of our secondary school teachers have undergone the Teachers trained
in Special Needs (TSN) programme to be equipped with more advanced
skills. </p>

schools higher levels of specialised support, in the form of Allied
Educators in Learning and Behavioural Support or AEDs (LBS). These
AEDs (LBS) are dedicated manpower specially recruited and trained
to support students with mild special needs in the mainstream schools.
After a year-long Diploma in Special Education at NIE, they are
posted to schools and work closely with teachers to identify and
assist students with mild special needs. Schools and parents have
shared that they cherish the support that these Allied Educators
provide. Currently, there is at least one AED (LBS) in all Primary
schools and 51 Secondary schools. We will recruit and train 200
more by 2016. </p>

about how we plan to better support children diagnosed with dyslexia.
While these children have difficulties learning literacy skills, there
is a good chance that they can overcome their difficulties with
appropriate intervention. So far, we have been referring dyslexic
students who need more intensive support to MOE-funded remediation
classes conducted by the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS)
outside of schools. From our experience, there are some students
who find it difficult to travel to these classes. Hence, to better
cater to them, we will pilot a new school-based dyslexia remediation
programme in 20 Primary schools island-wide in 2012 and 2013, and
this pilot will cost $3.6 million. It will target Primary 3 pupils identified
through a systematic screening process by the end of Primary 2,
and our objective is to help these students read at the same level
as their peers by the end of Primary 4. If the pilot is successful,
MOE will consider expanding the support in phases to other schools.
The school-based remediation is part of an ongoing process whereby MOE
improves educational outcomes for our students with mild special
needs. We are also committed to providing appropriate arrangements
for students with special needs who take the national examinations,
to give them the opportunity to do as well as they can. And Mr Teo
Ser Luck has asked about these provisions.</p>

conditions are an important component of fair testing in a merit-based
system. If students with special needs request to take the examinations under
non-standard testing conditions, such as extended time, they are
required to submit supporting documents such as a psychological
report. These documents will be evaluated
by a panel of MOE specialists. At the point of application, students
and their parents are clearly informed that the result slips and
certificates will be annotated to indicate that the examination
has been taken under non-standard arrangements. This, Sir, is in
line with international practice. Details of the arrangements are
not disclosed and will not affect the student's progression to the

been set up to nurture bilingualism with a focus on pre-school education.
Research shows that early bilingual exposure is one of the best
ways to develop language competence. We have earlier announced that
a Board would be formed to look into the uses of the Fund. As the
Vice-Chairperson of the Board, I thank Mr Lee Kuan Yew for starting
and contributing to the Fund. I am also very heartened that many
Singaporeans, as pointed out by Mr Teo Siong Seng, from all walks
of life have come forward to support the promotion of bilingualism.

on the uses of the Fund and on the progress of the Board, I am happy
to provide an update. The Board, chaired by Minister Heng Swee Keat,
recently met for the first time. Members discussed how best to nurture bilingualism
in young children, especially in view of Singapore's unique and
complex socio-linguistic context. The Board recognised that language
learning in pre-schools is important, and pre-schools need to be
well-supported. But language learning is not limited to the pre-school
setting. Bilingualism in pre-schoolers is also nurtured through their
day-to-day communication with parents and caregivers at home, or
through exposure to educational media programmes. Parents, grandparents,
caregivers and the community thus play an important role in creating
and shaping a conducive bilingual learning environment for our young
children. </p>

that the Fund could focus on supporting measures in three key areas:
first, bilingual learning in pre-schools; second, in their homes;
and, third, in the broader context of our society. This would ensure
an "eco-system" of support in all the environments that a pre-schooler
would be immersed in, and we will announce more details in due course. </p>

I would reiterate that bilingualism will remain a pillar of our

with linguistic skills that they will need now and in the future. </p>

with Members the key points raised by the Fund's Board members during
the discussions. Most importantly, the Board recognises that language learning
in pre-schools is important, and emphasis can be placed on supporting
the child's bilingual education in three areas of daily living,
namely: pre-school education institutions (this includes kindergarten
and childcare centres), family and community. This will ensure that
pre-school children receive maximum support in all areas of their daily
lives, to develop bilingual abilities. We will announce further
details in the near future. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-144201d0-e8ee-4f9b-95a9-9d9df2b7eda7">
                  <a name="budget__id-144201d0-e8ee-4f9b-95a9-9d9df2b7eda7"><!--a--></a>Mr Low Thia Khiang raised
a few concerns about the Fund. Firstly, he questioned whether the
PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Kindergartens will become the main beneficiaries
of the Fund. Mr Chairman, in actual fact, work on the Fund is in
its nascent stage. But since Mr Low raised his concerns, I am happy
to respond to his queries. Naturally, the use of the Fund should
be centred on the needs of the child, not of the organisations and,
in particular, on students who do not have good opportunities for bilingual
learning beyond the kindergarten or childcare centre setting due
to their family environment and financial situation. This principle
should be reasonable. Hence, I think Mr Low may have been overly-concerned.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a808ad6d-11d6-43f6-a353-22f5a45e573d">
                  <a name="budget__id-a808ad6d-11d6-43f6-a353-22f5a45e573d"><!--a--></a>Mr Low also reminded us
not to lose our focus, and should concentrate on the learning of
MTL, and not emphasise on bilingual education or the learning of
English. I would like to highlight that, having been named as a
Fund for Bilingualism, naturally the Fund seeks to enhance bilingual
competencies. We should, of course, focus on the learning of MTL.
Why? Because for many children from English-speaking families, learning
MTL is considerably difficult. However, Singapore's socio-linguistic environment
is also complex, and we do, indeed, have a group of students who encounter
difficulties in learning English. Hence, we should not and will
not forget them.</p>

now facing a language crisis. He believes that this crisis is severe
and we are at a point where we are desperately salvaging an irrevocable
situation. On previous occasions in Parliament, Mr Low had also
expressed similar views on the standard of Chinese. Back then, I
had responded with an optimistic view. Now, I am still responding
with an optimistic view. I would like to say that this is not blind
optimism, but based on a few considerations.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bc8d144e-7178-445b-bcd2-2eb0ec4dba61">
                  <a name="budget__id-bc8d144e-7178-445b-bcd2-2eb0ec4dba61"><!--a--></a>Firstly, the Chinese language
has been around for thousands of years, with a long and well-established
history. If we take a step back, in actual fact, there is now a
global trend to learn the Chinese language. Hence, rather than to
say that Singapore is now trying to desperately salvage an irrevocable
situation, I believe that we should instead say that we are now
trying to ensure that our students will not miss out on the best
opportunity to learn something that will benefit them for life.
I believe that our attitude and perspectives on this matter will
affect the progress of our work. In education, we need to have passion and
enthusiasm, but not necessarily undue pessimism. As the mother of
young children, I have some first-hand experience. The more urgently
we want our children to learn, the more they refuse to learn. </p>

concerned about the education of Chinese Language, particularly
the educators, would be pensive and thoughtful after reading this
article. I would like to point out that this is precisely why we
need to encourage students to enjoy learning the language and use
it wisely. We must focus on the practical usage of languages such
that even if a student burns her textbooks after the examinations,
we hope that the Chinese language has been ingrained in her brain
and rooted in her heart. And that if she ever would need to use
the language in future, she would not regret having not learnt more
about it. </p>

                  </span>: Thank
you, Mr Chairman. I have two clarifications. Several parents have
given feedback that some school teachers do not cover some of their subjects
thoroughly because they expect the children to have tuition teachers
who would do that for them. Can I ask the Minister what else can
MOE do to ask the teachers to do more, because not every student
has the advantage or the financial ability to have this kind of
tuition? </p>

is this. There are quite a few concerns expressed about the number
of foreign students in popular courses, like Medicine and Law, in
the local Universities. So, when I heard the hon Member Mr Baey
expressed his concerns that he did not get into medicine but some
other foreign students did, I would like to ask the Minister whether
he has some statistics on how many foreign students there are in popular
courses, like Medicine and Law, in the local Universities.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>
                  </span>: Thank
you, Chairman. I have two sets of questions for two of the cuts.
The first is regarding the Primary to Secondary Integrated Programme
pilot. The Minister said that "we will be transferring the pressure
to Primary 1". Does the Minister not agree that when that happens,
it means that this pilot is very successful and it is time to actually
open more of such pilots, just as we have done so when we did the secondary
to college integrated programme? The Minister also said that in
Finland, 40% of the students go to vocational stream at Grade 9.
I am not sure why this was raised as a problem by the Minister.
Is it because the Minister thinks that going to the vocational stream
is actually under achieving?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3ef08cbd-02f7-4721-a1b3-5582bfe13d30">
                  <a name="budget__id-3ef08cbd-02f7-4721-a1b3-5582bfe13d30"><!--a--></a>In speaking with Finns,
I actually found that parents and students, they choose the vocational
track by choice because in Finland, the salary differential between
the vocational stream and professional stream is not as great as
in Singapore. So, the higher percentage may not mean that they are
under performing. Is the Minister open to dialogue with schools
and parents to see if they actually want such a track because when I
did my survey, I found that there is a significant number of educators
and parents who are interested and I heard that – perhaps the Minister
can confirm that – one aided school even approached the Ministry
for discussion on this several years back. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-45977e99-cc26-4afe-bf72-f15252f21853"><!--a--></a>The second is related
to the GEP cut. The Minister questioned my use of the Primary School
Leaving Examination (PSLE) and GCE "A" level scores as a means of
assessing the performance of GEP students. I would like to ask the
Minister, are these not the same data the Ministry of Education
largely relies on currently to channel our students into different
academic streams and into schools and also in the Award of Scholarships? Does
the Minister not agree that parents today perceive the nine GEP
schools as being "the" good schools, as evident by the rush for
places in these schools? </p>

critical mass to put them into the centralised nine GEP schools,
I want to clarify specifically that I am not asking for GEP or accelerated
learning <em class="ph i">per se</em> to be abolished but I am asking for centralised
GEP to be scraped, and in place of it, being disseminated to different
schools. Does the Minister think that we can actually make use of
our cluster school system to achieve that critical mass?</p>

                  </span>: I thank
Mr Yee for his follow-up questions. First, on his point about his
proposal for an Integrated Primary 1 to Secondary 4 programme, I
have made two points. First, that we will be transferring the pressure
to Primary 1. Second, he mentioned my point about Finland that at
the end of Grade 9, 40% are on the vocational path. I want to use
that to illustrate a very basic point, which is that in our system,
we have many pathways and many options. This has been enhanced over
the years and the results have been very good across the entire
system. In the last few years, MOE had done major review of Primary
and Secondary education. In fact, Senior Minister of State Ms Grace Fu, who is
here, led the review on the Primary education. That is after very extensive
consultations with educators, specialists, parents and the broader
community.</p>

you will find that in all Primary schools now, we are implementing
a very wide range of very important and interesting programmes.
I mentioned about PAL, the Programme for Active Learning. I mentioned
about the learning support in order to raise numeracy and literacy.
With the additional bilingualism effort at pre-school, we will continue
to enhance that. Schools are given a lot more resources to level
up. I also announced earlier that we have now five major measures
to level up the lower and middle income families. And I have also
announced significant changes to Edusave.</p>

system, changes are being made. All these are part and parcel of
our entire effort to provide opportunities for all Singaporean students
and, at the same time, these are in line with our shift towards
holistic education and values-driven education. </p>

for us to look at how we design our system in a way that maximises
the opportunities for every child. At this point, with so many initiatives,
we must focus on good implementation. I have also mentioned how
in our system, that over 93% of our students are moving on to post-Secondary
education. In my second set of remarks, I also mentioned how vocational
pathways and technical pathways are very important. In fact, I deeply
believe, as Mr Zainudin Nordin has mentioned, that the ITE and Polytechnics
are crown jewels of our system. We have a system that works very
well and a system that has served all Singaporean students very
well.</p>

                  </span>: Well,
a large part of it, "yes", in the form of examination results at
PSLE. But we must also recognise the changes which have been made
over the years. Schools now have Direct School Admission (DSA),
in order to recognise a wider range of talent; in order for us to
develop a whole slew of different skills, aptitudes and talents. That
is how we have been doing it. Admission into schools like SOTA,
for instance, requires students to show the aptitude and interest
in the arts, similarly admission through sports. So, if you look
at the entire system, we have created many, many more options, pathways
and opportunities for our students. We have to recognise all these very
important changes which have taken place and I think we have to
go out and communicate better with our parents on all these changes.</p>

                  </span>: I would
like to thank the Minister for reiterating the policy on the Edusave
Scheme. I have four queries. First, can the Minister explain the
policy intent in giving Edusave only to students in national schools?
Second, what are the concerns of giving Edusave to private students?
Earlier with reference to the observations of Minister of State
Lawrence Wong on the challenges of embracing a private university, would
MOE consider Edusave to these private students if the school outcomes
of the private schools
are aligned to those in national schools? Finally, what changes
would MOE like to see to enable Edusave to be extended to students
in private schools? Sir, with all the support given to students
in mainstream schools and those in special needs schools, and given
the fact that there are about 6,100 Singapore students in private schools
of Primary and Secondary levels – including those who are homeschooled
but excluding those in special schools – are we not missing out
on the students in private schools who are part of Singapore's future? </p>

                  </span>: I thank
Mr Zainal Sapari for his follow-up questions. In fact, I will answer
all the four questions together because they are inter-related.
First, on the policy intent. Edusave is currently provided to Singaporean
children who enrol in MOE-funded schools. As I have mentioned in
my speech earlier on, this is because MOE encourages all Singaporean
children, as much as possible, to be enrolled in national schools
as this helps to build our national identity, common spirit and
social cohesion in each successive generation.</p>

with Mr Zainal Sapari when he mentioned earlier that <em class="ph i">m</em>
                  <em class="ph i">adrasahs</em> play
an important role for our Muslim community. And, indeed, not just
the Muslim community as he mentioned; in our broader Singaporean
community. It is for this reason that MUIS channels community funding
to support the <em class="ph i">madrasahs'</em> school operations, teacher training
and development, curriculum development and administrative support.
In partnership with MUIS, MOE also seconds up to two MOE teachers
to MUIS to advise on curriculum development and our National Institute
of Education also conducts customised training programmes for <em class="ph i">madrasahs</em> school leaders
and teachers. All these with a view of ensuring that educational
outcomes are good for all our students.</p>

about the 5,000 over students who do not get Edusave. Out of these
5,000 over students, about half of them, or 1% of our total enrolment,
are children with special needs and enrolled in our SPED schools.
We extend Edusave to Singaporean children in SPED schools because
their needs cannot be adequately met in a mainstream school setting.
The other half comprises students who are in <em class="ph i">madrasah</em> or in
other private settings.</p>

Sir, I know that it is probably not fair to blame the tuition syndrome
on MOE because it is reflective of the values we have in our society being
competitive, "<em class="ph i">kiasu-ism</em>" and parents who just want the best
for their children. I do want to ask if Minister thinks that it
is at least an issue that is worth looking into. I understand that
the Minister said the tuition syndrome is evident in many other countries
as well, but "<em class="ph i">two wrongs do not make a right</em>", and there
is a saying that says, "<em class="ph i">only dead fish swim with the stream</em>".
I do not think that Singapore is not quite dead and never has been.
So, I want to ask if MOE could think about facilitating dissecting
this problem. There are some of us who are willing to help. I ask

Sir. About NorthLight School, not Pathlight but NorthLight School,
the one that helps students who failed their PSLE. I think very
highly of Yen Ching, the Principal, and her team. But I hope the NorthLight
programme can be duplicated in more schools, like mainstream and
even special schools, instead of prolonging its legacy and starting
some more schools that are in the same fashion as Northlight like
the Specialist Schools for Normal (Technical) that I spoke about,
to which I am very against. I hope that the Minister will also reconsider this
plan and decision to start yet again some more segregated specialist
schools.</p>

                  </span>: I thank
Ms Denise Phua for being a very consistent advocate of better education.
I fully agree with her. First, on the tuition syndrome, as the Member has
said, a positive aspect is that our parents have high aspirations
and that we are a higher achievement society. Our society values
achievement and that is by itself a good thing. But the negative
aspect, which we all must be aware of, is that it imposes greater stress
on our children. They have less time for rest and it may take away
the joy of learning. As Ms Low Yen Ling and Asst Prof Eugene Tan
said earlier, really, at the end of it, our students need to be
lifelong learners, and the love for learning, the joy of learning,

is, first, make sure that our homework policy is well understood

to push for our schools to make sure that we set tests at the appropriate
standards. Importantly, I agree with the Member's point that it
cannot just be an MOE's responsibility. I think it requires the
efforts of the entire community and in particular, parents. We have
to reach out more to our parents in order to communicate what we
are doing. Let me share a recent experience. </p>

with two lovely children in a Primary school and I asked: "Are your
children receiving tuition?" They said no. They said, "Well, you
know, some parents said that enrichment centres set very difficult
questions and to help you to get an 'A', and I am little worried
that if I do not send them for that, they may not get an 'A'." So,
I asked, "Are your children doing well in school?" They said, "Yes,

encounter convinces me that we have to do more to reach out to parents
and to harness the knowledge amongst parents in our parent support
groups to do more – both to communicate what the schools are doing
and how parents can reinforce the learning in schools and at the
same time, to reach out, look at how we must take this holistic
education seriously. And earlier, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Hawazi
mentioned how we are providing some seed funding to parent support
groups. This is an area which the Ministry will do more. So I thank
Ms Denise Phua for her suggestion. I am always happy to hear her
ideas.</p>

MOE had recently enhanced the bursary schemes that were provided
to students in ITE and Polytechnics. We increased the quantum and
we extended the coverage so that it covers up to two-thirds of all families

continue to monitor these schemes and make sure that they are well

provides, we also know that there are community groups and self-help

Thank you, Sir. I welcome the move to reframe the CIP as Values
in Action. Since this may involve more work and effort on the part
of the teachers, can the Minister consider also giving an award
to teachers who go that extra mile to work with community partners
to impart values and to themselves set up a good role model to students?
My second question is about neighbourhood schools. Given that some
neighbourhood schools are struggling with falling enrolment, can
the Minister provide more funds in terms of quality teaching and
also in terms of resources to help these schools to level up so
that all schools are indeed good schools?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, I thank Ms Irene Ng for her question. On her suggestion of
recognising teachers for their efforts, that is something the Ministry
will consider and I thank her for her suggestion. On better resourcing
for neighbourhood schools, or good schools in our neighbourhood,
today our funding is driven very much by needs-based analysis. I
mentioned about the learning support programmes in our schools,
I mentioned about the additional allied educators in our schools,
and many of those programmes are funded on the basis of the needs
in the school. We will continue to look at this. I fully agree with
the Member that good schools in our neighbourhoods need to be well-resourced.
We are studying these issues carefully, looking at the needs of
different schools, looking at the profiles of schools and how we
can provide resources to our principals for them to do a better
job.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e0054bb6-ccf3-425a-ac41-5a73afce6faa">
                  <a name="budget__id-e0054bb6-ccf3-425a-ac41-5a73afce6faa"><!--a--></a>I gave the example of
Keng Cheng School and how the resources which we have given in the
form of the Opportunity Funds, in the form of additional school
grants and in the form of the trips for international experience
and so on, have been well-used, very creatively used by the principal.
It is not just the resources but also in sharing best practices
and which is why these innovation platforms and encouragement to
our schools to learn from each other are very important. Encouraging
our schools and our principals and school teachers to share best
practices, and to continue to think of ways and means for which
we can improve educational outcomes for all our children, are very important.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-acf8d4ee-aaa5-41ad-8e82-b0bad23d4db5"><!--a--></a>Mr Chairman, I realised that I earlier
did not answer a second question from Ms Denise Phua, if I may just
answer her briefly on this. Ms Denise Phua asked what we intended
to do with the experience of NorthLight school. Indeed, our intent
is not to duplicate another NorthLight. NorthLight serves as a trail
blazer for us to learn and because of the very innovative pedagogy,
because of the flexibility that was given to the school for them
to re-think their curriculum, to re-think their pedagogy and to
infuse the learning with a great deal of socio-emotional learning,
the school has shown how we can reach out more effectively. Earlier,
some Members had also spoken about how some students learn differently.
Mr Laurence Lien mentioned about kinesthetic learners and so on.
We are taking the experience from NorthLight school, studying it
very carefully to see how that can help us improve learning outcomes
right across our school system. Sir, our intent in all these is
very simple, that we want to find ways and means for which we can
reach out to our students, encourage them, motivate them and find
the best way to motivate each and everyone to learn basic competencies,
to learn lifelong skills and to be the best that he can be. </p>

for the year ahead has been forecasted to be between 1% and 3%,
and with this impending economic slowdown, various issues are certain
to surface, not least of which are social issues. Certainly, there
are a number of programmes and schemes to provide assistance to
our citizens who are already or would be affected by the economic
slowdown. The Work Support Programme (WSP), ComCare Transitions
(CCT) scheme and the Public Assistance (PA) scheme, are some laudable
examples. These programmes have been most useful and are high in
demand, especially during times of financial turmoil. Indeed, there
were most applications for the WSP and the PA scheme in 2009, about
the time when Singapore was most hit by the global financial crisis.</p>

the number of applications for WSP and CCT scheme seemed to be on
the rise again. Yet, the percentage of rejected applicants remained
as high as the other years. The bulk of the rejected applications
were due to either the applicants having sufficient income or other resources
they could tap on, or that they could not provide the supporting
documents and other reasons. Understandably, the financial assistance
meted out by these schemes are based on who needs it more, as well
as being limited by the amount of resources we have. As much as
our Community Development Councils (CDCs) and Voluntary Welfare
Organisations (VWOs) are doing their best to help these people,
Sir, is there a role, and I am sure there is, for the Ministry to
play an even more active part as well?</p>

may lead to workers being retrenched while others will suffer a
drop in income. Given our past experience, we have to anticipate
that more families will seek help while fundraising efforts from
VWOs may get harder. Two quick questions: how is the Ministry intending
to help such affected workers and their families, should the economic
slowdown happen and when there is this need? Also, how does the
Ministry intend to support our CDCs, our FSCs and the other VWOs?</p>

the inequality that we see in Singapore, and this appears to be
on the rise. Over the last few days, many Members have raised various
suggestions on how to reduce this inequality – some Members proposed
a higher tax for those who can afford it; some called for an increase
in tax for those with more than one car, others ask for tweaks in
the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) formula and others. I am supportive
of such calls to use the tax system to make life a little bit more
expensive for the rich, and to channel these monies to the poor.
But for today, I want to make a simple proposal, which is to increase
the tax deductions for charities. Sir, I want the rich to willingly
and compassionately help those causes they believe in, whether it
is for children, for education, for nature. In this regard, I ask
the Government to consider upping the tax deductions for donations
to any charity from the current 2.5 times to three times and to
make this a permanent feature.</p>

made, we need to address inequality through other means. We have
given more funds to CDCs and VWOs, but I think manpower is a major constraint
as well. Any CDC officer can be handling an average of 70 cases
at any one time, and this immense heavy caseload has been the norm
since 2007. In our helpline centres like the ComCare Call Centre
in Clemenceau Avenue, there are only about 16 staff manning 25 lines,
and the helpline, I believe, receives about 2,500 calls on average per
month. In 2009, the centre received the highest number of calls
at almost 29,000. Although there are plans to add three to five
more phone operators in the next six months, I wonder if this would
still be enough, given the coming economic slowdown.</p>

unveiled plans to build more FSCs and to inject $30 million of funds

able to offer its support in view of the looming economic slowdown

noble profession. We are also very fortunate to have many, many volunteers
helping out in the social service sector, whether it is in VWOs,
in various charities and other community organisations. These volunteers
are an invaluable resource to our society. The more complex cases
certainly need to be handled by other professional social workers
who would also need to follow up with active case management. Hours
are long, stresses are there. So, I salute the many volunteers that help
out and the many others who choose this as a profession. Given the
stresses that families and individuals are going through, we can
expect that their caseload, the workload of our social workers,
will increase and that we do need a lot more Singaporeans to consider
doing social work as a profession.</p>

economy becomes more volatile, our people are going to be more vulnerable
to such forces and as a result, find the stability of their jobs threatened
as well. Demographically, Singapore will face trends such as an
ageing society, smaller family sizes, sandwiched families and increased
family breakdowns.</p>

Ministry if it is reviewing its various help schemes to respond effectively
to these trends. Specifically, what changes is the Ministry planning
for ComCare. Are the criteria being reviewed and revised? Are amounts
being raised? What can Singaporeans expect?</p>

to slow down, companies would probably be scaling down their operations.
Indeed, many CDCs saw a large increase in the number of applications
for financial assistance in the last quarter of 2011 as compared
to the quarter before that. While CDCs have the flexibility to extend
the ComCare scheme to 12 months from six months now when the economy
is bad, is this option clearly communicated to the CDCs? Are there
clear guidelines too, on when and how to exercise this option?</p>

and 2011, an average of 33.9% of applications for ComCare Transitions
Scheme were rejected. Thirty-two percent of the rejections were due
to reasons such as the applicants not being able to submit supporting
documents or the withdrawal of application from them or simply not
meeting other criteria. </p>

of applicants rejected because of the lack of supporting documents
seems to be fairly harsh. Surely, there is more we can do to improve
the level of access to these applicants. I ask the Ministry to do
more on this front.</p>

in terms of demographics, I hope the Ministry will review the eligibility
and access of our various assistance schemes as well. Not only is
the kind of issues changing, but the profile of applicants is certainly
not static as well. My final question to the Ministry is to ask
how the Ministry is reaching out to these people, and to review
if these approaches are relevant and effective. Very often, the intentions
are noble, the schemes are there. But getting these messages and
this knowledge across to the people who need it, I think, is something
that we need to put more resources in to make sure that those who
really need it are able to receive it, know about it and in the
different language, even dialects, that they are familiar with.</p>

approach has enabled us to continue to develop as an inclusive society.
Apart from receiving assistance from the Government in the form
of reliefs, rebates and grants, Singaporeans also received assistance
from organisations and individuals in Singapore. For example, a
needy Malay family with five children in my constituency received
an estimated amount of over $5,000 from the Grow and Share package
last year. This amount includes the Growth Bonus, the National Service Benefit, the
Child Development Credit, U-Save, the Service and Conservancy Charges
rebate, the Workfare Special Bonus and the Workfare Income Supplement.
In addition, last year that particular family also received assistance
of around $2,000 from the local community for the family's basic needs

denied that the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore has made much
progress. Efforts to improve the development and achievements are
still carried out together. This collective effort had gone through
many changes and improvements. This is possible due to numerous
conversations and deep discussions between the community's leaders
and a strong partnership. Therefore, I am pained to read an article
in <em class="ph i">Berita Harian</em> dated Saturday, 3 March 2012, titled "The
Leaders' Forum must take a bottoms-up approach".</p>

were several facts that can create the wrong perceptions about the role
played by the Community Leaders' Forum (CLF).</p>

2003 as a platform for our community leaders to meet, discuss and
unite our strengths for the benefit of the Malay/Muslim community.
We realise that due
to limited resources, it was difficult for Malay/Muslim organisations
to implement effective measures. Therefore, the CLF became a channel
to merge the resources and strengths of these organisations, to
create programmes that are attractive and effective.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2353</p>

"a single twig can be easily broken, but if many twigs are collected
and tied together, it will become strong and difficult to break".
This is also the objective of the CLF, that is, to strengthen and
stabilise our Malay/Muslim bodies by identifying and leveraging
on each other's strength, and avoid duplication.</p>

that the "direction and decision of the CLF is still being determined
and decided by the political leaders, that is, the Malay Members
of Parliament". In my opinion, anyone who is guided by a mission
to help the community should not feel shackled or weakened or have
to bow down to another person who chairs a committee. As a community
leader, that person should be guided by the aims and objectives
of his job.</p>

and deeply values the contributions and ideas from all members of
the community. Due to this openness, the CLF that began almost 10
years ago, currently has almost 100 partners, with 15 programmes
coming from its four sectoral networks covering education, youths,
family and employment. This is a recognition of the CLF's effectiveness
in allowing its partners to run programmes that are effective in
helping their respective target groups.</p>

the statement that the CLF is "top-down". In fact, in 2010, the
CLF organised a Forward Planning Exercise (FPE) that targets young
Malay/Muslims so that they will also help to plan a more progressive
future for the next generation. The outcome of this effort is the
concept of "Creating a Caring Society" among these youth leaders,
which among others, led to the creation of the CLF Labs.</p>

channel that can be used by anyone, especially the youths, who have
good suggestions that can be used to help our community to progress through
the CLF's funding. One of the projects is the "Mobile Hub Community
Learning" project, which was implemented as a pilot project in October
2011, in Champions Way in Woodlands.</p>

2011, MUIS organised the inaugural seminar Muslimah and the Inaugural
Befrienders' Seminar as a lead up to the Mosque Convention held
at the end of last year. These were useful platforms for our stakeholders
to discuss challenges facing the mosque and how they can be strengthened
to guide and help the Muslim community in Singapore. Based on the
key findings of these discussions, how do our mosques intend to
enhance delivery of services to the congregants as well as to the needy?
We have to bear in mind that there is already an extensive network
of help schemes for Singaporeans who are in difficulties. So how
would the Mosque work with the various agencies to deliver help
to members of the Muslim community?</p>

for the Minister. Firstly, what is the total number of Mosque Executive
Chairmen now? Secondly, how effective is this scheme? I hope Minister
Professor Yaacob could give examples on the comparison between mosques under
this scheme and those not under the scheme. Thirdly, it has been
said or there is a perception that the salary of a Mosque Executive
Chairman is around $8,000 a month. Could Minister Professor Yaacob
explain this to avoid misunderstanding among the Muslim community
in Singapore on this matter? Fourthly, what has caused MUIS to change
its original position of not funding the salary of the Mosque Executive
Chairman to financing 20%? And, finally, what is the rationale behind
the system of financing the salaries of the Mosque Executive Chairmen,
where MUIS pays 20% and the Mosque 80%?</p>

Therefore, I am saddened by the comments made by the Chairman of

in a <em class="ph i">Berita Harian</em> article on 3 March. He said that the CLF
works using a top-down approach. I feel that this is an inaccurate
statement. During the previous term, as the Co-Chairman of the Family Development
Network within the CLF, I, together with Dr Maliki, visited all
the Family Service Centres (FSCs), and met with the members of Malay/Muslim
organisations, including the AMP, as part of our efforts to be inclusive.
Apart from giving encouragement, we also provided avenues for them
to work together in our effort to manage Malay/Muslim issues in
Singapore.</p>

the building of mosques to meet the religious needs of Muslims in

community in Singapore has never been intimidated to face the challenges
that lie ahead of them. As a community, we are always working together
in the <em class="ph i">gotong royong</em> spirit to bring about changes to our
community. In the 1960s, our community leaders took steps to set
up new organisations, such as the Malay Youth Literary Association
(4PM), and the Prophet Muhammad's Birthday Memorial Scholarship Fund Board
(LBKM), in an effort to overcome the educational challenges. As a
further step, they set up the Yayasan MENDAKI in 1982 to carry out
more focused and integrated efforts to enhance achievements in education.
We also continued to address the problem of drug abuse; not long
ago, we also implemented the Wrap Around Care (WAC) Programme to
address the issue of dysfunctional families. </p>

expanded efforts to help the community without being bound by their
jurisdictions. For example, ROMM gives counselling to young couples
to encourage them to think about delaying their plans to marry.
The Syariah Court also implements a counselling programme to help
couples facing marital problems to reconsider their decision to
divorce. </p>

Community Leaders Forum (CLF) in 2003 because we realised that we
need to make greater impact if we were to work together. Today,
CLF has more than 130 partners to carry out programmes that are
capable of reaching more than 150,000 clients. </p>

can be seen today. Our students continue to perform well. From 2001
to 2010, our children achieved better passing rates in the PSLE
and the GCE "O" and "A" level examinations. The rate of Malay students
who are going into post-Secondary education has increased in that
period from 74.6% to 86.2%. </p>

are also becoming stronger, with the divorce rate going down by
around 6.4% in the past five years. Marriage and divorce rates involving
young couples also dropped in the last 10 years. The number of marriages
involving this group declined 55% and divorces by 13% during that
period.</p>

of other achievements that portray our community as a community
that is able to move ahead and possesses the confidence to manage
various challenges. The value of contributions made by the community,
whether in cash or in other forms, has also grown. As said by Deputy
Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the incomes of all groups
have increased. We can expect the incomes of individual Malay/Muslims
to also increase. With this, the contributions to <em class="ph i">zakat</em> and
MBMF also grew from 3% to 7.9% last year. A total of $23.3 million
was collected for <em class="ph i">zakat</em> last year, an increase of 3% compared
to the previous year. With greater resources, our community is able
to carry out many more new programmes and added the number of aid
recipients. As a result, we have expanded the use of MBMF to upgrade
mosques and also for Islamic education. The number of people who
come forward to offer voluntary services has also grown. </p>

Lateef talked about consolidated care for the needy in our community.
This is what MENDAKI's Enhanced Wrap Around Care (eWAC) concept

last year in MacPherson. </p>

is the holistic help provided through a project manager, who co-ordinates
what each family member needs from different agencies. These agencies include
the South East Community Development Council (CDC), MacPherson Moral Family
Service Centre and the Sallim Mattar Mosque. Since its pilot in
the North East and the South East in 2011, the eWAC project has
reached out to 37 families to help them achieve a certain level
of healthy functioning. </p>

To give her children a good head start in education, she has recently registered

on education for our children. MOE's statistics show that the performance
of Malay students in PSLE as well as GCE "O" and "A" Levels has
improved over the past 10 years, between 2001 and 2010. Proportionally,
the percentage of Malay students admitted to post-secondary institutions

integrating secular subjects, such as Mathematics and Science, into
the religious curriculum and teaching these subjects in English.
We have benefitted from the progressive outlook of our leaders who

MUIS also ensures that the <em class="ph i">madrasahs</em> receive support. Such support
includes top-up allowances for our teachers' salaries, grants based
on student numbers and funding for various expenditures for facilities

2003, MUIS has invested $2.6 million in fully-sponsored training
for <em class="ph i">madrasah</em> teachers, Heads of Departments (HODs) and principals.
To address Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef's query, MUIS is well on track
to raise the professionalism of our <em class="ph i">madrasah</em> teachers. By

The new criteria are applicable from academic year 2012, and Mendaki
expects about 7,000 applications from new and existing students
to apply by July. Sir, I wish to assure the House that we will continue
to review the TTFS eligibility criteria from time to time, to ensure
that at least two-thirds of the Malay households in Singapore benefit
from the scheme. Mendaki will also continue to exercise flexibility
to assist families in unique circumstances, such as those with more
than one child in tertiary institutions.</p>

Supplementary Assistance Scheme (SAS) is an interest-free loan that

at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine with MENDAKI's interest-free

Despite her busy schedule, she still finds time to volunteer at

ratio for upper primary classes has been reduced from 1:12 to 1:8.
Second, MTS students are given materials designed according to their

home-school-community partnership has been strengthened to encourage
more students to enrol in the MTS, particularly those weaker in
English, Mathematics or Science. I urge parents to tap on the quality
and affordability of the MTS to benefit their children. </p>

at times, but divorce should not be seen as the quick solution.
Even as parties consider a divorce, we do not give up. The Syariah
Court pays much attention to saving marriages. On average, over
the last six years, between 2005 and 2011, the Syariah Court's Marriage
Counselling Programme (MCP) has successfully persuaded 44% of clients
each year not to proceed with divorce.</p>

offers a customised pre-divorce briefing in collaboration with PPIS
As-Salaam Family Support Centre to help couples reconsider their
decision, or pursue an amicable divorce if reconciliation is not
possible. Importantly, the briefing serves to minimise the impact
of divorce on young children. And this initiative has resulted in
17.5% of the participants not proceeding with divorce. </p>

collective efforts, divorce rates and minor marriages have gone
down, which Dr Intan has raised concerns about. Overall, Muslim
divorces have gone down by 6.4% from about 1,750 to 1,640 over the
last five years. This suggests that Muslim marriages are generally
showing stronger resilience. Muslim marriages involving minors have
also steadily decreased by 37% from about 410 to 260 over the last
five years (2007 to 2011). Likewise, Sir, on the flip side, divorces
involving minors have also gone down by 26%.</p>

pillars of our religious needs. I agree with Mr Hawazi that our
mosques should continue to enhance their service delivery, especially
to our needy. 2011 saw the inaugural Muslimah Seminar, or seminar

                  <a name="budget__id-9ad4693e-a199-4da3-a5ec-ec71d0bda12d"><!--a--></a>Sir, our mosques are not
only a place of worship, but have become an important community
space offering a wide range of socio-religious services. Mr Muhamad
Faisal Manap asked about the Mosque Executive Chairman (MEC). He
had five questions. I shall endeavour to answer all of them. MUIS
introduced the MEC Scheme in 2001 to provide leadership to run our
mosques and there are currently 11 MECs. With the support of the
Mosque Management Boards (MMBs), mosques led by the MEC have proven
to be effective in ensuring the quality of their programmes and
services, including community outreach and, equally important, inter-faith
engagement. The MEC work primarily for their mosque and the congregants,
and are therefore accountable to their MMB. Hence, it is right that
the mosques contribute to their wages. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6135fdd2-9af7-455e-b3b8-3a0ccd284372">
                  <a name="budget__id-6135fdd2-9af7-455e-b3b8-3a0ccd284372"><!--a--></a>At the same time, the
MEC also serves the function of helping MUIS, as the overall authority
for mosques, and to achieve its strategic plans for the mosque sector.
As a show of support to the mosques, MUIS thus bears 20% of an MEC's
salary, which is pegged to that of a Senior Manager in the social
services sector. I do not think it is right for us to discuss the
salaries of public officers in the House, I am sure the hon. Member would
know how much they actually earn because he is from the social service
sector. </p>

Fund (MBF) started out in 1975 to consolidate the community's spirit
of self-help to help build new-generation mosques. Renamed in 1984 as
the Mosque Building and MENDAKI Fund (MBMF), it was expanded to
include educational and social programmes. Since contribution rates
were revised upwards in 2009, the annual MBMF collection has gone
up steadily from $14.8 million to $16.5 million in 2010. In 2010,
half was allocated to Mendaki and religious education, while the remaining
half went to mosque building. </p>

were selected for the MUIS Mosque Upgrading Programme (MUP) Phase
1, which is expected to complete in 2013. Muhajirin Mosque in Toa
Payoh and Hajjah Rahimabi Kebun Limau Mosque in Whampoa have been rejuvenated
with barrier-free features, among other improvements. The remaining
three mosques – An-Nur in Woodlands, Al-Ansar in Bedok and Alkaff
Upper Serangoon Mosques in Upper Serangoon – are still undergoing
or soon undergo upgrading works. Additionally, Kampong Siglap Mosque,
down in Marine Parade, was also included under MUP Phase 1 due to
damage caused by a fire in October 2009. </p>

year, instead of 2014. We have identified 15 mosques for MUP Phase
2 based on their urgency for upgrading or expansion. From expanded
prayer areas to barrier-free accessibility features such as lifts,
these mosques will be spruced up according to their needs. </p>

mosque building is another important aspect to better serve our

will be creating a new <em class="ph i">wakaf</em> fund through consecrating and pooling
together shares of Muslim estates which will otherwise form part
of the Baitulmal or General Fund. Beginning with a capital sum of
$3 million, this <em class="ph i">wakaf</em> will be for the benefit of Islamic

is that more Muslims are doing financial planning and drawing up

Muslims can pledge up to one-third of their estates for the <em class="ph i">wakaf</em> fund.
The public may also contribute directly to the fund. Sir, MUIS will

to highlight that the Khalid Mosque in Joo Chiat is creating new <em class="ph i">wakaf</em> through

guide our community on areas such as Muslim inheritance law. MUIS
is also translating these <em class="ph i">fatwas</em> into English for publication. </p>

important as a common reference for the community. I am pleased
to note that our Syariah Court intends to publish a five-volume
Singapore Syariah Appeals Report (SSAR) series, which consolidates
significant Appeal Board decisions in both Syariah Court and ROMM
cases. Sir, this body of law will chart how the practice and the
development of Muslim personal law have progressed over the years. </p>

efforts to help our community thrive progressively, community-driven
initiatives are also critical. One key example, mentioned by many speakers
today, is the Community Leaders' Forum (CLF). Sir, the CLF Secretariat
has been developing the four key networks, namely Education, Youth,
Family and Employability. Mr Zainal Sapari recommended that the
community leverage on the CLF to build capacity to face future challenges. </p>

By all accounts, the future is paved with many uncertainties and
challenges but also opportunities. While education remains an important
concern for our community, we should also be collectively thinking
what education will be like for our community in the years to come.
And as the world gets more connected and learning and the sharing
of knowledge and expertise are no longer confined to the classroom,
how should our community leverage on new interactive technologies
to accelerate the pace of learning within our community? Sir, all
these point to developing new skills needed in our community in
order to navigate the future confidently. As such, Sir, I have asked
the CLF Secretariat to put forth some suggestions for our community leaders
to deliberate and consider the possibility of starting a fifth network
to drive this process. </p>

like to thank all Members for their questions. The Malay/Muslim
community has come far from humble beginnings. Our current successes
are all due to efforts put in bit by bit over many years, encouraged
by the Government to continue to do well in everything that we do.
We must continue to build on the successes together as a community
and nation, and not get distracted. The CLF Convention in November
this year will be an apt platform for us to reflect, review and
explore paradigms
to further build capacity as a community to face future challenges
and as a Community of Excellence.</p>

Sir, I am happy that 400 out of the 600 participants of the EPS

Sir, I do not have the exact details of what the profile are like
for the 200 participants, but based on the briefing that I have
been given by MUIS, most of the families face certain difficulties
that will require a lot more intervention. But I think the most
important point is that efforts are in place by MUIS and our partners
to help the remaining 200 families graduate. Some of them may be
families comprising older members and therefore it may be difficult,
but the important point is that we will continue to endeavour to
uplift them and move them out of the <em class="ph i">zakat</em> scheme so that
they can become self-reliant.</p>

for the public funds that are being used? The second point is that
I do agree that we should have our programmes coming from ground

they should put up their report card also on an annual basis, to
let the community know what is being done, the progress that is
being made for the community and how they have contributed as well.</p>

Sir, I thank the Member for the two questions. I agree with him
entirely that the funds that we use for the CLF and even other projects are
all public funds and they must be accounted for. I have asked my
staff to check and, in fact, the CLF is subjected to monitoring
by the Commissioner of Charities because these are public funds
and also by the Institutions of Public Character framework as we also
received donations. And as such, we have put in place a system by
which we monitor the progress of each programme. We evaluate to
see whether they are effective and those who have not met any of
the KPIs – and the KPIs are the KPIs in which we agree with our
partners – the programme will have to be reviewed or even stopped.
And we have done so for some of the projects in the past.</p>

year, we have a convention where a report is put up to all our partners
and so the partners have a copy of the report that will detail every
project, the funding that was spent, the targets of whether they
have achieved or not. In the name of transparency, this is what
we do and we have given it to all our partners. They are free to
share with their beneficiaries and their clients. I am confident
that they are aware
of what needs to be done in order to strengthen their CLF further,
in terms of their commitment.</p>

the various organisations – I cannot speak for other organisations
but on behalf of Mendaki, we are subjected to an annual meeting
where our members query us and we have to submit our report actually
to the Registrar because we are a registered society. Rest assured
that at every AGM, we detail our progress over the year, and this
is then published in our annual report which is made public, which
anybody can access. So, I agree with the Member that it is important
that organisations that use public funds continue to build trust
within the community by sharing successes, or otherwise, of their
programmes and how they have used public funds.</p>

Sir, I know the CLF offers a very good platform for all of us to
empower individuals as well as VWOs and MMOs to come together, working with
our community leaders. I am asking this question for the Minister
to consider whether we need a bit of expansion of the CLF where
we can have something under health and also management of the elderly.
Because this is a significant and important issue in the community
especially when we know that, say, for example, under dementia,
we have the highest rate of dementia amongst all the different racial
groups. There are certain unique ways of managing certain health-related
problems in the community, and it might help if we could, for example,
have a sub-committee under "network of family" to look into such
issues like healthcare and ageing population. </p>

Sir, the CLF was conceived in 2003 after extensive deliberations
internally by Mendaki and consultations with the community leaders. Since
the formation of CLF in 2003, the partnership has grown from strength
to strength, therefore reflecting that it is a platform which is
conducive for people to come in and do projects. Top-down, bottoms-up,
it depends on how you look at the glass. As far as we are concerned,
it is an effective platform because today, as I mentioned in my
reply, we have 130 partners, including many non-Muslim organisations,
who have decided that coming together on the CLF will help their
Malay beneficiaries in terms of getting out of the dysfunctionalities
that they may face.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cbea9098-e2d7-48de-bb93-4b450fbc3804">
                  <a name="budget__id-cbea9098-e2d7-48de-bb93-4b450fbc3804"><!--a--></a>I think the more important
point is, let us work together on this platform that we have created.
Sometimes we should not confuse between chairing the network and ownership
of the CLF. The CLF is owned by the community because the leaders
decided in 2003 to form the CLF. That is why, every year, we have
a convention to present to the community leaders our report. Before
the convention, the CLF Secretariat, which is housed in MENDAKI,
meets the community leaders to update them on the progress of each programme and
even if there are new emerging trends that need to be discussed, we
have presented them to our leaders. So really the process is consultative
and thus far I have not received any major complaints about how
the structure of the CLF has inhibited anybody from coming in. </p>

Sir, it would be difficult for us to replicate the kinds of schemes
that are available out there because our funds are limited. What
we do every year is that based on the TTFS – and I want to remind
the House that we are just managers of the TTFS because the policy
is decided by the Government, in close consultation with MENDAKI
– based on the savings, we basically re-channel the savings back
to the loan scheme. I cited the example of a girl who is studying
locally in a medical school, who could not get the TTFS because
at that time, based on the income level and her family background,
she could not avail of the TTFS but she took the interest-free loans
and she managed to graduate with a degree in medicine.</p>

is that, are there schemes out there to help? What we have been
doing over the last few years is reviewing our loan schemes so that
they are more targeted. For example, we have moved a lot more resource
to help some of the Polytechnic upgraders who, for one reason or
another, despite excellent results, could not get a place in local
Universities. They have to travel to Australia, Canada or the US to
get a degree and we decided to help them through interest-free loans.
They have accepted these and they are given a six-month period after
they graduated before they start repaying the loans. So, really,
we do not see this as a constraint. But our funds are limited. And
because the loans are interest-free – and it is a revolving fund
because we have to depend on the past recipients to return the money
so that I can loan it to future recipients – given the time value
of money, you will actually have an amount which is decreasing over

community well. The more important point is that if we need to really
send our kids overseas, we need to plan ahead – buy an insurance
policy and do other things that we can do to help our children secure
better future if they have to go overseas. This is something which
is being encouraged even by the Government. But at the same time,
what we have done in MENDAKI is, any Malay or non-Malay but as long as
they are Muslim students who walk through the doors of MENDAKI and
need assistance, we will do our best. We do two things – one, we
explore what we have internally and if we cannot satisfy the students'
needs, we will then explore externally. We have written on behalf
of the students to foundations like the Lee Foundation, Tan Kah
Kee Foundation, even other generous bodies to see whether they could
offer some kind of support. So far, it has been quite successful.
I have to thank the many partners that we have outside the community
in assisting us in this endeavour. </p>

Member, may I reply in English? Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked about the
challenges we faced in the <em class="ph i">haj</em> visa that were encountered
by the community last year. I would like to assure the House as
I have done in November last year in a reply to a parliamentary
question (PQ) that we have briefed all parties including the Association
of Muslim Travel Agents, the travel agencies who are involved in
the <em class="ph i">haj</em> business that those special visas will not be entertained anymore
because there were problems created by them. Having said that, we
will continue to work together with all the stakeholders to make
sure that those who are entitled will get the necessary visas to
perform the <em class="ph i">haj</em>.</p>

are a small country and our quota is very small. In fact, in about
three weeks' time, I will be going to my annual <em class="ph i">haj</em> meeting
to appeal again to the Saudi Government for an increase in quota,
which has not changed for many, many years. But we are grateful
because the Saudi Government has always relented in giving us additional
quota. Even the additional quota is not sufficient because the demand
is quite huge. But we will continue to work together. The most important
thing is that there is a registration system that MUIS has put in
place to allow would-be pilgrims to plan ahead, whether it is this
year or next year. You can put in and join the queue and for MUIS
to process this together with the agencies – the travel agencies
and the Association – to make sure that the pilgrims who are going
overseas to perform their <em class="ph i">haj</em> are well-taken care of. So
from this year onwards, we will not entertain any of these special
visas which was the source of the problem last year. Having said
that, when I attend the meeting at the end of March, I hope to be
able to appeal to my counterpart in Saudi Arabia to see whether
they can grant us even higher quotas. </p>

Sir, let me first thank the MCYS Minister and his team for the strong
support of the latest Enabling Masterplan for the Disabled. I seek
a status update on how the team might track and report on the plan's
progress in the future. Next, the need for a Masterplan. The Ministry
of Community Development, Youth and Sports has allocated a budget
of $2.1 billion; small compared to MINDEF's budget of $12 billion.
I believe that MCYS is in fact the best defence for Singapore with
its mission to build a cohesive and resilient society. However,
in budgetary terms, many of us are not certain if Singapore's cohesion
and resilience reflects a position of break even, surplus or deficit.</p>

to take reference from the recently completed Enabling Master Plan
for the Disabled, which it facilitated. For that plan, the committee
revisited the vision for the disabled; identified critical success
factors; identified the gaps for key focus areas; and engaged other
Government Ministries and key stakeholders to implement the plan.</p>

for Singapore society cohesion and resilience, what the "state of
the union" is, and engage other Ministries and key stakeholder groups
to formulate a Master Plan to Build a Cohesive and Resilient Singapore
Society. It should then
develop a Responsibility Matrix so that everyone, including the
rest of Singapore, can co-own and share in this construction effort.</p>

the social safety net. Sir, with this year's budgetary increase in
social spending, our social safety net is cast wider but is it stronger?
Much will depend on how well the gap between planning and execution
is monitored and closed. I wish to highlight just three gaps which
I urge MCYS to address. First, many helping hands. The strengthening
of the "Many Helping Hands" model to more effectively help those
in need was highlighted by Minister of State Mdm Halimah Yacob herself
when she was a backbencher. We are all aware that some people get
multiple or overlapping help; some are under-served and yet there
are those who fall through the social safety net. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-767bcca0-1447-4faf-a6cb-9eef46dc6d0d">
                  <a name="budget__id-767bcca0-1447-4faf-a6cb-9eef46dc6d0d"><!--a--></a>We often speak of the
need to be client-centric but the many helping hands such as the
Community Development Council (CDC), the Family Service Centre,
the grassroots, MPS volunteers, and other helping hands do not seem
to be very much to confirm the strategies and division of duties
to help, especially the families with chronic need. There is a strong
need for a systems integrator approach to manage help more effectively. Strengthening
the many helping hands and funding the use of tools such as case-management
templates, social eco-maps and residents' databases must be a priority, and
I urge MCYS to look into it.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b138ff4f-9d4f-4e2d-be0d-b545223b64f3">
                  <a name="budget__id-b138ff4f-9d4f-4e2d-be0d-b545223b64f3"><!--a--></a>Next, on a more rigorous
search for leadership talents and partners. Sir, the author of "Good
to Great", Jim Collins, highlighted the need to get the "right people
on the bus" for any organisation to be great. The social service
sector is no different. More than money, the sector needs more proven,
available innovative leadership talents. The appeal of taking the
path of least resistance – getting safe and familiar partners who ironically
could have contributed to some current poor outcomes for the clients
– should be resisted. I urge MCYS to embark on a more robust, rigorous
and systematic search for the right leadership talents and VWO partners
to help fulfil its mission.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4655535c-c292-4b28-9cdf-7899f84514d1">

Sir, the social service sector has often been given a badge of compassion.
We need to complement this with the badge of innovation to see even better
outcomes. One example is the recent campaign to recruit social workers
to staff the many new future-proof Family Service Centres which
are the bedrock of the Ministry's social service delivery system.
I watched with dismay the same strategies of advertising and paying
more to hire more. This is the same strategy that is adopted by other
Ministries in their race to compete for staff. Sir, MCYS should
help cultivate a more innovate culture in the social service sector.
In addition, I suggest MCYS set up an attractive Productivity and
Innovation Scheme to support organisations and individuals who can
contribute ideas and execute service models that are scalable and
effective. </p>

Sir, we receive reassurance from the Finance Minister to do everything
we can to keep up social mobility in each generation, and prevent
a permanent underclass from forming in our society. The realisation
of this intention will depend on how well MCYS puts concrete plans
into practice, the success of which will benefit the vulnerable

of which will also determine the social fabric of today and tomorrow.</p>

assigned to each family to look into the varying needs such as the
children's educational needs, financial assistance, parenting support,
nurturing home environment, student care, and job training and skill
upgrading for both parents. Could MCYS also work hand in hand with
grassroots leaders to identify such families in need and facilitate
and synergise with grassroots organisations, which want to set up schemes
to help this group at their constituency level? May I also ask MCYS
on the availability of social workers for these expanded areas of
coverage that require their expertise? What are the measures in
place now to increase this pool?</p>

the lowest income group is that they are not earning enough to cope
with rising costs. They are stuck in poverty and struggling, and
thus if left on their own, they will deteriorate further. According
to the Singapore Workforce 2010 Report, 20% of the resident workforce,
some 400,000 workers who earn $1,200 or less a month, based on Average
Monthly Household Expenditure (AMHE) cannot cover their expenditure
and they are in financial hardship.</p>

is monitoring if Singaporeans are living in poverty despite having
employment and how many such families are there? Does MCYS have
any plan to relieve their predicament? Apart from measures taken

recommend tweaking WIS to make it truly meaningful assistance for
low-wage workers?</p>

MCYS synergise with MOT on providing affordable specialised transport
services for the handicapped and the elderly? Transport mode that provides

inclusive society. Could MCYS give more transport subsidies to the

for people with mental illnesses is not adequate. I am most concerned
for those in the lowest income families. Can MCYS synergise with
MOH to give special attention and care to this vulnerable group?
Due to the poor home environment, such patients will have deficient
support that will make their conditions worse. These patients will
also cause negative impact to the family members who are already
struggling themselves. I feel we need a holistic approach in discharging psychiatric
patients to the community. We need to give tailored assistance individually in
the areas of financial assistance, family and home support. Could
MCYS consider long-term financial assistance eligibility for such
patients as well as public assistance, as it is hard for these patients
to find employment? MCYS can play a bigger role in the provision
of community care for mental patients. </p>

the issue of community-based services for our senior citizens. One
of the most desirable outcomes for senior citizens is to ensure
sufficient opportunities for healthy senior citizens to remain socially,
physically and mentally active to ensure their well-being. Indeed,
I have been advocating this and have spoken on many occasions in
Parliament. Sir, this is the basis of "live long and live well"
for the elderly
and that is to facilitate them to remain active and healthy. It
is better to strive for excellence in this area for prevention purpose
so that we do not need to cater excessively to take care of the
sick and disabled elderly. I would like to urge MCYS to look into
the establishment of "multi-service centres", integrating social,
health and other services under one roof for senior citizens. Could
MCYS synergise with MOH to see if we can have co-location of eldercare
services such as activity centres, day-care, day-rehabilitation,
and so on. I would like to urge MCYS to help set up these "multi-service
centres" as soon as possible and it will be ideal to have at least
one such centre in each constituency in the future.</p>

of one to two children of HOPE Scheme be increased to three children
from one marriage? I feel that it is the children of the low-income
families and disadvantaged families from failed marriages that need
even more attention and assistance. Would MCYS consider increasing
the household income criteria? Many of such families have problem
in purchasing HDB flats due to the lack of deposit for their flats.
Can HOPE's cash grant be allowed to use for deposit albeit with stricter
criteria on resale of such flats subsequently?</p>

Sir, this year's Budget has seen an increase in the social assistance
rendered to low-income families, especially in terms of education
subsidies. My deep concern goes for a particular segment of the
community, those who are divorced, they can be either men or women,
and in some cases, they fend for themselves and having to look after
and single-handedly raise their young children and oftentimes more
than a child. I met a resident who was recently divorced, as her husband
abandoned her for another woman and went overseas. She had two very young
children. She had nowhere to go and no savings and thus had to live
with her mother-in-law. They did not get along well and she was
treated harshly. She had to bite the bullet and endure the emotional
torture. This is but one example. Can we provide more support systems
both from a policy and programme level for this vulnerable group in
view of the increasing demands of raising children and ever-increasing
costs of living? </p>

have cases of women and children being abused and are victims of
family violence. And I mean beating from spouse and also cases of
ill-treatment by in-laws. There are also cases where the entire
family – husband, wife and young kids – being tormented by their
parents-in-law, both physically and emotionally. There is a limit
which the various NGOs, religious and self-help groups can sustain
and I foresee the imperative for Government intervention in the
set-up of more temporary shelters for wives, husbands, children
and even entire families for them to rebuild their lives. This will
also help to combat juvenile delinquency and keep the children off
the streets. </p>

and more homes for the aged, how can we better integrate overall
healthcare for the residents residing in these homes as they are
sometimes suffering from depression and mental illness. Is there
scope for greater synergy and collaboration between MOH and MCYS
in the care and management of the residents in such homes? </p>

year's Budget is aiming for an inclusive society that cares for
our vulnerable group in society is most uplifting. The various Government programmes
among other things would help the most vulnerable group in our society. Taking
care of the low-income, the elderly sick and looking after the general
well-being of Singaporeans have been the central focus of the Government
all these years, but this year's Budget is special.</p>

so and has some success in encouraging the rest of the society to
chip in through the "many helping hands" approach. We have the many
self-help groups successfully helping the needy in their respective
community. We have also the <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> School Pocket Money
Fund ensuring that school children are not deprived. We have the
Community Chest, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), the Kidney
Dialysis Foundation (KDF) and many other organisations that look
after the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

often marvel at our lack of vagrancy on the streets but this is only
because the Government takes care of those who are not able to look

in 2011 of 2,000 families is telling. To begin, we must rejoice when
Singaporeans in need are down but not out and are happy and very
proud to look after themselves and want to get out of their problems.
But I fear that some may have problems looking after themselves
and may not know where to get help from. The MCYS study also found
that one out of ten in the bottom fifth of income ladder is getting help.
We have currently about 100,000 families with an earned income of
$1,400, that is, one person in the family working, earning about
$1,400. We have ComCare to assist families in need, to get back
on their feet. Comparatively, as of last year, 20,300 families had
received help from ComCare against a background of 100,000 families
earning $1,400 or less. I hope the rest can cope and are receiving
some forms of help from somewhere, but I still fear that many may
fall through the cracks.</p>

many schemes to help and ensure that Singaporeans who may be down

We have schemes to ensure that if the parents misbehave and are
absentee parents, the children do not suffer. Hence, Sir, it would
be a travesty and a letdown if after all that we have done, there
are still many deserving help but are not getting help. I look forward
to hearing from MCYS on how they intend to reach out to those vulnerable groups deserving
help but for whatever reasons are not coming forward to seek help. </p>

Mr Chairman, our Government has consistently strengthened and widened
our social safety net over the years. This Budget is no exception
and many Singaporeans cheer the slew of measures that will provide
more support to the elderly, low-income and disabled. To date, we
have a significant number of social support programmes in place,
reportedly 100 of them offered by MCYS, various social agencies,
foundations and private organisations. </p>

to meet many residents who have difficulty getting by in life, whether
in finding a job or meeting medical expenses, dealing with a dysfunctional family,
paying for their children's education, or simple putting food on
the table. Sir, the saddest part is that many of them can actually
avail themselves to schemes that are already available and in place.
But they are not aware that these schemes exist, let alone how to
go about applying for them. </p>

the lack of coordination among the many helping hands whose well-intentioned
efforts to help the community are undermined by the disparate procedures,
duplication and piecemeal approaches. Some of the most helpful schemes end
up being best-kept secrets due to poor public awareness. Consequently,
we see low take-up rate for well-designed schemes and not reaching
those who could truly benefit from these schemes. </p>

Minister on how we can become more client-centric in our approach
to providing support and improve the accessibility of these schemes
as listed in the 88 pages of the "Assistance Schemes for Individuals
and Families and Social and Financial Need", as compiled by the
National Council of Social Service. How can we align the roles of
Community Development Councils, Family Service Centres and voluntary
welfare groups to make it easier for people to seek help? Could
we consider a localised help centre for each constituency as a one-stop
shop to advise and administer to residents the myriad schemes we
have and to also work in partnership with the local community and
grassroots to proactively reach out to those at risk?</p>

to be much more effective in outreach as the local community will

infrastructure to provide space for localised help centres. </p>

require assistance in a number of different areas. Residents often
share that they struggle, having to go through multiple locations
and multiple application processes. When I speak to them, apart
from feeling that the process is very cumbersome, I can sense that
it is also very demoralising for an applicant to have to tell the
same sad story repeatedly. Could MCYS enable integration of the application process
for the available schemes via one single database? So, we only ask once. </p>

                  </span>:
Sir, SPH's School Pocket Money Fund (SPMF) has done good work, providing
children from low-income families with pocket money to attend school.
Over the years, we have heard many happenings, stories of how needy
children benefited from the SPMF. However, I would like to suggest
a few improvements in the administration of the fund so that SPMF
can better achieve its objective of alleviating the financial burden
for children from low-income families.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bc0d1a9f-511b-42da-8a3c-124c32c866a9">
                  <a name="budget__id-bc0d1a9f-511b-42da-8a3c-124c32c866a9"><!--a--></a>Firstly, the SPMF acceptance
criteria currently state that it is compulsory for clients to undergo
casework and counselling with a social worker in order to receive
assistance. In many cases, however, clients do not require these
counselling services as they do not face any other social or family
issues. Take client A for example, she is a homemaker with three
school-going children. The husband is the sole breadwinner, drawing
a take-home pay of about $1,500. The children do well academically
since our client is able to supervise the children's studies at
home. The family also has minimal arrears because they budget their
expenses carefully. Yet, they could use some assistance to ease
their financial burden especially since a substantial portion of
the family's household income goes to the children's school and
daily expenses. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-a5ace9c7-f931-4204-9775-4102c7029aea"><!--a--></a>Sir, making casework and
counselling a compulsory criterion in SPMF applications could potentially
deter people like client A from applying for financial assistance
under the SPMF as they might find it a hassle to go through the
casework and counselling process when they do not have any issues
to work on. Yet, the financial assistance could make a huge difference
in enhancing the family's quality of life, thereby allowing the children
to better focus on their studies. From an administrative perspective,
we should also free up our social workers from having to conduct
casework and counselling for clients who do not really require the
service, so that our social workers can focus their efforts on more
urgent and complicated cases instead. I would therefore like to
suggest that the casework and counselling should only be required
for SPMF applicants, only when the social workers assess that there
is a real need for it. </p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
there was once a legend long time ago of a great fire that broke
out in the forest. People and animals started to run, trying to
escape from the fire. The owl was flying away when he noticed a
little bird hurrying back and forth between the nearest river and
the fire. He headed to this little bird. He noticed that it was a
small sparrow flying to the river, picking up small droplets of
water in its beak and then returning to the fire to put out the
flame. The owl approached the sparrow and yelled at him: "What are
you doing? Are you stupid? You are not going to achieve anything
by doing this. What are you trying to do? You must run for your
life." The little sparrow stopped for a moment, looked at the owl
and answered: "I am doing the best I can, with what I have."</p>

sparrow, our social workers similarly face challenges of resources in
the face of the heat of growing caseloads. Yet, like that little
sparrow, they continue to do what they can for the people that they
serve. Social work has very much been in the news lately. The recent
headlines also splashed "Wanted – 200 more social workers". </p>

this greater focus on community care amidst a crowded social services
landscape, the apparent lack of social workers will pose a greater
challenge in the years ahead. Our population is ageing rapidly,
our family structures seemingly have become less strongly-bonded
than in the past, all perhaps part of a globalised society. </p>

by MCYS provide a little insight into the little seen world of social
work. But how would the Ministry look at actual strengthening of
the sector and what are the strategies to better equip the social
service sector beyond what has already been announced? I applaud
the announcement by the Minister that the pay gap for social workers
will be narrowed over the next two years. However, it is beyond
that, that drives them. Passion drives them largely. Yet, at the
same time, resources will still be needed, and I ask the Ministry
to look into this.</p>

                  </span>:
Thank you, Mr Chairman, Sir. Let me start with the cut on the social
safety net. Budget 2012 has helped to improve and strengthen Singapore's
social safety nets in many ways, but I think one of the fundamental principles
underlying this is still the many helping hands approach. And this
means that there are a great many different agencies involved –
there are too many acronyms here for me to name − but these include
HEPAS, CEPAF, CCFA, ICCP, HSP, HOPE, SCFA, CCT, ComCare, PAWIS.
There are a lot of acronyms there. I was hoping for two things in particular:
one, it would be nice if these many helping hands could be a little
more integrated; and, second, I was hoping that this more integrated
approach can be implemented on a more localised level. Because I
think it is only at the local levels that we know very clearly what
each household needs. So, I hope that MCYS can take these points
into account. </p>

deal with is on the elderly. Budget 2012 is an inclusive Budget. There
are many initiatives focusing on the elderly. I think this is very
good. But one of the things that many people get very emotive and
upset about is when they see the elderly working in menial jobs
such as cleaning, and so on. And I think there is a sense of outrage
that, perhaps, these people should be treated better. This leads
to a couple of very specific questions. The first question is, what
kind of support is there to ensure that the elderly have the option
not to work if they are unable to, and what support can be given
to them. Second, it is not just about giving support to the elderly
but also in trying to build communities. So, what type of communities
can we build for the elderly? There has been a lot of unhappiness
in the news about elderly day care centres being built in various
neighbourhoods. What can we do to overcome this resistance to create
activity centres for the elderly? Of course, the final point is,
not all elderly do not want to work; some of them do want to work.
Are there any steps in place to help them perhaps get better skills
or to avoid discrimination if they so choose to work?</p>

on the social service sector. The social service sector is one that underlies
much of the implementation of the social safety net. Some of the
earlier speakers have said that the lack of social workers is probably
going to be a rising concern. There are a couple of things that
can be done. One of the reasons that we might have a shortage of
social workers is probably because of the wages of social workers. Obviously,
if we provide higher wages, hopefully, more people will come into
it. The second, of course, is to get a recruitment campaign which,
I think, MCYS is doing right now. But I am not sure if that is enough
to meet the shortfall. We understand from MCYS' press release in <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits
Times</em>, just recently on 21 February, the expected shortfall
of 200 social workers and there are only 800 registered practitioners.
So this seems like we need to increase the numbers by at least 25%,
which is quite substantial. So, I would like to know what steps
are in place to attract more people to this profession. </p>

the most important group of these people – the caregivers who are

Ministry helps to subsidise respite care for caregivers. MCYS could
also initiate the setting up of a support group for caregivers with
the help of social workers and counsellors who understand the challenges

of basic nursing and palliative care, food and nutrition. </p>

Could the Government help out in such situations, in terms of subsidies

social workers and caregivers is very important as they need to
give full-time care to the patient. Their physical and overall state
of mind must be in tip-top condition. </p>

Sir, it is good that the Ministry is finally addressing the problem
of social workers' caseload. I sincerely support the Acting Minister
in seeking to reduce social workers' caseload by 20%. We need to
empower social workers and other helping professionals such as counsellors,
who are actually on the ground forging the inclusive society. If
you overload them with work without adequate support, we cannot
expect them to deliver the quality of service that our vulnerable
need in order to stand back on their feet. </p>

its aim to increase funding for VWOs to reduce the average number
of cases per social worker from 50 to 40 from October 2012 onwards.
I would like to make three points on this matter.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2380</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-76271156-ff66-4119-9ecc-342f668efe95">
                  <a name="budget__id-76271156-ff66-4119-9ecc-342f668efe95"><!--a--></a>Firstly, in the answer to my Parliamentary
Question a few weeks back, the Acting Minister reported that the
average active monthly cases in Family Service Centres (FSCs) for
social workers have dropped from 49 in 2007 to 43 in 2011. This
is good news as the FSC is our frontline unit helping the vulnerable.
However, this means that we need to aim higher in reducing social
worker caseload by 20%. There is also no clear timeframe set by
the Ministry for the target. Would the Acting Minister consider
setting a target of 35 average active monthly cases for FSC social
workers, which is 20% lower than 43, to be achieved by 2015?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a64d8b9c-c23f-4837-a208-0f858c637b14">
                  <a name="budget__id-a64d8b9c-c23f-4837-a208-0f858c637b14"><!--a--></a>Secondly, in the longer
term, we need to reduce caseloads further to match international
best practices. In Hong Kong, 30 cases due to rising caseload in
the past decade are considered excessive. The Child Welfare League
of America, which deals with similar welfare issues as the FSCs,
recommends 17 active ongoing cases per social worker. Would the
Acting Minister consider setting a target of the ratio 1:25 for
FSC social worker's caseload to be achieved by 2020? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-340074e9-c133-42e7-ac70-bad91bc063dc">
                  <a name="budget__id-340074e9-c133-42e7-ac70-bad91bc063dc"><!--a--></a>In addition, studies should
be done to ascertain a caseload matrix to determine the optimum
caseload for each social welfare sector. Each sector presents different
kinds of demands on social workers. Medical social workers would
have different optimum caseload compared to FSC social workers or
CDC ComCare officers. We could learn from the US National Association
of Social Workers who recently proposed such a caseload matrix.
Perhaps, the NUS Social Work Department can be commissioned to do
such a study. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-381cf4f8-ea30-49db-b295-ad1d0f9502be"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, we need to also
consider workload as distinguished from caseload. Workload is the
amount of time required to perform specific tasks. When asked recently
whether the 20% reduction in caseload is sufficient, Care Corner,
Singapore FSC's Chief Operating Officer, Mr Daniel Chien said, "It
all depends on the intensity of the cases we handle." Other than
case work, social workers have to do many other tasks such as outreach
activities, attend to emergencies, appear in Court, work with community groups,
write up administrative reports, and so on. Would the Acting Minister
consider the measurement and tracking of workload, in addition to
caseload, with a view of reducing it to an optimal level, and also
with a view to reducing the administrative workload that is taking
the social worker away from case work? </p>

have to fulfil specific KPIs set by the National Council of Social
Services in order to receive funding for their operational costs
as well as for the administration of specific programmes. There
is no doubt that the Family Service Centres need to be accountable
for the usage of public funds and checks need to be in place to
ensure that these funds are used to achieve the intended objectives. </p>

are typically too broad or general to accurately measure and reflect
the actual work done and the results achieved by the VWOs. As a
result, FSCs are caught in a dilemma of devoting resources to achieve
the KPIs to secure funding rather than to devote such resources
to work which may not contribute directly to the KPIs, but to provide
more substantial and meaningful assistance to their clients. For example,
the funding of the number of social workers employed at the FSCs
is tied to the number of clients they serve every quarter. This
indicator fails to take into account the variations and the complexities of
cases and the amount of resources required to manage these different
cases. This is one example cited by the social workers which I have
spoken to. As such, it is my recommendation that the Ministry conduct
a comprehensive review of the KPIs which have been tied to the funding
provided to FSCs and, more importantly, to seek feedback of the
social workers in this exercise to make it as fruitful as possible.
The assessment of FSCs' contribution should not be based on just quantitative
indicators but also through regular interactions between the Ministry
and the FSCs to see what is actually happening on the ground. </p>

                  </span>: Sir, Singapore
is on a productivity drive to increase wages by at least 30% in
the next 10 years. The social sector and Non-Profit Organisations
(NPOs) have long suffered from low image and low wages. With rising
social deficits, this sector has much to do. Lest it be too little
and too late, I urge the Government to urgently and massively invest
into uplifting the image and productivity of this sector. One good
and easy way forward is through Information and Communications Technology
(ICT).</p>

sector is high touch-low tech, and so allow it to lag far behind
the private and even public sector in the understanding and deployment
of ICT. But this idea is flawed. It should be high touch and high
tech. Whether it is to manage volunteers, staff, donors, clients
or day-to-day operations, information and system integration, real-time
demand and business processes, ICT is a key productivity driver. Social
media like Facebook can do wonders in building interest groups and
support networks. Twitter can be used to crowd-source ideas, transmit
information and foster closer relationships between NPOs and the
people they serve. They are available free, but few know how to
maximise the mileage. </p>

NPOs found that 65% of NPOs said, "the lack of capital and talent
or knowledge" are among the major challenges the social welfare
sector faces in developing IT. Close to 40% of them said cloud computing
can solve all or part of their IT challenges. The study also shows
that with changing demand and greater mobility, the evolving NPO
service model requires ICT systems that will be able to dynamically address
its service needs, so they can focus on lifting service levels.
Could we do a similar survey to understand our ICT concerns and
needs?</p>

if everyone plays a part to strengthen our social capital. So, what
is social capital? Mr L J Hanifan, one of the first to use this
term in 1916, refers it to "social cohesion and personal investment
in the community". In a small <em class="ph i">kampung</em>, people know their
neighbours well, close ties are forged, mutual trust and care and
share is expected. Naturally, the sense of security and common destiny
boost the sense of well-being making better people, better society. </p>

capital, we can take a leaf from the organisation, National Endowment
for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA), which is a UK body
set up to allow the public to contribute ideas to solving daunting
challenges faced by the UK public services. One example is the "Strategies
with Kids, Information for Parents" scheme where it is a social
platform that forces positive relationship between parents and children.
Parents come together to share parenting tips and organise events
for family days. Young children are interviewed on how they would
like to be treated and what makes them happy. These have inspired
parents to think about what really matters. Sir, the foundation
of society lies in the strength of the family units, so fostering
family ties is the first step to building social capital.</p>

more to help meet the increasingly complex needs of the Singaporean community.
I argue this for three reasons. </p>

the "Many Helping Hands" approach. NPOs need to drive social change
and not be driven by it. They need to innovate and tackle root causes. Government
needs to lead by stepping back. In its funding approach, charities
are often tasked with raising funds for part of a Government-funded
programme. I would suggest that if it is a case of Government outsourcing
to the sector, that Government funds the specific programme fully,
and let the charities raise and apply funds raised from the public
to working on experimental and non-standard programmes. </p>

in a differentiated way. There could be two or three tracks, such
that those which are more independent and autonomous, and have shown
a successful track record of innovating are treated differently
from others that are still doing a good job but who prefer to focus
on running standard programmes. And we can experiment with more
funding for the former, and less active guidance and more co-creation
with the Government. </p>

to avoid the over-professionalisation of services. With the foreign
labour restrictions and ever increasing social needs, the supply
of labour cannot possibly keep up with its demand, even if you pay
more. This is where I believe volunteerism needs to play a much
stronger role. In fact, too many charities cast their mission too
narrowly and miss out on many potential volunteer opportunities.
This is sometimes the result of over-professionalisation of the
services they provide. Yet, numerous human services would not be
as effective if they were merely professionally provided, as the
compassion provided by the volunteers can be an integral part of making
that service effective. Charities must recognise the benefits of
engaging the community in their efforts and invest in better volunteer
management. </p>

to talk about community development and empowerment. When I visited
the US two years ago on the Eisenhower Fellowship, my biggest take-away
was learning about the Asset-Based Community Development (ABCD)
model of community organising. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-56a41a14-d367-4868-bc93-2f79e3846c8c">
                  <a name="budget__id-56a41a14-d367-4868-bc93-2f79e3846c8c"><!--a--></a>The ABCD approach focuses
on the half full, not half empty glass, that is, the assets in the
community. It looks at how people from various levels of the community
can step up to be active contributors. It counteracts the predominant
needs-based approach to development, which presents a one-sided
negative view that often compromises community capacity building
and social inclusion. And it rests on the principle that the recognition
of strengths, gifts, and assets of individuals and communities is
much more likely to inspire positive action for change than an exclusive
focus on needs and problems. The key to the ABCD is in the power
of local associations to drive the community development process,
identify community assets and then connect them to multiply their
power and effectiveness. </p>

with this approach. Let me just give Members an example. We introduced
this concept to the committee of the Children's Village in Bukit Timah
where they were trying to build a cohesive village concept to replace
childcare centres. And the core committee engaged parents of pre-schoolers
by holding a Parents' Night, a meeting where the organisers prepared
no agenda and the agenda was entirely decided by parents and volunteers.
This experiment worked very well with many enthusiastic parents
contributing ideas and executing the ideas, like storytelling sessions,
family outing days, and this went well beyond the committee's preconceived plans.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-168c49ea-a9d1-4269-90f4-b0159dbce746"><!--a--></a>NVPC has since tried to
introduce the ABCD concept to other communities. But we observe
a few difficulties. Agencies on the ground do not know how to lead
by stepping back; they often see it as a separate programme and
they are reluctant to shift mindsets. And they fear the lack of
structure and fluidity of the ground-up initiatives. </p>

if I were to ask hon Members present in this House if they feel

that all of us should feel younger than our true age.</p>

that how a person perceives ageing can actually affect how long
they will live. It is therefore important that we encourage our
seniors to have a positive attitude about ageing. If they have a
positive mindset, they can develop and strengthen their mental,
physical and spiritual resilience. Their will to live will be increased
and they will be more resilient to illness. They will also develop
a greater zest for life!</p>

Perception and Attitudes Towards Ageing and Seniors Survey revealed
that 80% of the interviewees felt that seniors can play an active
role in society. I do like to urge the Ministry to do more to shape
positive attitudes for both our young and older Singaporeans towards
our seniors and ageing. What can the Ministry do to honour our seniors
and celebrate ageing? How elderly are perceived can have implications
on how they are treated in our society. So, whether it is about
building or locating elderly care centre or Studio Apartment, taking
our trains and buses or at our workplaces, we need to shape positive
perception and discourage stereotypical views of our seniors.</p>

Sir, over the past few days, various Ministries have outlined plans
to prepare for an ageing population. The MND announced the EASE programme,
to make homes elder friendly. The Ministry of Health rolled out comprehensive
plans to ramp up medical infrastructure, particularly home care,
and intermediate and long-term care. </p>

Jurong last night, a grassroots leader commended the Government
for these plans, but said that it would be far better to emphasise

live well, live long and have peace of mind. I agree.</p>

Mr Chairman, the recent Budget announcements by the Ministry of
Health have spelt good news for families in terms of assistance
and relief for childcare and elderly care and people with disabilities.
All these have been generous. More support can be extended especially
to home-based caregivers. To elaborate, there are those who choose
to take care of their children, elderly parents or family members with
special needs or who are disabled, instead of putting them in a
care centre or nursing home. These Singaporeans, including their
spouses, should be able to enjoy higher personal tax reliefs, more
financial assistance schemes and the flexibility to draw from the
Medisave for medical expenses incurred by a family member whom they
are caring for.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-867de2ac-53e1-4ed2-9dd4-35322255262f"><!--a--></a>For children, I am particularly
concerned about the spate of cases in recent years involving the
abuse of young children. I believe more paediatric social workers
working closely
with the Residents' Committees (RCs), Community Development Councils (CDCs)
and Family Service Centres (FSCs) are needed. In addition, after
school care centres can help to support working or absent parents
and provide a safe and nurturing environment for children potentially
at risk of abuse. These centres can also provide opportunities for
older Singaporeans to be re-employed and take up positions as after school
caregivers. This may be a way of re-employing older Singaporeans
while, at the same time, encouraging the transmission of values
and sharing of life experiences from senior citizens to our young. </p>

who choose to take care of their grandchildren should be recognised
for their efforts in taking care of the future generation and in
parting family values. Such senior citizens can be given more financial
assistance such as further property tax reliefs and enhanced medical
subsidies. I hope the Minister can consider these proposed measures.</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, in fact, I have devoted most of my allotted time for this MCYS
cut because many Potong Pasir residents have asked me to raise this issue
of growing old and, more importantly, how to look after our elderly.
Sir, as many of us may know Potong Pasir is a mature estate and
we are very fortunate to have living amongst us many old folks and
people above the age of 50. In fact, about half of our residents
there are above the age of 50. On our part, my grassroots and I
will look after our residents as well as we can. But I think we
can do more and certainly we need more help. Sir, the reality is
this, we will all grow old and at some point in our life, we will
fall sick and at some point in our life, we will need caregivers
to look after. That day must come.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-48a8c067-3a05-4d44-a031-892a13f1b443">
                  <a name="budget__id-48a8c067-3a05-4d44-a031-892a13f1b443"><!--a--></a>Sir, the issue of ageing
is not an isolated concern. This is an issue that cuts across our Ministries.
A holistic approach is needed. MCYS cannot work in isolation from
MOH, whilst the latter cannot work in isolation from MOM or MOF.
Ageing and the care of our elderly is not the concern of one household
alone, but that of a community. It is not an issue that can be sealed
off within the walls of a nursing home. It is most definitely not a
concern faced only by the less well-to-do.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d5ee4fe1-fc5c-472b-bd33-b4da560375d4">
                  <a name="budget__id-d5ee4fe1-fc5c-472b-bd33-b4da560375d4"><!--a--></a>We in Singapore are lucky
as we have numerous schemes put in place to assist with the day-to-day
care of our aged. In Potong Pasir, for example, our Citizens' Consultative Committee
has implemented the Community Health Engagement Programme in collaboration
with Tan Tock Seng Hospital. This is a scheme which empowers the elderly
and in this case, those above the age of 50, to take charge of their
own health. The programme aims to equip them with the skills that
are essential for them to lead an independent and healthy life through
education, training and participation in various programmes. This
programme also creates a sense of comradeship amidst the older members
of our community as they spend time together and share experiences. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-871726d4-e1dd-4bd7-a4c2-d49eb3ae487e"><!--a--></a>Sir, ageing cannot be reversed. It is
inevitable. It thus cannot be an easy process for many. Our Potong
Pasir programmes try to enable the older members of our community to
age with grace and, more importantly, with care and company. They
know and can be assured that they are not "alone in the boat".</p>

or infirm, this period, the very late winter of their lives, where practically
all the leaves have fallen and all seems dark, it can be bleak and
endless. It is here that caregivers play an essential and often
irreplaceable role.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-433aa3ef-4dea-4811-b448-2c2d4fb35f34">
                  <a name="budget__id-433aa3ef-4dea-4811-b448-2c2d4fb35f34"><!--a--></a>In Singapore at present,
caregivers come in three forms: (i) institutional care, be it in the
form of nursing homes or hospices; (ii) foreign domestic helpers;
and (iii) family members. It remains the case that nursing homes
are an option of the minority, especially for the more infirm who
require round the clock professional care. Even so, the demand for
nursing homes far outstrips the supply. Some of the chief constraints are
the price of land and manpower.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f37847f4-0dda-41ee-bf99-7b98228fa1d7">
                  <a name="budget__id-f37847f4-0dda-41ee-bf99-7b98228fa1d7"><!--a--></a>Whilst it remains in the
forefront of our Asian psyche to care for our elderly within the family
as much as possible, we cannot run away from the realities of our
society. Families are faced with heart wrenching choices. More must
be done to assist them in finding alternative professional care
for their infirm elderly. Where they cannot manage or cope, it is
our role to step in and assist.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8dd1289b-219c-4030-8259-1e7d226faa8c">

is disconcerting and somewhat disturbing when we encounter Singaporeans
who do not want a hospice or nursing home in their neighbourhood. When
asked why, some fear that the prices of their homes would be affected
whilst others just do not care for it. Of course, they are thankfully,
but a very small minority in our society. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1f29f07f-1e8d-406a-9a18-e3d5c1eadc9f">

I may suggest, is a community for the aged. Granny flats or small exclusive
housing developments where only the elderly can live, where all
the facilities that they require are within their reach and things
are built to cater only to their needs, where they can mix and live
with others who like them seek solace and company in their old age,
where professional healthcare workers can assist them on a day-to-day
basis so that they can go by their lives with as much dignity and
independence as they can hope for. I do not know if it will work
in our society, but it is food for thought. One can see the attraction.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9fbdf6db-b48c-43d4-88f7-908d804ff889">

are whom I would refer to as "under-the-radar caregivers". In fact,
it is they who probably provide most of the physical care for our elderly.
For families who can afford a domestic foreign helper, the latter
plays a very important role in the day-to-day care of the elderly
family member. In fact, she is entrusted with their care on a daily
basis – from their physical needs to their meals, providing them
with their medicines, taking them to the hospital for check-ups
and patiently walking beside them as they take a slow stroll in
the evenings.</p>

domestic helpers cannot be underestimated. In our society, they
also help to relieve the demand for institutional care and allow
our elderly to continue to live in the comforts of their own homes
in the eve of their days. However, many helpers who are plunged
into the world of caring for the sick and elderly cannot perform
all the major Activities of Daily Living (ADL). They are often untrained
and ill-prepared. </p>

                  <em class="ph i">Straits

giving training were gearing up for a busier year ahead in light
of care giving training being made compulsory for families seeking
to receive a grant to offset the costs of hiring a domestic helper. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f640c40a-ecce-4972-8dea-fa4eca89c143">

to see that more training providers are available. However, it would
be useful to equip domestic helpers at an early stage with the basic skills
required to look after older members of a family. As the demand
for such care within one's home rises, it may be more cost effective
to provide such training at an early stage as part of the criteria
for domestic work employment.</p>

family members play the most important role in providing care for
the elderly. Hence, I saved the best for the last. There is nothing
like family. However, many family members find themselves unequipped
to deal with the challenges of caring for an aged family member.
As illness and age make the older person more dependent, and at
times temperamental, the family may find itself under severe strain
in more ways than one. It is not because family members do not want
to care for their elderly family member but it is because they do
not know how to.</p>

line-dancing classes, etc, in our Community Clubs. Perhaps, the
People's Association can also work with MOH and MCYS and private healthcare
providers to run classes for people who provide daily care for elderly
family members. These classes can also deal with simple issues such
as assisting family members in recognising the problems of ageing
and the onset of problems such as dementia, incontinence, diminished
mobility, etc.</p>

care giving for our elderly cannot be emphasised more. It is only
going to grow in importance in the coming years. We must work hand

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Chan Chun Sing</strong>
                  </span>: Based
on MOF estimates, the overall net increase in tax revenue from the
Integrated Resort (IR) casinos was about $900 million for FY10.
For the first 10 months of FY11 (between April 2011 and January
2012), the figure was also about $900 million. Both amounts have
taken into account the loss of tax revenues from the resultant decline
of other gaming activities such as lotteries, horse and sports betting and
fruit machines operated by clubs. </p>

of visitors to the two casinos reside with the IR operators. The
two operators recently released data which showed that 136,434 and
137,259 unique local patrons visited Resorts World Sentosa (RWS)
and Marina Bay Sands (MBS) casinos respectively in 2011. Taking
into account an estimated 30% overlap in local visitors between
both casinos, the number of locals who have visited the IR casinos
in 2011 is thus around 200,000. The respective operators have previously
released information on the proportion of local casino visitorship,
and these were reported to be in the range of 20%-30% of total casino
visitorship.</p>

patronise the casinos, do not appear to visit frequently. There
is however a small group of frequent gamblers which we are concerned
about. MCYS is looking into introducing "circuit-breakers" and expanding
third-party casino exclusion for a small group of problem gamblers
and financially vulnerable local gamblers who visit the casinos
frequently. MCYS will also be studying responsible gambling practices
in other casino jurisdictions, such as Holland, Austria and Australia, and
will consult the IR operators and public on these measures.</p>
