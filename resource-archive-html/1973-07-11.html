<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Withdrawal)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs whether the Singapore Government has  been

consulted on the Australian Government's intention

to  withdraw its military forces stationed in this

region  under the ANZUK arrangement; what  is  the

view   of  the  Government  in  relation  to   the

statements by the Australian Government over  this

question;  and  whether by the withdrawal  of  the

Australian   military  forces  the  security   and

stability of this region will be affected  in  any

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there were

discussions   between  the   Singapore   and   the

Australian   Governments  prior  to   the   recent

announcement by the Australian Government  of  its

decision  to withdraw by the end of February  next

year  all  but  600  Australian  troops  based  in

Singapore. However, by April 1975 all but  150  of

these 600 men would be withdrawn. The decision  by

the  Australian Government has been  as  expected.

The  Australian  Government has  said  that  after

April  1975  the remaining 150 men would  help  to

facilitate programmes of combined exercises and to

support those engaged in such projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australian decision will affect the present

Five-Power   Defence   Arrangements,    hut    the

usefulness  of  the  defence arrangements  remains

because  of  the  contributions  which  the  other

partners will continue to make. The Prime Minister

of  New  Zealand, in a statement on 4th July,  has

reiterated  that  there  is  no  question  of  New

Zealand   forces  being  withdrawn  as   long   as

Singapore wants them. The United Kingdom similarly

will  continue to maintain forces at their present

level.   This   being  the  case,  the   Singapore

Government is of the view that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



Five-Power  Defence Arrangements can  make  useful contributions towards peace and stability  in  the area.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up of espionage unit)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  whether the Government is  aware  of  the

fact   that   a   so-called  military   electronic

espionage  unit had been set up by the  Australian

military  forces in Singapore; and what steps  the

Singapore  Government proposes to take  to  ensure

that no such unit may be allowed to be set up here

and furthermore that our non-aligned policy is not

prejudiced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

Government  does  not regard the Australian  Radio

Intelligence  Unit in Singapore  as  an  espionage

unit  set up by the military services to undermine

and/or  subvert the security of Singapore and  its

neighbours.  It is a normal practice  of  military

establishments of all countries to maintain  radio

intelligence   units   to  serve   their   defence

requirements.  In view of this, I see  no  grounds

for  concern that our non-aligned policy has  been

prejudiced in any way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SPECIAL BUS SERVICES FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   if   he  will   look   into   the

feasibility  of  the bus operators providing  some

buses  for  school  children  only  on  their  bus

routes,  particularly at the end of the  afternoon

school sessions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as suggested by the Member

for  Anson, I shall ask the Bus Services Licensing

Authority  and the Singapore Bus Service  Ltd, to

look into the feasibility of providing special bus

services  for school children, at the end  of  the

afternoon school sessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary, however, for me to explain that

the  public bus service is not the only  available means of transport



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



for school children. There is in existence  a

separate  school  bus service,  the  expansion  of

which was one of the recommendations contained  in

the  White  Paper on Reorganisation of  the  Motor

Transport  Service of Singapore (Paper Cmd  21  of 1970).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of an original fleet of 149 buses, it was

hoped that by the end of the three-year Plan, i.e.

June  1973,  there would be in existence  a  total

fleet  of  600  buses. I am, however,  pleased  to

disclose that the actual fleet of school buses  at

the  end  of last month reached a figure of  1,574

buses,  which  represents 2 1/2  times  the  target

figure and more than ten times the original  fleet

in  1970 - three years ago. The rapid expansion of

the  school  bus fleet clearly shows that  parents

and  school  children are most pleased  with  this

service, and those who are not using this  service

as  yet  are  advised to do so  early  instead  of

having  to undergo the inconvenience of having  to

compete  with  the adults during the evening  peak

periods for bus travel.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister says that there are 1,574 buses.  Can  he

tell us what is the accommodation of each bus?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the capacity varies with

the  type of bus. Some are mini-buses and some are

large  buses.  Whatever it is, overall,  they  are

performing an excellent service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>WORK PERMITS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Exemption for Singapore blue identity card holders)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  whether he will consider exempting holders

of  Singapore blue identity cards who have resided

in the Republic for more than 10 years from having

to apply for work permits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, work permits have been freely issued

to  applicants  holding  Singapore  blue  identity

cards.  Holders  of Singapore blue identity  cards

are as a rule given work permits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



valid for two years as against one year  for

other categories of applicants. It is not proposed

to  exempt  holders  of  Singapore  blue  identity

cards,  who  have  resided in  Singapore  for  ten

years,  from  having to apply  for  work  permits.

However,  because  many  of  the  Singapore   blue

identity card holders who are on work permits have

family roots in Singapore, consideration is  being

given to granting this category of applicants with

a five-year work permit instead of the present two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member will recall that recently my

Ministry  announced that permanent residents,  who

pass  the  appropriate skill test or  who  possess

acceptable   training  qualifications,   will   be

eligible for citizenship if they satisfy the  ten-year   residential   qualification.   Holders   of

Singapore  blue identity cards who  are  unskilled

should,  therefore, strive to upgrade their  skill

so  that  they  can qualify for citizenship  under

this scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

is the Minister aware that the privilege mentioned

by  him  only applies to workers in the industrial

sector?  Is  he also aware that many of  the  work

permit holders in the white-collar group, in other

words, the commercial sector, will not enjoy  this

privilege  at  all  because there  is  no  way  of

assessing their skill as mentioned?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the privileges will be

extended  to  the  white-collar workers,  provided

they have attained a certain level of skill. There

are  a number of recognised examinations which the

white-collar workers can take. But,  I  think,  we

can go into the details when a decision is made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask  the  Minister what are  the  criteria  for

accepting   applications  for  work  permits   for

foreign workers, particularly Malaysian workers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Can the Member please repeat the question?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, my question is: what are the

criteria for approving work permit applications by

Malaysian workers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, their skill will be the main consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I have discovered that in

the  factories  there are a  lot  of  work  permit

holders from Malaysia, who have no skill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from

skill,  we  also grant work permits to  applicants

who  are  prepared  to  work in  the  construction

industry.  It  is  quite correct  that  there  are

unskilled  workers in the factories,  particularly

in  the  pioneer  industries. But ultimately  each

case will be considered on its own merit.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  while  welcoming the Minister's remark  that

citizenship would be considered for those who  are

skilled, would the Minister care to enlighten what

"skill"  is  in  his  terms?  "Skilled  work"   is

relative.  What  are  the  categories   that   the

Ministry would term as "skilled workers", for whom

citizenship can be considered?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry

has arranged with the Industrial Training Board to

conduct  skill tests for applicants who  are  work

permit  holders. If they can pass the skill  test,

they  will  be  eligible  for  consideration   for

citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know

whether  by  and large there is any relaxation  on

the issue of work permits?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I think the present work

permit policy is already liberal enough, and there

is no need to relax it any further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can, however, assure the Member for Sembawang

that  the  need for establishing creches in  other

areas  of  Singapore will be kept  under  constant

review,  and  more creches will be  provided  when

been successful in being allocated flats; (b)  how

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



will  consider according the priority to  retiring

public   officers   one  year   prior   to   their

retirement.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the existing

policy  only  retiring  public  officers  who  are

required   to  vacate  Government  quarters   upon

retirement  are granted priority for the  purchase

or  rental of Housing Board flats. Up to the  31st

March  last,  a  total of 374 such  officers  were

granted priority. Not one qualified applicant has,

in fact, been refused such priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not considered necessary to accord priority

to such retiring public officers one year prior to

retirement  because  they  are  only  required  to

vacate their quarters when they retire.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

give priority to retiring public officers one year

before their retirement, because some of them have

lodged certain complaints to me on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ch'ng, would you convert that into

a question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of

the fact that many officers have not been able  to

get Housing Board flats upon retirement, is it not

necessary to advance their priority by one year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the answer I gave just now is

that  not  one qualified public officer  has  been

refused  priority. In fact, they do  not  have  to

wait  very long because they are granted priority.

If  they are not granted priority, then they would

have  to wait three or four years. Priority  means

that they get the flats before others do.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, can the Minister clarify

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> By "public officers", we mean public

officers  working  in the civil service,  and  not

officers in the statutory boards like the Port  of

Singapore Authority or the Public Utilities  Board

who  have  their own quarters. Their problems  are

really  the  problems of the particular  authority

<div align="center"><b>(Remission for sole family house)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if he will consider introducing  amending

legislation to remit estate duty on a house  which

is  the  only  one owned by the deceased,  if  the

house is continued to be occupied by the family of

the deceased.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the hon. Member may remember  that

before  8th March, 1972, the exemption  under  the

Estate  Duty Act was up to $10,000. In  my  Budget

statement  for the year 1972-73, one  of  the  tax

concessions  I  announced  was  a  remission  from

estate duty for estates worth up to $25,000. I  am

not  inclined at present to consider  any  further

concession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong's suggestion to amend the

legislation to remit estate duty on a family house

would  result  in  an  unnecessary  sacrifice   of

revenue  in the case of the wealthy. For  example,

if,  as  has occurred, a family house  left  by  a

deceased  multi-millionaire is worth  $8  million,

the  remission of the estate duty on such a family

house would be $5 million. I consider also that it

would  not  be  desirable to give remission  other

than within the limit I have set, on a sole family

house  specifically in distinction to  savings  in

different   forms,  such  as  insurance  policies,

deposits  in  banks,  Post  Office  Savings  Bank,

Government bonds, shares, etc.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Minister

realise that with the present escalation of prices

of  properties, the estate duty may well result in

bankrupting a family concerned which owns one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



house,  which  might  have been  purchased  around

$20,000  or  $40,000 but is now  valued  at  about

$200,000? The family may have to sell the house in

order to pay estate duty and fritter away the rest

of  the  money in rentals until they get a Housing

Board flat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I realise the

consequence  to  someone leaving $200,000  to  his

family. But I would expect anyone who has  such  a

valuable  house  to take the usual  precaution  of

transferring the house during his lifetime to  his

beloved ones.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, under such circumstances, can

the  Minister inform the House whether steps would

be  taken  to  maintain or stabilise  the  present

level  of  prices  of property,  or  even  perhaps

reduce  them, so that the prices will not escalate

further  and thereby expose prospective inheritors

of  estates to this problem of having to pay  very

high  estate  duty and facing the  possibility  of

losing the sole family property?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a long question, Mr Conceicao.

<div align="center"><b>(Provision of funds)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Finance, now that a site has been obtained  for  a

swimming  pool in Upper Serangoon for the  benefit

of  the  residents and in particular the thousands

of  school children in the Upper Serangoon/Punggol

areas,  if  and when he will provide the necessary

funds for the construction of the pool, bearing in

mind  that  there  is no public swimming  pool  in

those areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the necessary

funds   for   construction  of  sports  facilities

including    any    swimming   pool    in    Upper

Serangoon/Punggol  areas  must   come   from   the

approved yearly Budget allocations to the National

Sports  Promotion  Board, or  from  donations  and

contributions  which,  under  its  Acts,   it   is

empowered  to  receive.  The  swimming  pool  must

therefore  vie  for  priority  within  the  Budget

allocations with all other projects which the NSPB

will consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total need for facilities must depend on the

overall  strategy for the promotion of sports  and

healthy  recreation.  At  the  same  time,  it  is

necessary  to determine also the total  facilities

already available including those developed by the

Government, statutory boards, clubs, etc.  With  a

plan  and  information on existing facilities,  it

will  then be possible to determine the additional

facilities  that  should  be  developed  and   the

priority  that should be assigned to each project.

When  such  a  plan  has been  formulated  by  the

National  Sports Promotion Board and the  National

Stadium  Corporation,  my Ministry  will  then  be

prepared to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



consider the financing aspects of such a plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total dependence on Government financing for the

swimming    pool   at   Upper   Serangoon/Punggol,

therefore,  will mean delay, particularly  if  the

funds  required  are  large.  If  the  Member  for

Punggol  is  anxious for the immediate development

of  sports facilities in his area, there are other

ways  of  public  or  private involvement  in  the

provision  of such facilities. In this connection,

I  would suggest to him the method adopted by  the

Member  for Queenstown. Through his initiative,  a

Queenstown  Schools' Swimming Pool  Building  Fund

was started. The Fund will be used to construct  a

swimming  pool  mainly  for  the  use  of   school

children  in Queens-town. The Government helps  by

giving tax exemption to donations to the Fund  and

by running the pool after its construction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would

the Minister for Finance not agree with me that it

is  the  Government's declared policy  to  provide

more   recreational  facilities  for  the  people,

especially those living in the rural and  suburban

areas?  If  so,  would he not  consider  that  the

construction  of  a public swimming  poo1  in  the

Upper Serangoon/Punggol area a development project

and therefore, notwithstanding its cost, provision

should be included in the Development estimates?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I have nothing to add to what I

have  already said, which is, that when a strategy

for the development of facilities is provided, the

matter would be looked into. This means that I  am

prepared  to  consider  on an  overall  basis  the

provision   of   facilities  for  the   whole   of

Singapore, including the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, just now the Minister

mentioned that Queenstown is getting its  swimming

poo1  through  its  own effort.  May  I  draw  the

Minister's  attention to the fact that the  people

in  the rural areas are not that well off. We have

had many campaigns to raise funds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



for  certain projects, and more often than not  we

found  that  we had to rely on the people  in  the

urban areas.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your supplementary question,

Mr Ng?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, what I wanted to know is

whether  or not the Minister is aware of the  fact

that  the  rural people are not well off,  whereas

the  Government has been responsible for  building

swimming  pools  like those in River  Valley,  Yan

Kit,  except in new Housing Board estates. And  as

these pools were built by Government, why does the

Government  now stop building swimming  pools  and

pass on the responsibility to the NSPB?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the NSPB is a Government

agency for the provision of facilities such as the

Member has in mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> If that is the case, I would be

grateful if the Minister for Finance would  convey

our  request to the NSPB to look into the question

of providing a swimming poo1 for the people in the

Punggol/Upper Serangoon area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The usual practice is for the

NSPB to submit the proposal for our consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> No, Sir,I am given to understand

by  the Minister for Social Affairs that we  would

have  to look for a site for a swimming pool.  Now

that  the site has been found, we are told, "Look,

such  and  such an agency is now taking charge  of

it,  why  not  go to that agency." I do  not  know

where to turn to in the end.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

pool in rural areas close to the seaside is lesser

than such a need in the urban areas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I agree with the sentiments

<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in the Bill are designed

to make the legislation more effective and to meet

present  day  requirements in the light  of  rapid

building development in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, owners of lands with outstanding

mortgages  may surrender their lands for  the  re-issue  of  new titles without having to  discharge

the  mortgages at the time of surrender,  and  new

titles  when  re-issued may be endorsed  with  any

outstanding  mortgages. The Bill also enables  the

Registrar to direct by various methods that  lands

approved for erection of buildings (intended to be

dealt  with  in  parts) may be brought  under  the

Torrens   system   prior  to   the   granting   of

subdivisional approval of the buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also gives additional powers to the

Registrar  to  enter cautions on  certificates  of

title  issued  for lands which have not  yet  been

surveyed   up   to  the  standard  of   government

requirements and to call a party to an  instrument

to appear before him for purposes of verifying the

party's   identity   where  the   party   is   not

represented by a lawyer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that any proprietor of

land   who  has  altered  his  name  may   execute

instruments under his new name different from that

in  the  certificate of title and that an  amended

caveat  will be given priority as soon  as  it  is

received in the Registry, and not on the  date  of

its  notification on the relevant  certificate  of

title.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other amendments considered desirable from the

drafting   point   of  view   and   for   improved

administrative operations, have also been included

in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr E. W. Barker].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>RECLAMATION AT TELOK AYER BASIN AND OFF NICOLL HIGHWAY</b></div>



<br><br>3.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name, as it appears on the Order Paper.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion, standing in the name of the  Minister for Law and National Development, reads   as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with

section  4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter  270),

approves the reclamation by Government of  those

portions  of the foreshore and seabed  at  Telok

Ayer Basin and off' Nicoll Highway containing  a

total  area of approximately 370 acres as  shown

edged  in  red  on the plan marked "LAND  OFFICE

RECLAMATION  PLAN NO. 6/73" which  is  deposited

in the Land Office, Singapore.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the intensive construction of buildings in

the central area, especially along Shenton Way and

in  the  "Golden  Shoe" area,  necessitates  early

action to expand the road capacity and improve the

traffic  flow  system in the vicinity.  A  coastal

expressway,  called  the East  Coast  Parkway,  is

under  construction  on the  reclaimed  land  from

Bedok to Tanjong Rhu. The Jurong Expressway on the

west  coast,  starting from the Anson  Road/Keppel

Road  junction, will be built to link the  central

area  to Jurong. To join these two expressways  to

form  a  freeway from east to west,  skirting  the

city  centre,  it  is planned to extend  the  East

Coast Parkway across Kallang Basin out to the  sea

on to the existing detached stone mole, or break-water,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



and  then back to land through Telok  Ayer

Basin  to  the  Jurong  Expressway  at  the  Anson

Road/Keppel   Road  junction.  This  system   will

enclose a large span of water at the seafront  and

create a 220-acre lagoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in November, 1967,

approval   was  given  by  this  House   for   the

reclamation of 165 acres of foreshore  and  seabed

off  Nicoll Highway. It is now proposed  to  widen

the existing stone mole and extend the reclamation

areas by another 370 acres, as shown edged in  red

on  the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN

NO.  6/73".  A  copy of this reclamation  plan  is

displayed  in  the Library of this House  for  the

information  of hon. Members. Thus, together  with

the   165   acres  already  approved   and   under

reclamation (shown edged in blue on the  plan),  a

total  of 535 acres of reclaimed land will  become

available. The project will enable some  66  acres

to  be  set  aside  for the Expressway  and  local

roads,  about  79  acres for  public,  social  and

cultural amenities, including landscaped walkways,

car  parks, hospital and school sites and  even  a

centre   for  performing  arts,  105   acres   for

commercial usage and condominium housing, and  the

remaining   285   acres  for   open   spaces   and

promenades.  Sites for commercial and  residential

development  will  be sold by auction  to  private

developers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fill required for the reclamation, which

will  be undertaken by the Urban Renewal Authority

as  agent of the Government and is expected to  be

completed  in about five years' time  at  a  total

estimated  cost  of about $294  million,  will  be

obtained from the Johore Shoals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4  of  the  Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves

the reclamation by Government of those portions of

the  foreshore and seabed at Telok Ayer Basin  and

off  Nicoll  Highway containing a  total  area  of

approximately 370 acres as shown edged in  red  on

the  plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO.

Speaker's  consent  and  the  general  assent   of

Members  present for notice to be  dispensed  with

under Standing Order 33. I give my consent. Is  it

the  pleasure of hon. Members that the  motion  be

moved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament pursuant to subsection (3)

of  section 7 of the Statistics Act (Chapter  299)

resolves    that    the    Migration    Statistics

(Revocation) Rules 1973, made on the  2nd  day  of

May, 1973, and published as Notification No. S 169

in  the  Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement

No.  23  of 11th May, 1973 as contained  in  Paper

S.L. 23 of 1973, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Department of Statistics has been

collecting passenger statistics by sea  under  the

Migration  Statistics Rules. Passenger  statistics

by  air,  however, are compiled from the passenger

manifests  submitted by airlines to the Department

of Civil Aviation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Migration Statistics Rules were enacted in

1930 and over the passage of time returns drawn up

under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



Rules are outdated in a number of aspects, such as

in the terminology used and the scope and coverage

defined. There is, therefore, a need to revise the

returns and the notes contained therein from  time

to  time. This in turn would need prior amendments

to  be made to the Rules. In order, therefore,  to

avoid  the necessity of having to amend the  Rules

each   time,   the  Schedules  under   which   the

statistics  are  collected  are  revised,  it   is

proposed to collect migration statistics under the

powers  contained  in the Statistics  Act  itself.

This  is possible as migration is included in  the

Schedule  of subject matters covered by  the  Act.

The Migration Statistics Rules can, therefore,  be

revoked.   Collection  of  statistics  under   the

Statistics   Act   would   enable   administrative

flexibility to vary the format, scope and coverage

of   returns  as  and  when  circumstances  arise,

without  having to resort to changes in subsidiary

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament pursuant to subsection (3)

of  section 7 of the Statistics Act (Chapter  299)

resolves    that    the    Migration    Statistics
