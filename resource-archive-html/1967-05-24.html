<div align="center"><b>MEMBERS FOR TOA PAYOH AND NEE SOON</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Absence in Parliament)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  if  he  is aware that the electors  in  two

constituencies,  Toa  Payoh  and  Nee  Soon,   remain

unrepresented  in  this House  as  a  result  of  the

failure  till  today of the two Members  elected  for

those  constituencies to take their oaths  and  their

seats; and whether he considers any amendment of  the

law necessary to remedy the situation.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed) (for the Deputy Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have  been  asked by the Deputy Prime Minister  to

give the answer. The fact that the two constituencies

of  Toa  Payoh  and  Nee Soon  have  not  seen  their

representatives  since 1963 is, of course,  a  lesson

that  the  public must be careful about  in  electing

those  who  hang  up a sheep's head  but  sell  dog's

flesh. The two constituencies have, however, not been

neglected  by  The Government and many projects  have

been  completed in both since the last elections  and

the disappearance of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



two  elected representatives. So long as they do  not

resign  from Parliament, no by-elections can be  held

in those constituencies until the next elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a constitutional matter and will be

considered when the new constitution is drawn up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like to ask a  supplementary

question,  and that is whether these two  M.P.s  have

been  receiving their allowances? If not, can we  put

the  allowances  to better use, say,  provide  better

services for the two constituencies concerned?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That question does not come within the

responsibility of any Minister of the Government  and

accordingly,   under   Standing   Orders,   is    not

permissible.

<div align="center"><b>TOUTS AROUND GOVERNMENT OFFICES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Action to curb their activities)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister of Defence

whether  action will be taken to curb the  activities

of   touts  around  Government  offices  who   charge

illiterate people, seeking assistance from Government

departments,   unnecessary  fees  for  helping   such

illiterate people write letters to the departments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  there  is  provision in the law  to  deal  with

persons  who  tout around Government departments.  In

fact,  action  has  already been taken  against  such

touts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public may wish to note that

approved  petition  writers  are  available  at   the

Registry  of  Births  and Deaths,  the  General  Post

Office and the Immigration Department, to assist them

in  filling Government application forms as  well  as

writing  letters.  Unlike the touts,  these  approved

petition writers charge a reasonable sum, i.e., 20 to

30 cents per form filled up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to legal matters, however, it must be

stressed  that  touts  as well as  approved  petition

writers are in no position to offer any advice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the legal matter is of a civil nature,

indigent members of the public, who cannot afford the

Aid Bureau.

<div align="center"><b>YIO CHU KANG ROAD/JALAN KAYU JUNCTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Road accidents)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Teo Hup Teck</b> asked the Minister of Defence

how  many road accidents occurred at the junction  of

Yio  Chu Kang Road and Jalan Kayu in 1966 and in  the

first three months of 1967, and how many of them were

fatal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister of Defence):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, there were two accidents  at  this

junction  in 1966 of which one was fatal. During  the

first  three  months  in  1967  two  accidents   have

occurred, both not fatal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): May I

ask  a  supplementary question? Because there are  no

traffic  lights at the junction of Yio Chu Kang  Road

and  Jalan  Kayu, many drivers do not  abide  by  the

traffic   regulations.  When   they   approach   this

junction,  the  speed normally is quite  high.  So  I

would  like  to ask the Minister whether he  has  any

intention to set up traffic lights at this junction?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a traffic

census has been taken and it has been discovered that

traffic  is heavy at this junction only between  7.00

a.m.  and  8.15 a.m. and from 4.00 p.m. to 5.30  p.m.,

and  is negligible during the rest of the day.  Also,

the  difficulty  and  congestion  is  the  result  of

traffic making right turns at this junction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve this problem, a traffic points man is on

duty at the junction during peak hours. The road  has

been  widened a little with a view to minimising long

queues  of vehicles. Also a left turning slipway  has

been  provided  which will reduce congestion  at  the

junction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the installation of traffic lights

at the junction is being studied.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drivers of vehicles traversing this junction should be

more careful when approaching it if they wish  to avoid

accidents. The National Safety  First  Council has  been

conducting campaigns on safety on the roads and   expects

members  of  the  public  to  be  more receptive to ideas

of safety.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL SERVICEMEN</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Provision for civilian employment after military service)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the Minister

of  Defence  whether provision for the employment  by

Statutory  Boards  and  private  firms  of  full-time

National  Servicemen discharged at the end  of  their

military   service  will  be  made  in  the  proposed

legislation  for  the emplacement  of  such  National

Servicemen in civilian occupations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister of Defence):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, as will he recalled, the  Minister

has  stated  in  this House when  moving  the  Second

Reading  of  the  National Service (Amendment)  Bill,

1967,  that all those youths called up for  full-time

service  in  the  army would be  placed  in  civilian

occupations   appropriate  to   their   ability   and

qualifications  on  completion  of  their   full-time

military service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also stated then that sufficient

numbers  of  such  posts in Government  service,  the

statutory  boards and large private  firms  would  be

reserved for discharged national servicemen and  that

legislation on this would be presented to Parliament.

A  survey  of the employment opportunities available

is  being conducted by officers of the Ministry,  and

the  indications  so  far  are  that  the  employment

opportunities that will be available should  be  more

than  sufficient  to  absorb all national  servicemen

discharged   after  completion  of  their   full-time

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the first national servicemen to serve full-time will not be called up before July this year,

legislation for the direction of employment  of  such

persons on discharge need be implemented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>



only  by July 1969. In the meantime, a careful  study

of  the  results  of the employment survey  is  being

undertaken to decide on the extent and scope  of  the

proposed   legislation.  This  is  to   ensure   that

restrictions  placed  on employers  by  the  proposed

legislation are sufficient to achieve the desired end

without being overly restrictive.

<div align="center"><b>ADULT EDUCATION CENTRE AND JUNIOR COLLEGES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Building progress and completion dates)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Education

what  progress has been made in the building  of  (i)

the  Adult  Education  Centre, and  (ii)  the  Junior

Colleges,   and   the  estimated  dates   for   their

completion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Adult

Education Centre project was first submitted  to  the

Economic  Planning Unit for inclusion in  the  Second

Five-Year Plan in August 1964. A revised project  was

put up by the Board in March 1965. This was supported

by   the  Ministry  and  forwarded  to  the  Economic

Planning   Unit.  The  Working  Party  of   Permanent

Secretaries,  which  was  set  up  to   examine   all

development  projects for the Second  Plan,  approved

the provision of $1.5 million for the Adult Education

Centre in July 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board prepared a new submission for inclusion

of  the project in the 1966 Development Estimates  in

March 1966. In July 1966, the Economic Planning  Unit

requested   for  additional  data  to  evaluate   the

project. This was submitted on 1st September, 1966. A

token  vote  was  provided in  the  1967  Development

Estimates  for  the Adult Education  Centre  project.

This is an indication of the low priority accorded to

the  project, and it does not appear likely  that  it

will be cleared this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Junior Colleges, piling work on the site

for  the  first  Junior College at Linden  Drive  has

almost  been completed, and the construction of  this

building is scheduled to commence in September. It is

estimated that the College will be completed by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>



end of 1968. The building of two more Junior Colleges

under  the  1967 school building programme  is  under

consideration.  If  these two  projects  are  cleared

early,  it  may be possible for the buildings  to  be

completed in 1969.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT-AIDED SCHOOL TEACHERS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Retirement age and long-service gratuity)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for

Education  if  he  will consider (a) terminating  the

services of teachers in Government-Aided Schools when

they  have reached the age of 60 years and recruiting

younger  teachers to fill their places; and  (b)  the

payment  to  retiring teachers in such schools  of  a

long-service  gratuity  equivalent  to   one   year's

difference  between  the  last-drawn  salary  of  the

retiring teacher and the salary of a new recruit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the

intention that the services of teachers in Government-aided  schools  on reaching the age  of  60  will  be

terminated  in  all  cases, as  in  the  interest  of

education,  the  experience  and  expertise  of   the

consistently   good  ones  should  be  retained,   if

necessary even in promotion posts, to help  build  up

the character of schools and education generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion of a long-service gratuity scheme

will be submitted to the Treasury for consideration.

<div align="center"><b>CITY CLEANSING</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Educational campaigns and legislation against litter-throwing)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Health if

he  will consider conducting campaigns to educate the

people  to  keep  their City clean, and  if  he  will

introduce  legislation to punish  the  indiscriminate

throwing of litter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, now that re-organisation of the Public Cleansing service has been

in operation for more than three months, with a total

work force of 3,500 working on a two-shift basis  and

the racket



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



of  high absenteeism during weekdays a thing  of  the

past,  we are ready to embark on the second stage  of

re-organisation, namely, that of educating the public

that  they  also  have a duty to  keep  the  Republic

clean.  Steps are being taken to bring various pieces

of   legislation  up  to  date  so  as  to  implement

effectively such policy, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, any householder or shopkeeper who fails to

provide a dustbin after due notice has been  served

on  him,  will  be  provided  with  an  appropriate

dustbin  by  the  Public Cleansing Department,  and

the  cost  will  be charged to his  monthly  Public

Utilities  Account for settlement. It is  estimated

that   about   one-half  of  the  householders   in

Singapore are without dustbins at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as those responsible for litter on public

streets, drains and vacant sites do not seem to be

deterred  by  the present lenient penalties  of  a

maximum  fine  of  $100 and  a  further  fine  not

exceeding  $25 for every day during  which  it  is

continued  after  conviction under  the  Municipal

Ordinance (Chapter 133) Conservancy Bylaws,  1941,

we  are  amending  the By-laws to  introduce  more

punitive  penalties,  like  $150  for  the   first

offence,  $500 for the second offence, and  $1,000

for the third offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have also in mind replacing the present

Destruction  of Mosquito Ordinance (Chapter  139),

passed nearly 50 years ago to control malaria, for

something   more   comprehensive  and   up-to-date

legislation  to  be  known as the  Destruction  of

Disease-bearing Insects Act, in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, at the same time, we intend to carry Out an

intensive  education campaign  through  Radio  and

T.V. with  the  co-operation of the  Ministry  of

Culture, and also include Health Education as part

of  the proposed Civics syllabus for schools which

is   now  being  drawn  up  by  the  Ministry   of

Education.

<div align="center"><b>RICE AND SUGAR</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Current trends in prices and adequacy of stocks)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Finance if he will make a statement on current trends

in  the wholesale and retail prices of rice and sugar

in  Singapore and on the adequacy of stocks of  these

staple foods for the needs of the Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members are no doubt

aware  that there is a growing rice shortage  in  the

world.  This  is  becoming clearer when  we  read  of

reports   that   rice-growing   countries   in   Asia

themselves  have  to import rice to meet  consumption

requirements.  The  growing  general   shortage   was

highlighted  when Thailand, one of the largest  rice-growing  countries  in  the  world,  had  to   impose

restrictions on exports of rice from Thailand.  These

restrictions had an immediate effect on the trend  of

rice  prices. Therefore, at the end of December 1966,

the  retail price of Siam polished rice 100 per  cent

was  40 cents per katty compared with 34 cents at the

end of 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, the retail price has increased

gradually to about 45 cents or 46 cents per katty  at

the end of April.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since the lifting of the export

restrictions  on  rice by Thailand  in  January,  the

wholesale  price of rice has shown a slight decrease.

At  the  end  of April, the wholesale price  of  Siam

polished rice 100 per cent was $40 per pikul compared

with $40.25 per pikul at the end of March.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a position of surplus with low prices paid for

raw  sugar,  in  recent months  the  trend  has  been

reversed.  The  price of raw sugar has  been  rising.

Consequent  on  this, it is therefore not  surprising

that the price of refined sugar should also increase.

Hence  in  January, the wholesale  price  of  refined

sugar  per pikul was $24.25, which rose to $27.60  by

the   end  of  April.  The  retail  price  of   sugar

accordingly rose from 28 cents per katty  in  January

to 30 cents per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



katty  the  following month, and it has  remained  at

this level since.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Singapore does not grow its own rice and

will only refine granulated sugar from raw sugar, the

increases in the price of rice as well as sugar  have

not  been  as  severe as in other countries  of  this

region.  This  is  due  largely  to  the  fact   that

Singapore is a large trading centre with an efficient

distribution system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House and the public will no doubt

be  pleased  to know that there is sufficient  stock,

both  commercial and Government, of  rice  and  sugar

adequate  to meet consumption requirements  for  four

months.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Parliamentary

Secretary himself has admitted that the price of rice

has  gone  up, is his Ministry not trying to increase

the allowance of workers to overcome this problem?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> The Government will consider this

matter when the productivity is increased.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we all

know   that   rice  and  sugar  are  very   important

commodities  in  the  livelihood  of  the  people  of

Singapore.  In  that  respect,  will  the  Government

consider  ways and means of preserving stable  prices

for rice and sugar so that the people will not suffer

from  any reflection upwards or downwards by  way  of

prices?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I do not think that it is  within  the

powers  of  the Government to control the  prices  of

sugar and rice since we do not grow these commodities

ourselves. Any form of control would lead to evasion,

and the moment you start controlling, there would  be

a  black-market  in these commodities.  Moreover,  to

keep the prices stable - to follow the suggestion  of

the  Member  for Punggol - would mean that  we  would

have  to subsidise either the price of rice or sugar.

I  think the Member need not go very far to find  out

what  has  happened  to  the country  that  has  been

subsidising the price of rice.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Do the Government or

the people outside fix the prices of rice and sugar?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are known as

a  country which allows free enterprise and free play

of  prices of supply and demand. The prices  of  rice

and  sugar are not fixed by the Government. They  are

the results of supply and demand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, suppose the

private  sector increases the prices, what  will  the

Government do? Will the Government put a stop  to  or

approve the increase in the prices?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I have said that our economy is

one  of  free enterprise, and if shopkeeper A  raises

the prices too high, shopkeeper B will undersell him.

So  the prices will be the result of the interplay of

supply and demand.

has  in  mind the advertisement sequence which  shows

cars  taking  part in a motor race. If  this  be  the

case,   it   will   not  be  possible   to   prohibit

advertisements  in  which speeding  is  part  of  the

place  and  not  slow moving or stationary  cars.  If

speeding   and  undesirable  types  of  driving   run

contrary  to  the  campaigns of the  National  Safety

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy (for the Minister for Culture and Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, T.V. Singapura

over  the  past  few years have definitely  increased

their  sports coverage. Apart from the weekly  Sports

newsreels  and also full-length programmes on  sports

whenever they have been available,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>



especially  those on popular  sports  such  as

badminton  and football. Between July 1966 and  March

1967, there were two programmes on basketball with an

interview in Chinese about local basketball, and  for

a  similar  number  of occasions,  table  tennis  was

shown.  In  volley-ball, the finals of the  Singapore

advance  information  from the  organisers  of  these

sports.  T.V.  Singapura  have  no  full-time  sports

reporters,  and unless the organisers of  the  sports

difficult   to  cover  such  events.   It   must   be

with different degrees of popularity in Singapore and

something has to be shown of all these sports.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr S. Rajoo</b> asked the Minister for Culture and

Social Affairs how many priests are employed in  each

of  the Hindu Temples administered by the Muslim  and

Hindu Endowments Board and whether their numbers  are

sufficient;  and  if  he is in  a  position  to  give

details   of   their   initial   salaries,   periodic

increments and present salaries.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member  has tabled a number of questions touching  on

the  Hindu  religion, and before  I  answer  them,  I

should like to make it quite clear that Singapore  is

a   secular  State  with  no  established  church  or

national religion. In fact, all religions are  equal,

and the Government's policy has always been, and will

always  be, to leave each religious community to  run

its  own affairs without interference from the State.

This is religious freedom. I shall,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>



therefore, be most happy to answer the hon.  Member's

question, in so far as the seeking of information  is

concerned, but I shall be in no position to deal with

any  matters  impinging upon any power  or  right  of

administration, which is strictly a  matter  for  the

religious authority concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now to come to the hon. Member's question. I

have  obtained  the information from the  Muslim  and

Hindu Endowments Board, which is responsible for  the

administration of four Hindu Temples, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Mariamman Temple at South Bridge Road,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Sivan Temple at Orchard Road,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Kaliamman Temple at Somerset Road, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The Perumal Temple at Serangoon Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mariamman Temple has one Head Priest who is

paid  a salary of $100 per month, and three Pandarams

who are paid $65 per month, $63 per month and $60 per

month  respectively.  The Sivan  Temple  employs  one

Priest  at $80 per month and one Pandaram at $60  per

month. The Kaliamman Temple has only one Pandaram  at

$90  per month. The Perumal Temple employs one Priest

at  $150  per month and one Assistant Priest at  $130

per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that each Temple employs priests

and   pays   salaries  according  to  its  means.   I

understand that there are no fixed salary scales with

regular  increments. I am told, however,  that  these

employees  receive other emoluments  over  and  above

their salaries, e.g., commissions on fees paid to the

Temples  by devotees for prayer ceremonies  conducted

by  the  priests;  they are also provided  with  free

housing, water and electricity.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Fanner Park):</b> I understand from the

Minister that the priests in various temples are paid

various sums of money. For instance, in the Mariamman

Temple, the priest is paid $100 per month, and in the

Sivan Temple the priest is paid $80 per month,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>



and in the Perumal Temple one priest is paid $150 per

month and his assistant is paid $130 per month.  Does

the  Minister  know why such different  payments  are

maintained in different temples? Is he aware that the

management of the Sivan Temple at Orchard Road is run

on a contract basis and that only one priest is given

full control over all matters, and that there are not

even any records of -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid I must stop the hon.

Member.  I  have  just had a look  at  the  Ordinance

setting  up  the Board and it gives no power  to  the

Minister  to issue directions to the Board.  In any

event  where there is a statutory board, the Minister

is  not  answerable for matters of detail  day-to-day

administration. So, if the hon. Member wants to ask a

question on a matter of principle, he may do  so.  He

will have to restrict his supplementary to matters of

principle and not go to details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> My point is: if the Ministry devotes its

responsibilities  to  the  appointment   of   certain

members  of  the  Board and does not  look  into  the

matter of how the Board is run, there may be so  many

anomalies  arising. So in future could the  Minister,

when he appoints members to the Board or when he does

something, take into consideration what is happening?

Otherwise,  there will be a lot of inconvenience  and

dissatisfaction in the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in one instance, I want to say that -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajoo, you are going much further

than a supplementary question. You are making a

speech. Do you have a question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> The question is: will the Minister

regulate such matters or give directions to the Board

on  how the management is to be run? I mean, at least

in future when he is introducing a Bill, will he look

into this matter?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I think you have

answered  the  question - that the  Minister  has  no

jurisdiction over the administration of  the  temples

from day to day.

Social  Affairs whether he is aware of any complaints

made  to  Temple Management Committees or the  Muslim

and   Hindu  Endowments  Board  against  the   Temple

Management   Committees  by   devotees   of   Temples

administered  by  the  Muslim  and  Hindu  Endowments

Board, and if he will ensure that such complaints are

dealt with satisfactorily and speedily.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should

like  to  repeat  here the remarks which  I  made  in

connection  with the previous question asked  by  the

hon.   Member,   namely,  that,   although   I   make

appointments  to  the  Muslim  and  Hindu  Endowments

Board, I am not responsible for the administration of

the Hindu Temples which have their own management sub-committees which are responsible to the Committee  of

Management   appointed  by  the  Muslim   and   Hindu

Endowments Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Hindu community who frequent

the  Temples  are divided into a number of  factions,

each with its own ideas of how the Temples should  be

run.  This  being so, it is quite natural that  there

should  be many complaints arising. The Committee  of

Management   appointed  by  the  Muslim   and   Hindu

Endowments Board consists of 15 persons who have been

giving up a good deal of their leisure time in  order

to  help  in the running of these Temples,  and  have

always  been at pains to investigate thoroughly  into

any  complaints. I would suggest to the  hon.  Member

that,  if  he  is  aware  of  any  serious  complaint

concerning  the running of the Temples, he  write  to

the  Secretary  of  the Muslim and  Hindu  Endowments

Board,  giving  the full particulars and  the  matter

will receive the due consideration of the Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> A supplementary, Sir, I am not

criticising   the  administration   of   the   Temple

Management Committees, but what I understand is  that

certain  letters  written to  the  Temple  Management

Committee in November 1966 have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



not even been acknowledged; and if I am not mistaken,

even up to date. If this is the system that exists in

the  Management Committees and the Minister is  still

trying to divert his responsibility ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajoo, I am afraid you are

compelling me to address the remarks that I addressed

to  you earlier. Perhaps you take up the matter on an

Adjournment debate on an early occasion. You can then

range far wider than is permissible at Question Time.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the hon.

Endowments  Board,  appointed under  the  Muslim  and

Hindu  Endowments Ordinance, is responsible  for  the

administration of both Muslim and Hindu religious and

charitable endowments. With the recent passing of the

Administration   of  Muslim  Law   Act,   1966,   the

over by the Majlis Ugama Islam, which will be set  up

under that Act.

monthly income of the family does not exceed $400.  I

limit  was recently raised from 5 to 6 years and  the

income limit from $300 p.m. to $400 p.m.

who  cannot afford to pay the higher charges  of  the

merchants or contractors and builders

he  should  refer them to the Ministry  concerned  or

send  them  direct  to me so that  I  can  direct  an

investigation.  But  coming  here  to  make   general

observations will not help anyone.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ngee Ann College was established in April 1963 and

is  registered  under the Education  Ordinance  as  a

private institution and financed and administered  by

Ngee  Ann  Kongsi.  When  it was  first  established,

Government  was given to understand that  the  Kongsi

had  ample  funds  to finance the  project  and  that

Government   financial  assistance   would   not   be

necessary   then   and  in  the   future.   On   that

understanding, Government had given its  blessing  to

the   establishment  of  the  college  as  a  private

institution and subsequently approved the  plans  for

permanent  buildings to be erected in Clementi  Road.

Therefore,  insofar as Government is  concerned,  the

financial aid given to the College has been confined,

since  its inception, to the award of bursaries which

amounted to $82,000 in 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the College was sited at the Tank

Road   premises   which   belong   to   the   Teochew

Association.  Later 40 acres of the  Kongsi  land  at

Clementi  Road were used for building the  Technology

Department of the College and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>



the  Kongsi has promised that the rent collected from

the  College  will be returned to the  College  as  a

grant. Ngee Ann Kongsi, however, had difficulties  in

providing  funds  for  the construction  of  the  new

buildings at Clementi Road. Furthermore, there was no

assurance   of  a  regular  income  to  meet   annual

recurrent  expenditure. In fact,  this  situation  is

still  prevailing. There were also doubts as  to  how

the  College  could  best  serve  the  needs  of  our

community.  Therefore, in mid 1964  Professor  Lucian

Pye,  a  political  economist  at  the  Massachusetts

Institute of Technology, and Mr Arthur Singer of the

Carnegie  Corporation  in  the  United  States   were

invited by the Kongsi to survey the College and  make

recommendations  as  to  its future  development  and

expansion.  The  Pye/ Singer Report recommended  that

the  position  of  the  College  in  the  educational

structure of the Republic needed to be redefined  and

that Ngee Ann College should develop into a community

college  to  train  technicians  needed  for  our  industrialisation programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1966, the Kongsi decided to set up a

Committee  of Review, headed by Professor  Thong  Saw

Pak, with the following terms of reference:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To review the organisation of the Ngee Ann College

with  special reference to the courses  of  study  at

present available at the College and, in the light of

the  findings  and  the  needs  of  our  country,  to

recommend  to  the Ngee Ann Kongsi in what  way  this

institution  of higher learning should be  developed,

and  how the organisation and courses of study should

be   improved   in   order  to   bring   about   such

development.'



<br><br>The  Thong Saw Pak Committee submitted its report  to

the Kongsi in July 1966. This report was released  by

the  Kongsi  in  September  of  the  same  year.  The

Committee  recommends  that  the  College  should  be

reorganised into a community college administered  by

a   17-man  council  with  representatives  from  the

Kongsi,  the  Ministry  of  Education,  the  Economic

Development Board and prominent citizens from a broad

area  of  community life in Singapore. The  Committee

consider  that the College may eventually attain  its

objective of university status. This cannot, however,

be accomplished overnight. There must be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



an  interim period during which difficulties  can  be

ironed out. The Committee recommends that during this

interim  period  -  the length  of  which  cannot  be

specified, because there are too many variables - the

College be reorganised into a community college  with

courses   leading  only  to  diplomas.  The  existing

courses   can   continue  until  all  students   have

completed their courses, i.e., till 1970, but no  new

students  are  to  be  admitted to  them.  Since  the

College   has  so  committed  itself,  the  Committee

recommends that degrees be awarded to all the present

students,  including  those  admitted  in  1966,  for

passing  the  final examinations for  which  external

examiners  are to be appointed, who will  advise  the

College  in  adopting a realistic standard.  At  some

later  date,  as soon as the College has become  well

established  as  a  community  college,  a   separate

assessment  of the situation should be undertaken  by

the  College authorities and, depending on the future

needs  of the Republic, the College can then  proceed

with  the final part of its development programme  of

providing degree courses in Engineering, Commerce and

Technology. Meanwhile, for the community college  the

Committee  lists  an  extensive coverage  of  courses

which  can  be  offered  of immediate  importance  to

building   trades,  electricity,   radio   and   T.V.

technology,    metal   work,   woodwork,    ceramics,

commercial and industrial arts, industrial laboratory

techniques and shipyard trades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students became concerned about their future. A

boycott of classes was mounted in June 1965 over  the

delay  of  the Kongsi in completing the buildings  at

the  Clementi Road site. Another boycott  of  classes

directed against the Thong Saw Pak Report took  place

in  October 1966. This boycott was exploited  by  the

pro-Communist elements and the Barisan Sosialis.  The

scope of the agitation was expanded and middle school

students, Nanyang University, University of Singapore

and Polytechnic undergraduates became involved in it,

culminating  in security action being  taken  against

them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall how the Ngee Ann students

rioted  in  front of the City Hall on  4th  November,

1966, and when the police finally moved into the Ngee

Ann  College  premises  at Tank  Road  in  the  early

morning  of 19th November, 1966, they were  met  with

stiff  resistance  and finally 66 Nanyang  University

expelled  students  and  65 Ngee  Ann  students  were

flushed out of the building where they had barricaded

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, events have taken a turn for the

better.  At an extraordinary general meeting  of  the

Kongsi held on 18th February, 1967, the Thong Saw Pak

Report  was accepted by the Kongsi in tow,  with  the

exception that the present premises of the College at

Tank  Road  could not be turned over to  the  College

because  the  ownership  is  vested  in  the  Teochew

Association and not the Kongsi. This means that  Ngee

Ann  College  will be reorganised in accordance  with

the  Thong  Saw  Pak Report and the Kongsi  will,  in

future,  turn over to the College half of its  annual

income.  The  Kongsi has also decided  that,  pending

reorganisation of the College, no new  students  will

be enrolled this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is introduced consequent upon the

acceptance of the Thong Saw Pak Report by the  Kongsi

as  a  first step towards the implementation  of  the

Report  so  as  to enable the College  to  enjoy  the

status   of   a  corporation  with  its  constitution

embodied  in  the Ordinance. The Bill  has  the  full

agreement  of the Kongsi. The enactment of  the  Bill

would  confirm the establishment of Ngee Ann  College

as  a  permanent  institution.  It  would  assist  in

enlisting   financial   support   from   foundations,

institutions and philanthropists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides for a Council and a

Senate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 provides that the Council shall be the

supreme  governing and executive body of the College,

whilst  clause  13 delegates responsibility  for  the

promotion of instruction and research, the conducting

of  examinations for its students and  the  award  of

certificates,    diplomas    and    other    academic

qualifications to the Senate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the 17-man Council is set out in

clause  7.  Three  members of  the  Council  will  be

appointed by the Committee of Management of Ngee  Ann

Kongsi from amongst members of the Kongsi which  will

be  providing  the  main financial  support  for  the

establishment and maintenance of the College,  whilst

an equal number will be appointed by the Minister for

Education under clause 7 (c) . Adequate representation

from  commercial  and industrial interests  has  also

been provided. Clause 7 (d) allows for representation

from the Senate and full-time staff of the College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these provisions have been made to ensure that

the   College   contributes  to   the   intellectual,

cultural,   commercial  and  industrial  welfare   of

Singapore.  Emphasis has, however, been made  on  the

development  of  studies in the sciences,  technology

and  commerce,  as other educational  fields  are  at

present well provided for by our two Universities and

the  future  of our economy will depend  to  a  large

extent on our industrial and commercial activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as this is a hybrid Bill, it will

at  the  end of the Second Reading be referred  to  a

Select Committee in accordance with the provisions of

the Standing Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  former  student  of  Ngee  Ann

College,  I  would like to say a few words  today  on

behalf  of  Ngee  Ann  College.  The  House  is   now

discussing  the Ngee Ann College Bill. This  Bill  is

intended   to  turn  Ngee  Ann  College,  a   private

institution which has been in existence for only four

years,  into  a corporation with a permanent  status.

Sir, when we review the situation we know that, since

the  inception of Ngee Ann College, certain directors

of  Ngee  Ann Kongsi have said that Ngee Ann  College

would  develop  from  a  small  college  into  a  big

university. I would like to ask those directors  what

is the situation now and whether Ngee Ann College



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>



is now already a university, or whether they will act

according  to  the  former plans and  turn  Ngee  Ann

College   from  a  small  college  into  a  community

college?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thong Saw Pak Review Committee was appointed on

the  16th of April, 1966. Let us look at the  Nanyang

Siang  Pau  report on this occasion. Professor  Thong

Saw  Pak was reported to have said that the Ngee  Ann

College  students would be issued certificates.  From

the following year the College would be turned from a

private  institution into a public community college.

Thirdly,  Ngee Ann College would continue to  develop

to  enable it to become a body which would  have  the

status  of  a university to meet the requirements  of

Singapore.  At  the same time, Professor  Thong  also

pointed  out  that the interests of the  students  of

Ngee Ann College would be taken care of and that they

should  not  agitate  or do anything  detrimental  to

their own interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree that students should not

take  part  in  any undesirable activities.  However,

they  should not be made use of by a handful of anti-national elements. There are several ways whereby the

interests  of  the Ngee Ann College students  can  be

taken  care  of.  Firstly,  the  College  authorities

should have close contact with the students. Students

of  any  college  or school, if their performance  or

behaviour  is good, should be respected  or  be  duly

rewarded by the Government and members of the public.

If  their behaviour is not good, of course, they will

earn  the  disrespect of the public. Then  what  will

happen  to  the other students who are  in  the  same

college  or school? That is the present situation  of

Ngee Ann College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, concerning the development of Ngee Ann

College,  the Review Committee said that in 1964  Mr

Singer  from  the Carnegie Corporation and  Professor

Lucian   Pye   of  the  Massachusetts  Institute   of

Technology  had been invited by Ngee Ann  College  to

study  and  review the position concerning  Ngee  Ann

College.  In  their recommendations,  they  suggested

that  Ngee  Ann  College should  become  a  community

college, namely, a junior college.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



Here it clearly tells us that a community college  is

a  junior college. On the 6th of April last  year,  a

statement   was  published  saying  that   from   the

following  year Ngee Ann College would be reorganised

into  a  public college and not a junior college.  Is

there no contradiction between these two statements?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Ngee Ann College at its inception was

intended  to  be on par with any ordinary university.

The only difference is that in an ordinary university

there are several faculties. But Ngee Ann College has

available only a few courses. If it can increase  the

number  of its courses, would it not he able to  turn

itself into a university? And when the time comes,  a

scholars'   committee  can  be  appointed   to   make

suggestions  on how to turn Ngee Ann College  into  a

university   or  an  organisation  on  par   with   a

university.  Sir, if you are a student  of  Ngee  Ann

College,  would you be satisfied with  this  sort  of

suggestion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Thong Saw Pak Report has, after long

consideration, quoted what has been expressed by  the

Pye/  Singer  Report  concerning  Singapore's  higher

education.  Some  degrees are conferred  by  American

universities or colleges which are not famous.  Would

you  agree  to  this? Is it true  that  some  of  our

educationists  here  have  only  degrees  issued   by

certain   not   very  famous  American  colleges   or

universities? This argument is not quite  correct  or

proper in the context.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me turn to the 1965 Ngee Ann College

Souvenir.  Let us look at it. We can see  that  wrong

things  have  been  said  about  the  professors  and

teachers  of Ngee Ann College. I would like  more  or

less  to enumerate the qualifications and experiences

of  the teachers of Ngee Ann College. Dr Wen got his

doctorate from Germany and was the Dean of  a  Taiwan

University,   Science  Faculty.  Dr  Lee   got   his

doctorate from Paris and was a Professor in a  Taiwan

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the 218th issue of Free World. Here

it   mentions   that  the  Committee  reviewing   the

qualifications of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



the  teachers had, as one of its members, one Dr Hu-hse.  He is one of the most famous scholars of China.

Dr  Yang  Sang  Chew  - he has been  brought  up  in

Singapore and is also a citizen of Singapore. He  had

a    doctorate   in   Mathematics   from   Brantridge

University.  And  Dr  Shueng Su-loon  came  from  an

American university - Cornell University. From  these

enumerated  facts regarding their qualifications  and

experiences, we know that the teachers  of  Ngee  Ann

College  are not teachers without qualifications,  as

alleged  in  the Pye/ Singer Report. There  are  also

other   people   with   quite  high   qualifications.

Professor  Kuan was in the Massachusetts  College  of

Technology, and many such teachers have been teaching

in   other  universities.  The  present  teacher   of

Geography  in  Ngee  Ann College  was  a  teacher  of

Geography  in Nanyang University and a Faculty  Head.

Professor  Chen  also taught in a Taiwan  University.

Furthermore, Ngee Ann College has other teachers  who

have  a  string  of  degrees and titles  after  their

names. Can you say that when these teachers with high

qualifications  come to teach in  Ngee  Ann  College,

their  values depreciate all of a sudden? We  can  be

proud of the fact that, although Ngee Ann College  is

a  new  College, it has obtained the services  of  so

many scholars of repute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Chinese Press of 8th May,

there  was  a news item about a campaign  to  conduct

teaching in the mother tongue. It also went on to say

that  Ngee  Ann College has a very short history  and

that  some  of the graduates of a recent  batch  have

gone  to  New Zealand and other countries for further

education. Can these concrete facts be denied?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Bill and I

believe  that  it will be very helpful  to  Ngee  Ann

College in its future administration and development.

I  would  like to express the hope that the Ngee  Ann

College  students  will face facts  and  not  involve

themselves  in political intrigues and  go  out  with

others  shouting empty political slogans.  They  must

understand  the present practical realities  of  this

country and go along the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



right  path.  Furthermore, if  there  is  mutual  co-operation

among  Ngee Ann Kongsi - the  sponsors  of

Ngee Ann College - the Government and members of  the

public, Ngee Ann College can be turned into a  centre

of  learning from where talented and useful  citizens

of this country can emerge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, we all know that education in Singapore

has  been  making great progress in keeping with  the

political   situation.   This   progress   has   been

revolutionary  in  nature  and  we  must  trace   its

development. Such a development should be in  keeping

with  our  situation and time. Ever  since  Singapore

became  a  sovereign  independent  State,  tremendous

advance has been made in various fields and this  has

instilled  a  spirit of optimism in  the  people  and

augurs  well for our future. Education plays  a  very

important role in national development. The trend and

development of education is a matter of great concern

to  the people of Singapore. Everyone must sit up and

take notice of this fact. On 22nd November, 1965,  at

the  Asian  Educational Conference  in  Bangkok,  the

Minister   for  Education  spoke  on  the   Five-Year

Education  Plan  of  Singapore  and  emphasised   the

following points:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to improve the quality of education;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to expand secondary education and tertiary

education; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to set up various kinds of special institutes

and  colleges in order to cope with  the  needs

of an industrialised society.



<br><br>He  also  said  that  we should expand  our  existing

facilities to improve the standard of education  and,

in  general,  foster  the growth  of  a  multi-racial

society  through  education. From  all  this,  it  is

obvious  that  before  this  Bill  was  tabled,   the

educational content of Ngee Ann College had not  kept

pace with the post-independent era of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the various courses in Ngee Ann

College.   There  are  seven  courses:  (1)   Chinese

language; (2) Malay language; (3) Domestic Science;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>



(4) Business Administration; (5) Accountancy; (6)

Applied  Chemistry; and (7) Telecommunications.  This

is  mentioned in the first chapter of the  Thong  Saw

Pak Report. We must admit that the setting up of such

courses is not in keeping with our need for a  proper

division  of labour and is a waste of our  human  and

material resources. These courses have not only  been

duplicated  in  Nanyang University but  also  in  the

Polytechnic. In other words, all these courses,  with

the exception of Domestic Science, have also been set

up  in  Nanyang University and the Polytechnic.  Such

duplication  of  courses is not in keeping  with  the

spirit  of making use of what we have learnt and  has

not  taken account of our needs. What special talents

do  we  need in our society? Ngee Ann College  should

set  up  courses  such  as  Arts  and  those  courses

connected  with Arts. Everyone is aware of  the  fact

that  any  university or college is an institute  for

the training of talents. We must set up courses which

are needed by society. Our next generation must learn

to   make  full  use  of  their  talents.  If  higher

education   is  not  concerned  with  the  employment

opportunities of students, and if students  are  mass

produced,  the graduates of institutes  will  not  be

able  to find employment. They and their parents will

inevitably be disappointed. Therefore, I suggest that

the  courses  which are taught in other  universities

and  colleges should not be duplicated  in  Ngee  Ann

College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Ngee Ann College can train people on

the  physical  side  of education.  This  is  a  very

important  need  of our society. Our  past  education

policy  has  not paid much attention to the  need  of

physical   education.   As  Singapore   is   now   an

independent nation, we must have a rugged  and  brave

generation. Therefore, we must train our teachers  to

teach  our  next generation to be rugged  and  brave.

Teachers  from abroad are not suitable to  train  our

younger generation, as they can only train people  to

be  courageous but lacking in patriotism. Let us look

at  the  countries around us in South-east Asia.  For

example,  Cambodia,  Thailand  and  Formosa  have  an

institute  for  physical education. But  in  our  own

country,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>



where  the  Government  is  stressing  the  need  for

physical  education, we do not  have  a  college  for

physical  education.  This is a  matter  for  regret.

Everybody cannot deny that as an independent  nation,

we  must  stress the importance of national survival.

Emphasis  should  not be put on  the  survival  of  a

particular college, and this should be our assessment

of values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should train our younger generation to be brave,

strong,  and  determined  citizens,  and  to   become

members   of  a  closely-knit  society.   We   should

strengthen our younger generation so that  they  will

be  energetic,  of upright character, and  strong  in

body  and mind, to enable them to play their role  in

nation-building. Therefore, university undergrads  or

college  students should be people who are strong  in

body  and mind, who are determined, and who are  full

of  vitality, energy and stamina. Apart from this, it

is  also  important that they should also be equipped

with   knowledge  and  discipline.  They  should   be

patriotic and loyal to their country, dedicated,  and

be willing or prepared to sacrifice themselves in the

interests of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we must also pay attention to

the  academic  side of a college or  university.  The

Principal  of Ngee Ann College is to be appointed  by

the Council according to this Bill, and there will be

a  Senate  formed  by  the academic  staff  who  will

supervise  its academic affairs. I suggest  that  the

composition  of  the Senate should  also  include  at

least  one  or  two  scholars of  high  international

standing to carry out joint research into measures to

strengthen  the discipline and to raise the  academic

standard of the college.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, university education is the acme of our

national  education. It not only produces specialists

but it is also a matter of prestige for a country  to

have  a  university. Whether a university is properly

run or not will affect other levels of education, for

example,  secondary  and primary education.  It  will

also affect the international image of the country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to point out is that every year

every  student is entitled to a bursary of $120  from

Ngee  Ann  College,  compared  with  $2,000  for  the

Polytechnic  students. We know that Ngee Ann  College

cannot  truly be a college. What it should do  is  to

build itself up gradually by setting up courses which

are needed by our society, and eventually grow into a

full-fledged  college.  As a matter  of  fact,  every

college,  apart  from  its  general  courses,  should

concentrate on one or two important courses in  order

to  cope  with  the  needs of our  society,  such  as

training university talent to promote the development

of  our  country  and to make a greater  contribution

towards the advancement of our society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ngee Ann  College  Bill  is  now

introduced into this House. According to the Minister

for  Education, this is done at the request  of  Ngee

Ann  College.  On this, I feel that the Committee  of

Management   of  Ngee  Ann  Kongsi  are  very,   very

realistic in their approach.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>4.09 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also shows that the authorities of Ngee Ann

College  are confident about their College. Thus  the

future  of  the  Ngee Ann College  students  will  be

ensured. We know that the College was set up in 1963.

The  term  is a four-year course. The first batch  of

students will graduate this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not easy for higher institutions like

Ngee  Ann  College to be successful. I know that  the

Ngee Ann College Development Committee has produced a

report. According to this report on Ngee Ann College,

there  should be certain prerequisites if  it  is  to

develop.   For  instance,  there  should   be   ample

financial  resources and facilities and a large  team

of  teachers with good qualifications. On  the  other

hand,  the report says that it is also necessary  for

the  College to recruit students of an equal standard

of education. At the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>



moment,  the  students  of  Ngee  Ann  College   have

different  levels  or  standards  of  education.  The

report also holds the view that the present situation

in  Ngee  Ann College is causing concern  because  of

lack  of  financial resources, poor  facilities,  and

shortage  of  teaching staff. Therefore,  the  report

holds the view that in order to turn the College into

a  university  where  it can confer  degrees,  it  is

necessary for it to consider its problems further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ngee Ann College Bill, as we all know, is

based  on  the Thong Saw Pak Report. The  report  has

gone  into a detailed discussion of the role of  Ngee

Ann  College and the courses to be provided,  it  has

also  gone into the details of higher education  that

we need, and it suggests that Ngee Ann College should

not  set  up courses in those fields already provided

by  other  higher  institutions of learning.  On  the

other  hand,  the report says that Ngee  Ann  College

should specialise in technology and commerce in order

to keep up with the needs of industrialisation in our

country. Therefore, it suggests three points  in  the

recruitment  of  new  students. Firstly,  specialised

training  should  include  engineering  and  commerce

reaching  a  degree  standard. Secondly,  large-scale

comprehensive training to enable the students  to  be

prepared   to  meet  the  changes  in  commerce   and

industry. Thirdly, to recruit apprentices for  newly-established industries and firms. On this it suggests

that  there  should  be prior consultation  with  the

Economic Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am of the view that these suggestions are

very  practical and useful because we are  developing

the  College  and the talent produced by  our  higher

institutions  of learning should be in  keeping  with

the  needs of our society. If the higher institutions

of our country do not plan well for their development

but   engage  themselves  in  producing  a  body   of

graduates  who  are not useful in the development  of

our  country, then a social problem will  be  created

for our country to meet.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also provides for the setting up of

a  Council  whose members will include the  Principal

and Deans of Faculties, three representatives of Ngee

Ann  Kongsi, three members appointed by the  Minister

for  Education,  one representative of  the  Economic

Development Board, and some others. But the Bill does

not   provide  for  student  representation  on  this

Council.  Is it because the Ngee Ann College students

had  staged  a  boycott of classes in the  past,  and

therefore cannot have the right to be represented  on

the  Council?  This  is quite  contrary  to  what  is

provided for in the Nanyang University Council  where

there  is  student  representation.  So  I  hope  the

Minister will be able to clarify the matter  to  this

House.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although Ngee Ann College has only a short

history of four years, there have been many incidents

connected  with  it. For instance,  in  October  last

year,  there was a boycott by its students.  We  know

that  this  boycott  was agitated  by  elements  with

ulterior motives. It did not have the support of  the

general mass of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that when this Bill is passed and

enforced, it will be able to help Ngee Ann College to

develop  properly on correct lines and  to  help  our

country to produce talent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the decision

to set up Ngee Ann College as a community college was

taken  by  Ngee Ann Kongsi itself, and this  Bill  is

introduced  at the request of the Kongsi. Actually  I

am  a  bit  puzzled because the Member  for  Thomson,

whilst  supporting  the introduction  of  this  Bill,

spoke against the concept of a community college. The

Bill  provides specifically for the setting up  of  a

community  college. I do not see  how  he  can  speak

against the setting up of a community college and yet

support the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not going into the merits

and  demerits of the academic staff appointed by Ngee

Ann College



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>



and  whether  the existing Ngee Ann College  has  the

facilities,  the staff and the financial  support  to

enable it to be run as a university. I think all this

has  been thoroughly gone into by the Thong  Saw  Pak

Committee. Most of the comments raised by the  Member

for  Thomson  should, I think, have been directed  to

Ngee Ann Kongsi anyway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar raised the question of the

setting up of a Department of Physical Education  for

Ngee  Ann College. This is very much in the  mind  of

the  Ministry of Education. We are, in fact,  in  the

process  of  planning  the  setting  up  of  such   a

department  at the Teachers' Training College.  As  I

have  said earlier, this Bill will be referred  to  a

Select  Committee.  I  think  there  will  be   ample

opportunity  for Members who are interested  in  this

particular  piece  of  legislation  to  voice   their

opinions in Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<div align="center"><b>EXPORTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the proviso to section 5 of the Control

of  Imports and Exports Ordinance (Chapter 214),  the

Controller  and Registrar of Imports and  Exports  is

unable to cancel, suspend or amend any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>



import   licence   or  permit  until   the   existing

irrevocable letter of credit issued in respect of  it

has   expired.   There  have  been  instances   where

manufacturers have asked for the imposition of  quota

restrictions,  and  with  the  knowledge  that   such

restrictions would be implemented soon, they or their

friends are suspected to have taken advantage of  the

proviso  to  section  5 of the Ordinance  by  placing

orders with overseas buyers in quantities much larger

than  they  normally  import and  establish  covering

letters  of credit just before the quota restrictions

are imposed. There are also instances where merchants

and   banks   are  suspected  to  have  connived   in

backdating letters of credit so as to take  advantage

of  opportunities  arising  from  the  imposition  of

quotas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to prevent these disruptive

practices,  it is considered that the recognition  of

an   irrevocable   letter   of   credit   should   be

discretionary  and  not mandatory.  In  other  words,

where  letters  of credit have been  opened  in  good

faith,  then  such imports will be  allowed.  On  the

other  hand, if there are strong grounds of suspicion

that  there  is  improper advantage  being  taken  of

foreknowledge of a quota or ban or that the banks, in

connivance  with  the traders, have  backdated  their

letters  of  credit,  then the imports  will  not  be

allowed  even if irrevocable letters of  credit  have

been established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was originally proposed that

the  proviso to section 5 of the Control  of  Imports

and Exports Ordinance (Chapter 214) be deleted so  as

to  enable  Government to cancel, suspend,  amend  or

disallow  any  import  licence or  permit  for  goods

covered  by an irrevocable letter of credit. However,

the  Chambers of Commerce and banks have advised that

the   deletion  of  this  proviso  would   give   the

Controller  and  Registrar  of  Imports  and  Exports

unfettered powers to cancel even import licences  for

goods   covered   by   genuine  letters   of   credit

established   in   good  faith.   This   may   create

uncertainty  among the trade and could react  to  the

discredit  of  Singapore  as  a  trading  centre.  I,

therefore, propose to suggest an amendment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>



to  clause 2 of the Bill during the Committee  stage.

This  amendment  will give the Government  powers  to

reject, cancel or suspend import licences covered  by

irrevocable  letters  of  credit  suspected   to   be

established not in good faith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, the

amendment to the Bill amending the Control of Imports

and Exports Ordinance attempts to restrict the powers

sought  in  the  Bill  which,  as  it  stands,  gives

absolute  discretion to the Controller to  cancel  or

vary  import  licences whether or not an  irrevocable

letter  of  credit exists. This amendment  is  to  be

welcomed  as  Singapore is a trading  city.  Whatever

might   be   the  success  of  its  industrialisation

programme, its geographical position determines  that

its  trading activity will go on expanding. And in  a

trading city traders must feel secured that bona fide

arrangements  and  commitments  in  trade   will   be

honoured.  The essence in trade is that delivery  and

acceptance  are made as scheduled. I quite appreciate

that  there have been and there will be circumstances

in  which it is justifiable for the State to step  in

and  interfere  with trade. But I  submit  that  such

circumstances must be rare and far between.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wording of the amendment, I should like to

hear  the views of the Members of this House who  are

in  the  legal profession. As a layman, I  see  great

difficulties in implementing the law if the amendment

as  it  stands is passed. My experience  in  business

tells  me  that all letters of credit are established

in  good  faith  by the banker and  his  client,  the

importer. Without such good faith or confidence,  the

banker  will  not issue a letter of credit.  I  think

what  is  in  doubt  is not so much  the  good  faith

between  the banker and his client as the  morals  of

the  importer.  Circumstances  may  arise  where   an

importer,  as  the  Minister  for  Finance  has  just

mentioned, armed with foreknowledge acquired  legally

or  more  likely  illegally,  attempts  to  frustrate

Government's intentions and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>



enriches  himself by extraordinary imports.  For  one

man  to enrich himself in this way at the expense  of

the  nation  and the people is obviously immoral  and

reprehensible. Tire State, indeed, has a duty to step

in.  What  I  am  worried  is  whether  the  proposed

amendment as it stands enables the State to do  this.

I  should feel happier if Members in this House  will

assist  with  words which will enable  the  State  to

intervene  and only intervene in the circumstances  I

have narrated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, far from

interfering in any trading that is being  carried  on

in   Singapore,  it  is  the  avowed  policy  of  the

Government  to  allow freedom of  trade  as  much  as

possible.  But, as I have said in moving  the  Second

Reading  of  the Bill, we have come across  instances

where letters of credit were opened and there was  an

absence  of good faith. In fact, there was connivance

between  the  banks.  Hence the  necessity  for  this

amendment. I can assure the Member for Havelock  that

the wording of the amendment as it stands will enable

us  to  prevent  or discourage such malpractices  and

punishment   meted  out  if  they  ever  arise.   The

amendment has been vetted by the S.A.G.'s Office and,

as  far as I can ascertain, the legal phraseology  is

as  it  should be. If the hon. Member has  reason  to

believe that it is not so, then I welcome any further

amendment by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San].

the end of line 10 and insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"by deleting the proviso thereto and substituting

therefor the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that any cancellation, suspension or

variation of the conditions of any import licence  or

permit  shall  not  be  enforced  until  an  existing

irrevocable letter of credit issued in respect of  it

has expired, unless such officer or person has reason

to believe that such irrevocable letter of credit was

not established in good faith.".".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as stated earlier, the deletion of

the  proviso to section 5 of the Control  of  Imports

and  Exports  Ordinance may create uncertaint3  among

the trade and react to the discredit of Singapore  as

a  trading centre if the Controller and Registrar  of

Imports  and Exports has unfettered powers to  cancel

or  reject import licences for goods covered even  by

genuine letters of credit established in good  faith,

it  is almost impossible for a hank to dishonour  the

terms  of  a  genuine irrevocable  letter  of  credit

opened  in good faith once it has been issued and  is

still valid and correct.. Both banks and traders  may

therefore  be  afraid to open letters  of  credit  in

future  in  cases  where there is a possibility  that

import licences may be withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended clause drafted in consultation with the

Chambers   of   Commerce  and  banks   empowers   the

Controller  and Registrar of imports and  Exports  to

cancel, suspend, amend or disallow any import licence

or  permit for goods covered by any letter of  credit

only  when  he  has reason to believe  that  such  an

irrevocable  letter of credit was not established  in

good faith.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very short Bill the purpose of which is to

rationalise  the  organisational  pattern  of   trade

unions catering for workers in the essential services

in the public sector. Under the existing Trade Unions

Ordinance,  workers employed by statutory  boards  or

statutory  bodies  such  as  the  Port  of  Singapore

Authority,  unlike Government servants  are  free  to

join  any trade union they like. For instance,  there

is  nothing  to  prevent gas workers  of  the  Public

Utilities Board from enrolling as members in  any  of

the  existing  general unions  which  cater  for  all

categories of workers in the private sector  if  they

choose  to do so. This laxity in the trade union  law

has  created a ludicrous situation in which  we  find

that  workers  engaged in essential services  in  the

public  sector are tied up with a predominant  number

of   other   categories  of  workers  in   the   same

organisation,  and that the former is  bound  by  the

constitution of the organisation to act according  to

whatever is the majority decision, including that  on

industrial  action  taken  by  the  latter.   As   an

illustration,  I cite the case of the  Public  Daily-Rated  Transport  Workers' Union. This  union  has  a

membership  of 839 daily-rated workers, 402  of  whom

are  from  the Public Works Department, 212 from  the

Public  Health  Department, and 225 from  the  Public

Utilities   Board.  Its  25-man  executive  committee

consist  of 17 Government daily-rated workers  and  8

workers  from the Public Utilities Board. The control

of  the union and the management of its affairs  are,

therefore, in the hands of the Government daily-rated

workers because of their overwhelming majority. Under

this peculiar set-up, the 225 members from the Public

Utilities  Board can never act independently.  Within

the union they have to abide by the majority decision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Government daily-rated workers  even  though

such decision may conflict with their own interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until its deregistration recently, the Public Daily-Rated Employees Unions Federation was also in the

same  unhealthy  position. There were  13  unions  of

daily-rated  workers affiliated  to  the  Federation.

Three  of  them catered for workers employed  by  the

Public   Utilities  Board  in  the  Water,  Gas   and

Electricity  services.  One catered  for  the  Public

Utilities Board and the Government transport workers.

Another catered for the Housing and Development Board

workers.  The  remaining eight  catered  for  workers

employed   by   Government.  The  Central   Executive

Committee  of  the  Federation  was  composed  of  21

members. But the 4,500 workers employed by the Public

Utilities  Board, who constituted more than one-third

of  the aggregate membership of the affiliates of the

Federation,  had  only 5 representatives  sitting  in

that  Central Executive Committee. Under this set-up,

this group of 4,500 workers in the essential services

also  had  to  follow whatever decision was  made  by

those  workers not engaged in the essential  services

who  constituted the majority. Surely this is not the

way  trade union democracy should be practised in our

democratic   society.   This   pattern    of    union

organisation  is not only undesirable,  but  it  also

provides  a  danger  point for  the  enemies  of  the

Republic  to disrupt civil order. The recent  illegal

cleansing strike and the threatened general strike of

daily-rated  workers  in  the  public  sector  was  a

classic example of how easily this situation could be

exploited to deprive the people of Singapore of their

daily   essential   supplies  of   water,   gas   and

electricity.  The overall economic situation  of  the

country and Singapore's economic future demands  that

positive  measures should be taken to regularise  the

position.   The  services  provided  by  the   Public

Utilities Board are part of the vital services of the

country.  I  am  sure that all of  us  who  have  our

economic future at heart



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>



will  agree that it is absolutely necessary that  the

workers in this area should he given full freedom  to

act  independently  in their own  organisation.  They

should  also  be  given adequate  protection  against

outside  control and exploitation to ensure that  our

vital  public  utilities will not be  jeopardised  by

irresponsible  elements using deplorable  tactics  to

coerce  conformity under the pretext of  trade  union

democracy.   Briefly,  Sir,  these   are   the   main

considerations which have compelled the Government to

introduce the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill confers on the Minister discretionary

powers  to specify any statutory board or body  whose

employees  shall  have to form their  own  union.  If

there  is  more  than  one  union  organised  in  the

specific  statutory hoard or body,  they  may  freely

enter  into  amalgamation or form a federation  among

themselves,  but  the  consent  of  the  Minister  is

required  for  the  purpose  of  affiliation   to   a

federation  of  trade unions if one or  more  of  its

affiliates cater for workers other than employees  of

that particular statutory board or body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new provisions in the Bill will affect the

employees  of only a few statutory boards  which  are

providing  the vital services of the country.  It  is

certainly  not  the  intention of the  Government  to

alter  the present position with regard to the  trade

union activities of employees of statutory boards  or

bodies  which  are not connected with  the  essential

services, or are less important as far as the running

of  the economy of the country is concerned, such  as

the  Adult  Education  Board, the  Seamen's  Registry

Board,  the Central Provident Fund Board and  so  on.

Ironically, it is just because these provisions  will

affect  only  a  few  existing  unions  that  vicious

accusations  are  being made,  both  locally  and  at

international level, that the Trade Unions  Ordinance

is  being amended to crush an institutional group and

to  suppress  freedom of association.  This  is  very

untrue.   Only   persons  with  an  irrational   mind

stimulated by sinister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>



motives can make such an irresponsible and irrational

allegation.  I  regret  to say that  the  Amalgamated

Unions of Public Employees confused the issue further

by  rushing to print in its journal, the Mimbar,  its

letter to the Prime Minister which contained a number

of  misleading  points. I hope that the  inaccuracies

are  just honest mistakes made by the writers who had

misread  the  Bill,  and not a wilful  distortion  of

facts  intended  to confuse the issue.  The  A.U.P.E.

states, among other things, that the Bill will affect

the  Teachers' Union because the Minister may declare

the  aided-school teachers as a body, in which  event

the  aided-school teachers will have to form separate

unions.  The  A.U.P.E. also claims that the  Minister

may  declare  a  group of Government employees  as  a

body, thereby forcing such group of employees to form

a  separate  union. It also jumps to  the  conclusion

that   the  registration  of  the  Singapore   School

Clerical Staff Union a month after the First  Reading

of the Bill, is an attempt to splinter the A.U.P.E. I

would   never   have  imagined  that  such   shocking

misrepresentations could come from the A.U.P.E. whose

efficient organisation and capable leadership I  have

long admired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the wording of subsection (1) of the new

section  29A  of  the Bill is plain and  simple.  The

operative  phrase  is, "No workman employed  by  such

statutory  board or body.. .". Aided-school  teachers

are  not employed by any statutory board or body.  It

is absolute nonsense to suggest that the Minister has

the power or intends to specify aided-school teachers

or  a group of Government employees as a body. I will

repeat  here that the Bill will not in any way affect

the teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Singapore School Clerical Staff

Union, the fact that its registration came after  the

First Reading of the Bill is just a coincidence. This

union  was formed by a group of Chinese school clerks

in  November  1966  after  they  had  failed  to  get

themselves admitted to the Chinese School Teachers'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>



Union,  because its constitution does not  cater  for

membership   of   clerks.  The  union   applied   for

registration   on  10th  November,  1966,   and   was

registered on 8th April, 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have just said, this union was formed by

Chinese  school clerks and its object is to  organise

the  clerks in Chinese schools. Although the  union's

rules  do  not debar the clerical staff in Government

schools  from joining its membership, the union  will

not be able to recruit the Government school clerical

staff, the reason being that this is a non-Government

servant  union  and the clerical staff in  Government

schools  are  debarred  by  law  from  joining   non-Government  servant unions. On the  other  hand,  the

A.U.P.E. is  not  permitted  by  law  and  its   own

constitution  to recruit as members clerks  in  aided

schools.  I therefore see no reason why the  A.U.P.E.

should  take objection to the Chinese school  clerks,

who  have  hitherto  no union  to  look  after  their

interests,  coming  together and  forming  their  own

union. Perhaps it was confused thinking that prompted

the  leaders  of  the A.U.P.E. to  believe  that  the

registration  of the Singapore School Clerical  Staff

Union  has anything to do with the Bill and that  the

proposed  amendments  are intended  to  splinter  the A.U.P.E.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it remains now for me to repeat that the Bill

is not designed to crush any individual or union. Its

sole  purpose  is  to rationalise the  organisational

pattern   of  trade  unions  in  the  public   sector

connected  with essential services. But  some  people

foolishly  believe  that they are  so  important  and

indestructible that the Government has  to  take  the

trouble to pass this law just to cause their downfall

and nothing else. This is childish thinking. If it is

only  a  few individuals that are worrying us,  there

are  many other methods and laws which we can use  to

deal  with  them. We need not have to go through  all

these  First, Second and Third Readings to get a  new

Bill  passed. These few individuals can be dealt with

effectively  and conclusively. But what we  are  more

concerned with is the future of our economy on  which

the   livelihood  of  all  of  us  depends.  We   are

determined that no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>



one - not even the strongest personality in the trade

union  field - can do anything to cause the  loss  of

confidence in our economy. However, there may be some

people - forces from outside, for instance - who like

to  see our economy go down. One way they can do this

is  by  manipulating  some of our  trade  unions  and

leaders and causing labour unrest. The way things are

with  many  categories of workers  in  the  essential

services grouped together in one giant union,  it  is

comparatively  easy  for anyone  to  create  a  minor

industrial dispute in any section, then spreading  it

to affect the workers in the whole union, and in next

to no time we will find strikes all over the place  -

telephone,  post  office,  water,  electricity,  gas,

telegraph services all stopped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> All under A.U.P.E.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> In fact, the whole city will be

paralysed. This will definitely shake the economy  of

Singapore, causing a flight of capital. This Bill  is

only one of the measures to safeguard against such  a

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of talk about this Bill being in

contravention   of  the  principle  of   freedom   of

association of the I.L.O. But we are not denying  any

worker  his right to join any trade union. We do  not

even  want  to  deregister the A.U.P.E or  any  other

omnibus union or hamper its work. In fact, this  Bill

was  read the First time on the 27th of February this

year  and  it  should  have gone through  its  Second

Reading in the last Parliament sitting in March.  But

we  deliberately postponed it to give fair notice  to

all  concerned, including the A.U.P.E. We have  given

them  ample time to readjust their internal  affairs.

With  the  time given, they can, I am sure, form  new

unions  for workers in the different statutory boards

if they want to and we will have no objection to such

a  move.  But I regret to say that the A.U.P.E. have

not   made  use  of  the  time  available   to   make

readjustments  within the union.  Instead  they  have

taken this postponement to mean weakness on the  part

of  the Government. They even cherish the faint  hope

that the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>



may  yield to pressure applied from within  and

without the country and withdraw the Bill. I must say

that they have taken the wrong advice. We know we are

doing  the right thing for Singapore and we will  not

yield  to  any lobbying or pressure. We  can  justify

publicly in Singapore the course we are taking and we

are prepared to justify it on an international level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will not affect the affiliation of local

trade    unions   to   international   trade    union

organisations. In recent years, more and  more  local

trade unions have extended their activities into  the

international field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

sorry that the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill has been

moved  by  the  Minister for Labour.  Its  object  is

nothing  else but to break up and control the  unions

by a policy of divide and rule. Perhaps he is worried

about  workers  who are uniting in a  militant  trade

union  to  struggle for their own rights.  Amendments

one  after another to the Trade Unions Ordinance have

been   moved   in  this  Parliament  to  stifle   the

achievements  of unions who have made  progress.  Not

long  ago,  an  amendment Bill was approved  in  this

Parliament  to prohibit P.U.B. employees from  taking

industrial  action. There were also other amendments,

and  bank employees were also affected. All this goes

to  show  that  the  trade unions will  face  a  very

difficult situation. The Minister for Labour believes

that the militant trade unions can be controlled only

in  this way. But he is unaware that the workers  are

fully conscious of the tactics of employers to weaken

them  and that they are ever willing to struggle  for

their legitimate rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on one occasion, the Minister for

Labour, when refuting a statement made by the  Member

for  Bras Basah, said that the Member for Bras  Basah

took   part  in  trade  union  activities  only  very

recently.  He  also said that he had more  experience

and  that although he had been to prison at one time,

it would not dampen his spirit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>



to  struggle for the cause of labour. Today he is the

Minister   for  Labour.  Likewise  the  workers   are

prepared  to  sacrifice  their  time  and  energy  to

struggle for their legitimate rights and interests. I

believe  that the spirit of the workers of  Singapore

is  strong  today, unlike in the past, and that  they

are  prepared to face any consequences. So with  this

amendment  Bill,  I  think the workers  will  not  he

weakened in their struggle for their rights.  On  the

contrary,  they will consolidate their  position  and

they  will be even more determined to fight for their

interests in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy of the present

Government  to  unite  trade unions  and  to  abolish

splinter  or  yellow  unions  has  been  welcomed  by

workers  throughout Singapore. It  was  through  this

policy  that  the ruling party, which is  pro-labour,

came  to  power.  Many unions have  adhered  to  this

policy  with  the  result that  unions  catering  for

insurance   company  workers,  bank  employees,   the

Singapore  Manual and Mercantile Workers'  Union  and

many other unions have been established. But what  is

strange  is that this amendment Bill mainly  concerns

workers  in  the P.U.B., whilst workers in commercial

firms  are not affected by it. Although the  Minister

for  Labour  has  stated  that  the  object  of  this

amendment  is not to suppress the unions in  general,

nevertheless, there is no doubt that it  is  directed

against   a  particular  union  or  unions.   It   is

unjustified,  Mr Speaker, because this amendment  is

designed  to  restrict a particular union  while  not

affecting other trade unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Inche Ariff, will you be very

much longer?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff:</b> Not very much longer.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): This is admitted by

the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Finance  when he answered a question from the  Member

for  Anson.  He  admitted that the prices  of  staple

foods  have  risen but that the salaries  of  workers

have  not  been given a fair rise. In preventing  the

workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



from  asking or agitating for more pay, the  Minister

for Labour is moving this amendment to establish more

unions  so  that  the spirit of the  workers  can  be

dampened.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in

bringing  this amendment Bill forward,  the  Minister

for Labour has said that this amendment would benefit

both workers and employers. Even so, it is the object

of  the  Government  that the  trade  union  movement

should be strengthened. In these circumstances, trade

unions which are now united in big organisations  are

to  be  broken up into splinter unions. This, I feel,

is  the  real motive of this amendment. If we try  to

break  the match sticks in a box all at once,  it  is

impossible.  But  to break them one  by  one  is,  of

course,  an  easy  task. If the Government  helps  to

unite the unions, it will be of great benefit to  the

country.   The  statutory  boards  are  now   to   be

separated,  and it is also intended that  the  unions

should  be  splintered and their backbones broken.  I

feel that this is the motive of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each sitting of Parliament the Minister for

Labour  brings forward an amendment, and  perhaps  at

the  next  sitting too he will bring forward  certain

amendments.  My  feeling is that he really  wants  to

break up the labour movement. He says that he has  in

mind  the interests of the workers. He ought to  know

exactly  how to bring about a better labour movement.

But  it is totally wrong of him to think of ways  and

means  to  break up the unity of labour.  Members  of

unions  have  certain rights and if they are  divided

and broken up,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



then   this  amendment  does  not  serve  any  useful

purpose.  Take  the  case of a  union  of  about  100

members.  What  can  they really  do?  How  can  they

improve  their  living standard? Can they  fight  for

their  rights?  They cannot. But if they  are  united

with  other unions, they can certainly find ways  and

means  to fight for their rights. Let us take another

example,  the public daily-rated workers.  One  union

may  ask  for $6 a day wage, and another may ask  for

$7,  while yet another may ask for $4. If each  union

asks  for  a  different rate, how  are  we  going  to

rationalise these demands? But if they all belong  to

one union and speak with one voice, it will be easier

for   statutory  boards,  Government,   and   private

companies to deal with this one union. But now,  step

by step, the unions are being broken up. What will be

the  final result for the labour movement?  There  is

the  basic  doubt  whether the labour  movement  will

survive in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister spoke about the A.U.P.E. He praised it, and quite rightly so. A.U.P.E. has approximately 40,000 members and it is growing from strength to strength. One day it may be able to pose a threat to the Government. But up to now it has not behaved in such a manner as to threaten the Government. So far

it  has  followed the labour laws. It has taken  into

consideration the interests of the workers. It has  a

responsible  leadership. I do not  think  there  have

been any harmful moves by the A.U.P.E.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the Government goes on legislating in this

manner, it will finally affect the workers to a  very

great  extent.  This is my opinion.  Then  what  will

become of them in the end? This is something we ought

to consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the labour movement in other

countries,  we  find  that some  unions  have  80,000

members;   others   have  100,000  members,   200,000

members, and so on. In such countries we do not  come

across  any dangerous elements. Our country is small,

and  our unions are also small. So if our unions  are

united,  they will be able to fight for their rights.

But if they are broken up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



little  by  little, it will not do the Government  or

our people any good. That is my opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in considering this amendment Bill, we

must   remember   the  several  other   Trade   Union

(Amendment) Bills that have been passed in this House

before.  I think that this particular amendment  Bill

should be sent to Select Committee to seek the  views

of  the  unions and of the people. Therefore, I  urge

the  Minister to send this amendment Bill  to  Select

Committee.



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  Bill before the House is significant,  not  for

any  vigorous  controversy it has  aroused  in  trade

union circles in Singapore, but for the misconception

entertained  in certain international labour  circles

regarding the intentions of the Bill. It has come  to

my  knowledge,  as  Secretary  of  the  International

Relations  Department of the N.T.U.C.,  that  certain

international trade secretariats have been  seriously

and grossly misled about the purpose and intention of

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These quarters have been led to believe that the

Bill  has  the most despicable motivations, and  that

the Prime Minister of Singapore is behaving just like

an  African  despot, and that he is out  to  cut  the

A.U.P.E. down to size, and particularly Mr Kandasamy

down to size. I do not for a moment believe that this

is  the  intention of the Government. Besides I  also

understand that the A.U.P.E. at the moment  does  not

pose  any  threat  or danger at all.  The  people  of

Singapore would laugh at such stories because we know

that  they  are  simply not true. The  A.U.P.E. also

knows that this is not true. Indeed, the A.U.P.E. has

issued  a  statement  to the effect  that  the  Prime

Minister  "took great pains" to explain to  them  the

reasons for the introduction of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, certain international trade union

bodies, hitherto friendly to Singapore, have been led

to  believe, by certain persons in this region,  that

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>



Bill is motivated by the basest of considerations. My

information  is that some damage has  been  done,  at

least  in  some  international  labour  circles,   to

Singapore's image. As a loyal Singaporean  and  as  a

patriotic  trade unionist, I call upon the Government

to  give  the  lie to the mischievous interpretations

which have been given to the Bill internationally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to report to this House that the Central

Executive  Committee of the N.T.U.C. met on Saturday,

20th   May,  1967,  in  order  to  consider   certain

representations on the Bill which had been  submitted

to  the  N.T.U.C. only a few  days  earlier  by  the

A.U.P.E.,  and  after  due  consideration  agreed  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the Central Executive Committee of the

N.T.U.C.,   after  having  listened   to   the

explanations offered by the Prime Minister  at

a  recent  meeting, was satisfied  beyond  all

doubt  that  the Government's  bona  fides  in

introducing  this Bill were completely  above-board, and that the Bill was not aimed at  any

particular  trade union or at  any  particular

trade unionist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the N.T.U.C, was, nevertheless,

concerned   about  the  application   of   the

provisions  of  the Bill,  and  to  this  end,

certain representations would have to be  made

to  this  House by trade union representatives

in  Parliament with regard to the  removal  of

certain  anomalies which might arise from  the

application of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to announce, both for national and

international  information, that  almost  the  entire

Central  Committee  of  the N.T.U.C.,  including  Mr

Kandasamy,  accepted the bona fides of the Government

as  being above board, and appreciated the fact  that

the Bill was not directed at any particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



trade  union, but was motivated by considerations  of

the national interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members of the Central Committee of the

N.T.U.C. met  the Prime Minister last  week  and  he

explained  to  us exhaustively what he meant  by  the

"national  interest",  and  I  do  not  recall   that

anybody,    or   any   particular   trade   unionists

representing  employees  of the  public  sector  (who

would  be  primarily affected by this Bill) disagreed

with or in any way countered the considerations which

the Prime Minister advanced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I myself have laboured this point

to  some  extent,  simply  because  the  N.T.U.C. is

concerned  to  squash,  once  and  for  all,  rumours

generated  in  certain international  labour  circles

which   tend  to  have  a  damaging  effect  on   the

international  image of Singapore, which  we  in  the

patriotic  trade union movement deem it our  duty  to

cherish and uphold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I shall deal with some of the critical

observations   that  the  N.T.U.C. has   to   offer.

Normally,  the  Minister  for  Labour  discusses  the

provisions  of  any proposed labour legislation  with

the N.T.U.C. This has happened on all past occasions,

but  this  time the N.T.U.C. was by-passed.  I  would

like  an explanation from the Minister for Labour  as

to  why  this  was  allowed to  happen.  It  must  be

appreciated that relations of understanding  and  co-operation  between the Government and the  democratic

labour   movement   can  only   be   maintained   and

strengthened  through  closer  consultation  on   all

matters  affecting the interests of  labour;  not  to

say,  "Well,  we  are not afraid of the  trade  union

movement. At this moment we are very strong," and  so

on. I believe that closer consultation on all matters

is very necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the applications of the provisions of

this  Bill, it will have one unfortunate result,  and

that  is  the creation of a number of peanut  unions.

For example, the Minister for Labour has said earlier

on  that  in the transport section, there are members

from the P.U.B., members from the Housing Board,  and

members  from other sections. If this Bill is  passed

into law,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>



instead  of  solidifying  or  getting  the  employees

together  to  form  a union, it will  create  a  wide

division of workers and various small unions will  be

formed. This, I think, is not in the interest of  the

workers.  You  will remember that our Government  has

done a great deal in the past to do away with smaller

unions  or  peanut unions. We all remember  the  days

when  our  port  workers were divided into  at  least

eleven   peanut  unions.  Today,  as  a   result   of

Government policy, the port workers of Singapore come

under  a  single union. A number of similar  examples

may  be  cited, but if this Bill is passed into  law,

the Government will have taken a backward step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine some of the implications. Employees

of  the larger statutory boards, like the S.T.B., the

P.U.B. and  the Housing and Development  Board,  can

form  fairly  sizable  unions. Where  the  P.U.B. is

concerned,  the Bill might indeed have a  progressive

effect.  At  the moment, employees in the Water,  Gas

and   Electricity  Departments  belong  to   separate

unions,  while monthly-rated employees in the  P.U.B.

belong  to  yet another separate union. So where  the

P.U.B. is concerned, this Bill would make it possible

for all P.U.B. employees to be united into one single

union,  rather  than  being  distributed  among  four

separate unions, as is the case at present.  This  is

only confined to a sizable union. But in the case  of

the  transport workers, it is not in their interests.

Therefore,  as I said, where the P.U.B. is concerned,

this  Bill  would have a progressive  and  beneficial

effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees of the Housing and Development Board are

also  distributed at the moment between two different

unions,  a  daily-rated union, and the A.U.P.E.  They

too  will  now  be able to amalgamate into  a  single

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us take a look at the other side of the

coin.  Statutory bodies like the Currency Board,  the

Economic  Development  Board, the  Central  Provident

Fund   Board,   the   Adult  Education   Board,   the

Polytechnic, the University of Singapore,  the  Asian

Seamen's Club, the Seamen's Registry Board and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>



National  Theatre are small-time employers.  Some  of

the  Boards  employ  as  few as  15  to  20  persons.

Employees  of  most of these Boards  are  at  present

represented  by  the A.U.P.E. But  according  to  the

provisions of this Bill, they will now have  to  form

unions of their own, with the result that we will now

have  to  deal with at least nine new peanut  unions.

This  is  surely a retrogressive effect. It  is  true

that  the  Bill provides for a federation  of  unions

representing  statutory board employees,  subject  to

the prior approval of the Minister. But why should it

be   necessary   to   specify   that   trade   unions

representing  employees of statutory boards  may  not

form  a federation without the prior approval of  the

Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am prepared to accept that employees of statutory

boards may not be affiliated to any other trade union

or   federation  of  trade  unions  whose  membership

includes direct employees of the Government,  without

the  prior  approval of the Minister. But why  should

such   prior   approval  be  necessary   for   unions

representing  employees  of  the  various   statutory

boards  to  federate among themselves?  This,  in  my

view,  is  an unnecessary stipulation, and should  be

specifically deleted from the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wonders too whether it is really necessary to

stipulate that it is in "the national interest"  that

trade  unions  representing  employees  of  statutory

boards  may  only  affiliate with the  N.T.U.C.,  for

instance, subject to the approval of the Minister. It

surely  cannot  be  held  that  the  N.T.U.C. is   a

subversive organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that employees of statutory boards,

who  at  present belong to various unions,  may  have

their own views as to how best they ought to organise

themselves.  I  am  therefore  to  suggest   to   the

Government that it should consider sending this  Bill

to  a  Select Committee, with a view to studying some

of  the  undesirable results that may ensue from  the

application of the Bill, particularly the creation of

a  few peanut unions. The Select Committee would also

be  able  to consider representations from the  trade

unions involved, so that necessary changes may





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>



be  made to the Bill with a view to securing  a  more

intelligent   and  more  effective  organisation   of

employees  in  statutory boards. If the  Government's

intention is good and sincere, and they wish to  make

us  believe that, I appeal to the Minister for Labour

to  consider referring this Bill to Select Committee.

I  hope  he  will  not  just  simply  steamroller  it

through,  knowing  full well that he  is  capable  of

doing  it, as he has so many Back-benchers to support

him.  If this Bill is referred to a Select Committee,

I feel it will do justice to the unions and they will

be  given  a chance to make their representations  on

the Bill.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful

to  the Member for Bras Basah who has disclosed  that

the  Central Executive Committee of the N.T.U.C. has

expressed  its support for this Bill. It leaves  very

little for me to add to what I have already said just

now.  But  I do not understand why there is  so  much

fuss from the two Members about asking workers in one

giant  union  to form their own exclusive  unions  to

cater for their own interest. In one giant union,  as

I  see it, the voice of a section of the workers  may

be  submerged, but in their own exclusive union  they

can  look after their own interests more closely  and

discuss  matters more related to their conditions  of

work. The workers in the Port of Singapore Authority,

for  instance, which is one of our biggest  statutory

boards employing a great number of workers, have  got

their  own exclusive union for years. And nobody  has

said  that this is violating the principle of freedom

of association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has said that the

Bill  will lead to splinter unions, or what he  calls

"yellow unions". But let me put forward one case. The

workers in the Telephone Board, for instance, who are

members  of  the  A.U.P.E., had their  own  exclusive

union  in 1959. Nobody said then that they were being

denied the right of freedom of association. Now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



we  are  only  asking them to go back  to  their  old

position. Was it a yellow union then?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the workers will not lose anything.

They  can  have their own unions to look after  their

interests.  They can elect their own officials.  They

can  even have their own industrial disputes, but  so

long  as the industrial dispute or action is confined

to  their field of work, it can be dealt with without

much  harm  to the economy of the country. This  Bill

makes   it  less  possible  for  a  small  group   of

irresponsible trade union leaders, who have  ulterior

motives  or  who  are  being manipulated  by  outside

forces,  to  manoeuvre our workers in  their  bid  to

bring  the economy of the country to a grinding halt.

As  far  as  the workers are concerned, their  rights

remain the same and they can still be represented  by

unions  of their own choosing. I think, on the whole,

this Bill will benefit many of us in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that there are so many labour

laws which can be used to deal with the situation  in

the  event of a general strike in the public service.

For  instance, the Industrial Relations Ordinance can

be  used  to  refer  the dispute  to  the  Industrial

Arbitration  Court,  thereby stopping  a  threatening

strike.  But  this is only true when  we  have  trade

unionists who are prepared to play according  to  the

rules of the game and who have the paramount interest

of  the  country at heart. But when we come to  trade

unionists who have ulterior motives or who refuse  to

abide  by  the  law,  we  really  have  to  think  of

something  to  deal  with them. We  saw  such  things

happen  in  February when the leaders of  the  public

cleansing union decided to call an illegal strike. It

is  in  this  situation that we have  to  review  our

position   and  tighten  up  our  laws,  leaving   no

loopholes for them to exploit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah is worried about the

peanut unions which may spring up after this Bill  is

passed.  I  have already said earlier that for  those

sections   of  workers  who  belong  to  very   small

statutory  bodies  and  whose  work  is  of  a   less

essential nature, they may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>



be  allowed to remain in the same old union.  It  has

been suggested that the discretionary powers given to

the  Minister in clause 2 of the Bill should be given

to  the N.T.U.C. Sir, I have great confidence in  the

present leadership of the N.T.U.C., but I am not sure

what will develop in a few years to come. We may have

a  new  set of leaders, or we may have the  same  old

people.  But it is very improper that power  of  this

sort should be given to an organisation whose quality

of leadership cannot be consistent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>Clause 28 -



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> (In Mandarin): Mr

Speaker, Sir,I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 8, lines 27 to 37, to leave out the whole

of paragraphs (a) and (b) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a woman social worker, I

express my welcome and support for amendments to  any

Bill  which are beneficial to women. At present  when

our  country  is  in the process of nation  building,

more   than  half  the  population  are  women.   The

Government can tap the resources of such a  potential

force and raise their social and economic standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, an amendment is proposed to the Women's

Charter. I cannot see how the suggested amendment  to

clause  28  can benefit the women. I feel  that  when

this  amendment is implemented, the purpose for which

it  is  intended will be defeated. Under the  present

Women's  Charter,  there are  questions  relating  to

divorce  in respect of certain women who, because  of

their  nature or their peculiar circumstances, cannot

fulfil  their  matrimonial  relationship  with  their

husbands. Under the present law, there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>



no  provision for them to separate. Because  of  this

special  consideration,  the  Minister  considers  it

desirable,  by  the introduction of an amendment,  to

provide  such  people with an opportunity  to  get  a

divorce. The motive of the Government is good. But we

should  put our heads together and think in terms  of

whether  more  problems  will  be  created  for   the

majority  when  we consider the interests  of  a  few

people, and whether this will be of any good  to  the

country  or  the people as a whole. We  all  remember

that  in  1959  our society was one where  polygamous

marriages were allowed. The women in Singapore  were,

therefore,  in a very disadvantageous position.  Then

at  that time, the P.A.P, decided to wipe out for all

time such a bad system. Thus the Women's Charter came

into  being to enhance the position of women  and  to

accord  them  their rightful status and  position  in

their family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us look at the provisions of clause 28 of

this  (Amendment) Bill. We see that  there  are  many

things  which are detrimental to women. I would  like

all  the  gentlemen M.P.s in this House to understand

that I do not only speak for women but also for them,

because  if  this question arises it will affect  not

only  women  but  also all the  people  in  the  same

society.  In  other words, if a couple disagree  with

each other, they can avail themselves of clause 28 to

seek a divorce. After they have lived separately  for

seven years, the Judge can make use of the provisions

of  this  clause  to  grant them a  divorce.  At  the

moment, there is no such amendment, and I wonder  how

many  husbands  secretly and stealthily  visit  their

mistresses!  Although they have wives at  home,  they

frequent  bars and dance-halls where they meet  their

mistresses or some other bad women. As a result,  the

matrimonial relationship is endangered and the family

life  is  disrupted, and this leads  to  divorce.  If

clause  28  is  passed, it will afford  men  an  even

better  opportunity  to  carry  out  their  nefarious

activities in the open. This is tantamount to the old

practice  in  China where husbands were accorded  the

right to divorce their wives with a stroke of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



the  pen.  Certain husbands in Singapore  will  avail

themselves of the opportunity and say, "I cannot  get

along  with my wife. Our relationship is no  good.  I

want  to  live  separately from her and  after  seven

years,  I  want  a divorce." Certain women  can  also

avail  themselves of the opportunity to do  likewise.

Thus the provisions of this clause will be abused and

many  problems will be created. So more  people  will

abuse  the  provisions of this clause.  Fewer  people

will  get benefit from it. So there will be more harm

done than good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Select Committee, the Minister said that

husbands  as well as wives can ask for a  divorce  on

the  grounds provided in this clause. But as  we  all

know,  man  holds the economic power in our  society.

Very few women hold economic power in their hands. In

the  history of Singapore, we can see that all  along

women   have   been   subjected   to   colonial   and

environmental suppression in society. Under the  yoke

of  this  two-pronged suppression, the women of  this

country have never been able to raise their heads. It

was  only  when  the P.A.P. assumed office  that  the

people were gradually able to play an active part  in

the economic, social and political life of Singapore.

That  means  that  it  is  still  the  womenfolk   in

Singapore  who were behind time, and it is  difficult

for  them to compete with men. At the moment,  as  we

all  know, the victims are normally the women; seldom

are  they  men. If there are any men who are victims,

then  it can be attributed to their ill-luck or  they

have themselves to blame. So if the clause is passed,

I  should  think that women will still be the  losers

and  men  can revert back to their former  polygamous

position and they can then openly cohabit with  their

mistresses  outside and in the end will  be  able  to

marry them. So it will create a very bad tradition in

the  family and I ask whether this tradition is  good

for  our  country. Obviously the answer is no.  So  I

think  this  provision  should  be  amended.  If  the

Minister  is thinking only in terms of a  handful  of

women who cannot get along with their husband, then I

think  it  is not quite necessary, because they  have

every opportunity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



under  the  present  law  to avail  themselves  of  a

divorce.  If  they want a divorce  and  if  there  is

disharmony between them and their husband, they  have

provisions  in the present law to get a divorce.  Now

if  the  husband wants to get a divorce, he  will  be

able  to get it under the provisions of clause 28  of

this  amendment Bill. He can go outside and mix  with

his  mistresses and in the end he will get a divorce.

So  this  will  afford  man better  opportunities  or

facilities to carry out any misdeeds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that this question is not just one

relating  to  women. It is also a social problem  and

all  Members  of  Parliament should give  it  careful

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  concerning the objection raised by  the  Member

for Delta who considers that the 7-year period is too

long,  I think this does not really affect the issue.

Although  seven years is fairly long, if  the  couple

after  separation feel that it is painful to both  of

them  to carry on separately and if they want to come

back within this period, I do not think there is  any

disadvantage to the woman. The Member for  Delta  has

also  said that taking up divorce proceedings is  not

the  special  privilege  of the  man.  I  think  that

relates to both parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question whether or not a marriage is

successful, it is up to both parties to see that they

respect each other. The Women's Charter is mainly  to

promote the one-man-one-wife system. We can say  that

it  has worked quite successfully. But the Member has

also  said that there are and there will be many  men

who  will have concubines or mistresses. I think this

is  the  responsibility less of the man than  of  the

woman. If a woman is not vain and is willing to  take

up  a  proper job, no one will force her to become  a

concubine  or  a mistress. If she were a  vain  woman

looking only for the luxuries of life, then it is her

own  fault. So I hope that women will stand on  their

own  feet  and show that they are strong of will  and

determination,  and I also hope that the  Member  for

Delta, as a woman social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



worker, will educate them to seek proper jobs and

compete with men for equality.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would you like to wait first in case

there are any points raised by other Members?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I only want to clarify one

point.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now

the  Member for Sembawang has said that women  should

be  realistic  and stand on their own feet  and  earn

their  own livelihood. But I remember one case: there

was one woman who is a relative of his who, for three

years, could not get any job.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, that was not a point of

clarification. That was a thrust of the sword!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to

take  up  one point on the question of divorce.  From

the  Report of the Select Committee which met several

times, we see that other points on the amendment were

not  raised  except this question of  how  a  divorce

should  be  granted.  I for one am  strongly  against

divorce. This question centres on two persons. Before

a  marriage is contracted, the two parties must fully

understand and realise the heavy responsibilities  of

parenthood.  The  upbringing of their  children  lies

solely  with  them.  If  they  could  not  get  along

together  and want to go their own way for their  own

convenience, then do they or do they not  think  that

the children would be the first to suffer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> What if they have no children?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Never mind whether there are any

children  or  not, as the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister  for  Social Affairs has  pointed  out.

Surely  in  a  marriage there is always the  hope  of

begetting children, and I am very correct here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is: once a divorce is granted, as I

have said, the children



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>



will  suffer and not the parents. If they  do  get  a

divorce  and go their own way thereafter,  they  can,

after all, look for new pastures!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the points I wish to make, and I am

strongly against this idea of divorce. A marriage  is

for good. It is a river of no return. Once you plunge

into it, you either sink or swim.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, perhaps I should draw your

attention   to   clause  34  which   introduces   new

provisions for the welfare of children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I was just elaborating on

this  point in clause 28 which brings in the question

of  a  period  of seven years - a sort of  separation

before  a  divorce is granted. I say: no  divorce  at

all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, I sat on the Select Committee on the Women's

Charter  (Amendment) Bill, and the Member  for  Delta

was also on the Select Committee. The suggestions put

forward  by  her today had, if I remember  correctly,

been  raised in the Select Committee. Now  that  this

same  amendment is raised again, I feel it is  rather

redundant; actually it is not necessary to repeat the

opinions already uttered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally there are three very wrong opinions on the

part of women on women's problems. Firstly, they take

pride  in being able to be on an equal take pride  in

being  able  to  be on equal footing  with  men.  For

instance,  if a woman can drive or be a  pilot,  then

she  takes pride in it as symbolising her ability  to

compete with men. But for men, they do not take pride

in   being   able  to  sew.  So  this  would   be   a

retrogressive  attitude on the part  of  women.  They

want  to follow what men do - to be able to join  the

Army  and fight, etc. - then that would be the  glory

of women. That is the first wrong concept on the part

of some women.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they regard women as a kind of material

property. Even Plato talked of women as wives as well

as  property, and the treatment of women as  chattels

or property is also a wrong concept.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, women regard themselves as weaklings who

cannot  compete with men in politics,  economics  and

other  fields.  And  so  they want  to  seek  special

protection  under  the law or  some  other  means  of

protection.  Thus  it will impede  their  progressive

movement  and lead them to some other misguided  path

and put them in dire difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has been harping on the fact

that women in the present society are unable to be on

an  equal  status  with  men and,  therefore,  it  is

necessary  to  let them have some special  protection

under the law. Of course, we do not want to have  any

laws that will not protect women. But in the end when

women  rely on legal protection alone, that  will  do

more harm than good to them. Because if they want  to

enjoy bliss, one of the many types of bliss would  be

matrimonial  bliss,  i.e.,  to  have  a  good  family

relationship.  If  womenfolk are not  satisfied  with

their  lot and though they lie on the same  bed  with

their  husband  but have different dreams  -  seeking

some  other unrealistic aims - then they will be very

unrealistic.   It   actually   amounts   to   seeking

privileges and advantages and not something  else  to

maintain  a good family relationship. Thus  it  would

bring  the  marriage relationship down to a  material

level.   Because   there  are  some   men   who   are

economically less well-off than others,  if  material

or  financial  resources are the  sole  yardstick  in

maintaining  family harmony, then  it  will  put  the

matrimonial relationship on a commercial basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, would you try to relate your

remarks  to Madam Chan's opposition to the seven-year

provision?  Please speak on details  rather  than  on

general principles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel

I should direct my remarks to her because she regards

women as the weaker sex. We should also pay attention

to   another   point.  We  should  not  put   certain

restrictions  on  women.  We  should  not  make  them

continue with their unhappy family life after waiting

for seven years. Though



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



the  amendment  provides that after  seven  years  of

separation  a  woman  can get a divorce,  it  is  not

giving   her   a   free   hand.   There   are   other

considerations to be met before such a divorce can be

granted. I would like to draw your attention to  this

wording in clause 28 (b):" ... and is unlikely to be

reconciled  with him." This clearly  says  that  even

after  seven  years' separation, the party  concerned

cannot  get a divorce automatically. It is up to  the

Judge  to  see that there are facts to show that  the

party  concerned is unlikely to be reconciled. So  if

there  are such facts, then the court will decide  in

favour of a divorce. Such a situation will affect the

two  parties.  It  is  not just the  women  who  will

suffer.  It  is not because woman is the  weaker  sex

that she is willing to suffer such stark cruelty.  It

is  not for us to make divorce more difficult to  get

from  the legal point of view, and make the law  more

refined to prevent divorce. What the law should do is

to simplify the position for reasonable marriages and

to  simplify other matters. For instance, the British

Law Society has suggested that if both parties cannot

live together, then they can, by mutual consent,  get

a  divorce.  That  is something arising  out  of  the

actual situation in England. We think this could be a

very good guide for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also pay attention to another point. The

Member  for Delta has just now suggested the deletion

of  paragraphs (a) and (b) in clause 28. But she  has

not  suggested  that the proposed new paragraphs  (c)

and (d) in clause 28 should also be deleted. It would

seem  that the Member's attitude is that a  wife  can

have  the right to seek a divorce after seven  years'

separation, but not the husband. So it would be  more

proper  for us to take care also of the other  party,

and  not  just  one party. Otherwise, it  would  give

people  the  impression that  this  is  something  in

favour  of women and that the Member would like  this

to  be a woman's world. And she would rather see  men

in dire difficulties. I feel that the amendment moved

by the Member for Delta is not proper and it will put

our society in dire difficulties. Therefore, I oppose

her amendment and her views relating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>



thereto. If I want to talk, I can pour out a  torrent

of  words, but because of the limited time,  I  would

like to sit down now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  I  am  not  mistaken, the Member for Bukit  Merah

seems to be encouraging divorces.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In order to correct

the  wrong impression of the Member for Sembawang,  I

would  say  that  the trend in law is  such  that  we

should  make  it  as our guide.  I  do  not  mean  to

encourage divorces by quoting that example. At  least

I  can  declare that I do not encourage it. I do  not

like  to  see  anybody,  including  the  Member   for

Sembawang,  asking  for a divorce on  unjustified  or

trifling grounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  now discussing  the  Women's

Charter.  Originally I did not intend to  speak.  But

having  heard the speeches by various Members,  I  am

compelled to say something on this matter. Apart from

the fact that women have always accused men of having

done some misdeeds, they have always said that it  is

not  the men who are the victims, and divorce  always

puts  women, not men, in a disadvantageous  position.

There  is a Hokkien saying about a woman being an  Oh

you tan. In such a case, if the man does not want  to

get  a  divorce,  then  would he  have  to  become  a

"tortoise"  of  some  sort? Can  a  man  endure  this

without divorce? It is very correct then for  him  to

seek  a  divorce.  Divorce is a  misfortune  for  the

children. Who suffers? It is the children who suffer.

I say that to get a divorce would be like getting rid

of the sores or boils on the body. If the boil is not

cut off, it will enlarge and endanger other parts  of

the  body. So I feel that it is justifiable to get  a

divorce on reasonable grounds. If it is true  that  a

divorce  will  encourage a  man  to  get  married  to

another  woman, then I will oppose such  a  thing.  I

disagree  with the saying that divorce means  another

marriage.  It is not correct. Who will do that?  Some

women will do that. It is not something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>



men can help. If a woman does not want to get married

to  a  married man, what can the man do? Who will  be

wrong?  It  is such a woman who is wrong. Who  entice

the men? It is the women who use their feminine wiles

to entice the men. So I say that when women have done

something wrong, they should not claim that  the  men

have wronged them. The Chinese have a saying: If  you

marry  a dog you follow the dog; if you marry a cock,

you  follow  the  cock.  But  in  Singapore  this  is

different.  Very often women want to climb  over  the

head  of  men.  If  men  do not claim  divorce,  they

should.  I  do  not  encourage  divorces.  We  should

understand that divorce is painful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should direct our remarks to

the  seven-year period. I feel that it should not  be

so  long. If they do not wish to reconcile, it  would

not  work.  Even  after  70  years,  they  would  not

reconcile  if they do not wish to. The most important

thing  between the husband and wife is a feeling  for

each  other. Without this feeling, there  is  nothing

left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Delta has said that men can

go  out and misbehave. Women too can do likewise.  So

do  you  want  the men to be some sort of "tortoise"?

Seven  years  is  too long. It is not practicable.  I

would  suggest  one  year. If  there  is  no  feeling

between  the  husband and wife, what is  the  use  of

carrying  on for seven years? Can they be reconciled?

They  cannot  if there is no feeling for each  other.

The  most  important thing in marriage  is  that  the

husband and wife must feel for each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has said that most men want to

get  concubines  or to get married once  more.  Whose

fault is this? I can say that it is the fault of  the

women who are willing to be concubines to men. Why do

they allow men to get concubines? This may be due  to

some sort of encouragement by women. If a man has two

wives,  of  course, he has done wrong. But the  woman

who  is  willing  to be his second wife  is  also  to

blame.  If a woman has two husbands, whose  fault  is

it? Of course, it is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



fault  of the woman. So we must decide each  case  on

its  merits  or  demerits. What  I  mean  is  do  not

encourage  all  to  get a divorce.  But  when  it  is

necessary to get a divorce, we must do so;  and  when

it  is not necessary to get a divorce, we should not.

And  it  does  not  mean that divorce  means  getting

married again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, I do not

want to involve myself too deeply in this Bill. It is

not  that  I am altogether disinterested.  I  do  not

think  that  I  will have to take  advantage  of  any

clause that is proposed today. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

previous  speakers in the House have somewhat  misled

us  when they discussed whether or not divorce  is  a

good  thing.  The Member for Delta very  chivalrously

protected the rights of women. I do not know what the

Minister  for  Education has to add to what  she  has

said.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Fong, you must keep personalities

out of the debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Yes. But she presupposes that

all  men are evil. On the other hand, the Member  for

Tiong Bahru presupposes that all women are evil. Sir,

I  think  we are not here to discuss whether  men  or

women are born evil; neither is the discussion on the

question  of equality of women. The Member for  Delta

has   complained  that  the  economic  machinery   is

controlled by men. I think it is through no fault  of

men.  With regard to advertisements in the newspapers

for  jobs as lorry drivers or tractor drivers, in  a.

hundred  per  cent  of cases you do  not  find  women

applying  for such jobs. They simply refuse to  apply

for   these  jobs  because  they  acknowledge   their

physiological inferiority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, we have to consider whether this piece

of  legislation will build a happier community rather

than  discuss whether the men or the women  are  evil

beings. Sir, this is indeed a very advanced piece  of

legislation. In some countries they are still looking

forward to having this kind of legislation, but  they

have not so far got it. I think we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>



are  perhaps among the first Asian countries to bring

about  this  legislation. To have two persons  living

together  who are totally incompatible  is  not  only

disastrous to them, in that it is a mental strain  on

both parties, but it is also a definite detriment  to

the  family,  if  they  have any  children.  So  this

provision in the Bill is a means to regulate  such  a

situation  and not to encourage divorce as  suggested

by  some  hon.  Members in the House. It  provides  a

solution  for  this kind of cases. I do  not  believe

there  is  a  possibility of reconciliation  if  both

parties  are simply incompatible. So this is a  means

to  allow both parties to acquire freedom to  seek  a

divorce. They can still apply to court for a divorce,

and if it is granted, then they are free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Bukit Merah has pointed out

that  the  Member for Delta has deliberately proposed

to  delete  paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause  28  but

retain  paragraphs (c) and (d) so that the women  can

take  advantage of the clause and put the  men  in  a

disadvantageous position. That is why there are  four

paragraphs in that clause to provide equal rights and

opportunities for both parties to seek a  divorce  or

to  seek  a solution - freedom from the anxiety  that

when  they  go  home  one evening,  they  might  find

somebody who is out to annoy him or annoy her, as the

case may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this clause 28 of the Bill and I would

like  to  make it clear that its aim is to provide  a

solution for some married people living in misery and

not  a  clause  specifically  provided  to  encourage

divorces in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, seeing

that the Member for Delta is the only rose among  the

thorns  in this House, I think I will say a  word  on

her behalf in view of what the Member for Bukit Merah

has  said.  It is true that she, as a member  of  the

fair  sex, accepts the fact that in the present setup

of  society, women play second fiddle and, more often

than  not, they are the injured party. This is not  a

question of right or wrong, as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Bukit Merah has said, but whether she  is

realistic  and practical in her approach and  is  not

afraid  to  face facts. Although I do not agree  with

all  that  she has said, I feel that, to be  fair  to

her,  she  is  right  in standing  up  for  what  she

considers to be necessary for the advancement of  her

sex.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment

to  clause  28  was raised for consideration  by  the

Member for Delta during the proceedings of the Select

Committee on the Bill, of which she was a Member, and

was   negatived   by  the  Committee  after   careful

consideration.  I  think  the  Member   is   somewhat

concerned over this clause because she considers that

its  provision may work against the interest of women

in  Singapore. I should like to assure her that  this

is  not so. All that we are proposing to do with this

new  provision is to create an additional ground  for

divorce,  and  this provision is  novel  in  that  it

allows for divorce by consent, in addition, I repeat,

to  the present grounds for divorce which are already

provided  for in the Women's Charter, but  with  this

difference.  Under  the  existing  provision,  it  is

possible  to  get  a divorce only  when  one  of  the

parties   has   done  something  wrong,   e.g.,   the

commission  of  adultery, or is of incurably  unsound

mind. It has been found that there are many instances

where,  quite obviously, the marriage has failed  and

it  is no longer in the interest of either party  for

the  marriage to continue, although neither  of  them

has  committed adultery or done anything wrong or  is

of  incurably  unsound mind. I think the  Member  for

Delta  will agree that in such circumstances it would

be   better   for   the   parties   to   part.   But,

unfortunately,  they cannot get a divorce  under  the

present  law  which has no provision for  divorce  by

consent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I assure the Member for Delta

that  in  the  event of a divorce  by  consent  being

granted by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>



the  court under the amended law, no disadvantage  is

likely  to  accrue to the female party? She  will  be

able  to  claim  the usual relief in the  payment  of

alimony  by her husband or apply for custody  of  the

children,  if  any.  None of the existing  rights  or

benefits which the present law provides for women  in

divorce proceedings will be affected in any way.  The

only  thing is the provision for an additional ground

for divorce.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  my  main  point  is why  there  should  be  the

necessity  for the Women's Charter and  what  is  its

purpose?  The  purpose,  I feel,  is  to  enable  our

society  to be one in which the husband and the  wife

in  a  family can have mutual respect for each  other

and  to  encourage such families in our  society.  If

paragraphs  (a) and (h) of clause 28 are  agreed  to,

then  they will clearly go counter to the purpose  of

the  Women's  Charter, because, on the one  hand,  we

want to encourage people to have happy and harmonious

families, yet on the other hand, we will be providing

more grounds for divorce. Thus, I cannot get the true

and  exact meaning and purpose of the Women's Charter

and,  therefore, accept the assurance  given  by  the

Minister  just now on that point. I do not  say  that

this  provision will be detrimental to the wife after

the  divorce. But what I mean to say is that, at  the

moment,  we  are not just looking after a handful  of

people  who  want  to  get a divorce  but  that  this

provision for divorce would be misused by some people

who  need  not  get  a  divorce  but  who  may  avail

themselves  of this provision to get a divorce.  That

is one of my main grounds for proposing my amendment.

I  do  not disagree if the divorce comes about  as  a

result of the two parties not being able to get along

any  more. But if this amendment is to resolve a  few

cases,  then  we will be doing more harm  than  good.

That is the gist of my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has also said that by my

amendment I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



shown  that I regard women as weaklings. I would  say

that  it is because of our present society that women

are  still  not  able  to  raise  themselves  to  the

standard of men in the economic and other fields. Who

dare  say  that women are the weaker sex? If  such  a

person  dares  to  say  that, let  him  see  what  is

happening in China. It is mostly women who  lead  the

Red Guards. We should say that the problems of women,

whether  they  are weaklings or not, are attributable

to the social system. Given the right opportunity,  I

feel  that since there is no distinction in  capacity

between  men and women, women will be able to achieve

equality with men. So if the women's problems in  our

society  are not solved as social problems,  then  we

have  yet to achieve a truly socialist society. I  do

not  mean  to say that the law is the only  means  to

resolve  women's problems, because  this  is  a  very

passive way of dealing with them. In actual fact, the

Government should afford women more opportunities  to

do  their  part.  If  the  women,  having  .got  such

opportunities,  still cannot be successful,  then  we

can  say that they are weaklings. But, at the moment,

from the recruitment policy of the Government, we can

see that the ratio of men to women recruited is still

in  favour  of men. If there are 10 positions,  women

can  only get two or three, and the rest will  go  to

the  men. So how can you describe women as weaklings?

This is a problem linked with the whole structure  of

society,  and since we are not yet economically  able

to  afford  women a better position,  we  should  not

allow them to suffer any disadvantages and allow such

an anomalous position to exist.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament resolves, in accordance with

section  2  of  the  Local Treasury  Bills  Ordinance

(Chapter  69),  that the Minister  be  authorised  to

borrow,  by  the  issue  of  Treasury  Bills  in  the

Republic, sums not exceeding Malayan $500,000,000  in

amount.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the provisions of section 2 of the Local

Treasury Bills Ordinance, the Government is empowered

to  issue  Treasury Bills in the Republic  up  to  an

amount  not exceeding $150 million under a resolution

made  by  the Legislative Assembly on 20th  December,

1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval of this House is now requested to

raise the limit to $500 million for two main reasons.

First,  when  Singapore  was in  Malaysia  and  after

Singapore  Day  up to 22nd April, 1967,  the  Central

Bank  of Malaysia was operating in Singapore. As part

of  their  liquidity requirements,  commercial  banks

were  allowed  to  hold  Government  securities   and

Treasury Bills of the Singapore Government or of  the

Malaysian  Government. Now that we  have  taken  over

supervision of the banking system in Singapore, banks

will  have  to  adjust their liquidity  holdings.  In

other  words, if banks in Singapore are  now  holding

Malaysian  Treasury Bills and securities,  they  will

have  to  convert  them to Singapore  securities  and

Treasury  Bills.  Similarly, banks in  Malaysia  will

have   to   convert  their  holdings   of   Singapore

securities  to  Malaysian  securities.  In  practice,

however, banks in Singapore have been holding largely

Malaysian securities and Treasury Bills. In  view  of

the adjustments now necessary, there will, therefore,

be a sudden increased demand for Singapore issues. It

is, therefore, necessary for the Singapore Government

to  issue more Treasury Bills to meet the demand  for

such securities by the banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, besides the liquidity holdings by banks,

these  banks as well as other financial institutions,

including  Government  statutory  bodies,  also  have

short-term  surplus funds which they wish  to  invest

profitably. Unless there is an outlet for such  funds

in  Singapore, it is likely that the money will go to

other financial centres. The Government, through  the

issue  of  Treasury  Bills and  its  own  securities,

therefore,  provides an investment  outlet  for  such

short-term funds. Recent trends indicate that more of

such  short-term  funds will be  forthcoming  in  the

future. Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>



more  Treasury  Bills  have  to  be  issued  by   the

Government to take up such funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may wish to know that Treasury Bills of 91

days'  maturity are issued on tap to statutory bodies

and  are  offered on weekly tender to banks  and  the

public.  Tap Bills carry an interest rate  of  5  per

cent  per  annum  while the average rate  for  Tender

Bills   is  4.9  per  cent  per  annum.  The   amount

outstanding  on  these issues are: Tap  Bills  - $31.5

million; Tender Bills - $109.7 million. In view of the

two  developments which I have outlined above, it  is

likely  that the demand for such bills will increase.

The authority of Parliament is therefore requested to

enable  Government to issue Treasury Bills up  to  an

amount not exceeding $500 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is hoped that by the issue of

more  Treasury Bills, there will develop in  time  an

effective  short-term money market  for  such  bills.

Such  a money market will arise as, out of the  bills

issued, a certain part or percentage would be held by

banks and other financial institutions on a revolving

basis.  In other words, when a certain issue of  such

bills matures, they will be replaced by purchases  of

new  bills. Such bills will also be used by banks for

trading among themselves or for discounting with  the

Accountant-General in order to meet deficits in their

daily



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



clearing.   The   larger  banks  in  Singapore   have

indicated that they will be able to provide a  steady

market for Treasury Bills to which they will be  able

to service short-term investment funds of the smaller

banks. For instance, a small bank with a cash surplus

on a particular day may deposit such cash at a larger

bank,  which will then purchase Treasury  Bills  from

the  Government. In this way, the smaller banks  will

find  profitable use for their surplus funds and  the

bigger  banks will then provide a market for Treasury

Bills  from  the Government. In time  to  come,  such

operations  will evolve into an active and  effective

short-term money market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament resolves, in accordance with

section  2  of  the  Local Treasury  Bills  Ordinance

(Chapter  69),  that the Minister  be  authorised  to

borrow,  by  the  issue  of  Treasury  Bills  in  the

Republic, sums not exceeding Malayan $500,000,000  in

amount.
