<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Chief Minister to

indicate whether and when the Report of the Inquiry

Commission into Allegations of Corruption under the

chairmanship of the Honourable Mr Justice F. A.

Chua will be presented to this House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Report is at present under consideration  by

the  Government and will be presented to  this  House

when the consideration has been finalised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2806</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CORRUPTION INQUIRY COMMISSION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Report)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Minister when the

Government  proposes to present  to  this  House  the

Report  of the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations

of Corruption.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Sir, the

answer is the same as that to Question 1.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no objection, of course, to

Ministers answering two questions at the same time.

<div align="center"><b>CLERKS EMPLOYMENT ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Observance by Armed Forces)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and  Welfare whether the Clerks Employment  Ordinance

(No.  14  of  1957)  is also observed  by  the  Armed

Services in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since May 1957

the  matter of preparing a declaration to be made  by

the Governor under section 2 of the Ordinance, to the

effect that clerks and industrial clerks employed  by

the  Armed Services in Singapore are clerks  for  the

purposes   of   this  Ordinance,   has   been   under

consideration. When the task of classifying  clerical

workers  in  these  Services  is  completed,  such  a

declaration  will be made and the Armed Services  can

then  be said to be observing the provisions  of  the

Ordinance in all respects.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Hon.  Minister care to let this House know when  that

will take effect?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Labour Department has

requested the Service Departments to have discussions

with  the Unions as to the classification of clerical

workers in these Service Departments, and as soon  as

the  discussions have been completed,  a  declaration

will be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Minister  inform us as to the work of the  Tripartite

Consultative Committee meetings on matters concerning

Services employees?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2807</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, this is not a matter for the

Tripartite Consultative Committee. It is a matter for

discussion  between the employers  and  the  employee

organisations concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2807</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DETAINEES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Right to see Solicitor)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Secretary what

right  the Government has in preventing the following

persons  now  under detention at Changi Prison  under

the   Preservation  of  Public  Security   Ordinance,

namely,  the  Member for Bukit Timah,  Messrs.  Devan

Nair,  Fong  Swee  Suan and James  Puthucheary,  from

seeing their solicitor.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Sir, section 3, subsection (3)

of the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance (No.

25  of  1955) provides that every person detained  in

pursuance  of  an order made under the provisions  of

subsection  (1) of that section shall be detained  in

such  place as the Chief Secretary may direct and  in

accordance  with  instructions issued  by  the  Chief

Secretary.  The Chief Secretary allows  detainees  to

interview  their  legal advisers if he  is  satisfied

that  the interview is sought solely for the  purpose

of  obtaining  professional legal  advice  on  purely

legal  matters.  It  follows that detainees  are  not

allowed  to  see their legal advisers  if  the  Chief

Secretary is not so satisfied. No exception  to  this

rule  has  been  made in the case  of  the  detainees

mentioned in the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, is the Hon. the Chief

Secretary  seriously suggesting that  he  must  first

satisfy  himself what is in the mind of the  detainee

when he wants to see a solicitor?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, the Chief Secretary has a

discretion  to  allow visits by people to  detainees,

and  previous  experience has  shown  that  political

discussions took place on some such visits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Chief Secretary not

recognise the fact that under the present law in this

Colony,  every  citizen has an inalienable  right  to

seek legal advice and assistance from an advocate and

solicitor of the Colony?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> That is agreed, Sir. We have not

denied that right. Detainees can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2808</b></font><br><br>



see  their  solicitors  if  the  Chief  Secretary  is

satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why was the Chief Secretary not

satisfied in these cases?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is a matter of opinion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2808</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DETAINEES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Interception of letter)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether the Government has intercepted and detained a

letter written by Messrs. Devan Nair, Fong Swee Suan,

James  Puthucheary, S. Woodhull and Chan  Chiaw  Thor

addressed to their solicitor.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Sir, the answer is yes. In fact,

there  were  two  such letters written  by  the  five

persons  named,  namely,  one  written  by  the  five

persons  named,  on 11th September, 1957,  which  was

detained  pending the receipt of certain  information

which  they  were  asked to furnish;  and  the  other

written by the same five persons named and by another

detainee named Tan Boon Eng, on 9th September,  1957,

which  was  detained  because the  letter  asked  for

advice on matters which had no legal significance but

which were political.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, Sir, about political

discussions  in answer to the previous  question,  in

this   latter  connection,  it  is  considered   that

political detainees should not be allowed to  indulge

in politics while still under detention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Hon. the Chief Secretary

not  recognise  the fact that they are  detained  for

political  reasons and the whole issue is  political;

and that naturally what they have to communicate with

their  solicitor  must  pertain  to  these  political

matters?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We cannot have a debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2808</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP REGISTRATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Application Forms)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  he  is aware of the difficulties experienced

by voluntary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2809</b></font><br><br>



organisations  in  obtaining  application  forms  for

Singapore  citizenship registration, and  whether  he

will make a statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Sir, I am aware of the problems

in   conciliating  the  many  claims   of   voluntary

organisations  who  naturally are anxious  that  they

should have application forms as early as possible in

order to satisfy the demands of their members and the

public.  We  have,  however, to make  sure  that  the

voluntary organisations which have appointments  with

visiting teams do in fact produce the required number

of applicants on the due dates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to point out that 441,835

application forms have already been issued up to  2nd

December,  1957. A sufficient supply  of  forms  will

continue to be issued daily to individuals,  both  by

the registration teams and by the Central Registry to

voluntary  organisations which have appointments  for

visiting teams.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Will the Hon. the Chief

Secretary  allow  voluntary  organisations  to  print

their  own forms in case they do not get enough  from

the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, does the Hon. the Chief

Secretary suggest that it is necessary to book a date

for the registration of applicants and that forms can

only be supplied if such dates are booked?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, the question is not very clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I shall repeat that, Sir: does

the  Chief Secretary suggest that it is necessary for

voluntary organisations to book a date for taking the

oaths  of  applicants, and, if not, that  application

forms   will  not  be  supplied  to  such   voluntary

organisations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, I have already said that

voluntary organisations will be given forms  whenever

they ask for them, but we have to see that the number

of  forms  given will be sufficient, and in  fact  is

sufficient, to cover the number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2810</b></font><br><br>



of people whom they can produce for registration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, can the Chief Secretary

tell us whether voluntary organisations can help  and

assist the public in the filling of application forms

only,  and  if so why are not these forms  issued  to

voluntary organisations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, application forms are issued to

voluntary organisations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2810</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP REGISTRATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Figures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary to

state



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) how many registration teams are employed by

the Singapore Citizenship Registry to cover the

whole Island of Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the maximum number of persons, that could be

registered daily by each team; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the total number of persons ah ready registered

up to 30th November, 1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Sir, registration started with

15  teams  while  during the month of November  other

teams  were  recruited and put under training.  There

are now 23 teams in operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question in (b), Sir, the

maximum  number  is not known. The estimated  minimum

number  of  applicants who could be registered  by  a

team  is  170  per day. The maximum is  dependent  on

variable conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the total number of persons already registered

at 30th November,. 1957, is 89,568.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, can the Hon. the Chief

Secretary  assure this House that by the target  date

of  31st  January, all registration will be completed

and   all   persons  who  are  desirous  of  becoming

Singapore citizens have been registered by that time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, we are working to achieve that

aim.

<div align="center"><b>CHIEF MINISTER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Display of Photograph)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  he  is aware that photographs of  the  Chief

Minister have been displayed at



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Hokkien Hoay Kuan, Telok Ayer Street,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Hill Street,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Queenstown Community Association, Princess House, Queenstown,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Registration Teams of the Singapore Citizenship

Registry  in front of applicants for registration  as

citizens  and  on  tables  at  or  near  which   such

applicants  are  required to take  their  oaths,  and

whether   he  will  state  on  whose  authority   the

photographs  have been so displayed and  the  reasons

for such display.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Yes, Sir. The photographs of the

Hon. the Chief Minister are displayed as he  is  the

head  of  the elected Government. I hasten to  assure

the  hon.  Member that there is no sinister intention

or  Party  propaganda  in this display.  This  was  a

routine   matter   carried  out  by   the   Singapore

Citizenship   Registry  and  if  anyone   wishes   to

criticise the action taken, I am responsible  as  the

Minister in charge of citizenship registration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, is the Hon, the Chief

Secretary suggesting that it is right on the part  of

the Government to place the photographs of a head  of

state,  who  is  only an elected Chief  Minister,  in

front of such registration teams?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is a matter of opinion.

<div align="center"><b>(Reciprocation by Commonwealth Countries)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> asked the Chief Secretary what

steps  have  been  taken to apply the  provisions  of

subsection  (1)  of  section  8  of  the   Singapore

Citizenship   Ordinance,   1957,   to   citizens   of

Commonwealth countries and, in particular, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2812</b></font><br><br>



state  whether  Commonwealth  Governments  have  been

informed  of  the  provisions of  section  8  of  the

Ordinance  and whether negotiations have been  opened

with Commonwealth Governments in regard to reciprocal

facilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Sir, the provisions of subsection

(1)   of  section  8  of  the  Singapore  Citizenship

Ordinance,  1957, have not yet been  applied  to  any

Commonwealth country. The Secretary of State for  the

Colonies   has   been  approached  to  provide   such

information  regarding reciprocity,  particularly  in

regard  to  the  acquisition of citizenship  and  the

right  to  vote,  as  will  assist  the  Minister  to

consider  whether  or not, either  now  or  when  the

British Nationality Act, 1948, is amended, to give  a

direction  in  respect  of the  various  Commonwealth

countries whose citizens reside in Singapore. So  far

this   matter  of  reciprocity  has  been  taken   up

officially with this Government by the Government  of

India. An enquiry with regard to this matter has also

just  been  made  by the Assistant  Commissioner  for

Ceylon.

1957,  wherein  it was stated that the Government  of

India   had   given  an  assurance  that   reciprocal

facilities  will be granted to Singapore citizens  to

acquire Indian citizenship, whether it is intended to

direct  that  subsection (1)  of  section  8  of  the

Singapore Citizenship Ordinance 1957 should apply  to

a citizen of the Republic of India.

Final  Report  from  the  Public  Accounts  Committee

(Sessional  Paper No. L.A. 14 of 1957),  if  he  will

state

of Rural Board revenue;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) at what figure the present arrears of

rates now stand;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) how many properties have been assessed or

re-assessed  since  the  publication   of   the

Report, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) when can the rates and assessment rolls

be expected to be brought up-to-date.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as   the  hon.  Member  for  Tanglin  is  aware,  the

difficulties  in  collecting  arrears  of  assessment

amounting  at  the  end  of 1956  to  $1,500,000,  in

bringing  the  rates and assessment rolls  up-to-date

and in carrying out re-assessment in the rural areas,

may be attributed largely to inadequacy of staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question regarding the collection of

arrears of revenue, additional staff for this purpose

has  now  been  recruited by the appointment  of  one

bailiff in July, two in August, two this month, while

another  two  bailiffs are expected to  be  recruited

shortly.  The Rural Board has commenced the issue  of

bills to house owners who are in arrears. These bills

will  be  followed  by notices of demand  and,  where

necessary, by warrants of attachment later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The figure of arrears as at 31st December,

1956, is $1,514,518. A total of $720,000 has now been

collected,   leaving  a  balance   of   approximately

$800,000 in arrears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) With regard to assessment and re-assessment of

properties, this work has been carried out  by  rates

officers  and assistant rates officers. An additional

four  assistant  rates officers have  been  recruited

since  August and there remains one vacancy of  rates

officer  to be filled. The newly recruited  assistant

rates officers have been undergoing training and  two

have since started on full

duties, and it is expected that the rest will  be  in

the  field  by  January. They will be  working  to  a

prepared  programme. In the meanwhile,  1,183  houses

and 54 land lots have been assessed or re-assessed by

the  old staff, with an increase in annual values  of

$811,848,   or  an  increase  in  rates  revenue   of

$159,450.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) In view of the difficulties already described,

it  is  expected  that  another  two  years  will  be

required before the rates and assessment rolls can be

put  up-to-date and the revaluation of all lands  and

properties made throughout the whole area.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP - RECIPROCITY BY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br>10.21 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, as indicated by my colleague, the Hon, the Chief

Secretary,  in his reply to Question 10,  I  rise  to

make  a statement in connection with the citizens  of

India  vis-a-vis subsection (2) of section 8  of  the

Singapore Citizenship Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the initial registration of citizens under Part

VI of the Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2817</b></font><br><br>



was  opened on 1st November, no Commonwealth  country

had been gazetted so as to allow its citizens to make

application under subsection (1) of section 8 of  the

Ordinance.  This  was  not done  as  this  particular

subsection  is  meant to apply only  to  Commonwealth

countries  that afford reciprocal rights to  citizens

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner for the Government of India came to

see me before I left for New Delhi and brought up the question of gazetting India as a Commonwealth country

so  that  Indian  citizens in  Singapore  could  make

application under subsection (1) of section 8 of  the

Ordinance.  I  pointed out to him  that  it  was  not

possible  to  do  so unless the Government  of  India

afforded  reciprocal rights to citizens of Singapore.

I also pointed out to him that citizens of India were

not  deprived of their rights to register as citizens

of  Singapore, and that they could become citizens of

Singapore  by either registering as citizens  of  the

United  Kingdom and Colonies and then register  under

subsection  (1)  of  section 8 of the  Ordinance,  or

register under section 9 of the Ordinance. I went  on

to  say  that if the Government were to receive  from

his  Government  a  declaration to  the  effect  that

reciprocal  rights would be afforded to  citizens  of

Singapore,   the  Government  would  give  favourable

consideration  to gazetting India as  a  Commonwealth

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in New Delhi last month, Sir, I had a

discussion  with  the Prime Minister  of  India,  Mr

Nehru,  as a result of which the Government  has  now

received  a  communication from the Commissioner  for

the  Government of India stating that the  Government

of  India  would  take  action to  afford  reciprocal

facilities  to citizens of Singapore. The  Government

has considered this communication and has decided  to

gazette   India  as  a  Commonwealth  country   under

subsection (2) of section 8 of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, Sir, however, point out that there is no

true  reciprocity, as while the Government  of  India

has  the  discretion to accept an  application  by  a

citizen of Singapore for registration as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2818</b></font><br><br>



a  citizen of India, the Minister under section 8  of

our  Ordinance will have no discretion in respect  of

an  application by citizens of India for registration

as  a  citizen of Singapore. In spite of this we  are

taking  this step and making it easy for citizens  of

India  to  register  as  citizens  of  Singapore   in

recognition of the role of the Indian community as an

integral part of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be clear from our action, Sir, that the

Government  will  give  favourable  consideration  to

gazetting  any  Commonwealth  country  which   grants

reciprocal rights to our citizens.

last  year that Government intended that a survey  of

the  Colony's industrial potential and markets should

be  carried  out and that for this purpose  enquiries

were being made in order to obtain the services of an

expert to undertake such a survey. Hon. Members  will

recommendations for its implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonel Lyle has held very senior positions in

industrial development work in Canada and in England,

and  has  had  wide experience in carrying  out  area

development programmes which are generally considered

to be the most practical and businesslike approach to

handling    problems   connected   with    industrial

development.  In  1956 Colonel  Lyle  was  the  first

give  some  idea of how the estimates of revenue  and

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> As I was saying, Sir, 1957 has been a year

of  great  significance in Singapore.  Constitutional

problems have been settled in an atmosphere of reason

and  friendliness which augurs well for  the  future.

The  Singapore Citizenship Ordinance has become  law.

The new Local Government Ordinance has been approved.

An  excellent understanding has been established with

the  Government of the Federation of Malaya.  In  the

field  of  labour  relations,  there  has  been  less

tension  between  employer and employee,  and  labour

disputes, strikes and consequential losses of pay and

working time have been far less frequent than in  the

recent  past. With the help and co-operation  of  all

political  Parties,  great  progress  has  been  made

towards  settling  the vexed question  of  vernacular

education,  although we must face, in consequence,  a

much  heavier  bill  to carry  the  new  policy  into

effect.  A  cautious  and common  sense  approach  to

problems  in the economic field has commended  itself

to  observers  all over the world. Most important  of

all,  however, there has been a return of  confidence

in  the future of Singapore. It would be idle to deny

that  the events of 1955 and early 1956 did  much  to

destroy  the  feeling  of  stability,  security   and

confidence  which  is  vital  for  the  existence  of

Singapore  as  a centre of world trade, services  and

communications. It is important that this  growth  of

confidence should be maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the least important event of the year has been

the achievement of independence by the Federation  of

Malaya. This has caused as much pleasure in Singapore

as  it  has happiness in the Federation. It  has,  of

course,  given  rise  to  certain  problems.  It  has

necessitated  an examination of existing  Pan-Malayan

arrangements  in  the  economic  and  monetary  field

against the background of the Federation's new status

as  an  independent state. Existing arrangements  for

the  issue and control of currency, banking,  foreign

exchange  control,  import  and  export  control  and

certain aspects of fiscal policy, all of which  raise

most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2821</b></font><br><br>



important  issues, have had to come under review.  It

would be inappropriate to deal with these matters  in

detail at this particular time. They are, as it were,

sub judice and must be studied against the background

of  the  very natural wishes of a sovereign state  to

exercise  sovereign powers. At the same  time,  while

underlining  this  Government's sympathy  with  these

feelings and aspirations, I hope that it will not  be

misunderstood  if  I  express some  general  thoughts

about  these  matters. For close on a hundred  years,

Malaya and Singapore have developed and grown  up  in

partnership. As the production of rubber and tin  has

expanded in Malaya, so have the services supplied  by

Singapore   in  the  field  of  marketing,   banking,

insurance, transport and communications increased. As

the  demands of the growing population of Malaya  for

consumer  goods have multiplied, so has the  capacity

of  Singapore  to meet them quickly and competitively

grown.  During  this  period,  the  ramifications  of

commerce  and  industry have spread  over  the  whole

peninsula     regardless    of    geographical     or

constitutional boundaries. The economies of  the  two

territories   have   become   complementary.   Common

policies  have  been followed not because  they  have

been  dictated but merely because reason,  experience

and  commonsense  has indicated the desirability  and

wisdom  of  a common approach in the economic  field.

The  results  of  this partnership  have  been  quite

outstanding.   By  their  joint  efforts,   the   two

countries  have achieved a well-being and  prosperity

which  is  the  envy  of all their  neighbours.  With

regard  to the future, reason, experience and  common

sense   suggest  that  this  partnership  should   be

continued  if  the  two countries  are  to  gain  the

maximum  advantage  in  the economic  field,  and  to

develop and prosper in the manner in which they  have

done  in the past. When I speak of partnership  I  am

not  talking  in constitutional terms but  merely  in

terms  of full economic co-operation. I mean  a  free

association of two partners whereby their  individual

resources  and  skills  are used  jointly  for  their

mutual advantage in matters of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2822</b></font><br><br>



mutual  concern. There need be nothing hard  or  fast

about  such an association. It need subsist  just  as

long as mutual self-interest demands. It calls for no

more  machinery  for consultation  and  agreement  on

matters of policy than exists at the present time. It

would be hoped that it would continue for as long  as

the  two  territories remain apart because  it  seems

certain  that  any  relationship  short  of  such   a

partnership  could  only be to the  disadvantage  and

detriment of both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as trade generally is concerned, 1957 has

perhaps  not  been  quite as  good  a  year  as  1956

although it has not been a bad year by any means. The

value  of total trade is likely to be maintained  but

imports  tend  to exceed exports and it  is  probable

that  there  will  be  a fairly  substantial  adverse

balance  of trade at the end of the year. The gradual

decline  in  the price of rubber has already  had  an

effect  on  the  economy and traders are  finding  it

difficult  to maintain their turnover. On  the  other

hand,  there  are  one  or two encouraging  features.

Despite  a  deterioration in conditions in Indonesia,

there has been some slight improvement in trade  with

that country. Exports to Indonesia in particular  are

showing an increase over previous years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one would expect against this background of

returning  confidence  and  prosperity,  revenue  has

remained  reasonably buoyant. Details of the  revised

estimate of collections are given in the pages of the

Draft  Estimates  which are devoted  to  revenue  and

comments are made in the Memorandum which accompanies

the  Draft Estimates. I will not go into great detail

at  this  time but merely endeavour to draw attention

to main points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original estimate of revenue was $235.9 million

and  it  seems  likely that $235.7  million  will  be

collected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised estimate of collections under Class I is

$186.9 million compared with the original estimate of

$193 million. The main shortfall is under Income Tax.

$68.5  million was estimated but only $65 million  is

likely  to  be collected. This shortfall  reflects  a

slight



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2823</b></font><br><br>



falling  off  in the profits of smaller companies  in

1956  as  compared  with 1955. It also  reflects  the

effects of Malayanisation in the Department of Income

Tax. A number of experienced income tax officers have

left  and  their places have not yet been  filled  by

officers  with  the same degree of experience.  As  a

result,  there has been a slight slowing  up  in  the

work  of the department, and assessments have  fallen

slightly  into  arrears. This decrease in  efficiency

will  only  be  temporary. Arrears of assessment  and

collection will be caught up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco also shows a shortfall of about $5 million,

the revised estimate being $39 million as against the

original estimate of $44 million. There are a  number

of  reasons  for this shortfall. A certain  temporary

decrease  in  consumption was to  be  expected  as  a

result  of  the  price increases resulting  from  the

increase in duty imposed last November. This has been

aggravated by recent medical reports on the  possible

effects  of  excessive cigarette smoking.  There  has

been  an  increase in smuggling as a  result  of  the

increase  in  duty.  Exports to Rhio  have  increased

since  November last year and considerable quantities

of  cigarettes are brought back into Singapore  under

cover of darkness, despite the efforts of the Customs

Department   to   prevent  the  traffick.   In   this

connection,  I  should like to pay a tribute  to  the

officers of the Preventive Branch of the Customs who,

night  in  night  out and often in  circumstances  of

great  discomfort,  patrol  the  sea  approaches   to

Singapore  and  wage  a  constant  war  against   the

smugglers.   Another  reason  for  the  decrease   in

collections is the fact that, under the protection of

a wide differential in duty, local manufacturers have

made  certain inroads into the monopoly  of  imported

cigarettes. It is unfortunate that this has not  been

offset by any marked increase in local employment. It

is thought, however, that these limiting factors will

be  temporary  phenomena and  that  consumption  will

return  in  due  course to its  previous  level.  The

collections of duty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2824</b></font><br><br>



on  liquors  and  petrol are  likely  to  exceed  the

original estimate by fairly substantial amounts.  The

collections of entertainment duty continue  to  mount

and  the yield on other items of taxation imposed  in

1956  appears  likely  to equal  if  not  exceed  the

estimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collections under the other Classes of Revenue

seem  likely  to  exceed the estimate.  Gains  should

counterbalance  the  shortfalls  on  Income  Tax  and

Tobacco.  As I said earlier, the revised estimate  is

only  a little short of the original estimate and  it

may in the end exceed it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to expenditure, it will be remembered

that  the original estimate was $254 million, and  it

will  be  seen  from pages 15 and  16  of  the  Draft

Estimates  that it is likely that actual  expenditure

in  1957 will amount to about $242 million. It should

be  noted, however, that this total includes a sum of

$9  million  in  respect  of compensation  under  the

Malayanisation Scheme. If this sum is excluded - it is,

I think, a fair charge on surplus funds since it will

be  recouped  by  savings  on  expatriation  pay  and

passages over a period of years - what might be  called

"normal"  expenditure  will  amount  to  about   $233

million and there will probably be a small surplus of

revenue over actual normal expenditure at the end  of

the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As will be seen from pages 15 and 16 in the Draft

Estimates, the revised estimate of expenditure in the

case  of  a  very  large number of Departments  falls

below   the  original  estimate,  usually  by   small

amounts. In the case of several, however, the  under-expenditure is likely to be considerable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main under-expenditure again appears under

Education. Here actual expenditure is likely to  fall

short of the estimate by about $8 million. About half

of  this  will be in respect of personal  emoluments.

Expenditure  on  Defence  Services  and  Medical  and

Health  Services is likely to fall below the original

estimate  by  about $3 million in  each  case,  again

mainly due to difficulties in filling vacant posts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2825</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, I propose to comment on the Development

Estimates  for  1957  and  1958  after  the  Ordinary

Estimates  have been dealt with. All I  will  say  at

this  stage  is  that expenditure  has  again  fallen

considerably short of the estimate, and that there is

likely  to  be  a  substantial balance  left  in  the

Development Fund at the end of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the financial position at the end of

1957, attention is invited to the Statement of Assets

and Liabilities which appears on pages 6 and 7 of the

Draft  Estimates. It will, of course, be  appreciated

that  this  Statement was drawn up in  September  and

that there will be numerous amendments in matters  of

detail by the time the final accounts are made up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets are estimated at $153 million, Liabilities at

$81  million, and the General Revenue Balance at  $72

million.  Amendments will of course have to  be  made

when  the final accounts are available, and allowance

will have to be made for depreciation in the value of

investments, but the final result should not be  very

much different from the estimate which is now given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, therefore, the position of the

Colony  is  sound. The public debt is  small  and  is

being  serviced as required by Law. We have a general

revenue balance in liquid form which is equivalent to

3½  months'  revenue. In point of fact, however,  the

position  is even sounder than at first appears.  $20

million  should  be added to the liquid  reserves  in

respect  of  the payment which will be  made  by  the

Australian  and New Zealand Governments in connection

with  the  loss of Christmas Island revenue.  Account

should  also  be  taken  of  $17  million  worth   of

Singapore Telephone Board stock which will be  issued

in  due  course  in respect of the  purchase  of  the

Oriental  Telephone  and  Electric  Company.   Having

regard to the steady progress which is being made  by

the  Singapore Telephone Board, it is likely  that  a

ready  sale would be found for this stock if it  were

placed  on the market. In short, the Colony  is  very

comfortably off and many larger territories with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2826</b></font><br><br>



much  greater natural resources would be happy to  be

in the same fortunate position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to 1958, it is difficult to make any

forecast  of what conditions may be like  during  the

course  of  the  year. Too many unknown  factors  are

involved.   It  is  also  undesirable   to   be   too

categorical  in  such  circumstances.   But   it   is

undeniable  that  there  is at  the  present  time  a

certain  amount of pessimism about the future.  World

conditions are unsettled and are likely to remain so.

It  is  feared that there may be a recession of trade

in Europe and the United States, which may affect the

price  of  rubber  and consequently  the  economy  of

Malaya.  Conditions in our main entrepot markets  are

disturbed  and trade may be affected.  On  the  other

hand,  the  experts whom I have been able to  consult

are  not  quite so despondent. In their opinion,  the

possibility  of a trade recession has  tended  to  be

exaggerated in the light of recent events. The  long-term  prospect for rubber is sound. The price  should

remain  not very far off the 80 cents mark throughout

1958.  Conditions in some of our traditional entrepot

markets  are  certainly disturbed but, despite  this,

trade  has shown a certain buoyancy in recent  months

and the indications are that this trend is likely  to

continue.  All in all, they feel that conditions  may

not  be  as  bad as the pessimists fear.  Trade  will

almost certainly be less favourable than it has  been

in  recent  years, and profits will be reduced  to  a

certain  extent,  but  there is nothing  to  indicate

anything  more than a slight recession of trade  such

as  Singapore  has often taken in its stride  in  the

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, collections of revenue

under Class I have been estimated at $189 million, or

$3  million  in  excess of the revised  estimate  for

1957.  Allowance has been made for a slight  increase

in  entertainment duty. Over 90 per cent of this duty

is  derived  from cinema tickets. New picture  houses

have been or are being built, the cinema-going public

continues to increase, and it is estimated that  this

duty will yield $6,750,000 in 1958. Income Tax has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2827</b></font><br><br>



been  estimated  at the same level as collections  in

1957.  It  is  doubtful if company profits  generally

will  maintain the same levels as in 1956  and  1957.

Again, as  I said earlier, the department is  having

staffing troubles. On the other hand, tax assessed in

1957 but not collected in that year will be collected

in 1958. In the circumstances, it is hoped that about

$65  million  will be collected in 1958.  As  far  as

liquor   duty  is  concerned,  the  increased  demand

resulting  from  growth of population  will  probably

more  than counterbalance any decrease in consumption

due  to  falling purchasing power, and the figure  of

$28 million entered for 1958 is slightly in excess of

the revised estimate for 1957. The number of cars  on

the  road,  the  number of new cars  registered  each

year,  and the amount of petrol consumed continue  to

increase and it seems reasonably safe to assume  that

$27  million would be collected from petrol  duty  on

the  present  basis of taxation in 1958.  As  far  as

tobacco  is  concerned, 541 million has been  allowed

for  1958. Consumption is bound to recover  from  the

setbacks  of 1957. The smoking population is  growing

all the time, a quota on exports to Rhio has recently

been   imposed  and  the  campaign  of  the   Customs

Department  against  smuggling  is  gaining  momentum

month  by  month. It will be noticed that  there  has

been  a  marked  drop  in  revenue  from  pawnbroking

licences, due to the change in policy with regard  to

the  issue  of licences. As hon. Members  are  aware.

licences now bear a fixed fee. They are no longer the

subject of tender, as they have been in the past,  it

having  been  decided that the system of  tender  was

anachronistic and open to objection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate for Class III shows an increase of

about  $1.4  million  due to  the  increased  returns

expected  from Postal and Telecommunications Services

which increase steadily year by year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class IV is increased by $2.4 million due partly to

interest  on  loans  and  partly  to  the  fact  that

interest  on  funds in the hands of the Custodian  of

Property will be credited to revenue under the  Draft

Enemy  Property  Bill which, it  is  hoped,  will  be

enacted during the next session of the Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2828</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimate or Revenue for 1958, on the

present basis of taxation, is $242 million, or $7

million more than the revised estimate for 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates of expenditure for 1958 total $277

million compared with $254 million in 1957. This is a

substantial increase but I can assure you, Sir,  that

the estimates have been prepared with the utmost care

and  that  no  provision has been made which  is  not

essential for the maintenance of existing services or

for  the expansion of the social and defence services

to which great importance is attached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this will be clear from an examination of

the  estimates.  It will be seen that a  considerable

number of departments are provided with less or  very

little  more in 1958 than was provided in  1957.  The

main  increases  appear  under  Medical  and  Health,

Defence  Services,  Pensions  and  Education,   which

between  them,  account for $16 million  of  the  $23

million increase on the Estimates for 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional sum of $2.6 million is required for

Medical  and Health, of which $2.2 million represents

an   increase   in  personal  emoluments.   In   this

connection,  attention is invited to the schedule  of

new  appointments which appears as an appendix to the

Memorandum  which  accompanied the  Draft  Estimates.

From  this, it will be seen that 314 new appointments

are  provided  for the expansion of the  Medical  and

Health Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Service estimates show an increase of

$2.8  million. Of this sum, $700,000 is required  for

the  Royal  Malayan Navy, $800,000 for the  Singapore

Military  Forces  and $1.3 million for  the  Infantry

Battalion which will get into full swing in 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensions require an additional $3.9 million. Of this

increase,  $917,000 is provided for the Supplementary

Allowances  on existing pensions which were  approved

by  the  Assembly  this year. Of  the  remainder,  $2

million  is required for commutation of pensions  and

ordinary  pensions arising in the  main  out  of  the

retirement   of   pensionable  officers   under   the

Malayanisation Scheme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2829</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main increase is, however, under Education

where  an  additional $6.7 million is  required.  The

estimates  for  1958, by comparison  with  those  for

1955,  show  very  clearly  the  effect  of  the  new

Education  Plan. The salaries of Headquarters  staff,

and  teachers  and  servants  in  Government  English

schools, demand $30.9 million as compared with  $18.9

million  in 1955. Recurrent expenditure has risen  to

$30 million compared with $13 million in 1955. Grants

in aid total $23 million, of which $14.4 million goes

to Chinese schools. This compares with a total of $10

million, including $4 million for Chinese schools, in

1955. $1 million is provided for the running expenses

of  the Polytechnic, $360,000 is provided for Evening

Classes,  $300,000  for the provision  of  free  text

books,  $388,000  for  aided  school  provident  fund

schemes,  $934,000  for the teaching  of  English  in

Malay  Schools and so on. Special expenditure  totals

$3.9 million of which $3.2 million is required as the

Government contribution towards the running  expenses

of the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest, there is nothing new or novel in the

estimates of expenditure. The truth of the matter  is

that  the framing of the ordinary estimates does  not

present much opportunity for dramatic changes in  the

emphasis or incidence of expenditure. The services of

Government  expand  as the need for  them  increases.

Expansion is only approved after long drawn  out  and

sometimes bitter arguments with the Treasury and even

then is only in accordance with plans which have been

presented  to and approved by the Assembly and  which

are  generally accepted as necessary by the taxpayers

of Singapore. Short of a major trade recession with a

serious contraction of Government revenue and  demand

for  Government  services, it  is  difficult  if  not

impossible  to  limit  or  restrict  expenditure   on

services  which  arc already in existence.  They  are

already  operating on the minimum standard consistent

with  efficiency.  Government  operates  within  very

narrow  financial limits and funds are not  available

for  any  dramatic departures from the  well  trodden

path of approved policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2830</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position therefore is that the estimate of

revenue  is $242 million, the estimate of expenditure

is  $277  million, and we are faced with an estimated

deficit of $35 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is what would this deficit be in the

event if no steps were taken to eliminate it. We know

that,  in the past, expenditure has invariably fallen

short  of  the  estimate and estimated deficits  have

turned   into   substantial  surpluses.   Development

programmes have not been implemented as fast  as  was

expected,   recruits  have  not   come   forward   in

sufficient  numbers to fill vacant posts,  there  has

been   delay  in  placing  orders  and  in  obtaining

delivery of costly items of special expenditure,  and

so  on  and so forth. The question is to what  extent

will expenditure fall below the estimate in 1958?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no formula which indicates what actual

expenditure  will  be. We make our  estimate  in  the

light  of past experience and results and anticipated

future  requirements and capacity. We know that,  for

the  past two years, actual recurrent expenditure has

tended  to  increase  on the  average  by  about  $18

million   a  year.  In  this  connection,  I   invite

attention  to  the  tables which were  given  in  the

Memorandum which accompanied the Draft Estimates.  It

seems  likely  that  this rate of  increase  will  be

maintained in 1958. If that should prove  to  be  the

case,  actual expenditure, excluding any compensation

in  respect  of Malayanisation which may have  to  be

brought  to account, should be of the order  of  $250

million.  In  the  circumstances, assuming  that  the

estimate of revenue is achieved, it is possible  that

the  actual  deficit  would be of  the  order  of  $8

million,  and it is this sum which we must  endeavour

to cover by means of additional taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, it is proposed to increase the duty on

petrol  and  to make slight increases in the  special

tax  on  heavy oil engine vehicles and in  the  stamp

duty  on  conveyances  of immovable  property.  These

increases  should yield about $8 million  in  a  full

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to petrol, an order under Section 11 of

the  Customs Ordinance has been gazetted this morning

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2831</b></font><br><br>



raises  the  duty from 80 cents to $1 a gallon.  This

rate  of  $1  a  gallon  has been  in  force  in  the

Federation  since  November  of  last  year  and  its

imposition  is  unlikely to  cause  any  hardship  in

Singapore. It has caused none in the Federation.  The

new  rate  of  duty will result in cars which  do  20

miles  to  the gallon costing 1 cent a mile  more  to

run.  Those which do 30 miles to the gallon will cost

2/3rd  of  a cent a mile more to run, those doing  40

miles  to the gallon, ½ a cent more, and so on.  If

1,000 miles a month, or 30 miles a day, is taken as a

fair  average mileage for private cars in  Singapore,

cars  doing 20 miles per gallon will cost $10 a month

more  to run, cars doing 30 miles to the gallon $6.60

a  month more, and those doing 40 miles to the gallon

$5  a month more. These additional sums can be of  no

consequence to people who can afford to run cars  for

pleasure  or who have to run them in connection  with

their work. Nor will the increase in duty be of  much

consequence to hauliers. A round trip to Penang  will

cost about $10 more. I do not think that the increase

in  duty will affect consumption. The number  of  new

cars,  and the total number of cars registered,  tend

to  increase each year and the consumption of  petrol

increases  accordingly. I doubt if the increase  will

tend  to  make people use their cars less  than  they

have  done  in  the  past. It is  expected  that  the

increase in duty will yield between $6 and $7 million

in a full year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to increase the tax on heavy

oil  engine vehicles. As hon. Members are aware, this

tax was originally imposed to compensate for the loss

of  petrol  duty  occasioned by the  introduction  of

diesel  engine vehicles into Singapore.  The  present

rates  of  tax are shown in the schedule attached  to

Gazette  Notification No. 5 202 of 22nd  July,  1955.

The  rates  have not been changed since the  duty  on

petrol  was raised to 68 cents a gallon. It will  now

be   $1  a  gallon.  This  increase  would  merit   a

proportional increase in the heavy oil engine vehicle

tax  of  about 50 per cent. However, it is considered

that an increase of this order at this juncture is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2832</b></font><br><br>



undesirable. As a first step, therefore, it has  been

decided  to raise the present rates by 25  per  cent.

The  new rates are given in the motion which will  be

presented  in the near future. They will be effective

from  the  1st of January. 1958. It is not considered

that  this  increase should occasion any hardship  to

bus companies or hauliers or necessitate any increase

in  fares.  It  will  be noted, when  the  motion  is

published,  that  the fee on diesel  taxis  has  been

raised   considerably.  The  new  fee  places   these

vehicles  on all fours with petrol-driven taxis.  The

yield  from  this  increased tariff is  estimated  at

$375,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to increase the stamp duty

on   conveyances   of  immovable   property   to   an

"advalorem"  rate of 2 per cent on the value  of  the

property transferred. This rate is the same  as  that

charged  in  Hong Kong. It is expected that  the  new

rate will yield an additional $700,000 in 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated yield from these items of new

taxation is therefore approximately $8 million and  I

hope that this additional revenue will go a long  way

towards  balancing actual revenue and expenditure  in

1958. However, if it is found later in the year  that

these   measures   are  going  to  be   insufficient,

additional measures will have to be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the Development Estimates, it is

desirable at this time to give some idea of what  has

been done in this connection since the war. There  is

so  much  pre-occupation with  the  present  and  the

future that there is perhaps a tendency to forget  or

overlook what has been done in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all standards, the achievement has been

monumental. Since the war, over 15,500 housing  units

and  600  shops  have been built at  a  cost  of  $95

million.  $28  million has been spent on  93  primary

schools  and 11 secondary schools, quarters,  playing

fields, equipment and other educational services. $20

million  has  been  spent on  expanding  the  Medical

Services. The number of beds in the General  Hospital

has been increased by 100 per cent, in Kandang Kerbau

Hospital by 50 per cent and in Tan Tock



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2833</b></font><br><br>



Seng Hospital by over 100 per cent. Accommodation  in

the Trafalgar Home and in the Woodbridge Hospital has

been  increased by 300 per cent. $36 million  has  so

far  been spent on making the finest airport  in  the

Far  East.  $15  million  has  been  spent  on  Rural

Development.  Land  purchases  for  development  have

totalled  close on $50 million. $10 million has  been

spent  on  capital work for Defence  Services.  These

items alone total over $250 million. In addition, $17

million   has  been  paid  in  connection  with   the

acquisition  of the Oriental Telephone  and  Electric

Company,  $4  million  lent to the  City  Council  in

connection with the Kallang Bridge Road, $30  million

lent to the Federation of Malaya, $10 million lent to

the  Singapore Telephone Board, and considerable sums

spent on the construction of buildings for the police

and customs, roads, bridges, quarters and the like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from Government expenditure on development,

the  City  Council has since the war spent over  $270

million on the development of the public utilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, development work of this order represents

a  monumental  achievement. This small island,  which

depends  for its prosperity on trade, has managed  to

find  funds for development to the tune of well  over

$600  million  over  a  period of  10  years  without

extending  itself  unduly. It is  an  achievement  of

which we can justly be proud and it must be the  envy

of many larger territories outside Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to development expenditure in 1957, it

will  be  recalled  that the estimates  presented  in

November   1956  envisaged  expenditure  on   general

development   (including  Colonial  Development   and

Welfare  Fund projects) amounting to $66 million  and

expenditure  by the Singapore Improvement  Trust  and

Singapore  Telephone  Board of  $15  million  and  $5

million   respectively.  Under  general  development,

provision  of $17 million was made for  work  of  one

kind  and  another for the Education Department,  $10

million  for  the Medical and Health Department,  $17

million for purchase of land, resettlement of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2834</b></font><br><br>



squatters  and  rural  development,  $3  million  for

Defence  Services and $3 million for further work  on

the  Singapore  Airport. It was  estimated  that  the

Development Fund would be completely exhausted by the

end  of  the  year  but, knowing how far  performance

falls  short of expectation in the field  of  capital

works, we were fairly confident that there would,  in

the end, be a balance in the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has proved to be the case. On the basis of

figures  available up to September, it is clear  that

there will again be substantial under-expenditure  on

general  development. As in the past, difficulty  has

been experienced over the acquisition, clearance  and

preparation  of  sites. Lack  of  "capacity"  in  the

architectural branch of the P.W.D. has also caused  a

planning bottle-neck. The only expenditure which  has

exceeded the estimate is that on public housing. Here

it seems likely that the Trust, with a clear field at

Kallang and St. Michaels Road, will spend $23 million

against  the estimated $15 million. And,  of  course,

the  Singapore  Telephone  Board  has  spent  the  $5

million  provided  in the Estimates.  Altogether,  it

appears likely that, instead of the estimated deficit

of  $3  million,  the Development Fund  will  show  a

surplus  at the end of the year of the order  of  $40

million  including interest on investments  amounting

to  $7.6  million not brought to account  until  this

year.  I  mention  the round figure  of  $40  million

because adjustment will have to be made in respect of

revaluation of investments and in respect of interest

payments. But it does mean that we will start off the

new  year very substantially better off than we hoped

to  be  and  that the question of raising  funds  for

capital  development in Singapore  in  1958  will  be

eased correspondingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates for 1958 are shown on

pages 395 to 439 of the Draft Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Fund is given on page 395. It will

be  seen  that receipts are estimated at $64 million,

expenditure at $94 million and the deficit  at  about

$30 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the items on the receipts side of the

account,  the  item "Repayment of Loans"  allows  for

repayment  of  principal of long-term  loans  to  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust which will  be  made  in

1958. It will be recalled that I said in 1956 that it

had been decided that such repayments, which will  be

spread  over  60  years  in  most  cases,  should  be

credited  to  the  Development  Fund  so  as  to   be

available for further development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also be noted that a contribution of $20

million  is  again made from revenue for development.

It  is,  in  my  opinion,  of vital  importance  that

substantial   contributions  of  this   kind   should

continue   to  be  made  for  expenditure  on   "non-productive"  items  of capital  development  such  as

schools,  hospitals, etc. - in fact, much of  the  work

done under General Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen from an examination of the Estimates

that  they  follow the same pattern  as  in  previous

years.  Indeed that is inevitable when Government  is

already  committed to approved long-term  development

plans.  Briefly,  of the sum of $32 million  provided

for  general  public  works,  $10  million  goes   to

Education,  $8.8 million to Medical  and  Health,  $3

million  to  Civil Aviation, $4 million  for  special

P.W.D. schemes which are outlined under Head 60,  and

$1 million for police building and quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sum of $61 million provided for special

development  expenditure, $26.5 million  is  provided

for  further work by the Singapore Improvement  Trust

on  programmes  6, 7 and 8 and a further  sum  of  $5

million  is  provided for Singapore  Telephone  Board

development.  Provision is made for the  loan  of  $1

million  (out  of  a total of $2  mil  lion)  to  the

Singapore  Government  Officers Co-operative  Housing

Society in accordance with the policy that Government

will  not provide quarters for its officers but will,

within  the limits of its capacity, provide loans  on

reasonable terms to enable officers to acquire  their

own homes. Again, out of this sum of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2836</b></font><br><br>



$61 million, $10 million is provided for the purchase

of  land  and  $4.8 million is provided  for  further

rural  development. Of the $6 million provided  under

Head  D. 45 Education, for special expenditure,  $2.8

million  is required for dollar for dollar grants  to

aided  schools, and $1.25 million for  equipment  for

the  Polytechnic and $1.25 million for equipment  for

new  schools. $2.6 million is provided under Head  D. 59 Telecommunications   for   further    essential

development of the telecommunications system which is

revenue earning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not deal with the estimates of development

expenditure in greater detail. This has already  been

done   in   the  Memorandum  which  accompanied   the

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the estimated deficit, it is, difficult

to  say  what  actual expenditure will amount  to.  I

think  it  more  than  likely that  the  estimate  of

expenditure for the Singapore Improvement Trust  will

be  fulfilled,  which is gratifying  in  itself.  The

Singapore  Telephone Board will be able to spend  the

$5  million which has been provided. In the light  of

discussions  which I have had with the  Minister  and

having  regard to past performance, I am inclined  to

doubt  if  planning  and building capacity,  and  the

other factors which tend to delay capital works, will

permit  of  expenditure in excess of $22  million  in

1958.  Again,  on  the basis of past performance,  it

seems  unlikely  that  more than  two-thirds  of  the

balance  of special expenditure, after loans  to  the

Singapore Improvement Trust and Singapore Telephone

Board  have been subtracted, will be spent. In short,

it  seems unlikely that total development expenditure

will  be  much in excess of $70 million and that  the

deficit, if any, will be comparatively small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Development Fund will be

exhausted  and development will in future  depend  in

the  main  on  contributions from  revenue  and  loan

money,  and  whatever  sums can be  transferred  from

general reserves to finance further development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2837</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise the position therefore, if all the

prognostications about 1957 and 1958  are  fulfilled,

revenue  and expenditure should balance  in  1958  at

about  $250 million (excluding any charge in  respect

of  Malayanisation compensation), the General Revenue

Balance  (including the Christmas Island payment  and

Singapore  Telephone Board stock) should  be  of  the

order  of $100 million and the development fund  will

be exhausted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to say something about the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure has increased at a very great rate since

the  war. In this connection, attention is once  more

invited  to the schedule of actual expenditure  which

appears  on page 13 of the Draft Estimates. In  1947,

expenditure,  including  Public  Works  Non-Recurrent

expenditure,  amounted  to  $51  million.  In   1957,

including  Development  expenditure,  the  total   is

likely  to  be  about $300 million.  If  we  look  at

individual  items, we see that recurrent  expenditure

on Education has risen from $2 million in 1947 to $50

million  in  1957;  on Medical  and  Health  from  $5

million to $27 million; on Social Welfare from  under

$1  million to $11 million; on Police from $2 million

to  $26  million,  and  on Defence  from  practically

nothing  to  $8 million. Recurrent expenditure  as  a

whole has risen from $50 million in 1947 to a revised

estimate of $232 million in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inevitable that recurrent expenditure will

continue to increase in the future, although  perhaps

not  at  the same striking rate. As in the past,  the

main  reasons  for increase will be the expansion  of

Education and Medical and Health Services and Defence

Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Education 40,000 children are

reaching the age for entry into Primary Schools  each

year.  It  is  the am of Government to  give  primary

education to all children between the ages of  6  and

14, and secondary education of either a general or  a

technical  nature to a large percentage of those  who

pass  through the primary stage successfully. It will

consequently  be necessary to make similar  additions

to staff in the future as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2838</b></font><br><br>



have been made in the past and funds will be required

to  meet  the recurrent expenditure required for  the

additional  schools  which will  have  to  be  built.

Again, increased provision for grants-in-aid will  be

required  to meet increased expenditure in  expanding

vernacular  schools.  The  recurrent  cost   of   the

Polytechnic  will increase as the organisation  comes

into  full operation. Again, the University  must  be

expanded to provide the graduates of all kinds  which

the  expanding economy of Singapore requires.  It  is

difficult to say to what extent the cost of Education

will increase over the next five years. Prior to  the

introduction  of the full aid scheme, the  effect  of

which  is  seen  in the returns for  1956  and  1957,

expenditure tended to increase at the rate  of  about

$7  million  per  annum. It might  be  reasonable  to

assume  that the increase in the future  will  be  at

about  the same rate. This would mean that, by  1962,

expenditure on education will have reached a total of

about $80 million a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Medical and Health Services, it is a

case  of  expanding hospital accommodation,  clinics,

health  centres, etc, as fast as the availability  of

staff,  funds and building capacity will  allow.  The

ultimate  aim  is to build another General  Hospital,

ten  district hospitals - 5 in the urban area and 5  in

the rural areas and each with 500 beds - 20 out-patient

departments and about 100 small maternity  and  child

health clinics. In addition, now that the elimination

of  tuberculosis  is no longer a  possibility  but  a

probability, the drive against this disease  will  be

stepped  up.  Quite obviously, it will be  very  many

years before these plans can be fulfilled. As I  have

said,  lack  of funds and lack of trained  staff  are

likely  to be the limiting factors. But they will  be

fulfilled  gradually and recurrent  expenditure  will

mount   in  the  same  way.  In  the  past  recurrent

expenditure on Medical and Health services has tended

to  mount at the rate of about $3 million per  annum.

Assuming that it continues to mount in the same  way,

it  will  by 1962 have reached a total of  about  $41

million per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlikely that the Police Force will grow to

any  great  extent between now and 1962,  but  it  is

inevitable that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2839</b></font><br><br>



cost of Defence Services will increase. The future of

the Royal Malayan Navy is still uncertain but, if  it

is  transferred to the Federation of Malaya, we shall

have  to  expand the role of the Malayan Royal  Naval

Volunteer  Reserve and of course we have  to  provide

for  a  second  battalion of the  Singapore  Infantry

Regiment.  Expenditure  on  Defence  Services  is  at

present  running at the rate of about $11  million  a

year,  and  I  consider that it is not unlikely  that

this may have increased to about $16 million by 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is doubtful if expenditure on any other service

of Government will expand at anything approaching the

same rate as in the case of the three services I have

mentioned specifically. There will of course be  some

increase.  That  is  inevitable.  But  it  should  be

comparatively  small. By and large, the  majority  of

departments  have stopped expanding - at  least  for

the  time being. For the next five years at any rate,

any  increase in expenditure should only be  required

in connection with increments and replacements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, therefore, it seems likely

that total expenditure will tend to increase over the

next  five  years at a rate of something between  $12

and  $15  million a year. Total expenditure  by  1962

therefore may well be of the order of $300 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a somewhat alarming figure and the first

reaction of hon. Members may be to ask not how it can

be met but how it can be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult question. Contrary to general

belief,  there is no more over-staffing, extravagance

or  waste  in Government than there is in  any  large

scale   commercial  undertaking.  There  is   not   a

superfluity  of staff in any section of the  service.

Only that amount of recurrent and special expenditure

is  allowed  which is necessary to keep  the  machine

running with maximum efficiency. The Treasury sees to

that,   as   any  Head  of  Department  will   agree.

Allegations  as regards Government extravagance  have

been  made  in the past and investigations have  been

made  by  select committees, organisation consultants

and other agents. But the results have generally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2840</b></font><br><br>



been  disappointing from the point  of  view  of  the

critics.  Minor  examples of waste  and  extravagance

have of course come to light and have been corrected,

temporary staff which has become redundant  has  been

removed, but the total saving which has resulted  has

been   comparatively  small.  This   has   been   the

experience of other administrations as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that waste and extravagance do

not  exist,  or  that the Government is  prepared  to

close   its   eyes  to  them.  Quite  the   contrary.

Government  is  always  on the lookout  to  eliminate

waste,  extravagance and redundancy. To this end,  it

is  proposed  to  set  up  an  organisation  in  each

Ministry   which   will   keep   these   matters   of

organisation and efficiency constantly under  review.

The  scheme follows the proposal of an Indian  expert

who  visited Singapore in 1955. Unfortunately we have

not  yet  been able to recruit the adviser who  would

train  the officers required to run the scheme.  Such

men are in very short supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is to be any significant reduction in

Government spending, it can only come as a result  of

drastic  changes in plan, reduction in  the  rate  of

expansion of the social services, retrenchment,  cuts

in salaries, or a combination of some or all of these

factors. For example, expenditure could be reduced if

it  were  decided that secondary education should  be

limited  to  a  smaller percentage of  those  passing

through  primary  school, or that  primary  education

should stop at 12 years of age and not be extended to

14  years  of age, or that the expansion  of  Medical

services  should  be drastically cut  down  or  cease

altogether  for a period, or that variable allowances

should be reduced and so on and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such decisions could defeat the Government's

avowed intention to expand essential services to  the

public.  Consequently we must look  in  the  main  to

increased taxation to meet the bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue has increased substantially over the past

decade  from  $77 million in 1947 to an  estimate  of

$235  million in 1957. During this period,  the  only

completely novel measure of taxation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2841</b></font><br><br>



which  has  been introduced is Income Tax  which  now

yields  $65  million or about 27 per  cent  of  total

revenue. There have been increases in rates of duties

collected  by the Customs Department over  the  years

and collections under Class I have increased from $42

million  in 1947 to $186 million in 1957. Again,  the

expanding  economy, the growing population,  and  the

growing demand for Government services have all  made

a material contribution to the increase in revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a considerable revenue potential

left  in  Singapore  within the  present  pattern  of

taxation.  We are, in effect, still one of  the  most

lightly  taxed  nations  in the  world.  We  are  for

example  considerably better off than people  in  the

Federation who, in addition to paying duty on tobacco

at  a much higher rate than we do, have to pay a wide

range of customs duties on other goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But increases within the present pattern of

taxation  will  not  be enough in  themselves.  Other

means  of  taxation, hitherto novel  in  the  Malayan

context,  will  have  to be devised.  The  population

generally  will  have  to  contribute  more   towards

Education - perhaps  through  the  Education  rate.  It

seems doubtful if Medical attention and the supply of

medicines  can remain altogether free for any  length

of  time.  I  do not exclude the possibility  of  the

eventual  introduction of import duties on a selected

range  of  goods which either do not enter  into  the

entrepot trade or enter only to a limited extent. But

I hope sincerely that this step will be long delayed,

and  only  taken after all other measures  have  been

exploited to the full.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, if Singapore is going to have the

services  it wants, it must be prepared  to  pay  for

them, and to pay much more heavily than it has in the

past.  We  must  be  prepared for  greatly  increased

taxation.  Reduction  in  expenditure  can  only   be

achieved  by a drastic change of policy which  should

probably  be avoided as long as any revenue potential

remains untapped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of financing development in the future

also raises difficult



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2842</b></font><br><br>



questions.  I  have already given some indication  of

what  has  been  done  in Singapore  in  the  way  of

development  in the public sector since  the  war.  I

think that it will be generally agreed that what  has

been  achieved is most impressive. At the same  time,

much  remains to be done. Assuming that estimates  of

the amount of development which can be undertaken  in

1958  prove  to  be  correct, Government  will  still

remain   committed  to  work  estimated,  at  present

prices,  to  cost  over  $100 million.  In  addition,

allowance must be made for continuing items not shown

in the estimates such as housing after the completion

of  existing programmes, rural development,  purchase

of   land  for  development,  education  and  medical

development  in  addition to noted  commitments,  and

Defence  Services development. The City  Council  has

plans  for the development of public utilities  which

will entail the expenditure of $130 million over  the

next three or four years. The proposed allocation  of

this expenditure is $50 million for electrical works,

$40  million for water works, $6 million for gas  and

$36  million  for sewage disposal. In  addition,  the

Singapore  Telephone  Board will require  substantial

sums  for  further  development  if  the  demand  for

telephone   facilities  is  to  be  met.  In   short,

Singapore  will be faced with the task  of  financing

known commitments amounting to something of the order

of  $340  million  irrespective of any  other  urgent

works which may arise in the meantime, and this  will

have to be undertaken over the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question immediately arises whether this can be

done, and if so, over what period of time must it  be

spread. I think the answer is that it can be done  if

certain  conditions are fulfilled, but it  will  take

somewhat  longer than most authorities  and  citizens

would  like,  and  implementation  will  have  to  be

planned and integrated on an island-wide basis if  we

are going to succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto we have managed to finance our development

because of a number of factors. We have experienced a

decade  of unparalleled prosperity which has  enabled

Government to build up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2843</b></font><br><br>



reserves  beyond  the  wildest  dreams  of  Financial

Secretaries  of the past. Government has  managed  to

finance all its development, including loans  to  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust  and  to  the  Singapore

Telephone  Board,  from  these  resources  and,  more

recently,   from   substantial   contributions   from

revenue,  and has left the loan market  free  to  the

City Council which has managed to borrow $214 million

since  the  war. All the quasi Government authorities

in Singapore have, like Government, been able to make

substantial    contributions    from    revenue    to

development. In addition, confidence in the future of

Singapore has been high and institutions and  private

investors  to  a  lesser  extent  have  been   easily

persuaded  to  invest  their surplus  funds  in  City

Council loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, however, the position has changed somewhat.

The boom period is over. We are back to what might be

called   "normal"  Singapore  conditions.  Money   is

tighter.  Institutions  and  firms  have  no   longer

surplus funds to invest in long-term loans. Long-term

loans have lost popularity and all the emphasis is on

short-term  lending  and  borrowing.  The  Government

Provident  Funds  have appeared on  the  scene  as  a

source of development capital for the two Governments

and  have had the effect of almost completely  drying

up  other  institutional sources. Although confidence

is  growing, it would be idle to deny that  there  is

not now as much confidence in the future of Singapore

as  there  was, say, in early 1955. It  is  now  more

difficult than it has been before to obtain access to

the  London market. Perhaps due to the nature of  the

economy  and  to  its subjection to the  vagaries  of

commodity   prices,  there  is  an  almost   complete

absence, amongst the population as a whole,  of  that

instinct  to save which is a characteristic of  other

races.   The  response  of  private  individuals   to

Government and City Council loans has been  poor  and

the  response  to  such means of saving  as  National

Savings  Certificates and Premium Bonds  even  worse.

The problem of how best to promote the saving habit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2844</b></font><br><br>



in the population is one of the Government's main pre-occupations at the present time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, one may safely say that, by and large,

the main sources of development capital available  in

Singapore at present are the contributions which  the

various  authorities can make from their  own  funds,

such  funds  as the Central Provident Fund  Board  is

prepared to make available for local investment, and

the  small  sums  which  other sources  of  long-term

investment capital can supply. As regards the Central

Provident Fund, I am afraid I am not very happy about

the  policy  of the Board of this national  provident

fund  which  insists that 25 per cent  of  its  funds

should be invested outside Malaya at a time when  the

City   Council  is  sorely  in  need  of  funds   for

development  purposes. At the very outside,  I  place

the  total sum which is likely to be available in any

one  year  from  these sources  at  $50  million.  In

addition, it may be possible to obtain specific loans

from  international organisations for development  of

certain aspects of the City Council utilities, and it

may  also  be possible to invest some of the currency

fund  in  local  loans. These accretions  of  wealth,

however, are not certain and, even if available, will

not accrue for some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, the implementation of existing

development plans after 1958 is going to  be  limited

by  financial  considerations  to  at  the  most  $50

million  a year, at least at the start. This  clearly

demands  the  integration  and  phasing  of  existing

development plans against the background  of  finance

likely  to be available. Gone are the days when  both

Government  and  the City Council could  go  blithely

ahead  without  much thought for the availability  of

funds.  From  now  on, development will  have  to  be

planned  on an island-wide basis to ensure  that  the

funds available for capital development are spent  to

the  best  advantage of the territory as a whole.  To

this  end,  it has been decided to set up a  Planning

Committee   under   the   Financial   Secretary   and

consisting  of representatives of the Government  and

the City Council and other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2845</b></font><br><br>



development authorities. This Committee,  which  will

meet as soon as possible, will examine existing plans

and  commitments of the Government and  City  Council

and will integrate and phase them in the light of the

essential  needs of the Colony funds, and development

capacity likely to be available. It will be appointed

by  the  Council of Ministers to which it will report

from time to time. Its findings will also, of course,

be made available to the City Council which will have

an opportunity of expressing any opinions it desires.

In  this connection, I must make it clear - since fears

have  been expressed in other quarters - that the  need

for  the  development of public  utilities  is  fully

appreciated,  and  will  not  be  overlooked  in  the

allocation of funds for development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net effect of this limitation of funds and

phasing  of  development will be that development  is

spread  over  a  longer period  than  was  originally

intended. This is regrettable but unavoidable in  the

circumstances. We can, however, take comfort from the

fact  that so much has been done in the past and rest

assured   that,  if  there  is  any  opportunity   to

accelerate the programme in the future, it  will  not

be neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, gives some indication of the shape of

things to come. If we are to have the services  which

we   regard  as  essential  for  our  well-being  and

prosperity, we must be prepared in the future to save

much  more  and pay much more in taxes than  we  have

ever done in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to pay tribute to the

officers   who   have   been  responsible   for   the

preparation of the Estimates. They have been hard  at

it since April and I cannot speak too highly of their

conscientiousness and devotion to duty. I should also

like  to  thank the Government Printer and his  staff

who, as always, have met all demands on their ability

and time with cheerfulness and customary efficiency.

The  present  rate  rises from .6  per  cent  of  the

Eve   when  they  ate  of  the  forbidden  fruit.   A

thoughtful  providence, Sir, saw to it that  man  was

provided  the  wherewithal to obtain  sustenance  for

himself  and  for  his family. A merciful  providence

provided  man with land to till and mine, to  extract

his  needs  by  the sweat of his brow. A  cooperative

providence provided man with the seas to extract food

from,  if  he  was  clever and courageous  enough.  A

thoughtful  providence also provided man with  swamps

and  marshes,  which is neither land nor  sea,  as  a

reserve, for man to use his skill and cunningness, if

he  wished  to  put  it to his  use  when  his  other

resources were found to be insufficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the resources of Singapore: We in

Singapore are land hungry. On an island of 225 square

miles,  we  have a population of 1½ million.  Perhaps

hon.  Members  are not aware of the  density  of  our

population. I have here, Sir, the Colombo  Plan  fact

sheets   that  are  produced  by  the  Colombo   Plan

Information Office in which are quoted the density of

population  figures  for  the  various  Colombo  Plan

countries. Now the figures for Singapore are taken on

a  previous  census basis of 1¼ million.  Singapore's

figures are quoted as 1,635 per square kilometre  and

the  next  highest Colombo Plan country's density  of

population is that of Ceylon, that is, 131 - less  than

1/10th  of  Singapore. Now, the enormousness  of  the

density of population situation cannot be realised by

hon. Members unless they see such figures. Worked out

on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2849</b></font><br><br>



population  basis of 1½ million, Sir, our  population

comes  to  6,667  per square mile  and  that  is  the

highest  population density, I believe, in the  world

if  we  take  Singapore as a nation - as a  country  by

itself which we are now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken at various times on the need to

put  land to the best and the most economical use  we

can.  Even then, it cannot be concealed that we  have

not   sufficient  land  and  at  the  rate  that  our

population is growing, we will find it very  hard  to

produce enough food even on the basis of what we  are

producing now. Therefore, it is our duty to make  use

of every little bit of land that is available, and if

no  land is available, to make use of other resources

like marshes and swamps rather than to let them go to

waste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Fisheries Division in my Ministry has

shown,  by experiments, that it has conducted in  the

Government  prawn  ponds,  that  it  is  possible  to

increase  the yield per acre of prawn ponds in  swamp

areas  to  .34  ton per annum, that is more  than  5½

picul  per acre per year. A survey of the swamp areas

of  Singapore has also disclosed that not many  areas

of such swamp lands are available for development for

prawn  pond  purposes.  In  order  to  increase   the

opportunities  for our local citizens,  I  put  up  a

proposal to the Nature Reserve Board early this year,

that  the Board should release the Ulu Pandan  Nature

Reserve  for  the  purposes of prawn  cultivation  in

ponds.  Later on, I modified my proposal to a request

for  a  further 800 acres only because 200  acres  of

that  Nature Reserve are already occupied by a  prawn

pond operator without licence and those 200 acres, it

seems,  were  opened up by him during the  Occupation

period.  At least a quarter of the 800 acres which  I

am  asking  this  House to vote for release  will  be

reserved  for cooperative prawn ponds for  the  Malay

fishermen  living  in  the  area  and  I  propose  to

organise  these  Malay fishermen into a  co-operative

for  that  purpose. Full assistance will be given  to

these Malay fishermen in order to organise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2850</b></font><br><br>



them  and to set them on a proper footing into a  co-operative so that they can exploit the prawn ponds in

the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious, Sir, that considerations which favour

the release of a large area of mangrove swamps in the

Pandan Nature Reserve for the purposes of prawn  pond

cultivation more than outweigh those which favour the

retention of this area for the limited purpose  of  a

nature  reserve to serve only a small section of  the

population,  either for the purpose of recreation  or

of  education. The colony, Sir, has come to  a  stage

now  where  it cannot afford the luxury  of  mangrove

swamps as nature reserves, for such swamps can be put

to  better  economic  use,  and  for  the  biological

studies of nature students, it is considered that the

swamps  along  the  south coast of Johore  which  are

quite close to us will be more suitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order, Sir, that the whole of the Pandan Reserve,

excepting  an  area of 370 acres which  will  not  be

required and which will be kept as a reserve,  should

be  released  for  the economic  use  of  prawn  pond

cultivation,  an  amendment to  paragraph  5  of  the

Schedule   to   the  Nature  Reserves  Ordinance   is

necessary  and  under section 4  (1)  of  the  Nature

Reserves Ordinance,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Legislative Assembly may by resolution amend

the Schedule to this Ordinance by either the addition

to or deletion from the said Schedule or may make any

modification  of  the boundary  of  an  area  already

included in the said Schedule."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the motion which I have moved will be

to  reduce the present acreage of the area  shown  in

paragraph 5 of the Schedule from 1,370 acres  to  370

acres,  thereby confirming the release of  200  acres

which  are now already covered by prawn ponds without

licence,  and also releasing a further 800 acres  for

redevelopment as prawn ponds. The remaining 370 acres

will continue under the control of the Nature Reserve

Board  as a nature reserve-cum tourist attraction.  I

must emphasise that the areas shown in the other five

paragraphs of the Schedule to the Nature



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserves Ordinance will not be affected by this

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohamed Sidik:</b> Sir, I beg to second the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.55 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

purpose of this motion introduced by the Minister for

Commerce  and Industry, as he has already stated,  is

briefly  this:  to  reduce by a thousand  acres  from

approximately  1,370  acres to about  370  acres  the

Pandan  Forest Reserve which is at present under  the

protection of the Nature Reserve Board as one of  the

five areas on the island of Singapore requiring so to

be protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has placed before this House his reasons for wishing to reduce the Pandan Forest

Reserve  area, namely, the highly laudable and  well-intentioned  reason of wishing to open up  this  area

for  prawn  ponds, so that there will  be  a  greater

prawn supply in our local markets, and employment for

an increased number of prawn fishermen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding this intention of increasing our prawn

supply, I am completely at one with the Minister:  it

was  I  myself who pressed the Government to increase

the  prawn  catch in the Committee of Supply  a  year

ago.  Since  then,  I  have made  investigations  and

enquiries, just as the Minister himself has. The only

difference  between  us  is  that  we  have  come  to

different  conclusions: his conclusion  is  that  the

island's  prawn catch can be increased by  converting

1,000  acres of this mangrove forest, or  rather  the

balance of 800 acres, into prawn ponds: my conclusion

is  that  the reverse may very well be the case,  not

only  shall  we  reduce our prawns  but  reduce,  and

reduce  to extinction, a unique mangrove area  to  no

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall first put forward reasons, and the

reasons of experts, why this mangrove area should  be

reserved  as  an area of scientific importance,  and.

secondly, reasons why the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2852</b></font><br><br>



is running a great risk of doing the opposite of what

it  intends if it carries through the policy  of  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall urge as strongly as I can that the

Government withdraws this motion, that it reconsiders

all   the   evidence  available  and  acquires   more

scientific data on this subject before proceeding any

further.  I base my plea on this simple truism:  that

you  can cut down a tree in a matter of minutes,  but

it takes you 10, 20 or 30 years to undo what you have

done and replace that tree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I launch into my main

argument,  I would like to emphasise that I  have  no

axe  to  grind in this particular matter, I  have  no

interest in the forest reserve or prawn ponds  except

a  scientific interest and an interest in Singapore's

well  being,  and I have considered this  problem  as

objectively and dispassionately as I can in a  desire

to find out the truth. My whole case is this: that in

the  light  of present evidence I am of  the  opinion

that the Minister is making a grave mistake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would first like to draw your attention to

the  purpose  of  the Nature Reserves  Ordinance  now

before  us:  the  long title states that  it  is  "to

provide  for  the  dedication and  administration  of

certain  lands in the Colony of Singapore  as  Nature

Reserves".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3 of the Ordinance states the objects in

greater detail. Sub-section (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lands shown in the Schedule to this Ordinance

are  hereby dedicated, set aside and reserved for the

purposes   of   the   propagation,   protection   and

preservation of the indigenous fauna and flora of the

Colony and for the preservation of objects and places

of aesthetic, historical or scientific interest."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-section (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Such lands shall be controlled and managed not only

for  the  purpose  of protection and preservation  as

aforesaid but also for the purpose of providing under

suitable  conditions and control facilities  for  the

study  of and research into matters relating  to  the

fauna  and  flora  of  the Colony  and  the  physical

conditions in which they live.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lands mentioned in the Schedule are the

following, each of which was created as a reserve for

a particular reason:-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2853</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 1. This is the forest reserve known as the

Municipal Catchment Area, which is preserved for  the

obvious  reason  of  protecting  part  of  our  water

supply,  and  accounts for the  City  Council  having

powers  to nominate one of its members to the  Nature

Reserve Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nos. 2 and 3 are two adjoining sections of the Bukit

Timah  Forest Reserve forming one area which  is  the

"classical   collecting  area  for   a   very   large

proportion of Malaya's flora. It is the type locality

for  probably more species of plants than  any  other

area  of comparable size in the world. It is the only

remaining   piece  of  primary  lowland   forest   on

Singapore Island."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 6 - if I may skip Nos. 4 and 5 for the moment-is

the   Labrador  area  which  "conserves  a  primitive

species of fern, 'Dipteria conjugata', which is found

elsewhere in Malaya only above 3,000 feet."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nos. 4 and 5 are firstly the Kranji Forest

Reserve,  which "typifies the transition  from  muddy

foreshore  to  a  dry land vegetation,"  whereas  the

Pandan  Forest Reserve is "typical of tidal mangrove.

With  the total exploitation of other mangrove  areas

on  Singapore Island and the extensive working of the

mangrove   in  South  Johore,  Pandan  is  the   last

remaining piece of typical mangrove."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should explain, Sir, that the obvious scientific

portions of the explanation of the areas which I have

just given are not my views, but part of a considered

report made by the Nature Reserve Board itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pandan, I repeat, is "the last remaining piece of

typical  mangrove".  And I would  add  the  following

report   of  the  present  Director  of  the  Botanic

Gardens:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The species of plants recorded from the Pandan

Reserve represent about 1/20th of Singapore's  flora.

One  species at least is found elsewhere only on  the

east  coast  of Malaya, and another nowhere  else  in

Malaya  South  of Negri Sembilan and Pahang.  A  fern

recently found at Pandan has been previously recorded

in  Malaya  only in the mountains of central  Malaya.

Some  13 species of rare plants are at present  known

in the area."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will therefore be realised that the five areas

listed  in the Schedule were all to be protected  for

specific and separate reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, therefore, this Assembly reduces the Pandan

Nature  Reserve  from 1,370 acres  to  370  acres  by

approving  this motion, an area which  is  "the  last

remaining piece of typical mangrove", I maintain that

it  is  violating  the  letter  and  spirit  of  this

Ordinance  which expressly states that  the  area  is

"dedicated,  set aside and reserved for the  purposes

of  the  propagation, protection and preservation  of

the  indigenous  fauna and flora of  the  Colony".  I

would   add  that  the  word  "dedication"  expressly

carries with it a sense of permanence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I know perfectly well what the Minister's answer

to  this  might be: it is perhaps the only  point  he

has.  Professor Holttum, in giving his views on  this

problem earlier in this year, stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natural vegetation can only be preserved in samples

sufficiently  large to be self-propagating.  In  most

cases,  units  of  about 200  acres  are  probably  a

minimum for this purpose."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my hon. Friend the Minister might say, "There you

are,  Professor Holttum has stated that 200 acres  is

sufficient. I am leaving you with 370 acres or almost

double."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are at least two points which qualify, if

not negative, Professor Holttum's statement which was

written in London without more accurate knowledge  of

the  areas  proposed  to be alienated.  Firstly,  the

areas  to  be  left are divided into  three  separate

sections of 236, 90 and 45 acres respectively so that

the  last  two are of no value at all. Secondly,  all

three areas are strips along the coast, and I have  a

map  which  shows that this is so. Now, if you,  Sir,

have  been  into this mangrove area, as I  have,  you

will  immediately have noticed one curious fact. That

the  mangrove along the edge of the coast and on  the

two  banks of the Sungei Jurong is stunted: in  other

words,  the  trees  are smaller  than  those  growing

further inland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nature Reserve Board has pointed this out as

follows.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2855</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is utterly impossible for these (three areas) to

be representative of a whole mangrove community since

mangrove   vegetation  consists  of   a   series   of

gradations  from  the seaward edge of  the  innermost

border  to  where dry land begins. The plant  species

and  the  animals associated with them vary with  the

degree of inundation and exposure they have from  the

tide."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you take this argument - and any ordinary

person   can  accept  it  after  simple  observation

together  with Professor Holttum's opinion, you  will

appreciate that the fragmentary 370 acres proposed to

be left untouched are of little or no value. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natural vegetation can only be preserved in samples

sufficiently large to be self-propagating."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acres concerned lying along the coast do not form

a  complete unit of mangrove and therefore cannot  be

self-propagating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed what Professor Holttum said was this and I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In most cases, units of about 200 areas are

probably a minimum for this purpose, and larger areas

would  be  better. From an educational  and  cultural

viewpoint,  it  is  the  duty  of  any  community  to

preserve  adequate samples of its natural vegetation,

and in Singapore mangrove constitutes a distinct type

of vegetation of particular biological interest."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear therefore that Professor Holttum

qualified his minimum of 200 acres by saying that  it

must  be  an  adequate sample of  natural  vegetation

which  means  that  it  must  be  large  enough   and

representative enough to be self-propagating.  It  is

quite  clear that these coastal strips do not  fulfil

these  conditions,  that therefore  the  granting  of

these  strips  does not fulfil the intention  of  the

Ordinance  and that the Minister's interpretation  of

Professor  Holttum's  200 acres  would  be  extremely

misleading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Professor Holttum's view is not the only expert

view: if his view gives the Minister the ghost  of  a

case,  other experts whom I shall now quote give  him

no case at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr E. J. H. Corner is the first authority: as many

Members  of this House will recall, he was  Assistant

Director of the Gardens from 1929 to 1945 and is  the

author  of  the classic book Wayside Trees of  Malaya

which contains descriptions of 950 different species.

He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2856</b></font><br><br>



is  now at the Botany School at Cambridge University.

His  memorandum on the Reserve can only be quoted  in

part:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at times thought that Johore could provide

better nature reserves, but it was realised from  the

beginning  that  a keen and skilled  staff  would  be

essential to maintain them, such as could be supplied

only  from  the  Raffles Museum and Botanic  Gardens.

Further  it  was  foreseen that the  restoration  and

maintenance of areas of original forest in  Singapore

would add greatly to the amenities of the island; for

instance, they would provide places in which to  show

the  town-children the natural scenery and biological

complexity of Malaya, as well as supplying places for

exciting  excursions, and of course  attractions  for

tourists who would like to enjoy drives into tropical

scenery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pandan Reserve was particularly held in mind for

this  purpose  ...   to discover the  enlightenment

which  protects,  and, within its limits,  encourages

wild  life and scenery, will be a joy to visitors,  a

pride to the populace as it welcomes education, and a

sign  of  hope and integrity to the world. To  falter

will  be  to  barter  away the birthright  of  future

generations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tweedie, until recently Director of Raffles Museum, has given this opinion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The zoological interest of mangrove swamp lies

partly in the ground level and aquatic fauna of fish,

molluscs  and  crustacea and partly in  the  arboreal

fauna  of  the  forest. Impoverished samples  of  the

former can be seen in areas subjected to cutting, but

it  is  largely exterminated by conversion to  ponds.

These  animals (especially the crustacea) are  easily

observed during the day and are of great interest  to

students of animal behaviour. . . The proposed action

at  Pandan would therefore destroy a nature  reserve

of a very special and important kind."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Purchon, Raffles Professor of Zoology at

the University of Malaya, stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The area in question is the type locality for a

number of described species. Indeed the value of  the

area  in  this respect is so great that to assess  it

accordingly would be a very difficult task. The  area

is  important scientifically and educationally. It is

regularly   used  by  staff  and  students   of   the

Department of Zoology for teaching purposes,  and  it

is similarly valuable to our schools."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Professor of Botany, Professor Gilliland, has

written:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Singapore, with its very large number of schools

and its two universities, these nature reserves are a

vital  necessity  for the teaching of  biology.  That

public interest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2857</b></font><br><br>



may  increase in Singapore follows naturally from the

commencement of the teaching of biology in  Singapore

schools in 1938.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the Pandan Reserve has many

advantages - it is conveniently accessible to Singapore

schools  and universities; it is the locus of certain

of  the  rare plants, including orchids, recorded  on

the  island, and it is of sufficient area to be self-maintaining  as a mangrove community. Further,  lying

as  it  does  in  the estuary of a  stream,  all  the

physiographic factors which operate to bring about  a

mangrove habitat are present."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has suggested that students and teachers can go to Johore to study.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is clear that the

hon. Member will take some time?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then I will suspend the sitting. I will

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we adjourned before

lunch  I  was giving the House an exposition  of  the

scientific  value  of the Pandan  Nature  Reserve  as

confirmed  by experts, and I had almost concluded  my

arguments  on this aspect of the problem.  There  is,

however, one important point still remaining, one  of

the  few made by the Hon. Minister which requires  to

be answered, in a singularly unconvincing speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has suggested that students and teachers can go to Johore to study biology, but will

he  tell the House where in Johore there is a  Nature

Reserve? There is, I believe, some accessible  Forest

Reserve  40  miles  away  at  Pontian,  but  that  is

controlled  and cut for the purposes of timber.  Only

in  a  Nature  Reserve will we find  the  undisturbed

mangrove   in  its  natural  state  which  biological

studies  require. Are we to deny these  opportunities

to our two Universities?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2858</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only yesterday I obtained further information on

this point. I have it on the authority of a prominent

member of the Department of Zoology at the University

of  Malaya - whom for some reason the Minister has  not

thought  fit  to consult - that there  is  in  fact  no

mangrove  in the whole of South Malaya which  can  be

called  first-class, and you would have to go to  the

mouth of the Sarawak River in order to find it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense it would be true to say that the

Pandan   Reserve  is  not  ideal,  although   it   is

recovering very fast, but it is also true to say that

there is no better mangrove in South Malaya and  that

the only mangrove of comparable quality in Johore  is

in   the   Kukup   area,  where  it   is   completely

inaccessible  except  by boat after  almost  a  day's

journey.  All mangrove in Johore which is  accessible

by  road  is unrepresentative for the obvious  reason

that it is not left undisturbed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great point about the Pandan Reserve from the

teachers' point of view is that they know what is  in

the  Reserve and they can bring their students to  it

without having to search for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are facts from experts who know the mangrove

intimately,  and I would venture to suggest  that  if

our  aim,  through the University of Malaya  and  the

Nanyang  University, is to produce our own biologists

and botanists to fill future posts in the Departments

of   Agriculture  and  Fisheries,  and  the   Botanic

Gardens, and to provide teachers for the students and

the  next  generation, why deny  them  what  we  have

already at hand on our own island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to another opinion, the Planning Adviser to

the Singapore Improvement Trust has stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I confirm without question that we looked upon the

Nature  Reserve as complementary to the  Green  Belt,

and  that  they  were specifically  included  in  the

Master   Plan  under  the  designation   of   'Nature

Reserves' in order that they might be enjoyed by  the

public in their natural state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart therefore, from any protection which may

be  afforded by the Nature Reserves Ordinance, it  is

my  opinion that it would be entirely contrary to the

Master Plan for these areas to be used for any  other

purpose."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that I have not wearied the House by

pursuing  to  such lengths what is  in  fact  only  a

subsidiary argument



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2859</b></font><br><br>



to my main argument to which I am shortly coming, but

it is important to establish this point, namely, that

in introducing this motion, the Minister is in effect

saying,  firstly,  that the educational,  biological,

botanical, zoological and tourist value of this "last

remaining   piece  of  typical  mangrove"   must   be

destroyed;  and,  secondly, that he  must  flout  the

spirit and intention of the Nature Reserves Ordinance

as I have already quoted it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us suppose that we must accept this, although I

am  not  sure that the House will be fully  with  the

Minister in this matter; let us suppose that we  must

sacrifice these valuable assets of the Pandan Reserve

in  the interests of more prawns for our markets  and

more  employment for our people, a need on  which  we

can all agree. Is there irrefutable evidence that the

opening  up of another 800 acres to prawn  ponds  and

the  reduction of the mangrove forest  to  370  acres

will  produce this result? The Minister has  possibly

the  authority of the Department of Fisheries to tell

you,  Sir, that it will, though I wonder whether they

are  really  convinced; but the amount of  scientific

evidence  on his side is practically nil, nor  indeed

has he produced any.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit, Sir, that there is an almost overwhelming

body  of evidence on the other side, and I would  put

the   proposition  that  if  there  is  the  remotest

possibility that by converting 800 acres of mangroves

into   prawn   ponds  you  will  reduce   the   prawn

population, then this motion should be withdrawn  and

the whole question given further study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nature Reserve Board has stated its views most

emphatically on this subject, as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With regard to over-trapping the Board would

emphasise  again  most strongly the evidence  already

submitted  that a proportion of the prawn  population

must  be at large in undisturbed mangrove to  form  a

breeding nucleus from the fry of which the ponds  are

stocked.  Since  the ponds are traps and  the  prawns

therein   are  caught  before  they  breed  this   is

essential."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Nature Society puts the problem in its

simplest form:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since we include among us two ecologists of more

than  local  repute,  we think  our  opinion  on  the

proposed scheme may be worth giving. We believe  that

it  would actually lead to a drop in prawn production

rather than a rise, for the following reasons.  These

prawns  are  really mangrove animals; that  is  their

natural habitat where they feed and grow. They follow

the  tide  up, thus entering the prawn ponds  at  the

inner  edge of the mangrove and being caught  at  low

tide  when  the sluice gates are opened. If  however,

the  mangrove is removed and the whole area is filled

with  prawn  ponds, then the prawns' natural  habitat

and  feeding  grounds are destroyed.  The  inevitable

result would seem to be a rapid fall in the catch  of

prawns,  as they will go elsewhere in search  of  the

right habitat."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point it is only fair to say that, quite

unwittingly, I may have misled the Minister-as indeed

I   misled   myself-when  I   asked   the   following

supplementary  question on 22nd  May  of  this  year,

namely,  whether the Minister was aware that  it  had

now been discovered that prawns breed in the mangrove

areas.  I  should in fact have said  "feed"  and  not

"breed", a very different thing. It is in fact agreed

by   the   experts  that  the  prawns  of  commercial

importance breed somewhere out to sea and not in  the

mangrove, but where is not yet known.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister somewhat naturally seized on this point, and I do not blame him, when he wrote to me on

3rd June as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two kinds of prawns, one belonging to the

family  known  as  the  'Carideans'  which  breed  in

mangrove areas and the other belonging to the  family

known  as  'Peneids' which do not breed  in  mangrove

areas.  The  former are only useful as pig  and  duck

food  whilst it is on the latter 'Peneids'  that  our

present prawn rearing industry is based."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, according to Mr P. N. F. Hall, a prawn

specialist  who  left Singapore  when  the  Fisheries

Research Station collapsed - and it is a pity he is not

here  to help us over this problem - according  to  Mr

Hall  who has been contacted, there may be 14 species

of  prawn present in a catch, of which seven  species

rarely constitute less than 95 per cent of the total.

And this 95 per cent are the Peneids which, according

to Mr Hall, "breed offshore and spend their juvenile

growing life feeding in the mangrove swamps or in the

ponds".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now if I may revert to the Minister's letter to

me,  we  will  find,  Sir, that  his  information  is

exactly  similar, expressed though it is in different

words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost all members of the family known as the

Peneids breed at sea and the young larval stages  are

brought into the mangrove swamps by the tide. As soon

as they have reached the mangrove swamps or perhaps a

little earlier they settle down on the bottom to feed

and  grow up. When they have reached a length of from

two  to three inches they have a natural urge to swim

out  to  sea again, to mature and breed. It is during

this stage of their life history that they are caught

by our prawn cultivators."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this admission that from the young larval

stages until they reach a length of from two to three

inches    they    are    living    and    feeding - not

breeding - feeding  in  the  mangrove,  how   can   the

Minister contemplate with equanimity the cutting down

of  800  acres of it? His own letter to me proves  my

case, and not his.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put this all once again in my own words

because  it  is  the crux of the whole  problem.  The

prawns breed out to sea, but how far they travel  and

where  they  breed is not yet known. In  their  early

larval stages they come in with the tide, either into

the mangrove or into the prawn ponds, where they sink

into  the mud and feed and grow and fatten. When they

have  reached  a  certain  size - about  two  or  three

inches - the urge comes to stir themselves  and  to  go

out  to  sea  again and breed. Those feeding  in  the

mangrove  swim out to sea without restriction;  those

that  have fattened in the ponds cannot get  out  but

are  caught in the nets at the sluice gates and  find

their way to the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to follow quite logically, therefore, that

if  you  reduce  your mangrove to a  small  area  and

increase your prawn pond area by the amount by  which

you  have reduced your mangrove, too many prawns will

be  caught, too few prawns will swim out  to  sea  to

breed,  and  the  law  of  diminishing  returns  will

operate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts proclaimed by the Minister that the prawn

catch  in  the  Government  experimental  ponds   has

increased in the last three years to one-third  of  a

ton



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2862</b></font><br><br>



per  acre per annum proves nothing. But if it  proves

anything at all in the Pandan area, it surely  proves

that the mangrove should be left undisturbed, and not

the  reverse.  Indeed there is some evidence,  though

not  conclusive, that there is already a falling  off

in  the  prawn catch in the Pandan and Ponggol areas,

that these areas, in other words, are being fished to

the limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one further important point to be

remembered  regarding this Pandan  or  Sungei  Jurong

area,  and that is this: the 1,370 acres of  mangrove

of  this Forest Reserve is the only mangrove left  on

the  southern shore of the island; if it is cut  down

to  all  but  370  acres,  there  is  no  alternative

mangrove in this area at all to which the prawns  can

turn for the feeding ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the prawn population diminishes through the

stripping  of  the mangrove along the  banks  of  the

Sungei  Jurong, as is intended, the first  people  to

suffer hardship will be the poor Malay fishermen who,

as  you  probably  know, Sir, eke  out  a  precarious

living by wading up to their armpits in the mud  with

their  nets  for  a  meagre and fortuitous  catch  of

prawns  and  other  crustacea,  and  whose  catch - and

therefore their living - will be reduced still further,

and  the co-operative scheme for them will be  of  no

avail.  If that were to happen, the Minister and  the

present  Government will have a great deal to  answer

for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated, there is little or no scientific

evidence  on the side of the Minister to support  the

action  he  proposes to take, and one can  only  hope

that, having taken the stand that prawn ponds in  the

area  are to be increased, he will not feel  that  he

cannot  withdraw from that stand even in the face  of

facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one more quotation, and it is from

the  findings of the Malayan Branch of the  Institute

of Biology:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not one single member of the Institute who has been

contacted  has  given even qualified support  to  the

proposal for alienating the reserve. If this proposal

were to go ahead it would thus be in the face of  the

overwhelming majority of Malayan professional biologists,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2863</b></font><br><br>



and  of  the  only body in  Malaya  which  is

competent   to   express   the   views   of   Malayan

professional biologists."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of that statement, is the Government not

prepared to pause and think again?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, are we then to abandon ideas of

increasing our prawn supplies? That is certainly  not

the  case.  The Nature Reserve Board has pointed  out

that there is considerable acreage of tidal swamp  on

Crown  Land suitable for development around the coast

of   Singapore.  The  Tuas  area,  for  example,   is

particularly  promising, and it might well  be  that,

after  experimentation, a considerable area could  be

opened  up  to  prawn  ponds without  damage  to  the

necessary mangrove feeding areas; because on the west

coast  there are considerable stretches of  mangrove,

not  only  on the Singapore side, but on  the  Johore

side as well, and it is not straying too far into the

realms of conjecture to suggest that the Johore coast

can  and  does  provide  the  feeding  grounds  which

benefit  Singapore prawn ponds in the Johore  Straits

even today, and that the feeding grounds utilised are

therefore  something like twice the area  at  present

calculated.  Certainly  it  is  something   requiring

further research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Commerce and Industry have put

forward the curious argument that areas such  as  the

Tuas  area  cannot be developed as prawn  pond  areas

because  of  the objections of the fishermen  in  the

area, whose plight is desperate because of the curfew

in  the  Johore Straits. Apart from the fact  that  I

believe that the restrictions have now been eased,  I

fail  to see why the fishermen would not welcome  the

development of their own area through the  enrichment

of prawns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am not going to say to this House that

the  views  of  the Nature Reserve Board  or  of  the

biologists   must  be  correct  and  those   of   the

Minister's   and  his  advisers   are   not.   I   am

sufficiently imbued with the scientific temper to say

no  more  than that there are at least two points  of

view, and that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2864</b></font><br><br>



Government should proceed with extreme caution  until

further research has taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what seems to me unfortunate is this: that it

appears  that the data and the research work  of  the

Department  of Fisheries has never been published  or

revealed  so that the other experts in Singapore  can

also  work  on  it.  The  Department  has  worked  in

isolation.  Its views may be right - I am  not  denying

that-but with so much conflicting opinion they should

not   be  accepted  until  they  have  been  expertly

examined by other authorities in the same field.  Why

is it that the Minister has never called together the

members  of  the Nature Reserve Board and members  of

the  Institute  of  Biology  to  discuss  this  whole

problem  with the Fisheries Department,  so  that  if

there  are conflicting theories, they can be thrashed

out?  Is this not the proper course even now, instead

of  the  leap  in  the dark which the  Government  is

proposing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the Minister never consulted the Department

of  Zoology at the University, which is there in  our

midst  to  give  advice? Is it because  the  Minister

fears  that  he  will  get the  answer  he  does  not

want? - because I come back to the point I made at  the

outset:  that you can cut down 800 acres of  mangrove

trees  in  a short space of time but if your theories

are proved to be wrong, it will take some 30 years or

more to grow them again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I referred to Mr Hall who was with the

Research  Station at Changi and who did a great  deal

of  work  on prawn biology while he was here.  It  is

betraying  no secret for me to say that his  treatise

on   the  subject  is  in  the  press  and  due   for

publication in one of the scientific journals. He may

be  able  to  throw  a great deal  of  light  on  the

importance  or otherwise of mangroves, on the  effect

of  the currents round the Singapore coast which must

have  some  influence on the breeding areas.  If  the

migratory  movements  of  the  prawns  were  properly

understood, it would be much simpler to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2865</b></font><br><br>



formulate    efficient   schemes    for    commercial

exploitation, and to avoid the error of  killing  the

goose  which  lays  the golden  eggs.  Would  it  not

therefore  be  wiser to obtain Mr  Hall's  data,  or

await  its publication, instead of plunging into  the

unknown?  As this is a purely scientific problem,  is

there  any reason why the Government should not adopt

a scientific approach towards it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have, I think, said enough to explain why we

are not happy about this motion. There is still more,

nevertheless, which I could say. I might mention that

the  Rural Board is unanimously opposed to this move,

having heard from one of its own Health Officers that

a  large scale clearing of the mangrove is likely  to

create   breeding   sites  for  the  malaria-carrying

mosquito called Anopholes sundiacus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might pause to wonder why it is that the Minister

for  Commerce and Industry, and not the Minister  for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing, is  introducing

this  motion, as the Nature Reserves come within  the

latter's portfolio. I might pause to wonder why it is

that  the  Minister for Commerce and Industry  is  so

desperately  keen  to  press  this  issue   at   this

particular time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own belief is this: that if all the experts oil

the subject in the country got round one table to  go

into  this matter and pool their knowledge - as  should

have  been  done  before - it would be found,  firstly,

that the area of land alienated for prawn ponds could

be  increased beyond the present area; secondly, that

a  sufficient but different area of mangrove could be

retained  at the Pandan Forest Reserve as  a  feeding

area  for  prawns and as a self-propagating area  for

biological study; and thirdly and finally, the proper

balance  of nature could be achieved. That  would  be

the  best  possible  results, while  at  present  the

Government may get the worst of both worlds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only conclude by urging the Government and

the  Minister,  in  the  light  of  all  the  present

evidence,  to have the honesty and courage  to  think

again. I do not know whether the Minister will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2866</b></font><br><br>



in  fact consider withdrawing his motion but in order

that  all Members on both sides of the House  may  be

able to consider this question more carefully, I wish

to  move, under Standing Order 20 (1) that the debate

be  now adjourned to a later date to be fixed by  the

Minister.



<br><br>2.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Under Standing Order 20, a motion

should  read, "That the debate be now adjourned."  If

that is agreed to, the date will have to be named  by

the  Member  in  charge. Will the hon. Member  please

move formally?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move under

Standing Order 20 (1),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate be now adjourned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I second the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  People's  Action Party has no bird-watchers,  or

prawn  admirers,  or mangrove swamp special-lists  in

its midst. I do not wish to appear to be a Philistine

but I found the earnest arguments so academically put

forward by the hon. Member for Tanglin as to why



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The procedure is a bit

complicated,  I do admit, but the motion  now  before

the House is, "That the debate be now adjourned."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was leading to

my  point on this motion, and if you so wish it, Sir,

I  shall come to my point first and then elaborate on

it.  And  the point is this: the only argument  which

carries weight - if it were true - is that if you open up

these  800 acres you are going to diminish the  prawn

production.  If  that is true then I  say  the  whole

purpose  of  this scheme will be defeated.  Obviously

the Hon. the Minister cannot have been so ill-advised

and  we  would like to know if he has second thoughts

on  the  matter  after hearing the very  lengthy  and

detailed arguments put forward by the hon. Member for

Tanglin.  If there is the slightest doubt as  to  the

possibility



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2867</b></font><br><br>



of  increasing production by diminishing  either  the

feeding area or the breeding area by 800 acres,  then

I  say  the debate should be adjourned, and  on  that

motion  alone we might have the information  that  is

available to the Minister for Commerce and Industry.



<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am speaking on the second

motion,  Sir. First of all, the Minister  is  not  "a

single man". The Minister is not expected to be a man

with  academic  knowledge of fisheries,  swamp  land,

mangroves, stunted  mangrove  growths,  centipedes,

serpents  and  whatever else that grow  in  the  man-groves,  or that live in the mangroves. The  Minister

has  to  rely  on advice from the head of department,

who  is  the man who should know his job and what  is

going  on.  According to the advice that I  have  got

from  my Chief Fisheries Officer, there is no  danger

that  there  will be a diminution in the breeding  of

prawns because of this scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps hon. Members may like to know why there is

no  such danger, and I will give the answer in brief.

With  the  Peneid variety of prawns, the  full  grown

ones  live  out offshore, far out at sea,  more  than

five miles away from the coast. When they breed,  the

larvae come into the inshore waters. They remain  and

feed  in the inshore waters and grow until they reach

"young  hood". That is when the prawn operators  open

their  gates and get them in. But it does not  follow

that  the  whole lot of larvae in the inshore  waters

will  be  caught by the pond operators. Quite  a  big

number  are not caught because there is the  urge  in

these  young  prawns  to swim out  to  sea,  back  to

offshore waters. Therefore a lot of these prawns  are

not caught.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This talk of breeding in the inshore areas of

Singapore - it  has been fished by local fishermen  for

the  last  50  years and yet there is no evidence  of

over-fishing so far. The Peneids are not caught until

they  reach  near  maturity and the prawn  ponds  are

feeding  grounds so that the prawns will grow faster.

But as I said earlier, a good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2868</b></font><br><br>



portion of the prawns manage to get far out into  the

sea from the inshore waters, and when they go far out

to sea they breed again and the larvae come back into

the inshore waters to grow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir,

could the Hon. the Minister explain to us what is the

significance  of  his argument that  there  has  been

fishing  for  50  years without a diminution  in  the

amount of prawns available to be caught, with respect

to  the  argument that if you cut down the  1,370  by

1,000 acres there will be a diminution of the area in

which  these  larvae  can grow to  "youth-hood" - as  I

think it was put by the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I was answering the

argument  of  the  hon. Member for  Tanglin  when  he

suggested that there might be over-fishing, that  is,

too  many of these young prawns may be caught by  the

prawn  ponds  so  that  there  will  be  insufficient

numbers to go out and breed. But that is not so, as I

have explained earlier. As regards the area that  may

be  cut down reducing breeding area, I think there is

no  danger  of  that  because  the  prawns  breed  in

offshore  waters and we have offshore waters  on  all

sides of the island.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a further point, Sir, as I

understand  it,  the  larvae come  into  the  inshore

waters  and  into the mangrove. There  it  feeds  for

three months or so until they are ripe for the catch.

Then  the  sluice gates are opened,  the  prawns  are

caught  and  fed in the ponds and are ready  for  the

market.  The argument of the hon. Member for Tanglin,

which should carry considerable weight if it is true,

is that if you cut down the feeding area, which is at

present 1,370 acres, by 1,000 acres (although in fact

it  has  already been cut down by 200 acres, so  that

there  are  another 800 acres to be  cut  off),  then

there  will  not be sufficient space in the  mangrove

for the larvae to feed on.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would appear that we are entering

into a debate on the main Question. The Question  now

is, "That the debate be now adjourned." From the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2869</b></font><br><br>



debate  within  the debate that has  taken  place  it

seems  to  me that the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar

seeks  to  make  further  investigations  into   this

problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, Sir, we do not wish to delay

the  purpose  of the Liberal-Socialist  amendment  to

postpone  the  debate. We are  not  very  anxious  to

postpone the debate unless we can be sure there is  a

valid  reason.  What we want to be  certain  is  that

there  is no valid reason, and the enquiries  that  I

have  put to the Minister about this cutting down  of

the  breeding or feeding area is to find out  whether

or  not there is a danger. If there is then I suggest

the   debate   should   be   adjourned   for   proper

consideration to take place; if there is not then  we

go on with the debate on the merits of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> There is no such danger, Sir.

The  inshore area is infinitely larger compared  with

the 800 acres that we propose to cut down.



<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, the crux of the

matter  has not been explained away by the  Hon. the

Minister   for  Commerce  and  Industry.  What   will

influence  our vote as to whether this debate  should

be adjourned or not is the usefulness of having these

extra  800  acres  as  a natural  reserve.  From  the

answers  which the Minister has given to  the  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar, it seems that  the  Minister  is

himself  in considerable doubt as to what the  answer

ought  to  be.  We want to know definitely  from  the

Minister  before  we  cast our vote  whether  he  has

considered this question from all the scientific  and

biological  information from the experts who  are  on

hand and whose opinions have been given by my learned

colleague, the Member for Tanglin. Unless we have the

Minister's assurance that he has fully considered  it

and  is  prepared  to demolish 1,000  acres  of  land

dedicated for the last 100 years in 10 minutes or  20

minutes debate, then I am sure we are unable to  cast

our votes even on the motion for adjournment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir, It  seems  that the hon. Member wants  my  full

reply to the points raised by the Member for Tanglin.

I  was reserving that for the reply to the debate  on

the original Question. Can you please guide me?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As I understand it, the motion, "That

the  debate be now adjourned", was moved because  the

mover urged that there should be closer investigation

into  the  whole matter. I think that  if  debate  is

entered  into  on that Question, and if hon.  Members

will  confine themselves to whether or not they think

closer  investigation ought or ought not to be  made,

we  will  be  able  to complete the  debate  on  that

particular Question and then go back to the  original

Question.



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

suppose  we  do  have the debate  adjourned  now  and

postpone  it  to  say another three months-or  longer

than  that-how much prawns will we have caught during

this  period or these few months? Is it not  possible

that  for a consideration of a small amount of prawns

that may be caught during that time, we could adjourn

this  debate and think carefully on the pros and cons

of  this  subject? I think there should  be  no  loss

whatsoever, but if the Government, after hearing  all

this  argument, would still want to use its Nominated

Members to bulldoze this issue through, then I think-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member does understand

that he must not impute improper motives?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I believe, Sir, that when

arguments  are  put  forward - and  strong  arguments,

too - in  support  of  a motion not  against  what  the

Minister   has  proposed, but  just   to   ask   for

reconsideration of the matter, the Government  should

consider the case. I think anybody wise enough should

accept  the  motion, because, if  the  evidence  does

point  out  that it is harmful to do  away  with  the

nature  reserve, we would not have done away with  it

yet;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2871</b></font><br><br>



but  if the evidence shows that it will be profitable

to  carry on making the whole area into prawn  ponds,

then  it  will not be late, even though it  may  take

place a month or two later.



<br><br>3.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I understand

the  mover  of  this motion - or emotion - correctly,  he

essentially  seeks  to get more expert  advice  on  a

matter  on which expert advice has of course  already

been  given. It is not a matter on which I  can  give

expert    advice,   except   some    experience    in

administration: but the more experts  you  have,  the

more  differing opinions you will get. I do not think

it  will  be helpful, after the Ministry has  made  a

thorough  study and come forward with a proposal,  to

throw  it  all  back  for a lot of  further  ex-parte

expert   advice.  I  cannot  help  recollecting   the

question  of floods and water storage in  which  the

City Water Engineer put up an expert scheme first and

then  my  drainage adviser put up another scheme  and

when  they  were in conflict we had a special  expert

out from the United Kingdom to put up a third scheme.

Meanwhile  the Water Engineer was changed, and  there

was a fourth scheme. That was the result of going  to

too  many experts. You have got to take your  experts

and  stick  to  them, Mr Speaker, and I  think  this

motion must be resisted because it is a time-waster.



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it  will probably interest the hon. Member  for

Serangoon  to know that I am in favour of  adjourning

this debate. I do not know very much about mangroves,

and I certainly know very little about the habits  of

prawns. When I was a young man there was a song which

ran,  "Do  shrimps  make  good  mothers?",  but   the

evidence was inconclusive. And I would certainly like

to know a great deal more from the Government side as

to whether or not the cutting down of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2872</b></font><br><br>



the   mangroves  would  indeed  interfere  with   the

fecundity of the prawns.

this  motion. Expert views have been put  up  by  the

hon. Member for Tanglin and I think it will be in the

interests of the Members of this House and the people

of  Singapore in general if the debate on the  motion

is adjourned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question accordingly negatived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2873</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question as appears in

Item 2 of the Order Paper is now before the House.



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, it is indeed with great

regret  that  Government  is  forcing  through   this

measure.  I have to protest because we only  received

this motion less than a week ago on a matter of vital

importance to Singapore, in the respect that  we  are

changing a dedicated area of this country in so short

a  time  and  after  my learned  Friend  has  brought

forward considerable evidence and scientific data  to

raise  doubt  even in the mind of the leader  of  the

People's  Action  Party. It  is  a  very  inopportune

moment for us to resist this motion at a moment  when

elections   to   the  City  Council   are   imminent.

Unscrupulous politicians-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not see how a speech of

that nature is relevant to the Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the very fact that somebody

said  "platform" induces me to say that  we  will  be

accused of trying to prevent people from getting more

food  when  our  sole  idea is  to  have  the  proper

investigations before we leap in the dark. I for  one

and  my  Party have always advocated more work,  more

food,  and  if  we are certain that cutting  down  of

1,000  acres  would improve the prawn  feed  and  the

prawn  population,  I say cut down  10,000  acres  or

whatever you have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not clear and it has not been proved, and

we  will not accept the word of just one expert  when

the scientific data are against it. Sir, if this goes

on,  why  not  cut down the Botanic Gardens  too  and

plant tapioca or whatever you like? There must  be  a

certain balance and careful deliberation and thinking

before measures like this are forced through within a

few hours.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, I think there is one point

on   which   the   Opposition  is  being   a   little

unrealistic - the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2874</b></font><br><br>



assumption  that  if this is not done  now,  it  will

never  be  done.  If  we  look  at  the  increase  in

population  of  Singapore,  it  makes  it  absolutely

certain that if things go on as they are, in the  end

even the Botanic Gardens will have to go, unless  you

put  guards  around them and fence them  with  double

reinforced concrete and all the rest of it; for there

will  be  no  space on the island which can  be  left

vacant  if we go on breeding at the present rate.  It

is  a matter of ten, fifteen or twenty years. We have

already  got six to seven thousand people per  square

mile  of  the  island and it is impossible  that  you

should  be  able to preserve any space  that  is  not

fully developed and put to the maximum economic use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you try to preserve this area as a sanctuary for

prawns or crustacea or snakes or any other flora  and

fauna -  I  have the greatest sympathy with those  who

care  for  them  and  find  educational  benefits  in

them - nevertheless  they will go  quite  soon.  People

will  start  cutting the mangrove for  firewood;  you

will  not be able to stop them; they will be in there

in  every  possible way and you will be  rooting  out

squatters  from the area. It is illusory  to  imagine

that  with the population pressure of Singapore, this

sort of area can be preserved in perpetuity. The most

you  can  do  is  to delay it for  a  while  but  its

development is inevitable in the end.



<br><br>3.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Labour

Front   never   liked   experts - the   Minister    for

Communications and Works said that. But I  find  that

it  imports one expert after another one for  water,

one  for transport, one for local government, and one

for  every other thing it can think of. But  in  this

matter  it  will say, "No, it does not like experts."

It  is  one  of  the  funniest things  to  apply  the

argument only when it suits the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point I would like clarification, Sir.

Out  of those 2,000 acres of mangrove swamp you would

want  to cut down 1,300, leaving only a small acreage

as  a  nature reserve. If we do really want  to  have

that place developed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2875</b></font><br><br>



as prawn ponds, then why not cut down everything? Why

leave  that  little  bit?  If  it  is  not  going  to

contribute  towards the breeding of prawns,  then  by

all  means  take  off the whole area;  do  not  leave

anything.  Why leave a little bit here and  a  little

bit there serving no useful purpose?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we come to a case in which, as the Hon.

Minister  for  Communications and Works said,  people

will  chop down the trees as firewood, and when  only

such a small area is left, I definitely think that it

will  vanish in no time. So again this is a  case  in

which Government is doing things half-heartedly. Does

it think that that little area will be good enough as

a  nature  reserve?  Or does it think  that  it  will

produce  more  prawns?  Whichever  way  it  is,   the

decision of the Government is wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to the Government this

matter  of  food production. Here we have the  Pandan

Nature  Reserve,  but elsewhere around  Singapore  we

have many more areas of mangrove. Does the Government

encourage prawn fishing in those areas? Does it  give

licences freely? In some cases it would say  that  it

is   looking  after  the  interests  of   the   Malay

fishermen;  in  this  case it is going  to  over-rule

them.  In some instances Government would go  out  of

its  way  to  consult  the  fishermen.  I  am  asking

Government  whether it has done so in this  case.  If

not, why not?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on a matter of food production, in Singapore

we  do  not  just produce in the swamps. I think  the

Hon, the Minister for Commerce and Industry is  also

concerned   with   agriculture.  Just   look   around

Singapore and note the various areas where  there  is

waste land. What has he done about such land? Has  he

converted  it  into  useful food-producing  areas?  I

would like an answer to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again I would say that, in conflict with

another    Department   of   Government - the    Health

Department - the Government has not seen fit to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2876</b></font><br><br>



allow  Kallang basin to be developed for the purposes

of prawn fishing - Kallang basin, not fit for building,

not  fit  for  any other purpose, yet the  Government

will   not   issue   licences  because   the   health

authorities say no. Now in this instance again,  what

is  the view of the Health Department? Has Government

considered it? If not, why not?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard very interesting quotations right at

the  beginning of this debate. Many people can  quote

Scripture  but many people can also get  their  facts

wrong.  Devils  can  also quote  Scripture  and  also

devils  can  get  their facts wrong. Singapore  is  a

nation. We do not have a representative at the United

Nations   Organisation.   Singapore   has   a   thick

population.  Yes, it is very thick because  it  is  a

City  and I do not see how all these things can  help

the  debate when it just concerns a few hundred acres

where we can catch prawns. I would ask Government  to

think of better ways of increasing food production by

deep-sea  fishing. I think Government has  been  most

obstructive  in the matter of encouragement  of  food

production when it first refused to allow freely deep-sea  fishing-boats to be licensed to go out. And here

it  is squabbling over some little bit of swamp land,

and even that half-heartedly.



<br><br>3.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a great pity

that  in  a  debate such as this we do  not  have  an

opportunity  first of hearing the Hon.  Minister  for

Commerce and Industry in reply. I quite realise  what

the  situation is. But obviously he held back a great

deal of his fire and so we have not heard what he has

to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the meantime we have heard the most cogent

arguments put up by the hon. Member for Tanglin.  Now

I would like to say, with reference to remarks passed

by  the  hon.  Member  for Paya Lebar  and  the  Hon.

Minister  for  Communications  and  Works,   that   I

personally  am not in the slightest degree interested

in  the  preservation of a Nature Reserve as such.  I

think the very fact that there are in Singapore large

areas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2877</b></font><br><br>



under mangrove is a little bit out of place in  this

age.  What  I  want  to hear from  the  Minister  for

Commerce   and   Industry  in  reply  is   scientific

refutation of the arguments put forward by the Member

for Tanglin, that the destruction of the mangroves is

going to lead to lesser breeding of the prawns.  That

seems to me the only argument of any substance.



<br><br>3.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we voted

against  the motion proposed by the hon.  Member  for

Tanglin  because he sounded like a Catholic on  birth

control.  They come to you and they say,  "Well,  you

know it has really nothing to do with Catholicism; it

has  to  do with the nervous system of the woman  and

the  man and everybody else. But do not vote for  the

F.P.A."  Sir, I was very interested to hear from  the

Member  for Tanglin that there were peculiar  plants,

and  insects, the flora and fauna, in these  mangrove

swamps which may be of some benefit to those who have

the  leisure to go and take pictures at long distance

of  birds  and bees and snakes and prawns  and  other

things. But it seems to me completely unrealistic  to

talk   about  nature  reserves  in  the   island   of

Singapore. If you want to talk of nature reserves  in

the  Federation - like King George VI Park - then  I  say

there  is some sense of proportion; but if you  think

nature can be saved from the teeming population,  and

mangrove  swamps  at that, saved  for  some  doubtful

benefit, I think it is completely and utterly mad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was sorry that the Minister did not have at

his  finger-tips the data with which to  destroy  the

arguments  put forward by the Member for  Tanglin - not

the  argument which he really believed  in,  but  the

argument  he put forward to preserve his main  point,

namely, that it should be a nature reserve. Now, very

simply,  it  is  this:  if  there  is  the  slightest

possibility of the total prawn population going  down

as  a  result  of  mangroves disappearing  and  ponds

appearing, then I say it should be stopped.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2878</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is no danger of this happening if the

scheme is put into operation in several phases. If we

do not have the 800 acres suddenly cut down and ponds

appearing, but it is done in phases, we can  see  the

way the prawn population is going - whether it is dying

off, like the aborigines in Australia, or whether  it

is multiplying, like the Negroes in America. It is on

that  basis that the Government is going to  use  its

common  sense and put the scheme through  in  several

phases to make sure that the scientific calculations,

or  the calculations of the scientific experts quoted

by the Member for Tanglin, are not proved correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as we can make out, if we already have 200

acres  of  the  1,000 acres you want  set  aside  for

prawns,  in  fact fish ponds, then  do  it  in  three

phases, and as you finish each phase you can see  the

"state of the nation" as far as prawns are concerned,

and  go on with it if prawns keep on multiplying. And

it   is  on  that  basis  that  we  objected  to  the

adjournment,  particularly when the hon.  Member  for

Serangoon suggested three months. This is one of  the

election  issues which is bound to  crop  up  in  Ulu

Pandan.  We, the P.A.P., are not interested;  we  are

just spectators there, but the Liberal-Socialists are

not just mere spectators. But I would say this, it is

very  close to the City area. The moment I receive  a

letter  which contains all the arguments put  forward

by the Member for Tanglin, signed by a person who has

large  acres of fish or prawn ponds in that  area,  I

view  the matter with some pardonable suspicion. When

I  find a big owner of fish ponds putting forward all

the  biological and zoological reasons why this thing

should  not be turned into ponds, I think the  matter

should be pursued with even greater vigour.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker, I think it is quite clear from the arguments

we  have heard from both sides that all agree that it

is  the  duty  of  Government  wherever  possible  to

increase  food  production,  particularly,  when  one

looks at the reports



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2879</b></font><br><br>



and the statistics which show that the population  is

fast  growing. Now prawns are very expensive  in  the

market  and  everything that can be done to  increase

prawn  production  of  course  should  be  supported.

Therefore  on balance food production comes  foremost

against  Nature  Reserve. The biological,  zoological

and other "ological" reasons do not move me one bit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly concerned with the ability to

increase food production, and the only argument  that

was  advanced by the hon. Member for Tanglin, on  the

important question raised by Mr Sutherland,  whether

the  cutting down of the mangroves is going to reduce

the  prawn population, the only argument advanced  by

the   Member  for  Tanglin  seems  to  me  absolutely

contradictory.  He  says in one  breath - and  I  speak

subject  to correction, I may have heard wrongly - that

by  destroying  and  demolishing mangroves,  you  are

demolishing  and doing away with the food  which  the

prawns  require  in order to grow  up.  In  the  next

breath he says, quoting from another expert, that the

prawns,  the larvae, go into the mangrove swamps  and

bury  themselves into the mud for a period until they

grow in size to two or three inches.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir. The

biological  problem is simply this:  prawns  feed  in

mud,  mangroves  or  ponds; when they  are  ready  to

breed, they leave the mud, mangroves or ponds for the

sea.  If  too high a proportion of an area  is  pond,

then  too high a proportion of prawns is trapped  and

there  are  not enough left to go out to sea  and  to

breed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> That is still contradictory, Sir,

because  I  cannot  see  how the  demolition  of  the

mangroves themselves as mangroves is going to  reduce

the  food  for  prawns.  These  larvae  feed  on  the

molecules  that  are  in the  mud,  and  whether  the

mangroves are there or not they still have their food

in  the mud for a certain period. That is how  I  see

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I cannot support any argument which says

we must preserve the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2880</b></font><br><br>



mangroves,  for  botanical reasons or for  zoological

reasons  or  for biological reasons,  and  also  that

mangrove  is  food  for the prawns. Someone  remarked

about the Botanic Gardens. The Botanic Gardens, as  I

see it, is a place which is particularly set aside to

grow  and  preserve such flora as are found in  one's

country in a particular site, and anybody who  wishes

to study that flora can go there at their leisure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On those grounds, Sir, I am not satisfied with any

argument advanced by the Member for Tanglin  that  by

destroying the mangrove we are going to do away  with

prawn  food  and  thus reduce the population  of  the

prawns.  As  no  argument has been  advanced  I  must

accept the expert advice of the Fisheries Officer  on

this question, and I support this motion.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not

that  I  did not have a proper reply when the  motion

was  moved for the adjournment of the debate. It  was

because  I was holding my guns for the reply  to  the

debate on the original Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must assure this House specifically that all

these arguments which the hon. Member for Tanglin has

put  up  have already been put up to the Ministry  by

the  Chairman  of  the  Nature  Reserve  Board,  with

supporting evidence as put forward by the Member from

the  various  other  professors and  people  of  high

academic   qualifications,   and   they   have   been

considered by the Ministry. The Ministry feels  that,

as far as fisheries is concerned, it is its Fisheries

Officer who is best qualified to speak on the subject

and  who should know his job. If the House feels that

the  opinion of the Fisheries Officer is wrong,  then

the House can vote against the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, the Member for Tanglin ended his

long  academic speech with the remark that he  paused

to  wonder why the Minister was so keen to press this

issue.  Sir,  I  can  assure the House  there  is  no

sinister motive behind my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2881</b></font><br><br>



pressure to get this motion passed. It is the job  of

the  Minister for Commerce and Industry, besides  his

various  other jobs of expanding industry,  commerce,

agriculture, veterinary services, keeping an  eye  on

the  foreign  exchange and what not,  to  expand  the

economy of the country, and if he does not carry  out

that job, then he is not an efficient Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was not so very long ago that the hon.

Member  for  Tanglin,  speaking  in  the  debate   in

Committee stage on the Appropriation Bill last  year,

made this remark:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I have no doubt that, through more research, it

should  be  possible to increase the yield of  prawns

per acre; thus increasing the return to the fishermen

and, at the same time, reducing the market price."



<br><br>And, Sir, he went on to advocate that there should be

more prawn ponds and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the hon. Member for Serangoon, the leader

of the Liberal-Socialist Party, had this to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Land must be granted by the Land Office and then

sanctioned  for fishing by the Fisheries  Department.

As  far  as I know, a great deal of our marshland  is

still not being made use of, and most of such land is

being given under Temporary Occupation Licences..." .



<br><br>Then he went on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the marshland is brackish in nature, very

little will grow there except mangroves, and I  think

that   the  department  concerned  should  reconsider

granting  such land for purposes of fishing  as  this

has  been  considered as most important  by  so  many

Members."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, like a true democratic Minister I took

heed  of what the Opposition Members remarked  and  I

governed  myself accordingly and tried to  find  land

for  the purpose of growing more food. And now  I  am

under  censure for trying to carry out what they  had

in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back, Sir, to the first argument of the

Member for Tanglin that it is against the very nature

of  the  Nature  Reserves Ordinance to  move  such  a

motion,  it  is remarked that the words  "dedicated",

"set  aside and reserved for purposes of propagation,

protection . . .". etc, have been used in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2882</b></font><br><br>



section 3 (1). But I hasten to point out that  it  is

not dedicated in perpetuity. There is also provision,

Sir, in the same Ordinance; under section 4 (1), "the

Legislative  Assembly  may by  resolution  amend  the

Schedule to this Ordinance by either the addition  to

or deletion from the said Schedule of any area or may

make any modification" and so on. That shows that the

intention  was not that this area should be  a  final

dedication  in  perpetuity, but that  this  area  was

reserved and that the Assembly, which is the  highest

authority in this country, should have the  power  to

make  any  amendments to it if it  wished.  Evidently

what  was  in mind is that circumstances  may  change

when  we  cannot  afford the luxury  of  having  such

reserves.   And  in  accordance  with  the  machinery

provided  by the Ordinance, I am bringing the  matter

up to this House for the decision of hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, talking of experts; you always have two

opinions  on  any  subject.  You  have  the  Liberal-Socialist  opinion, you have the P.A.P. opinion,  and

you  have the Labour Front opinion which in this case

is  coincidental  with  the P.A.P.'s.  You  have  the

opinion  of  one  expert, you  have  the  opinion  of

another,  but  somebody has got to  decide  which  to

follow,   and   that  somebody,  according   to   the

democratic  set  up,  is  the  layman,  because   the

Ministers  are not experts in the field. You  do  not

have a doctor as a Minister for Health. Therefore  it

is  the  layman who decides. He does not decide  only

from one angle, and that is the technical angle,  but

he  decides from the common man's angle, and that is:

what is most important and good for the country.  And

basing my decision on that, I - being in the position

to  make the decision - now have brought it up to the

House  because  I feel that it is important  that  as

much  area as possible is opened up to the people  of

Singapore  for food production. It is  now  a  matter

that  rests  with this House, for Members to  decide,

and  all  Members in this House are  laymen  in  this

respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, a lot has been said about the Nature

Reserve Board saying this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2883</b></font><br><br>



and  the Nature Reserve Board saying that. The Nature

Reserve  Board is not an expert body. Except for  one

or two persons on the Board, and that is the Director

of  Botanic  Gardens and the Professor of  Botany  (I

think) of the University, the rest of the members  of

the  Nature  Reserve Board are laymen. And  therefore

when  the  hon. Member says the Nature Reserve  Board

says  this, what he really means is what the Chairman

of  the  Nature Reserve Board says. The rest  of  the

members  are laymen, just like you and me,  and  they

cannot express a technical opinion on the subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a pity that Sir Stamford Raffles, when he

founded Singapore, did not see the paramount need  of

preserving the flora and the fauna of the island  but

opened  up the island to commerce. If he had seen  it

he  would  probably have kept the whole island  as  a

nature  reserve, in which case of course  the  Member

for  Tanglin  and his colleagues would  not  be  here

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin also said, 'Don't you want to

preserve this Reserve for our University students  to

study   and  produce  Directors  of  Raffles  Museum.

Professors  of  Biology,  and  Directors  of  Botanic

Gardens,  and Fisheries Officers, and so  on?'  These

nature reserves have existed since the time Singapore

came  into  being.  Whether they  were  dedicated  by

Ordinance or not, they were there. How many Directors

of   Botanic  Gardens  have  we  produced?  How  many

Directors of Raffles Museum have we produced from our

local boys? None. Why not? Luckily today we have one,

a  local  officer,  who  is Chief  Fisheries  Officer

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got to take the advice of my expert, and

that  is  the  Chief Fisheries Officer,  on  subjects

connected  with fisheries and prawns, as against  the

advice of the Nature Reserve Board. But this I  think

will  help to convince hon. Members that not all  the

arguments   put   up  are  absolutely   correct   and

unchallenged. Here is a letter from the  Director  of

Fisheries, Malaya, in which he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have spoken with Messrs. G. C. Maddock, F. G. H.

Allen and Dr B. D. Molesworth about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2884</b></font><br><br>



the  birds, and they say there is no rare species  at

all  there. One species of pittu has nested there and

that is the only place on Singapore Island from which

it  is recorded . . . I also understand there are  no

rare   botanical  specimens.  It  has   no   specific

attributes and is in no way unique..."-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speaking of this Ulu Pandan Reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir - and this is the expert opinion

expressed by the Fisheries Officer:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prawns which are of commercial value found in

the  Ulu  Pandan  prawn ponds belong  to  the  family

Peneids  and  are known as Peneids to scientists.  No

conclusive  research work on the breeding of  Peneids

in  Malayan waters has been carried out. The  present

state of knowledge based on the research work done in

the  United States of America and elsewhere  on  this

group of prawns indicates that they breed fairly  far

out  to sea in clear water. A review of this work  by

three  U.S.A. experts  on  prawns,  namely,  W.   N.

Anderson, J. E. King and M. J. Linder, may  be  found

in the Biological Bulletin of 1949, and this work has

been  accepted by biologists all over  the  world  as

accurately representing the position, so that we  may

until   such  time  as  proof  to  the  contrary   is

available, assume that our Peneid prawns spawn fairly

far  out  to  sea  and that their larval  stages  are

brought  into  the  ponds by the tide  from  spawning

grounds  which may be ten miles or more from the  Ulu

Pandan area. These larval stages then grow up in  the

ponds until they are large enough to spawn. They then

migrate  back to the sea. It is during this migration

that the prawns are caught by the filter nets of  the

prawn pond operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a sufficient number of prawns will always go out

to  sea  for breeding, and the prawn ponds can  never

catch the whole lot that is growing up in the inshore

waters, and that is the reply to the argument of  the

hon. Member for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he (the Member for Tanglin) has quoted an

expert  who  actually  is a carsinologist.  The  term

denotes  a person who is expert in the classification

of  crustaceans, which includes crabs, prawns  and  a

host  of  other  shrimp-like animals, into  families,

genera   and  species.  A  carsinologist   need   not

necessarily   be   an  expert  on  the   biology   of

crustaceans   such  as  prawns.  Sir,   indeed   many

carsinologists  are not biologists  in  the  accepted

sense   of  the  word  and  therefore  do  not   know

sufficient of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2885</b></font><br><br>



the  biology  of prawns or crabs to  offer  expert

opinion   on   whether  or   not   the   continued

productivity of the Ulu Pandan prawn ponds depends

on the utilisation of this Nature Reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there you have an expert speaking out his

mind.  I do not know whether hon. Members wish  to

accept it or not but the fact is that cutting down

these  800  acres  is  not  going  to  affect  the

breeding of the prawns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a lot of other arguments, Sir, on points

which  I  could  answer but I think  the  time  is

running short. There is one other thing, Sir;  the

important  question  of Malay fishermen  has  been

raised  and  I assured the House earlier  that  we

would try to form them into a co-operative so that

they  will not be the losers because of this,  and

we  will guarantee them a quarter of the area,  to

be  run by the co-operative. Now let me give  some

figures   on   the   economics   of   pond   prawn

cultivation.  Supposing there are  200  Malays  in

this  area now and their catch value is an average

of  $5  per  day  per family, their cash  earnings

probably  come  to only about $1,000  a  month  or

$12,000  a year because not all sell their  catch.

If  you  have 200 acres, at the Fisheries rate  of

production,  that is 5 piculs and 70  katties  per

year  per acre, you get $114,000 per year  if  you

sell  your prawns at $1 a katty. So now  you  have 200 Malays earning about $12,000 a year; if  they

co-operate  and join this scheme, and develop  200

acres, they could stand to gain $114,000 per  year

if  the  production is at the maximum rate of  the

Fisheries Department. But if the production is  at

the minimum rate, as alleged by the Nature Reserve

Board,  and that is 200 katties per year, even  at

that rate, they could still get $40,000 a year. So

they will not be the losers by this. And of course

you  get a vast increase in the quantity of prawns

in  our  markets,  and  that  means  a  relief  to

housewives, who could get their prawns cheaper and

more readily whenever they want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other mangroves, wherever it is possible

Government has encouraged prawn ponds. Only in the

Straits of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2886</b></font><br><br>



Johore  does Government not allow prawn  ponds  at

the   moment  because  of  the  curfew   and   the

restriction on fishermen to fish there  at  night.

If  later on these curfew restrictions are lifted,

then  of  course  Government will  look  into  the

matter and probably allow them to have prawn ponds

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally I want the House to consider this

aspect. Does it wish to preserve the flora and the

fauna - maybe thousands of centipedes and snakes and

ferns  and  stunted  dwarf  trees  that  grow   in

mangrove swamps such as this one - or does  it  wish

to preserve the human species?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1)

of  section  4  of the Nature Reserves  Ordinance

(Chapter 235), resolves that paragraph 5  of  the

Schedule  to the aforesaid Ordinance  be  deleted

and the following substituted there-for:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All those pieces of land situate in Mukim No. V

Pandan  and Mukim No. VI Peng Kang, in the Island

of  Singapore,  known as Pandan  Forest  Reserve,

comprised  in  parts of lots 136-15  and  136-17,

Mukim  No.  V, Pandan, and in part of  lot  94-13

Mukim  No.  VI,  Peng  Kang,  and  estimated   to

contain  approximate areas of 236 a. O r.  0  p.,90   a.  O  r.  O  p, and  45  a.  O  r.  O   p.

respectively,  the boundaries of which  are  more

particularly   delineated  and   edged   red   on

Certified  Plan No. 7499 filed in the  office  of

the Chief Surveyor, Singapore.".

<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>PARTY POLITICAL BROADCAST AND THE CITY COUNCIL ELECTIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> ir, when I

sought  the  right  to speak on  this  adjournment

motion, I thought it would not really be necessary

to  argue  the case for radio time to be given  to

political Parties to put over their programmes for

the City Council elections. It seemed so eminently

reasonable, and so eminently correct,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2887</b></font><br><br>



that  I  did  not put it down in the  form  of  a

motion.  However, I was wrong. I understand  that

the   Government  is  not  very  keen  on  having

political Parties speaking over the radio. I have

therefore today tabled a motion on which  a  vote

will be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see any reason why we should be afraid

to use this very powerful weapon of disseminating

information  in  a  very  peaceful  and   orderly

manner,  and why this channel should not be  open

to  political Parties. I have been brought up  to

believe that the theory of the democratic  system

is  that  competing political  Parties  put  over

their   views   and  their  programmes   to   the

electorate,  and every member of that  electorate

is  given  an  opportunity - by  secret  ballot  to

indicate his choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways of putting over one's

programme        and       one's        political

philosophy-newspapers owned by  big  combines  or

wealthy proprietors, mass meetings-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I just want to clarify a

point which the hon. Member mentioned. Did I hear

him correctly when he said he had tabled a motion

on which he expects a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I have taken steps to see

that  if  the rejoinder of the Government  to  my

proposal  of political Party broadcasts for  City

Council elections is adverse, then a motion  will

be   tabled  for  debate.  If  my  suggestion  is

favourably received, then I see no reason why  we

should  waste  the time of the House  by  further

debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No notice has been given?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, Sir. Sir, there are many

ways  of  putting over one's political points  of

view.   We  depend  upon  the  courtesy  of   the

newspapers,  and  some  of  them  are  not   very

courteous. They go of their way not to  tell  the

public  that you are holding an election  meeting

because they do not happen to like your political

Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2888</b></font><br><br>



They black out one party's meeting, they boost up

another's.  When one party has a big  crowd  they

say it has a small gathering. If the Parties they

favour  have  a small crowd they do  not  show  a

picture  of the crowd. There are many other  ways

of manipulating propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one medium which cannot be

manipulated.  If  you  allocate  to  each  Party,

according  to the number of candidates contesting

the  elections  a certain period of  radio  time,

there  can  be  no distortion, there  can  be  no

danger of rioting. It is the most reasonable form

of putting forward one's point of view. There can

be  no danger of being booed either. So I do  not

see any reason why anybody should be afraid to go

before the microphone to put his party's point of

view across.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as I have said, it is so eminently

just  that  I see no purpose being served  by  my

bringing up argument after argument, and I  would

like  to  know from the Government what  are  its

reasons  against  giving  political  Parties  the

opportunity to use this medium which is owned  by

the  Government. It could be done  fairly.  There

are  certain rules of the game which we  observed

in  the last general elections. I remember in the

old  days  when elections were not very  popular,

because  they were not based on a wide franchise,

every  piddling little City Council election  was

allowed   radio  time.  And  now,  at  the   most

important election for the City of Singapore, for

the  administration  of the City  Council  for  4

years, we are to be denied radio time.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It being four o'clock, the Motion for the

Adjournment   of  the  Assembly  lapsed   without

Question put.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2889</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PARTY POLITICAL BROADCAST AND THE CITY COUNCIL ELECTIONS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There is just one argument

which  I  have  heard, an aside during  the  idle

conversation that sometimes goes on outside  this

Chamber. It is that Radio Malaya is not owned  by

Singapore  alone and therefore if the  Federation

does  not have election broadcasts for their Town

Council elections, we should not set a precedent.

Sir,  I  see  no merit in that argument  at  all.

There  is a medium wavelength for Singapore which

need  not be re-broadcast either in Penang, Kuala

Lumpur  or Malacca. If we are afraid to  put  our

political Parties and their programmes over Radio

Malaya then our democratic system will perish.









<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, the accepted policy now

both  in the Federation and Singapore is that  no

radio time should be allocated to political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2890</b></font><br><br>



Parties  for broadcasting for any election  other

than  the  general elections to  the  Legislative

Assemblies.  Sir,  we all appreciate  that  Radio

Malaya  provides a pan-Malayan service common  to

Singapore  and  the Federation,  and  this  is  a

matter  which  will have to be  referred  to  the

Federation. Action is being taken to consult  the

Federation Government as to what their views are,

and  all the points raised by the hon. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar will be duly considered  before  a

final decision is taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Are you in favour? Or are you

scared?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We are scared.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
