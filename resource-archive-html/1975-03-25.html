<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead

AAA 1004*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Teong Eng Siong).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Sir, I would like to refer the policy

with regard to the manpower position in the Police

Force.  The  Minister, in a written  answer  to  a

question  I  raised recently, stated that  the  Pc

Force  as  a whole had a vacancy of 15%.  Has  the

Minister  any  measure  in mind  to  resolve  this

unhappy   manpower  position,  which  may  have  a

critical  relationship  to the  effectiveness  the

Force?  I  have also a suspicion that  recruitment

requirements may not realistic, and also that  the

promotion  structure in the  rank  and  file  does

encourage  a sense of motivation. Moreover,  where

officers are concerned there is some feeling  that

sufficient  credit not given to field achievement,

while  too  much  attention is  paid  to  academic

qualifications. I would urge the Minister to  give

some clarification regarding policy over manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been some reference to the calling

up  of  young  men  into  Police  Force.  In  this

respect,  I  think atmosphere should  be  cleared,

other's   there  will  continue  to   be   certain

apprehensions.  I am sure the Minister's  positive

reply will do much to add to morale in the Force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, und ably better relations have

been  established  between  the  Police  and  the

people  in  the  past year. This  is  because  of

efforts of the Ministry of Home All in many ways,

for  instance,  the holding of the Annual  Police

Week  and  opening of police stations  to  enable

members  of the public to see for themselves  how

the  Police  work.  This should  go  a  long  way

towards  promoting  operation  and  understanding

between the people and the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are complaints of courtesy and

haughtiness  among Pc officers. Taxi drivers  have

complained  that certain policemen in patrol  cars

across  their taxis. Sir, this practice not  good.

There  is  a speed limit many areas and  a  police

officer   should  know  how  to   abide   by   the

regulations He drives faster than the speed limit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



in order to catch up with a taxi driver only to

threaten the taxi driver with the attitude "Do you

know who I am?" This is very undesirable. I hope

the Minister will take note of this incorrect

attitude of the Police officers and take necessary

measures to rectify it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is another matter regarding the shortage of

policemen. In one of my Meet-the-People sessions,

a female resident in my constituency came to see

me. She told me that her husband had gone amok and

wanted to beat the children. Her husband had been

treated at the Woodbridge Hospital on a few

occasions previously but was released only

recently. She, therefore, asked me to help her by

giving this matter urgent attention in order to

avoid any accidents. I telephoned the Chong Pang

Police Station and the officer who received the

call replied, "Sorry, Sir. At the moment there is

only one policeman here. We cannot help you." I

asked whether he could send a patrol car to the

complainant's home to help her out. The reply was

that she had to wait for some time. This shows

that there is an acute shortage of police

personnel in that area. I remember that a few

years ago therewas the Lee Soo Ann Committee

Report on the salaries of the Police rank and

file. I understand certain recommendations in this

Report had been implemented. However, up till now

certain posts in the Police Force have still not

been filled. Why is this so? I would like to ask

the Minister what

remedial measures he intends to take. In the

President's speech it was mentioned that full-time

national service would be introduced for the

Police Force in order to relieve the manpower

shortage in the Police rank and file. I would like

to ask when will this proposal be implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question regarding the ranks in

the Police Force. I understand the authorities

concerned have set up a committee to look into the

structure of the ranks of Inspectors and to make

recommendations. However, after a considerable

lapse of time, there has been no follow-up of that

review.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



I  would  like to ask the Minister when  will  the

recommendations  of the committee be  implemented.

Why  have they not been put into effect?  I  would

like  to know the reasons. Several posts have also

not  been filled up till now. I would like to  ask

why  these  posts are still vacant. Is it  because

the pay is so low that people do not like to apply

for these posts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be given permission to

speak  on  this  head, although I have  indicated

that   I  would  not  be  moving  the  last   two

amendments* standing in my name?



<hr size="2" noshade>

*The amendments read as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) That the total sum to be allocated be reduced

by $100.for Head U in respect of the Main

Estimates

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) That the total sum to be allocated for Head U

in respect of the Development Estimates be reduced

by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I wholly agree with the sentiments expressed

by  both the Member for Katong and the Member  for

Sembawang.  But I would also like to add  what  my

two  Friends have said with regard to  the  Police

Force. First of all, I welcome the introduction of

full-time national service in the Police Force.  I

am  sure  this  will inject more  numbers  to  the

Police  Force,  as it is now trying  its  best  to

recruit more personnel to the various echelons  of

the Police service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Sembawang mentioned about

the   activities  during  Police  Week  in   which

exhibitions and shows about Police work  are  held

in  many parts of Singapore. I would like  to  ask

the  Minister for Health and Home Affairs  whether

he  has  taken  note  of  the  extent  of  success

achieved as a result of the Police Week campaigns.

In  this  connection, I would also  like  to  know

whether an assessment of the results has been made

and  whether steps can be taken to give the Police

Force  a  better image. I am not saying  that  the

Police  Force is not enjoying a good  image.  They

do; but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



as  is  always  the case with a large organisation

the  presence of a small number of black sheep  in

our  Police  Force  can mar its  good  reputation.

However,  the House has been assured by  the  Hon.

Minister that the black sheep will be weeded out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that the President's Address and its

Addendum lay stress that Singapore will be made  a

place  in which people can live in peace.  It  has

also  been  pointed out that four police  stations

will  be  built  in various housing  estates,  for

instance, in Toa Payoh.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the idea of setting up more police

stations.  But  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Hon.

Minister  to  look  into this  matter  in  greater

depth.  To  the  best of my knowledge,  there  are

insufficient  police  stations  in   the   housing

estates. Therefore, when Housing Board estates are

being   built,  there  should  be  a  coordinating

committee  to look into the question of  providing

facilities  such  as  police  stations,  so   that

whenever members of the public have any complaints

to  make,  say,  a case of theft or robbery,  they

will not be too inconvenienced by having to travel

great  distances. In other words, a police station

should  be  at the doorstep of the high-rise  flat

dwellers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress this point because

thousands  of Housing Board flats are being  built

every year, and they will accommodate about 70% of

the  population  by  1980. When  the  Housing  and

Development  Board was first set up in  1960,  its

object  was  to provide low-cost housing  for  the

people.  The  question  of  policing  the  housing

estates,   in  all  probability,  had   not   been

considered and this has resulted in the  sad  fact

that  today the Home Affairs Ministry has  thought

it  fit  and proper to build more police stations.

Sir,  I  would  like to add that  building  police

stations is one thing,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



getting   the  right  material  in  relation   the

manpower  is another. As I have said, the recruitment

of  police personal as well as enlisting full-time

national servicemen into the police force is  most

welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to make the point with regard

to  cases  of brutality on part of the  police.  I

think if the Minister hears of this case again, he

will "Please give me details, etc." But I making a

general statement, because have come across a  few

cases  my where some of my constituents have  been

arrested and kept in the police lock-up for  quite

some  time.  As  I  know it, the  police  has  the

authority to detain any person suspected of having

committed  a crime for a period of not  more  than

two  weeks.  I would like to s the Hon. Minister's

assurance  that  so-called  black  sheep  will  be

weeded  and that law enforcement will be  can  out

fairly, firmly and also impartially



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the forms punishment, I am

happy  to  note I the police force  will  be  very

active bringing all criminals to book. I book that

in  the course of such duties they would press for

deterrent  terms punishment so that Singapore,  as

been stated in the Presidential Address will be  a

place  in  which  the people  live  in  peace  and

harmony.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I also have amendment and I

would like to take this opportunity to speak.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps you better wait. The Minister would like

answer the Members who have spoken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, may I deal first with the clarification asked for by

the  Member  for Katong with regard to the  problem  of

manpower  in the  police force. This point  has  also been

raised  by the Members for Sembawang and  Punggol.

We  in  the  Minister of Home  Affairs  view  this

problem   manpower  in  the  police   force   very

seriously because there is a serious shortage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



of manpower among junior officers, to the tune

of  about  15%. As at 1st March, 1975, there  were

4,406   police  constables  and  women  constables

against an authorised establishment of 5,107.



<br><br>Of  course,  the  manpower  problem  is  not  a

problem  peculiar to the police force  alone.  The

manpower  problem has been created as a result  of

our sustained

economic growth in the last decade resulting in  a

tight  labour  market in Singapore. Therefore,  as

far  as the Ministry of Home Affairs is concerned,

We  looking  at  this problem, we  feel  that  the

logical means of overcoming this manpower shortage

is  to develop new work methods which will utilise

the  limited manpower available to the police more

efficiently. Therefore, a committee to review  the

manpower problem in the police force was appointed

in  January this year. The committee is headed  by

an  Assistant Commissioner of Police and  consists

of  members which include one school principal,  a

representative from the Public Service Commission,

a representative from the Ministry of Finance and,

of  course, a representative from the Ministry  of

Home Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of reference for this committee are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to consider the requirements of the police

force for junior officers in relation to the crime

rate, population growth and changing political,

economic and social conditions of Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to recommend ways in which the manpower

requirements of the police force can be met having

regard  to  the  general  labour  shortage  in Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to recommend measures which will alleviate

the manpower problem and contribute to greater

efficiency  of  the  police  force,  such   as

rationalisation and civilianisation of certain

police duties, mechanisation and computerisation,

and greater use of women police officers; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) having regard to (1), (2), and (3)

aforementioned, to examine whether  present  terms

and  conditions of service for junior officers are

adequate  to  attract and retain officers  of  the

right quality.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



This  fourth term of reference will mean reviewing

the  effectiveness of the Lee Soo Ann  Committee's

recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the question of enlisting full-time national servicemen to meet the problem of

manpower  shortage  in the  police  force.  I  say

straightaway that this will only meet the shortage

to  some  extent, and we hope the  committee  will

find the full answer to the manpower shortage as a

whole.   As   regards   the   full-time   national

servicemen in the police force, our view  is  that

this  will only solve part of the problem  because

full-time national servicemen will be doing  full-time police duties for only two years. After that,

they go into the reserve service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go into details as to how they

will  be  used because the details are  now  being

worked out. With regard to the operational date of

the  full-time national servicemen scheme, it will

operate as soon as possible because facilities are

now  being prepared in our training school to take

in   the   first   batch  of  full-time   national

servicemen in the police force. They will be given

12  weeks, or three months' training, before  they

are given police duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now turn to the Member for Sembawang

who complained about discourtesy and arrogance  on

the   part  of  the  police  force  and  also  the

complaint  of the Member for Punggol on the  abuse

of  power  and brutality? In 1974, a total  of  65

complaints  were received from the public  against

police  officers  for  rudeness,  discourtesy  and

abuse  of power. Four of the complaints are  still

under   investigation.   Of   the   remaining   61

complaints,  only  10  cases  were  substantiated.

These 10 were cases of minor infringements and the

officers    concerned   were   reprimanded.    Our

experience  has  been that most of the  complaints

were  unfounded  and a number  were  malicious  or

exaggerated.  But  I would like to  reassure  hon.

Members  that  every complaint  received,  whether

from a Member of Parliament or from any member  of

the  public  against  any members  of  the  police

force, is fully investigated and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



if  the complaint is substantiated action is taken

against  the  offender, whether the  complaint  is

against discourtesy, arrogance, abuse of power  or

brutality. I have often repeated this and I  shall

repeat again that abuse of power and brutality  in

the  police force will not be tolerated.  However,

in a large organisation as the Police Force - this

was  also stated by the Member for Punggol  -there

will always be a few black sheep to mar its name.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to action against the black sheep,

may  I  just give a few figures. First of  all,  I

would  like to assure the Member for Punggol  that

the  Police Force has no hesitation in weeding out

the  black sheep if the offences committed warrant

dismissal.  In  1974, 35 officers comprising  four

Inspectors, one Station Inspector, four  Sergeants

and  26 Police Constables were dismissed from  the

Force  for  corruption  and  serious  breaches  of

discipline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for

Punggol  that  these cases should  be  dealt  with

impartially  and fairly, may I draw the  attention

of  hon. Members that sometime last year I had the

Police  Force  Act  amended in this  Chamber.  The

amendment  to  the Police Force  Act  enables  the

Commissioner of Police to refer disciplinary cases

against  junior  officers  or  inspectors  to  the

Public  Service Commission. This ensures impartial

investigation  against police officers.  Prior  to

that,   offences  committed  by  those  ranks   of

officers  were  dealt  with by  the  Police  Force

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to police/public relationship, the

Police  Weeks  and the campaigns  that  have  been

held, the Member for Punggol asked me what was the

effect  of  these campaigns. May 1  say  that  the

results   were  quite  encouraging   because   the

attendances in all the campaigns, Open Houses  and

other  programmes  organised by the  Police  Force

were good. But the fostering of good police/public

relations  will  take some time  to  nurture,  and

cannot   be   achieved  by  only   one   campaign.

Therefore,  we  will  continue  this  campaign  of

fostering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



good  relations between the public and the  Police

Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the campaign which was held recently, special

instructions  were  given to the officer-in-charge

of  the  various Land Divisions to  foster  closer

working relationship between him and the MP of his

Division, as well as the Chairman of the Citizens'

Consultative  Committees. It will take  some  time

for    them   to   establish   a   close   working

relationship, but I am informed that in  a  number

of  constituencies  some  happy  relationship  has

already  been forged for the common  good  in  the

fight against crime. Again I must say that it will

take some time for it to develop, but a start  has

already been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wanted to know about the

vacancies of inspectors. He is worried that  there

are  not  enough  inspectors. As I  say,  our  big

concern  is the junior ranks. Anyway, may  I  just

give  him some figures of inspectors. In 1974,  37

Police  Inspectors were recruited against a  total

vacancy of 69. That is by direct recruitment,  but

it  does  not mean that these posts of  Inspectors

should  be  filled by direct recruitment.  Usually

half  of  them  are  filled by direct  recruitment

because  some posts must be reserved for promotion

of sergeants as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg your indulgence. The Minister has not

replied to my question of police stations  in  the

Housing Board estates. This is an important  point

and  it  has  been  mentioned before  in  previous

debates - the Member for Toa Payoh can bear me out

that  Toa  Payoh  at one time  was  known  as  the

Chicago of Singapore. So I hope the Minister  will

reply on this point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I do not think that the crime rate in

Housing Board estates can be brought down just  by

having  a police station in every housing  estate.

If  we  are  to  have a police  station  in  every

housing estate that would mean mobilising a lot of

police  manpower. This is a problem that  we  have

given thought to very deeply. We cannot afford  to

pin  down heavy manpower resources by building too

many police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



stations.  What  we  are doing  now  is  to  build

Divisional Police Headquarters at strategic  sites

and  from  these Divisions we will be  introducing

team policing. Patrol cars will be doing a 24-hour

patrol  duty within that division and  the  patrol

cars  should  also cover Housing  and  Development

Board  estates.  It is better  to  have  a  mobile

patrol  moving around rather than be static  in  a

place,  because that would be tying down manpower.

At  the moment we are having team policing in  two

Police Divisions, that is Orchard Division and the

Central  Division. Since the introduction of  team

policing,  figures have shown that the crime  rate

in  these two Divisions has gone down by  30%.  We

now  have plans to introduce team policing in  the

other six Police Divisions by October this year. I

hope that the crime rate would go down accordingly

in these other six Police Divisions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members on this side of the House have

already raised several questions in respect of the

Police Force, and I would like to air my views  in

this  regard. The Minister said just now that  the

Police  Force will be enlisting full-time national

servicemen for police duty. I endorse this move to

be taken by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the moment there are part-time national

servicemen  in  the  Police Force,  that  is,  the

Special Constabulary. I think care should be taken

of these people. According to my understanding the

morale  of  the Special Constabulary men  is  very

low.   Many  highly  educated  part-time  national

servicemen  have  been posted to do  watch-dog  or

jaga  duties, or even office-boy duties. Naturally

these  people are frustrated. As a result of  this

frustration their morale is very low. I have  also

heard of more interesting episodes. One is that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



Police officer told the Special Constables in  his

charge to issue three summonses a day after  which

they  could  go home to sleep. If there  are  such

cases,  I  think we have to stop them.  We  should

think  of  ways and means to remedy the  situation

and raise the morale of the Special Constables who

are  part-time national servicemen.  They  form  a

vital link, if I may say so, in the Police Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also said that he will continue to

hold   Police   Weeks  to  further  promote   good

police/public relationship. I say  that  it  is  a

good  idea  to  continue  with  the  Police  Week.

However, we should not forget that when we ask the

people  to  cooperate with the police,  we  should

also  ask the police to cooperate with the people.

We  have received many complaints from members  of

the public, as what other MPs have also said here,

that  there are many complaints about the rudeness

and  discourtesy  on the part of the  police,  for

instance, inconveniencing the witnesses by  asking

them  to  turn  up at the police station  to  give

statements. Why cannot the police inspector go  to

a place convenient to the witness to take down his

statement?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Gambling Suppression Branch sometimes

receives information from the public that such and

such  a  person  is running a gambling  den.  When

information  of  this  nature  is  received,   the

Gambling  Suppression Branch should  take  a  very

cautious  attitude  in  its investigations  before

taking  any action. In my constituency  there  had

been  some  unpleasant incidents  arising  out  of

action  taken  by  the Police on such  information

received.   Police  officers  from  the   Gambling

Suppression    Branch,   without   checking    the

reliability  or unreliability of the  information,

came  all  the way to my constituency  to  conduct

raids and searches in the homes of people who  had

participated  in  community work. These  residents

have  a very high public standing and are unlikely

to   be   bookies   or  gambling  den   operators.

Therefore, I would ask the Minister to direct  the

Gambling  Suppression Branch to be  more  cautious

before acting on informa



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



tion   received,  because  the  information   they

receive   can   turn  out  to  be  unreliable   or

malicious.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has also told this House that

on  receipt  of complaints against the Police  for

brutality,  discourtesy,  etc, investigation   is

always  made  and very often such complaints  were

found to be unsubstantiated. I wonder who are  the

people  responsible for the investigation of  such

complaints.  If  we ask a police officer  to  look

into  a  complaint against another police officer,

we  would  not get any favourable results  as  the

officer  would tend to cover up the other officer.

To  ensure  that  such complaints are  impartially

investigated  into, they should  be  conducted  by

independent  people  who are not  police  officers

themselves.  I think if this course of  action  is

taken, we will find that many such complaints  are

well-founded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to remind the Minister

of the shortage of police personnel in Jurong Town

which is the largest industrial town in Singapore.

In this industrial town there is only a very small

police  post. I was informed at any one time  that

the  number  of police officers on duty  does  not

exceed three. I do not know whether it is true  or

not. Also there are only two police patrol cars in

this  police  post, one of which is out  of  order

every  other day. For a big industrial  town  like

Jurong, it is inadequate to have only such a small

police post. As a result, there are so many  cases

of  robbery and housebreaking and other crimes  in

Jurong.

I  would like to ask the Minister whether  he  has

any plan in mind to improve the security in Jurong

Town.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, may I say that this particular subhead

relates  to  the Permanent Secretary. I  have  not

heard  you  mentioning a word about the  Permanent

Secretary so far.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I think the Permanent Secretary is the head

of    the    department   responsible   for    the

administration of the whole Ministry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every time a complaint is made

against  the  Police department, we can  expect  a

stock  answer, "Of course, in any organisation  we

have  the black sheep." These are the exact  words

which  the  Minister gave me last year.  We  heard

this  answer last year and we hear it  again  this

year.   Judging  by  the  increasing   number   of

complaints  from this side of the  Chamber,  I  am

beginning  to feel that the number of black  sheep

has  increased.  If  that is the  case,  something

positive  should  be  done about  it  rather  than

saying that it is a question of black sheep in any

organisation.  I  do  not think  that  is  a  very

satisfactory answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly support the suggestion of the Member

for  Jurong  that  a  more independent  system  of

investigation should be set up. The mere fact that

investigation is left to the colleagues within the

Police Force, one could expect, as pointed out,  a

situation  of kuan kuan sian hu, which means  they

will  take care of their own interest for  obvious

reasons.  Another answer which has been  given  so

very   often   is   that  the  Police   Force   is

shorthanded.  If the Police Force is  shorthanded,

something  should be done very quickly.  Otherwise

by  publicly  making such statement and  admitting

the  shortcomings of the Police Force, we are only

extending an invitation to the criminals  to  step

up their activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effectiveness of the Lee Soo Ann Report and

what  should be done to remedy the position should

be  looked into very quickly. This has dragged  on

long  enough,  and  I  would  like  to  refer  the

Honourable Minister to his reply to me  last  year

when we were debating on the same department. Most

of the complaints are again heard here today. I am

sure  most of my colleagues agree with me that  we

are  beginning to feel a little tired coming  here

and playing the same old record. It is not that we

like  to  hear our own voice or that we are  over-imaginative.  It cannot be due to over-imagination

that  we are taking up all these complaints. There

must be some foundation in the complaints to cause

its num



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



ber  to increase. Why? Certainly there must  be  a

good reason.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu said

that a stock answer has been given. Whatever the

Member calls it, that is the answer because black

sheep are always present in any organisation. If

no action has been taken, then of course there is

justification to complain. I have stated

categorically that action against black sheep has

been taken. It is not that action has not been

taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I repeat for the information of the Member

how  many black sheep have been dismissed from the

Police  Force. It is not that I want to  play  the

record  again, but the point is that it seems  the

message  has  not been put across effectively.  At

the  risk  of being repetitious, may I  again  say

what action has been taken against black sheep? In

1974, 35 officers comprising four Inspectors,  one

Station  Inspector, four Sergeants and  26  Police

Constables  have  been  dismissed.  Is  that   not

action?  Do we want to sack more? They should  not

be  sacked  until  they have  been  given  a  fair

hearing under a disciplinary board. It is not that

action has not been taken. Action has been taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the allegation that police officers will

protect  their own kind, we should at  least  have

some  confidence  in the majority  of  the  Police

Force    personnel   for   their    honesty    and

impartiality. I do not think it is fair to make  a

general  allegation that police  officers  protect

their  own  kind.  May  I  say  that  justice  and

impartiality  not  only, in fact,  exist  in  such

cases  but  they have been seen to  exist.  May  I

repeat  again that action has been taken to  amend

the  Police Force Act in this House last  year  so

that   the   Commissioner  of  Police  can   refer

disciplinary  cases  against  junior  officers  or

inspectors to the Public Service Commission. Where

cases   are   referred  to  the   Public   Service

Commission,  there will be non-Police officers  on

the Board of Inquiry, and if there is a cover-up I

am  quite  sure that those who sit  on  the  Board

should be able to find out. Why should there be in

the Police Force an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



external  body  to  investigate these  complaints?

What  about  the other departments? There  is  the

Complaints   Bureau  and  they  also   investigate

complaints against police officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to manpower shortage, we are not

throwing  our arms up in despair. It is a problem,

and  it  is not that nothing has been done.  As  I

have  stated just now in answer to the Member  for

Katong,  a  Manpower Committee has been formed  to

look  into these problems and I am just as anxious

that  they  come  up  with the answers.  If  these

answers  or  recommendations  are  accepted  -  of

course,  other Ministries are also involved  -  we

can  then implement these recommendations to solve

the problem. I have said that one of the terms  of

reference would be to review the effectiveness  of

the  Lee  Soo Ann recommendations. Maybe it  could

have been done last year but as you know, it takes

some time to consider the effectiveness of the Lee

Soo  Ann  recommendations. We  have  asked  for  a

review, and it is fair to say that the Lee Soo Ann

recommendations were implemented only two or three

years   ago.  I  think  we  have  not  lost  time.

Something has been done, and I assure the  Members

for  Jalan  Kayu  and Jurong that before  we  meet

again  in  the next Budget debate something  would

have  been  done  as far as manpower  shortage  is

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the proposal to introduce full-time

national  service in the Police Force  also  means

that  something is being done. This in  itself  is

the  answer that it will partly solve the  problem

of manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allegation that the Gambling

Suppression  Branch  takes  action  without  first

checking   up,   usually  they  do   check   their

information.  In  the case mentioned  it  just  so

happened  that the raid conducted did  not  reveal

anything. I agree with the Member for Jurong  that

before  raids  are conducted they should  be  very

careful  in  processing their information.  But  I

think  this  is a professional matter.  Therefore,

the   officer-in-charge  should  know   best   how

reliable  the information is. These officers  have

always been cautioned to be very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



careful  about  information  received,  just   as

information received about complaints against  the

Police   Force   have  also   to   be   cautiously

investigated.  Some complaints are  substantiated,

and  some are not. Some human beings, as you know,

are motivated by good motives while some are not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About police stations, something is also being

done  here. Most of our police stations were built

before  World War II. Some were built even  before

World   War  I.  Besides  the  Queenstown   Police

Station,  we have not had any new police  station.

It  has been stated that four police stations will

be  built. I see the Member for Toa Payoh  sitting

there  pretty satisfied, and I hope the Toa  Payoh

Police Station will come up soon. Tenders will  be

called before the end of the year.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Jurong, I agree with the Member

for Jurong that the Police Force in Jurong Town is

highly  inadequate. At the time  of  planning  the

Police  Posts it was never envisaged  that  Jurong

would  grow  into  a  town of  80,000  or  100,000

people.  Immediate action is now  being  taken  to

remedy that situation. Jurong Town is in the Rural

West  Police  Division. The  existing  Rural  West

Divisional Headquarters stationed at Bukit Panjang

is  not  strategically situated to cater  for  the

needs of Jurong Town. It is, therefore, planned to

build a headquarters station in Jurong Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Architect of the Public Works

Department  is now making a feasibility  study  of

building  the station on a two-acre site  opposite

the   T-junction  of  Corporation  Road  and   the

proposed extended arm of Boon Lay Drive.  But,  as

an  interim  measure, the Police are  planning  to

shift  the  operational  headquarters  from  Bukit

Panjang  to  Jurong Town as soon as possible.  For

this purpose, an application has been made to  the

Government's Building Committee for permission  to

rent  part  of  the premises which belong  to  the

Jurong Town Corporation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for

answering my questions. However, he seems to  have

omitted two points. First, what measures are being

taken by his department to increase the efficiency

of  the  Police Force and raise the morale of  the

Special  Constables because some highly  qualified

people in the Constabulary have been asked  to  do

very  common  duties. The other point  relates  to

Police  Week. The Minister must not emphasise  the

need  for the people to cooperate with the Police.

It  should  be  the other way round -  the  Police

should cooperate with the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I have forgotten to

answer these questions. With regard to the Special

Constables, that situation might have occurred  in

the  past. But attempts have now been made to make

part-time   duties   in  the   Police   Force   as

interesting  as  possible  and  to  utilise  their

higher  education, which some  of  them  have,  to

advantage. For example, instead of detailing  some

dental   surgeons,  who  are  part-time   national

servicemen,  to  do  pure Police  work  which  the

Member  for Jurong referred to as watchdog duties,

they have been organised to render dental service.

In   fact,  they  are  giving  dental  service  to

families  of  the  Police Force  and  the  Special

Constables.  We  are now trying to  utilise  their

talents  as  much as possible. The  difficulty  is

that  since they are part-time national servicemen

they  are  on duty for only three hours every  ten

days.  Anyway,  every attempt  is  being  made  to

ensure   that  national  service  in  the  Special

Constabulary  is  as interesting as  possible.  In

fact,  I  am  told  that their  morale  has  risen

compared to what it was before because of the  new

attempts to make their service more interesting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to cooperation between the Police and

the public, of course, it is a two-way affair.  It

cannot  be  one-sided. As I said, the officers  in

charge  of the various Police Divisions have  been

told to work closely with Members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



Parliament  and  members  of  the  Citizens'

Consultative Committees. Maybe there has been such

cooperation in some Police Divisions  but  not  in

others.  But as we carry on with our campaigns  to

promote Police/public relationship, a good working

relationship  will be fostered in all  the  Police

Divisions.  It cannot be just a one-sided  affair.

It has to depend on both sides.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the Minister for his answers. I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1105*. (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs P. Govindaswamy, Lee Yiok Seng, Phey Yew Kok and J. F. COnceicao).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the new

Government's policy to use national servicemen  in

the  Singapore  Police Force. The men  who  combat

crime with increasing complexity and at great risk

to themselves deserve our full support and praise.

However, I would like to join my fellow colleagues

here  to  examine the real reasons for  the  acute

shortage of manpower in the rank and file  of  the

Police   Force  and  to  establish  what  remedial

measures can be taken so that we will attract  the

right  type of men for the very important task  of

maintaining law and order in our Republic. Perhaps

the need to establish a Manpower Committee so soon

after the Lee Soo Ann Report may reflect the  fact

that  the Minister is not satisfied with the terms

and  conditions given in the Lee Soo  Ann  Report.

However,  I hope that this new Manpower  Committee

will do much better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this sub-head I would like to comment on

the Ministry's traffic policy.

It  is  accepted that traffic control by both  the

Area's  Divisional Police and the  Traffic  Police

Division is essential to reduce accident rate  and

to  prevent traffic congestion. I am sure everyone

agrees that severe penalties must be meted out  to

people who persistently commit tra-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



ffic  offences  and violations. According  to  the

latest Police Department Annual Report, 1973,  the

revenue collected by the Force for the years  1972

and  1973  for  compounding traffic offences  were

$2,481,215 and $2,972,891 respectively. It  would,

therefore, appear that the Traffic Police Division

was  set  up more as a revenue-earning section  of

the  Police  Force where the silent  majority  are

those who are penalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month a member of this silent majority

dutifully pleaded guilty to a charge of beating  a

red light. It was his first offence. Excepting the

Traffic  Court, no opportunity for any explanation

was  given or any offer of composition made by the

Traffic Police. Like the majority who were unlucky

to  be  summoned  to court, he had the  impression

that  there was little use in arguing against  the

words  of the single policeman who booked  him  as

one  would  only  end up paying  a  heavier  fine.

Hence,  he  pleaded  guilty.  Imagine  his   great

surprise  when the Magistrate fined him  $600.  He

had only $200 in his pocket. The Police refused to

let  him  go  home to get the rest of  the  money.

Finally, he pleaded to be allowed to use the  only

available  telephone, that is, a public telephone.

He  called  up  his  office  colleagues  and  they

managed  to raise the rest of the money  required.

This  was personally delivered to him. What  would

have  happened if the public telephone was out  of

order?  Perhaps  he would have to wait  until  one

kind   police   officer  dared  to  exercise   his

discretion and allow him to go home to collect the

rest  of  the money, having retained his  identity

card.  In  this particular instance, his  identity

card  was  retained and yet nobody was sympathetic

towards  his  predicament. He was  simply  treated

like a criminal!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, on 23rd February I was told that in

the  Nanyang Siang Pau, it was reported that a man

was  fined  only  $250  or one  month's  jail  for

molesting a girl in a public bus. Yet, for a first

offender  for beating a red light the  penalty  is

$600 or two months' jail.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it Government's policy to raise revenue from

the   Traffic  Police  or  other  traffic  control

authority, such as the ROV irrespective of whether

the  public is going to suffer from any minor, and

sometimes   through  ignorance,  or  unintentional

infringement of the law? The interpretation of the

law  according  to  the letter  and  the  complete

unwillingness  to exercise any discretion  is  the

surest  way  of  generating discontent  among  the

public against the Police and the Government. Many

people  feel  that the mobile and  traffic  police

appear  to  have a quota of arrests to fulfil.  In

the same 1973 Police Department Annual Report,  it

was  also  reported that for the  years  1972  and

1973,  the  number of reports of traffic  offences

were 121,648 and 163,634 cases respectively. It is

little  wonder  that as the Traffic  Police  fines

increase in size the number of arrests or  traffic

offences  committed  by  the  public  appears   to

increase   proportionately.  I  would   like   the

Minister concerned to make a statement whether the

Traffic Police has, in fact, a quota of arrests to

fulfil  either for each day or each month for  the

benefit of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The answer is no.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> In fact, I was told that the Mobile Squads were

each given a quota of six arrests a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a well-known fact that Traffic Police

(both from the Traffic and various Divisions) hide

behind trees, pillars and at corners to pounce  on

motorists  who may have missed, for  example,  the

"no  turning"  road signs during certain  selected

hours. Many Members in this House will agree  that

some of these signs cannot be read until one comes

near and stop in front of them. For a motorist who

is unfamiliar with a road or area, it is sometimes

inevitable  that  turning the  corner  during  the

restricted   hours  will  happen.  Some   of   the

policemen  forget that their primary  duty  is  to

assist the public and not to simply arrest or book

them.  They should, therefore, stand in  front  of

the  signs  to guide the traffic rather than  hide

somewhere so as to be able to catch



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



motorists for committing any simple offences.  All

the strenuous efforts to project the good image of

the Police Force as a friend of the public such as

the  Police Week and so on, are nullified by these

actions of the Traffic Police. The Police who want

public  cooperation on the one  hand  seem  to  be

practising   public  persecution  of  the   silent

majority, on the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully support the Police in their job to

maintain  law and order, but I would like  to  see

positive action taken by the Ministry to minimise,

if  not  to  eliminate, punishment by the  Traffic

Police of the silent majority simply because  they

are  more manageable victims to handle than  those

who commit serious crimes.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my colleagues have raised so

many  points  that most probably I  will  have  to

repeat what they have said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, must you repeat what other

Members have said?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I will try to bring up those points which

they have not covered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many police stations in Singapore which

are  very old as they were built a long time  ago,

and  they  have not been renovated. In  fact,  the

Central  Police  Station building  is  an  ancient

building. Since there is a trend to modernise  the

Police Force, why not start building a new Central

Police Station? A new, central, modern, and up-to-date  police station will not only create a better

image  but  it  will also provide  better  working

conditions for the officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of full-time national service

for  the Police Force is an excellent idea  as  it

will  meet  the manpower shortage to some  extent.

May I ask how this is going to be implemented?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask whether the Police

Force  is  manned properly? In the last one  week,

more than a million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



dollars  worth  of  goods were  stolen  in  a  few

robberies.    Something   is   wrong    somewhere.

Obviously, the criminals know that the  Police  is

understaffed  and, therefore, they  can  get  away

with  crime. Their attitude seems to  be  that  if

they  get  caught it is just bad luck.  But  their

chances  of  getting away are good.  Probably  the

Police Force is very badly understaffed. It is  no

use  increasing the punishment for  the  criminals

because I believe the robberies will increase.  We

must try to reform the robbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is happening to the mobile squad of our

Traffic Police? My colleague has already spoken on

this  subject. A few national servicemen have been

recruited to this section. They were given  a  few

ancient  vehicles  to go around on  patrol,  which

broke  down so often. They could not do their  job

properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any plan by the Police Department to buy

more  motor cycles so that more traffic  policemen

will be available when needed at all times of  the

day?  Sometimes in congested areas we  cannot  see

any traffic constables. They have all disappeared.

Nowadays,  the only time policemen and  women  are

seen  is  often during peak-hour periods  or  when

there is a road safety campaign. That is the  time

they  come out in full force. Outside those  hours

they are very elusive. They are never seen on  the

road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic lights along the stretch of road from

Orchard Road right up to Collyer Quay are supposed

to  be synchronised. May I ask how many roads have

traffic  lights synchronised in such  a  way  that

they  ensure a smooth flow of traffic? Quite often

motorists  have  to stop at every  traffic  light,

because  they  are  not synchronised  and  thereby

traffic  jams occur, or the traffic is  unable  to

flow  easily  and smoothly. Furthermore,  to  make

matters  worse the duration of the amber light  of

many   traffic  lights  is  so  short  that   many

motorists  are  caught unawares. In certain  cases

accidents  have resulted simply because the  amber

light went off so fast that the red light seems to

be instantly on. And the green light for the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



direction is lighted at the same time. I feel that

a  few  seconds' duration should be given for  all

the  red  lights to stay on before  changing  into

green  light  for the other direction of  traffic;

and not an immediate change.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I still want to stress the point

that  we should pay attention to the rising  crime

rate  in  Housing  Board  estates.  Just  now  the

Minister in his answer mentioned several points to

the  effect that the crime rate in the HDB estates

has  decreased. But I have found out  that  it  is

because  certain crimes committed in  these  areas

were not reported to the Police. That accounts for

the  decrease. Perhaps it is due to  the  people's

disappointment with the service they get from  the

Police that they do not want to report any crimes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimes in HDB estates are usually robbery, house-breaking, and molest. There are people who regard

such  crimes as minor and so the police  need  not

bother  paying attention to them. I do  not  agree

with such people. We should realise that more than

half of our population live in HDB flats. They are

constantly  troubled with crimes such  as  I  have

mentioned, and this puts them in a dilemma. Sir, I

think  the  Police  should give  top  priority  to

combating  such  crimes. There are  so  many  such

incidents  that  the HDB flat dwellers  themselves

are unable to prevent them that they need the help

of the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually these crimes are committed in a certain

pattern.  If  a flat is empty, the criminal  would

break  open  the  door  and  steal  the  property.

Robbery or molest is usually committed in the lift

or  in  some secluded corner at a convenient time.

These criminals usually find that HDB estates  are

convenient places for them to commit their crimes.

Perhaps it is because of many people milling about

that it is difficult to detect them. Once they are

missed in the crowd, they could easily make  their

escape. The Police should be aware of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



this and should be able to think out a good method

to deal with such crimes. I cannot understand why,

in  spite  of the increase and frequency  of  such

crimes, the Police are still not able up to now to

take any effective measures to check such crimes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the main reason why the Police

Department  is not able to deal with these  crimes

effectively  is  that  they  have  neglected   the

seriousness of such crimes because they think that

robbery,  house-breaking, and theft are all  minor

crimes  which  do not deserve their attention.  So

they do not plan out an effective way to deal with

such crimes. Another reason is that the police  do

not  well  understand the conditions  in  the  HDB

estates and therefore they cannot fully play their

role.  They are not able to carry out their duties

effectively,  thus leading to higher incidents  of

crime everyday, even in the day time. I think  the

criminals  know the conditions in  the  HDB  areas

better  than the Police. They also know very  well

the beat duties of the policemen, and so they pick

a  suitable  time and place in order  to  get  off

easily.  In  the circumstances, the  police  could

only  resort  to  such measures as increasing  the

number of patrol cars and more frequent beats,  or

put  more policemen on beat patrol in the  housing

estates.  This is also what the Minister suggested

in  his  replies. Using only this method, I think,

is  a bit too mundane. It is a sort of routine. It

will  not enable the Police to know what  goes  on

inside  the buildings. Moreover, it will give  the

criminals a good opportunity to pick out  suitable

times  and  places to commit crime. For  instance,

during  the recent exercise of community  security

service, the hours were from 7 pm, to 11 p.m, when

the  participants  had  to report  to  the  police

station  at these times. So if one were to  report

at  a  police  station, it would take  some  time.

After  taking away the time for the trips  to  and

fro, only about two hours would be left. What kind

of help can the people get out of such patrolling?

The  criminals can also calculate their time. They

can commit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



crimes, before the patrolmen turn up or after they

have  left. So if the Police cannot quickly  think

out a better method to deal with the crimes in HDB

estates  but  only talk about crime  and  security

problems  in  the  housing  estates,  it  is  more

propaganda and is not going to help the people.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me this is a very important question because I

am  not  willing  to see more  than  half  of  our

population  who  are  staying  in  Housing   Board

estates  facing this security hazard. So  I  would

like  to suggest to the Minister, firstly, to  set

up  in  the  Police  Force a  section  of  special

personnel to deal with the prevention of crimes in

Housing  Board estates by taking charge of matters

such  as  planning effective action  to  ensure  a

presence  of security. Secondly, to set up  Police

sub-depots in HDB estates. I do not mean  ordinary

police  stations but sub-depots. I mean  that  the

Police could rent a one-room unit from the HDB and

station  some policemen there to provide a 24-hour

service. I believe this can be very effective  and

economical. It would be cheaper than to get patrol

cars  to go around. In this way the residents will

be  able to see the policemen every day and,  when

necessary,  they  can report to the  policeman  on

duty  of  any  crime. Moreover, it will  give  the

Police  an  opportunity  to  cooperate  with   and

actually serve the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, your 10 minutes are up. Mr Phey is not

here. Mr Conceicao?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, as my memory is fresh, I would first reply

to the Member for Bukit Panjang about policing the

Housing and Development Board estates. He seems to

give the impression that he is quite an expert  on

the  crime situation in the Housing Board estates.

He  is  quite  vehement  about  setting  up  crime

detection  and  prevention posts in Housing  Board

estates. May I remind him that I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



as  much concerned with crime in the Housing Board

estates as he is. I may remind him that I  am  the

Member   for  MacPherson,  a  constituency   which

consists wholly of Housing Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Member for Bukit Panjang is

suggesting  this to prepare for the Housing  Board

flats  that are going up in Woodlands. As  far  as

the  proposal to establish a police post in  every

Housing   Board   estate  to  prevent   crime   is

concerned, I have stated earlier that it is not  a

feasible proposition. Without the support  of  the

Headquarters  Division, such police  posts  cannot

respond  effectively. They  can  only  respond  to

reports  of  petty crimes within  their  immediate

vicinity.  This is an uneconomic use of  manpower.

Therefore,   the  answer  is  mobile   patrol   by

policemen,  who  will provide a quicker  and  more

effective  response to crime reports.  The  Police

will  also be able to deploy its limited  manpower

over  a wider area by increased mobility, that  is

to say, to adopt team policing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain to the Member what is meant by team

policing? Team policing is not just going  into  a

patrol car and take a drive round. That is not the

case. Team policing entails a deployment of a four-man  patrol  team utilising a saloon car  equipped

with  a  portable two-way radio for  communication

with  each  team  member  and  their  headquarters

station.  The team provides a 24-hour coverage  of

crime-prone  and specially selected  areas,  which

are    divided   into   sectors   determined    by

geographical  location,  crime  rate,   population

density and security sensitivity. Members  of  the

team  also perform foot patrols. They do not  only

sit  in  cars. They are also equipped with walkie-talkies  in order to achieve maximum coverage  and

to  develop  close rapport with the  public.  When

they  need  to  act  as a team,  they  can  easily

assemble  together  because of  the  walkie-talkie

communication with each other. To prove that it is

an  effective method of crime prevention,  it  has

been  tested in "A" and "E" Divisions. The results

confirmed that it is a better system. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



has  shown  that  the rate of preventable  crimes,

such as robberies and burglaries, has decreased by

approximately 30% in both Divisions. Therefore, we

shall implement team policing in the remaining six

Divisions by October 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member said that we do not regard house-breaking and robberies in Housing Board estates

with any seriousness. That is not true. We do.  In

fact, in addition to the proposed team policing we

have  already instituted vertical policing of  the

Housing   Board  estates.  In  other  words,   the

policemen  do not only police round the block  but

they  also  go up and down the staircase  and  the

lift as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a Police presence, priority for Housing

Board  flats is given to Police officers, but  not

every  Police officer will be staying in the  same

block of flats. That is no good. The scheme i5  to

slot,  say,  two Police officers in one  block  of

fiats,  so  that there is some form  of  a  Police

presence  in every block of flats. That  is  being

done now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also said that routine patrolling is

not  good enough for crime prevention because  the

criminals are intelligent enough to know when  the

Police  is coming and therefore could avoid  them.

Surely the Member can credit the Police with  some

intelligence  and  commonsense  not  to  have  too

routine a policing. In other words, everyday  they

deploy  their  patrolling at different  intervals,

i.e, not necessarily at the same time every  day.

The  point about CSF on policing duty between  the

hours  of  7  p.m, and 11 p.m, every  night-  that

cannot be helped because they are also working  in

the  day and are only free during these hours.  We

have  also organised some Vigilante Corps  members

who  work on night shifts to patrol during the day

time as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the Member for Anson. I agree with

him  that almost all the police stations  are  old

and  due for renovation. I have said that all  the

police stations, except Queenstown Police Station,

were built before the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



Second  World  War. As far as the  Central  Police

Station  is  concerned, it is due  for  demolition

under  urban renewal. II is planned to  house  the

Central  Police  Station  at  the  present  Police

Headquarters  building at Pearl's Hill,  when  the

proposed  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  Police

Complex at Mount Pleasant is developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also mentioned that four divisional police

stations will be built in the course of the fiscal

year.  One is at Toa Payoh. The second station  is

the  Orchard  Road Police Station at  Napier  Road

near  the  Gleneagles Hospital. The third  is  the

Paya Lebar Police Station at Upper Paya Lebar Road

junction, and the fourth is the Jurong Town Police

Station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the shortage of Police manpower, may I say

this.   The   shortage  of  Police   manpower   is

experienced  not  only in Singapore  but  also  in

other Police Forces the world over. However,  this

is  not something which criminals can find comfort

in,  as  suggested  by some Members,  because  the

Police   make   up  this  shortfall   by   greater

utilisation of national servicemen, like  the  CSF

and  so  on, more civilianisation and the  use  of

policewomen  to relieve male junior  officers  for

crime   detection   and  prevention   work.   More

mechanisation  has  also been  adopted  with  team

policing. As far as investigation and detection is

concerned,  we have also reorganised the  Criminal

Investigation  Department.  We  have  built  up  a

Criminal  Intelligence Unit and we  are  going  to

build  up  a  Scene  of Crime Unit,  and  this  is

expected  to  increase  the effectiveness  of  the

Police Force further. So far, in spite of what  we

read   in  the  newspapers,  the  rate  of   crime

detection is quite high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as full-time national servicemen are

concerned,  the details are being worked  out  and

they will be announced in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the mobile squad, as far as its

strength  is concerned, it is not as  bad  as  the

Police Force as a whole. But its shortage will  be

looked into by he Manpower Committee, as I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



said  before. One of the primary functions of  the

mobile  squad is to control and regulate  traffic.

The  volume  of  traffic is heaviest  during  peak

hours. Therefore, more mobile squad personnel  are

utilised during these periods than off-peak hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned about using

national  servicemen  to do  mobile  patrol  squad

duty.  We  have  a  small mobile  patrolmen  squad

comprising  37 national servicemen.  They  perform

eight  hours  of duty every 19 days on motorcycles

provided by the Special Constabulary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to traffic lights, they are

synchronised to facilitate the flow of traffic. To

date, 26 roads have such a synchronised system. As

far  as  the amber light is concerned, the  amber-phase of a traffic light system is timed according

to  the  intensity of the vehicular traffic  going

through  the  road  intersections.  Normally   the

duration  is three seconds. The Member  for  Anson

gave  an example. He wants all lights to be  green

at the same time so that there is a smooth flow of

traffic.  I agree with him on this point,  but  at

the  same time if all lights are green there  must

be a time when all lights are red. You cannot have

one without having the other also.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point made by the Member for River Valley is

that  the Traffic Police Division is, he fears,  a

revenue-collecting organisation. I can assure  him

that  it is not a revenue-collecting organisation.

Its  function is to enforce traffic laws  so  that

accidents will be reduced to the minimum.  Traffic

Police   personnel  are  constantly  reminded   to

enforce traffic laws in accordance with the spirit

rather  than the letter of the law. In fact,  they

have been told that their work is assessed on  the

nature  of  the  cases reported  and  not  on  the

quantity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state this quite categorically. It is a

misconception to say that the

Traffic Police have been told to come back with so

many summonses a day.

This is not true. It is the quality of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



cases they detect rather than the quantity. Let me

be  very  categorical about this. That is why  the

Traffic Police have adopted what they term as  the

Selective Enforcement Policy. The rationale behind

this  policy is that it is not possible to enforce

the  law  in  every single traffic violation,  and

since  there  is a relationship between  hazardous

traffic  violations  and  traffic  accidents,  the

Traffic   Police  concentrate  their   enforcement

efforts   on   serious  traffic   offences   which

contribute to traffic accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Selective Enforcement Policy is now paying

dividends.   The   number  of   traffic   accident

fatalities  dropped from 390 in  1972  to  380  in

1973.  In 1974, 288 persons were killed in traffic

accidents, representing a reduction of 24.2%.  May

I  repeat  that  it is not true that  the  Traffic

Police have a quota of summonses to issue per  day

in  order  to boost the revenue of the Government.

The  assessment of the performance of  the  police

officer  is  based  on  the nature  of  the  cases

reported and not on the quantity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also realise that to many black sheep

motorists,  particularly those who can  afford  to

pay  fines, the ultimate answer is not  to  impose

fines on them again and again. That is why we have

introduced the Points Demerit System in  which  an

accumulation  of  12  points for  serious  traffic

violations will cause the offender's licence to be

suspended.  It  is quite clear that  we  introduce

this system not with the object of collecting more

money,  but  because  we  could  then  justify   a

suspension of licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the case which the Member brought

up   about  the  Police  not  allowing  a  traffic

offender to go home to collect money for a fine, I

am  surprised  he  has  not  brought  this  to  my

attention  earlier because this  case  needs  some

investigation. I do not know why this has not been

done. As far as the sentence is concerned - a fine

of  $600 as compared to a lighter sentence  for  a

case  of molesting, that is a matter which is  not

within  the  province  of  the  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs.  That  is left to the assessment  of  the

magistrate. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



you   know,   it  is  his  judgment  alone   which

determines  the  degree of the  sentence.  If  the

person  who  is  sentenced is not  happy,  he  can

appeal.  This  is what is known as an  independent

judiciary.  That has got nothing to  do  with  the

Traffic  Police. But as far as the Traffic  Police

is  concerned, in cases where there is  a  blatant

violation  of traffic laws which would  invariably

lead  to an accident if not prevented, they  would

want heavier and heavier sentences to be imposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I do concede the point that the amount of

fine  imposed  for  a traffic offence  is  at  the

discretion of the magistrate. But what I am trying

to  bring  out is the public opinion  towards  the

control  of  traffic  in  Singapore.  Just  now  I

indicated  the  increased  revenue  from   traffic

offences  in  1972-73. 1 said  that  in  1972  the

revenue was almost $2.5 million and in 1973 it was

almost  $3 million. One of my colleagues here  has

given  me  figures which show that  the  estimated

revenue  from  traffic fines  for  1974  was  $3.3

million and for 1975 the estimated revenue  is  $4

million. So there is this fear among the public of

this  intention. I am just reflecting this  public

opinion which I think is valid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to traffic fines, I purposely lay

stress that this was the first offence, and  I  do

concede that if there is a blatant act to beat the

traffic light then nobody would quibble about  it.

But here is a case of one policeman's word against

that  of  a member of the public. I would like  to

ask  the Minister, being a lawyer himself,  is  it

not common Jaw that a person is innocent until  he

is  proved  guilty? But in this case the policeman

seems to exercise the reverse, which means that he

presumes that the offender is guilty until  he  is

proved innocent. What I am saying is that no oppor

tunity  was  given  to this person  to  prove  his

innocence,  it  is like saying,  "When  the  light

turned amber, I was very near the stop-line.  What

do  you want me to do? Step on the emergency brake

or drive across?" The circumstances are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



such that proper investigation should be done. The

reason  why I did not bring this matter up earlier

was  because] was informed of it only a few  weeks

ago although the incident occurred on 2nd January.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I am quite surprised that the person

concerned pleaded guilty. If he is not guilty,  he

should not have pleaded guilty. The Traffic Police

cannot force him to plead guilty, and if he  feels

that the fine of S600 is too heavy because this is

his  first  offence  he  can  always  appeal.  The

sentence is at the discretion of the magistrate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about revenue. The Annual

Report  for  1973 just happened to include  it.  I

have  made  it quite clear that it is no criterion

to  effectiveness.  The  criterion  is:  how  many

accidents have been averted? How many deaths  have

been  avoided? How many cases of injury  resulting

from road accidents have been reduced? That is the

criterion and I state this quite categorically.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I concede all the points the Minister has

said.  Can the Minister assure the House  that  he

will  give  specific instructions to  all  Traffic

Control Divisions and the Traffic Police that they

will henceforth stand in front of the traffic sign

or  at the road junction and not hide behind trees

in order to catch the offenders, as we have seen a

few days ago?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is another point, it is

actually  debatable whether the Traffic  policemen

should  stand  in  front of the  traffic  sign  or

behind it. As I said, the Points Demerit System is

such  that we must operate it in such a way as  to

remove  those hazardous drivers who are  a  danger

and  a  menace  to other road users.  Whether  the

policemen carry out their duty in front or  behind

trees is a matter for the professionals to decide.

I will not direct them on this. The policy is that

they  should  not  summon just  for  the  sake  of

summoning.  They  should  try  to  put  all  their

efforts   in   accordance   with   the   Selective

Enforcement Policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



In  other words, to remove hazardous and dangerous

drivers from the road, and as far as minor traffic

infringements are concerned, they should  exercise

their discretion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the normal course of events,

an  offender  is offered composition for  a  first

minor  traffic offence. But in the case  mentioned

by the Member for River Valley, why is it that the

motorist  who  committed a minor offence  for  the

first time was not offered a composition?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, that is equally puzzling to me because there

may  be other reasons. If the details of the  case

are given to me, it will be investigated.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I shall be submitting the case to the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead GAA 1111.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Health

and   Home  Affairs  whether  he  has  any  policy

governing  residents of Singapore who are  without

identity cards. Will he consider issuing at  least

blue  identity  cards  to such  people  if  he  is

satisfied  that  they  are  former  residents   of

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these people have been employed abroad at

one  time  and  were holders of the old  Singapore

paper  identity cards. But now upon  returning  to

Singapore they found that the old Singapore  paper

identity  card  has been changed  to  the  present

laminated   card.   So   they   applied   to   the

Commissioner  of  National  Registration  for  new

identity  cards  but were told  to  apply  to  the

Immigration  Department for permanent stay  before

applying for the new identity cards. At the office

of the Controller of Immigration they were told to

obtain an identity card first before applying  for

permanent stay. Thus they were pushed from  pillar

to  post due to the lack of decision of these  two

departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are in a dilemma as no one will

employ  them  as  they  have  no  identity  cards.

Moreover, employers are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



not   able  to  pay  the  Central  Provident  Fund

contributions  for those who do not have  identity

cards.  In  view  of the plight  of  these  people

without  identity  cards,  I  wonder  whether  the

Minister concerned could do something to alleviate

their hardship.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore happens to be at the

junction of international traffic, so much so that

even illegal immigrants think that Singapore is  a

haven  for  them. Having come here illegally,  and

finally, finding themselves financially destitute,

they  end up by committing crimes. May I ask  what

active  measures are being taken to prevent  entry

of illegal immigrants into Singapore? A few may be

caught,  but  I am sure that many got  away  scot-free.  I  will not be surprised if I am told  that

many of the robberies, thefts, etc, were committed

by  these  illegal immigrants out of  desperation.

What  steps  are  being taken to  tighten  up  our

security  measures  to  prevent  entry  of   these

illegal immigrants?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Immigration Office at Empress Place

seems to be perpetually congested. There seems  to

be  no order. People do not queue up and there  is

confusion.   It   is  time  this  department   was

reorganised so that there will be a proper  system

in dealing with members of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received complaints that some of the

officials  who deal with members of the public  do

not  seem  to understand the policy governing  the

issue  of  passports. To quote an instance,  there

was  a  boy who was born in Singapore. His parents

are  non-citizens. He is studying in a  school  in

Singapore. Recently, the boy's parents  wanted  to

take him abroad to see his aged grandparents. When

his  parents applied for an international passport

for  this boy, the Immigration Official told  them

that   the   application  for  the   international

passport  was  rejected. The reason  is  that  his

parents are non-citizens and, therefore, he cannot

automatically become a citizen. They were  advised

by   the  official  that  they  should  obtain   a

certificate of status for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



the  boy, which would take some time for it to  be

granted.  In the meantime, the parents  went  back

home disappointed and explained the matter to  the

boy's   uncle.  On  the  strength  of  the   boy's

restricted  passport which was given  earlier  the

uncle  went  to  see the Assistant  Controller  of

Immigration  to  explain the case.  The  Assistant

Controller, on seeing the restricted passport that

the  boy  is  a  citizen by  birth,  directed  his

officer  to  approve the issue of an international

passport.  However, the official  told  the  boy's

uncle  that  the  original  application  form  was

missing  and  requested him to  fill  up  a  fresh

application  and  to collect  the  passport  on  a

certain day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day in question when he went to collect

the  passport,  the official was  not  there.  But

there  was  another person dealing with the  case.

Again  the  same problem arose, and this disgusted

gentleman had to refer the matter to the Assistant

Controller. Finally the passport was approved  and

given to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to know why should all these

unnecessary  problems exist at this counter.  Such

inconsiderate and ignorant behaviour on  the  part

of  the  officer  at  the counter  should  not  be

tolerated because many tourists and visitors go to

this  department. It would give a very poor  image

of  Singapore and their opinion would be that  the

department is not functioning properly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to take the question of the

Member for Bras Basah first. The position is  that

the old Singapore paper identity cards have ceased

to  be  valid documents after 31st January,  1967,

vide Government Gazette Notification No. 145 dated

20th  January, 1967. In view of this, persons  who

are  away  and  still hold old Singapore  identity

cards are not automatically eligible for Singapore

laminated  identity cards. If they wish to  return

to   Singapore,  they  must  first  apply  to  the

Immigration  Department for the necessary  permits

to  return.  If  their applications are  approved,

they may then apply for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



new laminated identity cards after their return to

Singapore.  This is necessary because many  people

who have been residing in a foreign country for  a

long  time may have lost their permanent  resident

status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to illegal immigrants, brought up by

the  Member for Anson, the majority of the illegal

immigrants   are   brought   into   Singapore   by

traffickers,  some  of  whom  are  organised  into

syndicates. Concerted action continues to be taken

by  the  Police and the Immigration Department  on

illegal  immigrants. The Marine Police who  patrol

the  territorial waters of Singapore  are  on  the

lookout  for  small vessels which  sneak  in  with

illegal   immigrants   on   board.   Police    and

Immigration Officers carry out surprise checks  at

work  sites.  They  also conduct  raids  based  on

information    gathered   by    the    Immigration

Department. This has resulted in numerous  arrests

of illegal immigrants. In 1972, 1973 and 1974, the

number  of illegal immigrants arrested was  1,547;

2,223  and  1,365  respectively. On  arrest  these

illegal immigrants were prosecuted and imprisoned,

and  then repatriated. The traffickers were  dealt

with severely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the amendment to the law introduced last

year,   penalties   for  traffickers   have   been

enhanced.  Illegal immigrants and their harbourers

or employers are liable to imprisonment for a term

not exceeding two years or to a fine of $6,000  or

to  both  such imprisonment and fine.  Traffickers

are  punished  with imprisonment of  two  to  five

years and are also liable to fine of up to $10,000

and  to  caning.  In  addition,  their  boats  and

equipment  are  also  confiscated.  Recently   one

trafficker was sentenced to 64 years' imprisonment

and   12   strokes  of  the  rotan,  and   another

trafficker  four  years'  imprisonment  and  eight

strokes   of   the  rotan.  Keeping  the   illegal

immigrants out of Singapore is not easy because of

the  close proximity of neighbouring countries and

the    accessibility   of   our   coastline.   The

Immigration Department has since last year set  up

an Intelligence Unit to seek out traffickers. As a

result  it  has achieved considerable  success  in

tracking down



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



a  number  of  traffickers who are  now  in  gaol

serving heavy sentences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to congestion at Empress Place office

of  the Immigration Department, in early 1974  the

Immigration  Department secured an extra  area  of

11,330 sq, ft, at the headquarters, Empress Place.

This  extension  of office and waiting  space  has

helped to ease the congestion. Railings have  been

constructed at crowded sections of the counters to

induce the public to queue up. This has been done,

for   instance,  at  the  Passport  counter  where

numerous  applications  are  received  daily.   In

addition  to the railings, more cushioned  benches

have  been  placed for members of the  public  who

have to wait. The issue of the various immigration

documents is also done in an orderly fashion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson related the story of a boy

who went through considerable difficulty before he

was  issued with an international passport. I have

been  informed  by  my officers  of  a  case,  the

threads  of  which are very similar and  it  could

well  be  the  same  case. The  boy  was  born  in

Singapore  on 7th February, 1963. His  application

for a passport was submitted by his father on 11th

November,   1974   at  the  Immigration   counter.

Although   his   father  had   declared   on   the

application  form  that  the  boy  had  no   other

passport, it was discovered later that the child's

name was included in his father's foreign passport

and that both father and son had entered Singapore

on  a  visit  pass. Since the boy was a  Singapore

citizen  he  had really no reason to travel  on  a

foreign passport, but having entered Singapore  on

a   foreign  passport,  his  application   for   a

Singapore  international  passport  was  therefore

referred  to a senior officer. The senior  officer

told the father that it was necessary for the  boy

to  regularise his stay in Singapore  by  applying

for a certificate of status before the issue of  a

Singapore   international   passport   could    be

considered.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18th November, 1974, father and son called at

the Immigration Department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



and  produced the boy's Singapore restricted

passport.  This  case  was then  referred  to  the

Assistant  Controller of Immigration  who  was  in

charge of the Passport Section. He found that  the

boy's  case  had already been regularised  by  the

fact  that  the  boy  had a  Singapore  restricted

passport and that his name had, since the previous

interview, been deleted from his father's  foreign

passport.  He then decided that the boy  could  be

issued with a Singapore international passport. As

the  father  wanted  the  passport  urgently,  the

Assistant Controller advised him to submit a fresh

application    immediately   as    the    previous

application had to be withdrawn. The passport  was

issued to the boy on an urgent basis the next day.

The  moral of this story, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that

you  may get into unnecessary difficulties if  you

want the best of both worlds, as was the case with

the boy's father.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson's narration of the story is

the father's version. That is only one side of the

story.  Unfortunately, the narration of the  story

puts the Immigration Department in a bad light.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to clarify

the  matter  of replacement of old identity  cards

with  new  laminated ones. Just now  he  told  the

House  that  the old identity card was invalidated

after 31st January. 1967. I would like to ask  him

this.  TI  local people who had lived  abroad  and

were  not aware of this regulation were to  return

after  that  date,  would the  Ministry  concerned

consider their cases sympathetically?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I have already answered the question. A

returned  resident can apply for  a  new  identity

card  and  the application will then be considered

on its own merits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I said just now that the person concerned has

applied  for a new identity card. When he went  to

the  Commissioner for Registration he was told  to

go  and  see  the  Controller of Immigration.  The

Con-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



troller of Immigration told him that he must go

and  see the Commissioner for Registration.  There

is no way of knowing who should move first. Nobody

knows.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, there should not be a case of one officer

pushing the matter to another. If the procedure is

properly complied, a decision would have been made

either  to grant or riot to grant. But  I  do  not

know  what  happened. If there is a case,  perhaps

the Member can write to me and I will consider it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, in view of the answer, I beg leave to

withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead EAA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past year the Vigilante Corps has

shown good performance. Since the organisation  of

the  Community Security Force, the VC has made  an

even  better  contribution to the  community.  The

most  important function of the VC is  to  perform

beat  patrols in HDB estates, kampung  areas,  and

other  areas that need such patrols. This  greatly

contributes to the maintenance of security and the

suppression  of crime. Therefore, this performance

receives the praise of all the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Vigilante Corps has a glorious history

behind  it.  Members of the Corps have  sacrificed

much  time  and effort in the task of  maintaining

security  in the community and the maintenance  of

law  and  order. On the introduction  of  national

service  the  VC  membership  increased  with  the

addition  of  volunteers so  that  the  number  of

regular  VC  personnel could be reduced.  However,

there  are still thousands of volunteer VC members

on  patrol beats maintaining security and law  and

order  in  the  community. They  have  contributed

their  time  and  effort in  the  service  of  our

country. All this effort is worth our praise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to raise the matter of

allowances  paid to VC members. According  to  the

present scheme, the allowance is too little. A  VC

member gets 60 cents for an hour's service  and  a

leader   85   cents  per  hour.   This   is   very

insignificant. Everything has in-creased in price.

In  the past, the bus fare was 5 cents to 20 cents

per trip, but now it is at least 20 cents. Laundry

was 20 cents to 50 cents per piece, but now it  is

at  least  50  cents. When a member turns  up  for

duty,  he  spends on petrol or bus  fares.  If  he

takes snacks or drinks it comes up to $3 or $4 per

night. This is why his allowance is not enough. If

a VC member could work more hours or take up other

jobs, he would be given more allowance. So I  hope

the  Ministry concerned can increase the allowance

to VC members in order to raise their morale.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my Minister

to  reply. Volunteers in the VC draw the same rate

of  training  and duty allowance as that  paid  to

national  servicemen. The following  hourly  rates

are paid to VC members according to rank:



<pre>

Rank                                 Rate per hour



Vigilante and Assistant                   60 cts

Section Leader



Section Leader                            65 cts



Assistant Group Leader,                   70 cts

Group Leader,

Senior Group Leader



Assistant Unit Leader and above           80 cts

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Corps, including national

servicemen  and volunteers who have been  selected

for  the  CSF  policing service, are  required  to

assemble at and then fan out from their respective

policing posts for operations. These VC posts  are

situated  in  the various operational  areas  well

within  easy  reach by bus. This  enables  all  VC

members,  including group and section leaders,  to

commute   between   their  residence   and   their

respective VC posts or between different posts  by

bus.  Besides,  in  order  to  minimise  transport

expenses and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



inconvenience,  every  VC  member  is  as  far  as

possible  posted  to  the  VC  post  nearest   his

residence. Members of the Corps who travel by  bus

are  entitled to concessionary rates of bus  fare.

Those  who  prefer to use their  own  cars  during

operations are doing so on their own accord.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has only given us

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

HAA 1111*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem of citizenship is still one that

bedevils   many   people  in  Singapore.   In   my

constituency  during  my Meet-the-People  sessions

every  week,  I  receive a lot of complaints  from

various  people  about the delay in  dealing  with

such applications over the past few years. Many of

them  have waited for many a year and some of them

have repeatedly made applications without success.

They are very worried and concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have analysed their circumstances, their

family backgrounds, their income, their

occupations and the number of people in their

families. From what I have gathered, these

applicants generally have an income of at least

$400 per month. Their occupations range from

workers and technicians in the shipbuilding

industry to hawkers, taxi drivers and other

occupations. Most of the other members in their

families are local citizens, or they have children

born in Singapore and who are citizens of

Singapore. There may be exceptional cases where

one or two members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



family  are non-citizens. Many of them pay  income

tax  and they contribute a great deal towards  our

country.  Therefore,  we should  give  sympathetic

consideration  to  citizenship  applications  from

such  people  so that they will be  able  to  make

greater contributions to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has said repeatedly in this

House that those who contribute to our country  in

one  way or other will be given consideration  for

citizenship.   I  endorse  this   view,   it   is,

therefore, my hope that the Minister will consider

granting  citizenship to those who  contribute  to

the  arts  in Singapore. I would like to give  one

example of this case for the careful consideration

of  the  Minister.  In this particular  case,  the

applicant is an expert in ballet dancing. He is  a

permanent resident of Singapore. He went  overseas

after  completing  his  secondary  education.   He

obtained a diploma from a school in London and  is

a  member of the London Institute of Choreography.

He  has also participated in various international

performances and returned to Singapore in 1972  in

the hope of contributing what he has learnt.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his stay in Singapore for three years, he

participated  in  charitable performances  in  the

National  Theatre and conducted ballet classes  in

the  various community centres to develop talents.

In  considering  the granting  of  citizenship  to

people  who  make  an  economic  contribution   to

Singapore,  we must also consider those  who  make

artistic  or cultural contributions to  Singapore.

It  is  only  in  this  way that  talents  in  the

cultural   field  will  be  able  to  develop   in

Singapore. This particular artiste I mentioned has

applied  for  citizenship two years  ago  but  his

application is still under consideration. I  would

therefore  ask  the  Minister to  look  into  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also cases of old people who have

applied   for  citizenship.  They  have   grown-up

children   who  are  quite  successful  in   their

business. One such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



applicant  has  a son who is a medical  specialist

working  in  the General Hospital. This  applicant

has  waited  for two years but the only  reply  he

received was that his application has been  turned

down.   Surely  there  is  no  harm  in   granting

citizenship  to  this applicant  because  all  his

children are now independent and in a position  to

support  and maintain him. So granting citizenship

to  him will not add to the economic burden of our

State.  I  would, therefore, ask the  Minister  to

give   special  consideration  to  cases  of  this

nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after the separation of

Singapore from Malaysia, a large number of  people

became  stateless through no fault of  their  own.

These people are permanent residents of Singapore.

They have no country to go to. They have lived all

their lives in Singapore, and the only thing  that

is  missing is documentary proof. Because of this,

they  are  not granted citizenship. They  are  not

considered citizens, and therefore they  lose  all

the privileges accorded to citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the national registration in 1967, some of

these people could not produce proper documents to

support  their  case  and consequently  they  were

given  blue  identity  cards, which  automatically

means  that  they are non-citizens.  What  is  the

plight of these people? To date many of them still

find   difficulty   as  they   are   not   granted

citizenship of their country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a case where every member of the

family  is a citizen of Singapore, except for  one

poor member whose documentary proof was mislaid by

his  parents during the war. Thus he became a non-citizen.  He  had  applied for  citizenship  quite

sometime ago but he has not received any reply  to

his application. Can the Minister explain what  is

the  present  stand in the granting of citizenship

for cases of this nature?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also people who have the necessary

requirements and are paying income tax but are not

considered for citizenship. May I ask why they are

not considered for citizenship?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I first reply to the Member for

Sembawang?  The  Government  must  be  strict  and

careful  in  granting citizenship. Citizenship  is

something which must be regarded with great value.

However,  the  policy on citizenship  is  reviewed

regularly.   All  applications  are  attended   to

without  delay, but they must take their  turn  in

the  queue. It is true that some applications  may

take  a  long  while before a decision  is  given.

These  applications come from applicants who  have

not  met  the minimum requirements for citizenship

but  who may later qualify. Such applications  are

reviewed  regularly. If an applicant has  to  wait

for  a long time it is because he has taken a long

time to meet all the requirements. Once a decision

on  the  application  is made,  the  applicant  is

notified  immediately. Therefore, as  long  as  an

applicant  has  not received a decision  there  is

hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years good news exceeded bad news, as

evidenced by the following statistics:



<pre>

         Citizenship Applications from all

                    Categories



      Approved   %    Refused   %  Decisions

1974    3989   93.9     259    6.1    4248



</pre>



In  other  words, through the years the number  of

approvals has been going up.

This  should gladden the heart of the  Member  for

Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member's second point, it has

been  and  still  is  the Government's  policy  to

consider favourably applications from persons  who

are able to contribute to the economic, social and

cultural  progress of the country. I do  not  know

the  two cases that he has mentioned. If he  could

write to me, then I will investigate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member for Anson, he raised

the   problem  of  persons  who  claim  birth   in

Singapore  but  have  no documentary  proof.  This

problem was discussed in Parliament on 17th March,

1972.  The present position remains basically  the

same  as  in 1972. We cannot waive the citizenship

regula



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



tions  for  these persons because a  waiver  will

immediately encourage applications from all  sorts

of   people,  all  of  them  professing  birth  in

Singapore.  The crux of the matter is  documentary

proof.  During the national registration  exercise

it  was  revealed that there were many people  who

claimed  birth  in Singapore but on  investigation

were found not to be born here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the granting of citizenship to a

person who is the sole remaining non-citizen in  a

family,    the    Government   is   prepared    to

sympathetically consider the application of such a

person provided he will not become a burden to the

State.  In fact, quite a number of such applicants

have  already  been  granted citizenship, if  the

Member has any particular applicant in mind, he is

invited  to  supply the details to my Ministry  so

that the case will be looked into.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy(Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I am sorry that this matter, as the Minister

has  pointed  out,  is a regular  occurrence  year

after year. Unfortunately the reply also seems  to

be  the  stereotyped, year after year - the policy

of  citizenship is being reviewed year after year.

This is one of the stereotype replies; but how  it

has changed from last year to this year we are not

aware of. I thought I heard the Minister say  that

if  citizenship  is not granted to  an  applicant,

perhaps  he has not satisfied the requirements.  I

would  have  thought that once an  application  is

accepted,  he  has already satisfied  the  minimum

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter is that the applicant is told

that no enquiries are to be made. If enquiries are

at  all  made,  the  applicant is  told  that  his

application is still under investigation. If there

is  no communication between the applicant and the

Registry,  I do not know how the Department  keeps

track  of an applicant fulfilling the requirements

by   a   certain  time,  that  is,  he   is   able

economically to be of some benefit to  the  State,

before granting him citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, when I say that the

policy is being reviewed from year to year, it  is

not just an empty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



statement.  First, since last year  we  have  been

granting citizenship to skilled workers. Secondly,

we  have  also been granting citizenship to  those

who  have done national service. So the policy  is

not  static. We have reviewed our policy and  have

added  on  to  the  criteria of  requirements  for

citizenship.  The  minimum  requirement   is,   of

course,  residential qualification, i.e, permanent

residence for 10 out of 12 years. There are  other

requirements, like not being a burden to the State

and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to those who qualify under the

various   criteria,   how   do   we   know    that

circumstances have changed? As I said,  they  must

go and take their turn in the queue. So when their

turn comes, they will be notified and interviewed.

From  the  interview  we will know  whether  their

circumstances have changed or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am very glad to hear from the Minister that

the  number  of  applications  approved  has  been

increasing  from year to year. I  know  there  has

been  some  progress  made in  the  processing  of

applications for citizenship. But what about those

who  have been rejected? There are about 6,000  to

7,000  rejected  applications over  the  years.  I

wonder  whether the Ministry concerned  will  give

more sympathetic consideration henceforth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> First of all, they have to reapply, and then we

will  consider  whether their  circumstances  have

changed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the Minister's very clear answer, I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Minister for Finance delivered his

Budget  speech  on 3rd March, 1975, he  emphasised

the  need to introduce various measures to counter

economic recession. However, in implementing these

measures  we  have to keep them in line  with  our

long  term  policies. We have to make use  of  our

current  slack  period to prepare for  a  complete

economic  recovery.  Sir,  this  shows  that   the

Government   has  made  judicious   and   adequate

preparation   to   meet   the   present   economic

recession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, we have seen that in order to

counter  and  mitigate the impact of  recessionary

trends  on  our business community, the Government

has started to readjust and formulate new economic

policies  in  the  last  quarter  of  1974.  These

include  the setting up of the Economic Activation

Committee to formulate new policies and strategies

for  economic  development, the reorganisation  of

the  Economic  Development Board  to  enhance  its

efficiency, the setting  of an Export  Council  to

help  businessmen to find new markets  abroad  for

our  manufactured goods, and the setting up  of  a

Foreign  Exchange Markets Committee to  raise  the

effectiveness  of  our financial  institutions  as

well  as measures to relax credit squeeze and  the

partial lifting of restrictions on the purchase of

properties   by  foreign  investors.   All   these

measures   are   aimed  at  stimulating   economic

activity  in  our  country.  They  are  all   very

excellent measures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for the current year for the

Ministry  of Finance is $707 million, representing

40%  increase  over last year.  Out  of  this  sum

$281.7  million  is in respect  of  loans  to  the

business community for their development, which is

very  good.  I  would like to know  what  kind  of

business enterprises will benefit from these loans

and  what contribution will they make towards  our

economic  development, and how many jobs  will  be

created for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Finance Ministry has spared no

effort  to  stimulate our economy and  to  attract

foreign  investment,  according  to  the  business

circle, there was a big drop in foreign investment

last year. What are the reasons for this drop? One

of  the  main  reasons may be  due  to  the  world

recessionary trends. However, apart from this,  we

also  have to take a closer look at our investment

policy  to see whether there are any shortcomings.

If there are, we must take steps to remedy them in

order to consolidate our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consensus of the business community is that

there  have been some shortcomings in the Economic

Development  Board's policies.  These  act  as  an

impediment to foreign investment. For example,  no

proper  guidance  has been given to  the  would-be

investors. They have not been told of the kind  of

industries  suitable to promote in  Singapore.  In

addition, there has been undue delay in processing

the  applications. It takes at  least  a  year  to

process an application. Sometimes there is a delay

of  two to three years before it is approved,  and

during this period the investors do not know  what

to  do.  This  has become a wet blanket  over  the

enthusiasm  of would-be investors. If  we  are  to

continue  to attract foreign investment, something

must be done to remedy such a situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another complaint relates to the

difficulties  faced by foreign  investors  in  the

purchase of residential properties. This has  been

a  vexing problem to them because the Land  Office

has  adopted delaying tactics in considering their

applications. It invariably happens  that  when  a

buyer and seller have entered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



into  an agreement and after payment is made,  the

Land  Office  then  informs  the  buyer  that  his

application has been rejected. Thus, he will  have

to  engage a lawyer to get a refund of his  money.

This   is   another  depressing  effect   on   the

confidence  of  foreign investors  to  invest  and

reside  here.  I  hope  the  Minister  will   take

measures  to  remedy  this situation,  Finally,  I

would  like to put forward three questions to  the

Minister.  Firstly,  how is the  Finance  Ministry

going to encourage and subsidise our export trade?

What  kind of industrial or commercial enterprises

will  benefit from such subsidies? Secondly,  will

there  be  a further relaxation on the  supply  of

money  in  order  to encourage and  stimulate  our

economy, in particular, the construction industry?

Thirdly, on 17th March, 1975, when I took part  in

the   Budget   debate  I  mentioned   about   some

difficulties faced by the timber industry. One  of

the  reasons  given  was that  the  Timber  Export

Industry  Board  was not efficient.  The  Minister

then  answered that he would take note of this.  I

do  not  know whether an investigation  has  since

been  carried  out  or not. I also  mentioned  the

great  need to promote our timber export and wood-processing industry. Since the Minister  has  once

again  emphasised the need for diversification  of

our  economy, he should pay more attention to this

industry and ensure that plans are being  made  to

develop  this particular industry which has  great

profit potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister another

question. I wonder whether he knows anything about

the Customs Branch Office in Jurong. Oddly enough,

this  office  only deals with non-dutiable  goods.

For  dutiable  goods one has to  go  to  the  main

Customs  Office  to pay the duty. Therefore,  many

industrialists    find    it    troublesome    and

inconvenient to do so, particularly so in view  of

the  traffic  problem. Since there  is  a  Customs

Branch  Office in Jurong, it should be  given  the

power  to  levy taxes on dutiable goods  as  well.

There are about 500 to 600 factories in Jurong and

this  Customs Office in Jurong should provide such

services for their convenience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I suppose it is our

Government's   policy   to   recruit    preferably

Singapore  citizens, wherever possible,  into  our

civil service. In this connection, I would like to

ask   the   Minister  for  Finance  the  following

questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. What is the total number of Divisions I and II

officers  in the civil service as at  the  end  of

February 1975?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. How many of these officers are non-Singapore

citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What steps, if any, are taken or will be taken

by the Government to grant Singapore citizenship

to non-Singapore citizens officers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Will the Minister for Finance set a target

date  for  the  civil service  to  be  completely

staffed by Singapore citizens?



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, under this subhead I

apply  myself  to  the policy of the  Ministry  of

Finance  regarding  revenue collection  and  other

matters under the Ministry relating to policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his reply to Members in the debate on the

Budget statement, the Minister said that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is always very difficult to balance the needs

for  additional  revenue against  the  concessions

which  Members  think should be given  because  of

inflationary or recessionary effects which we  are

experiencing at present.'



<br><br>The  Minister  also  said  that  there  should  be

greater recognition of the need by all citizens to

pay for some of the services which are afforded by

the  Government. All this is appreciated  and  not

difficult  to grasp. Today, the people are  paying

for  most,  if not almost, all the services  which

the    Government   is   affording   the   people.

Conspicuously  excluded,  however,  is   education

which, of course is heavily subsidised and so also

the medical services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem will be to persuade the people to

recognise  the fact that mounting costs determined

by  external  factors requires increased  national

revenue, to be acquired through taxation and other

measures,  to  pay  for more costly  services.  Of

course,  the  additional  burden  must  be  spread

justly. To do so, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



should  think it necessary at all tunes to present

a    coherent   explanation   of   revenue-raising

measures.   It   is  important  to   ensure   that

explanations   of  revenue-raising  measures   are

always   adequate  and  credible  as  representing

aspects  of a just and well-considered  policy  of

national revenue development, so as not to  invite

public  belief that they are being  taxed  ad  hoc

simply because the Government thinks they can take

it  and therefore should pay, and because that tax

measures will yield the most money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his reply to Members on the debate on the

Budget  statement, the Minister thought  that  the

increase of $60 per annum on the 1000 cc and under

cars  was very modest as it amounted to only $5  a

month  and which the Minister thought that anybody

who  went to the Orchard Road Car Park for a  meal

could afford. If this response of the Minister  is

construed  by  the  public as an  explanation  and

justification  of  the $60 increase,  then  surely

there  will he the public fear of another increase

shortly  by another $60 per annum, and  which  the

Minister  would  probably explain  away  again  as

"just another $5 increase a month".



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that having imposed this tax he

did  not want Members to think that it was the end

of  all  taxes  as far as road transportation  was

concerned. He also said that this tax was meant to

be  principally  revenue-raising  and  not  as   a

solution  to  the  congestion problem  or  towards

making  a  success of the CBD scheme.  The  public

must then be puzzled because, in his statement  in

Parliament  on 16th October, 1972, on raising  the

road  tax,  the  Minister offered the  explanation

that  "the  revised  rates should  encourage  more

people to use public transport to their places  of

work  in  the  central city area." Again,  in  his

reply on the 17th March, the Minister utilised the

contention  of  Members  that  the  car  being   a

necessity is owned by every family to regard it as

a  standard  possession  and  suggested  therefore

"there was a chicken in every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



pot  in  Singapore". That is why the Minister  was

unrepentant  about  the road  tax  increases.  The

Minister  founded his unrepentance upon a  premise

which  he  himself constructed out of  an  earnest

opinion of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I appreciate the nature of the problem

relating to the need to increase our revenue  with

which  the  Minister is confronted, in  particular

the  problem  of preparing to meet the  increasing

expectation  of  a  youthful population.  As  this

youthful   population  of  ours  marry  and   have

children, they begin to have expectations both for

their  own  future  and for the  future  of  their

children. But I believe, Sir, that our people  can

be  carried  along  to  bear  a  greater  national

expenditure if they see fairness and coherence  in

the   explanation  or  justifications   supporting

revenue-raising measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the civil service, I wish to make the

observation that much can be improved in the lower

ranks  of the service. As the Minister has pointed

out, the officers at this level are concerned with

the  administration of rules and  regulations  and

are   in   contact  with  the  public.   While   I

acknowledge the general efficiency of the service,

I  must  agree with the Minister that we must  not

reach  the  point of "smugness and complacency  in

the  civil  service".  I feel  that  there  is  an

immediate  need to orientate, with  emphasis,  the

attitude  of  the  civil service officers  at  the

lower  ranks towards assisting the public in areas

other than those with which they are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public are often told by officers

that the matters they have brought directly to the

attention of the officers cannot be dealt with  at

that   counter   or  in  that  section   or   that

department.  When direction of further  assistance

is  sought by members of the public, the  officers

either  refuse  or are unable (probably  they  are

more unable than being inclined to refuse) to deal

with  matters which specifically relate  to  their

counter,  section or department.  I  should  think

that if a matter is brought to an officer for  his

attention but that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



should   be  dealt  with  in  another  office   or

department  in  a  particular  way,  the   officer

approached should not only say, "No, this  is  not

done  here" but also say where the matter  can  be

dealt with. He should also be able to say how that

member  of  the  public should go about  it.  Such

orientation  may  be  useful  at  present  as  the

Minister has made a provision of $2,188.2  million

for  the  fiscal  year  1975 for  Development,  an

increase of 40.1% over the fiscal year 1974; while

allowing  an  increase  of only  1,689  posts  for

fiscal  year 1975, i.e, an increase of  only  2.7%

for fiscal year 1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has asked his Ministry to improve

the   civil  service  through  developing  greater

administrative skills, adopting innovating  ideas,

improving  work procedures and methods and  making

greater  use of machines. The Ministry of  Finance

has  also issued a circular to the service calling

for  higher productivity. I feel that the  service

at  the  lower  ranks  can  become  productive  if

officers  develop the initiative and  capacity  to

assist  the public, as I have suggested.  I  would

conclude by recalling the Minister's assurance  to

the Member for River Valley that should cases like

the  example of the 50 bicycles be brought to  his

notice,  he would send the officer responsible  to

the   Staff  Training  Institute.  But   for   the

improvement of the civil service, can we  have  it

the other way round? Can the Minister keep sending

officers to the Staff Training Institute first  in

order to avoid the 50-bicycle blunder?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the chit fund companies

have closed down for quite some time.



A  small  sum of money was supposed to  have  been

paid out to the subscribers in various stages.  It

appears  that only one or two payments  have  been

made so far.

There  are  many people involved in the two  major

chit fund companies and they are still waiting for

the  second  payment of their dividends.  However,

there  is  no news about this. The rate of  making

payment  is rather slow. It is believed  that  the

cost of administration will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



eventually  exceed the actual amount  to  be  paid

out. Can something be done about this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last one year, bank rates on fixed

deposits   and  saving  accounts  had   fluctuated

several times. At one stage the rates increased by

2%.  Then subsequently they began to drop.  Though

this may be good for investment, there is a danger

that  money  would be withdrawn, as is being  done

now,  and  invested in illegal  ventures  such  as

illegal  tontines,  lotteries,  unauthorised  chit

funds,   etc.  Although  for  general   investment

purposes  the reduction in rates is a good  trend,

can the Minister do something to prevent the rates

from fluctuating?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leave allowance given to civil servants

appears  to  have been fixed according to  grades,

and  an increase is given only on promotion  to  a

higher  grade. Can the Minister revise the  scheme

and  introduce  some  form of  sliding  scale  for

payment  of  leave allowances? This  is  requested

only  in  the  interest of a more  faithful  civil

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Post Office Savings Bank has advertised

in  no  small  way  that its branches  are  spread

throughout the Republic for the convenience of the

general  public  and that a number  of  them  have

since  been computerised, and the final  objective

is  to  introduce this system to all its branches.

However,  in  almost ail the Post  Office  Savings

Bank   branches,  the  sharing  of   premises   is

noticeable  - the officer in charge  of  the  Post

Office  acting  as  Branch Manager  of  the  Bank.

Depositors  of the Post Office Savings  Bank  have

been  told quite a number of times that funds kept

in  such  branches are not sufficient to meet  the

immediate  demands, even though  the  computerised

system  was  introduced. Can the Minister  explain

why  the POSB cannot keep sufficient funds of  its

own  to help the depositors so that they need  not

be  driven  away from time to time? If  necessary,

post a security guard at the office.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is our national shipping line faring at

present against other shipping lines? Is there any

move  to make it compulsory for our exports to  be

carried on our national shipping line? What is the

Government  doing to promote Singapore-made  goods

in  other countries? INTRACO seems to have receded

from the public eye, and what role is this company

playing today?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consumer supermarkets have been opened to

check  the  rising prices of goods. It is  to  the

credit  of  the Government to introduce  them.  In

spite  of  my complaint last year that  prices  in

some supermarkets were not as competitive as those

in  the private sector, they still sell many items

at  S  to  15  cents  more than what  the  private

dealers sell. Can something be done to improve the

situation?  Though prices may be going clown,  the

Government  must maintain and squeeze the  private

dealers out, especially those who are not fair  in

their  prices,  by  lowering  the  prices  at  the

supermarkets.  Sir,  I  would  also  request  that

before  any price increase of essential  foodstuff

is  allowed, the Minister should first  check  the

stock in order that the consumers or the merchants

do not lose in any way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Minister's stand on the subject of

the  13th  month payment? When this allowance  was

introduced,  it was made clear that  a  periodical

review  would  be  made in order  to  improve  the

situation.  Will  it  be  maintained  or  will  an

increase  be given? I would also like to know  how

many   civil   servants  have  been  given   merit

increments  last  year. I hope the  Minister  will

grant more merit increments to deserving and loyal

civil  servants. This merit increment will help  a

great deal to retain civil servants who are needed

and it will also he an incentive for others to get

increments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since my complaint last year on the filling

up of income tax forms there is a slight change in

the tax form for this year. There is now a section

for  inclusion of a claim for tax relief for  aged

parents.  However, I still say that the  tax  form

can  be further modified for easy completion.  One

way would be the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



"ticking"  method. I hope the Minister  will  look

into it and improve it in the coming year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Save Water" and "Save Energy" campaigns have

been  going  on for some time. This was especially

evident  during the energy crisis.  All  kinds  of

steps  were  introduced to curb power consumption.

Of late it would appear that there is a slackening

of  vigilance and a certain amount of complacency.

A  hue and cry is made only when someone steps  on

our toes. Why can we not maintain strict vigilance

over  the  need to cultivate the saving habit?  It

will be good for the country and the economy as  a

whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something is wrong with the way PUB bills are

drawn  up. There are far too many cases of persons

being   overcharged  and  suffering  losses   when

adjustments  are  made  in  the  charges.  Is  the

computer  working properly or does  it  require  a

little  bit  of oiling? It would appear  that  the

amounts in these bills fluctuate on the high side,

thus  creating some diffidence in the public  view

and also anxiety in that they are always paying an

increasing  amount. When the matter is brought  to

the  authorities concerned, the officials  scratch

their  heads and make adjustments in the following

month's   bill.   Why   should   there   be   such

discrepancies?  Can  the PUB  recruit  more  meter

readers  to  read the meters monthly  so  that  an

accurate  assessment can be made rather than  make

an  estimate which is usually faulty?  In  certain

areas  there are also inadequate meter readers  to

cope with the work.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Sir, the Member for Sembawang has asked quite a

number of questions. I do not know whether I  have

got  all of them down. I think he complained about

guidance to investors not being adequate and  that

they  were  not  told what industries  were  being

promoted.   He  also  complained  of   delays   in

processing applications, some of which took two to

three  years. On this particular comment, I  am  a

bit  surprised  because the  Economic  Development

Board is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



one  of  our most efficient institutions. I  think

its  record over the last 10 to 15 years has  been

quite good. It has had a reputation of being  able

to  reply  very promptly to applications  and,  in

some  cases,  it has given guidance  to  investors

within  two  or  three  weeks.  If  there  is  any

particular instance which has been brought to  the

Member's  notice, I would like to know  and  I  am

sure   the  EDB  also  would  like  to  know  what

particular  inefficiency has resulted  from  their

efforts to promote investment in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained about investors having

difficulty   in  purchasing  property   and   when

notified   by   the   Land   Office   that   their

app1ications  for purchase of property  have  been

rejected,  they have been to a lot of  trouble  in

recovering their deposits. On this matter, while I

take  general interest in it, the Land  Office  is

not under my jurisdiction. But I would say that in

many  cases,  where  the investors  are  going  to

reside  in Singapore, a high proportion  of  their

applications  has been approved. For  those  cases

which  have not been favoured by either  the  Land

Office  or by the Ministry of Finance, it  may  be

that  the  property applied for has very  generous

land areas. I think the idea is that the investors

should  be  enabled to settle in some place  which

would  give  them  peace of mind  and  ability  to

concentrate upon their industries. Beyond that,  I

do  not  think that it is our intention that  real

estate should be bought up even by investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked three questions. First, how

is  the  Minister going to encourage and subsidise

industries,   and   what   industries   would   be

subsidised in the present situation? The answer to

this  is  that all industries are welcome although

those   which   are  more  viable  under   present

circumstances,      such     as      shipbuilding,

shiprepairing, oil rig building, and machine  tool

industries  which service these industries,  would

be  given some priority. The assistance which  has

been given has been clearly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



made  available  in  the form of  tax  incentives,

export incentives, assistance with loan financing,

assistance    in    industrial    buildings    and

infrastructure. In the matter of export financing,

the  Monetary Authority of Singapore is finalising

arrangements to enable banks to rediscount  export

bills  with  the  Authority.  This  facility  will

provide  a cheaper source of finance for  exports.

Details of this arrangement will be announced very

shortly by the Monetary Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question, I think, is whether there is

any  further  relaxation on money supply.  In  the

case  of money supply, we have relaxed all  credit

controls  and  the banks are quite  free  to  lend

money without any limit to any particular industry

or industrial sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third question is on the difficulties of the

timber industry and he mentioned that I had stated

that  I  would  take note of the difficulties  and

refer  them  to the Timber Export Industry  Board.

This  matter  has been noted as promised  and  the

particular  section  of  his  comments  has   been

referred  for action by the Timber Export Industry

Board. I have not had any reaction as yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final suggestion which the Member made was in

relation to the Customs office in Jurong which, he

says, deals only with non-dutiable goods. I am not

familiar with this particular division of work  in

Jurong. But it seems a reasonable suggestion  that

there should he officers there who could also deal

with  dutiable  goods, and I will refer  his  very

useful  suggestion to the Customs  Department  for

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson asked questions on

recruitment of Singapore citizens into  the  civil

service  and  would  like to know  the  number  of

Divisions  I and II officers in the civil  service

as  at  the end of February 1975. The figures  for

February  1975 are not yet available, hut  figures

as at December 1974 show that there was a total of

21,160 officers in Divisions I and II in the civil

service, of whom 19,932 are Singapore citizens and

1,228 or 5.8% are non-citizens. Of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



these  1,228  non-citizens, 606  officers  are  in

Division I and 622 are in Division II. These civil

servants  may be considered for citizenship  after

five  years' permanent residence, instead  of  the

normal requirement of 10 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, I suppose, sonic advantages in having

a  civil  service  staffed entirely  by  Singapore

citizens. But it is not possible at this stage  of

Singapore's  development for the  Singapore  civil

service  to  be  so  staffed.  A  manpower  survey

conducted jointly by my Ministry and the  Economic

Research  Centre  of the University  of  Singapore

suggests that the manpower shortages of engineers,

architects, surveyors, doctors, dentists,  lawyers

and  technicians will continue in  the  l970s.  We

shall  not be able to train sufficient numbers  of

such  professional and skilled personnel from  our

own  citizens,  and  we shall  therefore  have  to

continue   to   recruit   non-citizens   if    our

development  programmes are not  to  be  adversely

affected. It is not possible for me, therefore, to

set  any  target date by which the  civil  service

will  be  entirely staffed by Singapore  citizens,

nor  do  I  consider it desirable that any  target

should be set.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has benefited from recruitment of non-citizens into our public service in the past

through  the system of open competition.  I  would

favour continuing to leave the door open. However,

the  Member for Thomson may rest assured that, all

things being equal, a Singapore citizen takes  and

will continue to take preference over non-citizens

in appointments to the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens touched on a

number of points. He gave me a lecture on the  way

I should present my Budget and explain the revenue

raising  measures to the public. Well, I  am  much

obliged for this little lesson on explanations  on

tax  problems.  I  realise, of  course,  that  the

explanations  on  why taxes  have  to  be  imposed

should  be  fair and coherent. If I am lacking  in

this particular quality on this particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



Budget  on  the 3rd March and 17th March,  I  hope

that   these  shortcomings  will  be  excused   by

Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the circumstances in which I made the

statements on taxes on cars in October 1972 and in

March  1975  are  quite different.  In  the  first

instance,  we  were in the rather  happy  position

that  we were not really short of money, even  for

development  purposes.  In  the  1975  Budget,   I

thought  I explained that there was a gap  between

the  revenue  we  had  and the total  expenditure,

including development expenditure, and therefore I

had  to  place greater emphasis upon the  revenue-raising aspect of the tax. I did explain that  the

effect  on  the car-using public was  a  secondary

objective,  and  hoped that there  would  be  some

psychological effect on people against using their

cars  - some encouragement would be given to  them

to adopt the Park and Ride scheme, and also adjust

to  the  limitation on people going to the Central

Business District during peak hours.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not there would be further

taxes,   this   would  depend  upon  the   traffic

situation  and perhaps upon the need  for  raising

further  revenue. I thought the tax  imposed  this

year  was  modest  but would have a  psychological

effect.  Anyway  I  hope that there  would  be  an

upturn  in the economy and it may not be necessary

for  me to come again for taxation for the purpose

of raising additional revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens also mentioned

the civil servants and the desirability that there

should  be  no smugness or complacency  among  the

civil  service.  I  quite  agree  that  our  civil

servants  should be as polite and  as  helpful  as

possible,  and  if  they  cannot  deal  with   any

particular  request of the public at a  particular

counter  or  in their own office then they  should

try  and  indicate where additional  help  can  be

obtained  and perhaps even help them in  referring

the  matter  to the particular office  that  deals

with the problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned my comments on the

civil service and the way in which they dealt with

problems.  He also quoted the two instances  which

had been raised by the Member for River Valley.  I

have  been  trying to trace these  two  particular

instances in my Ministry. I am afraid we  have  no

record  of them. I must assume that perhaps  these

examples  are,  if  not classical,  apocryphal  in

nature, and they probably sprang from the mind  of

the Member for River Valley. (I am sorry he is not

here.)  In  fact, it is like the fishermen's  tale

where  the  fish  grows bigger and  bigger.  These

blunders appear to have been magnified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, say that in particular matters

of this nature, technical officers have a tendency

to  try and blind the Ministry of Finance officers

with  scientific verbiage. They use a  description

to  try to frighten my officers in regard to their

ignorance. My Ministry has a part to play. We  are

guardians of public finance and we must  see  that

money  is  spent  in the way it  should  be  spent

without any extravagance. So even where we fear we

may  be ignorant, we still ask questions which  we

think  are  necessary. We should not be frightened

of  being  thought  ignorant by  asking  questions

which  we feel must be answered before we  can  be

satisfied  that  expenditure should  be  approved.

This is probably analogous to the patient and  the

doctor  (since doctors are mentioned) - the doctor

probably   knows   better  about   his   patient's

condition. The doctor can probably suggest that an

operation is very necessary to protect the  health

of  the patient, but finally it is the patient who

must   decide  whether  or  not  to   undergo   an

operation.  In the same way it is the Ministry  of

Finance which must decide whether or not money may

be   allocated  for  any  particular  purpose.  If

extravagance  is  allowed, and if departments  are

permitted  to  spend as they like, it  would  mean

that   the  burden  of  extravagance  would   have

eventually to be placed upon the shoulders of  the

public in the form of heavier taxation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I hope that my Ministry of Finance officers

are  sufficiently  capable of  distinguishing  50-cycle generators from 50 cycles and one generator,

I   agree   that  they  should  always  be   given

additional training. In fact, they have been  sent

to  the  Staff Training Institute even before  any

notice  is  taken  of any particular  officer  who

requires   special  training.  But  if  particular

officers do make blunders of the nature which  had

been  described by the Member for River Valley,  I

certainly  would consider that perhaps they  could

improve  by  undergoing  a  course  at  the  Staff

Training Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the comments of the Member for

Anson.  He  touched on such a variety of  subjects

that I will only answer those which come under  my

own  jurisdiction. He mentioned about chit  funds.

The  position is that since August 1972,  26  chit

fund  companies  have  been  wound  up.  Time   is

required  to adjudicate on claims and  recover  as

much assets as possible, and the interim dividends

can  only  be  declared  as  and  when  there  are

sufficient funds. The public is always informed of

such payments through press releases. The delay in

declaring   funds   was  caused  by   difficulties

encountered  in the collection of  debts  owed  by

debtor subscribers. In some cases court action has

to  he  taken  to recover such debts. To-date  the

Official  Receiver has declared interim  dividends

totalling  $9,264,638.15 to 43,026 subscribers  of

14  chit  funds. Between April and September  this

year  another 5,575 subscribers of 10  other  chit

funds  will be receiving their dividends totalling

Sl,950,527.  It is anticipated that a  second  and

final dividend for the two big chit funds will  be

paid  sometime  towards the end  of  the  year.  I

assure  the Member that the Government is as  keen

as  he  is  to see an early conclusion to  matters

connected with the closure of chit funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also expressed concern over recent

fluctuations in interest rates. Movements  in  our

interest  rates  have  been  to  a  large   extent

influenced by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



international events, and it is difficult  for  us

in  Singapore to insulate ourselves from movements

in  the  international monetary markets.  However,

there  is  no  indication  that  fluctuations   in

interest  rates in Singapore over  the  past  year

have  produced  adverse effects on  the  level  of

deposits  placed with banks and finance companies.

On  the  contrary,  these  deposits  continued  to

increase  and  at the end of February  1975  fixed

deposits with banks and finance companies stood at

$5,179.7  million compared to $4,601.2 million  in

July  1974.  For the same period savings  deposits

increased from $746.7 million to $792.5 million. I

would  like  to emphasise, however, there  is  not

much that the Government can do if individuals, in

their  hope  for  quick  gains,  take  unnecessary

risks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also asked why the Post

Office  Savings  Bank  cannot maintain  sufficient

funds  to  meet  withdrawals.  This  Savings  Bank

always  ensures that there is sufficient  cash  at

its   various  counters  and  branches   to   meet

withdrawals.   But   like  any   prudent   banking

institution it tries not to overstock liquid funds

at counters, since such funds do not earn interest

but only add on to costs. With the installation of

computerised  on-line  banking,  the  Post  Office

Savings Bank has in fact increased the amount that

may be withdrawn. At the Savings Bank counter in a

Post  Office  a depositor can now withdraw  up  to

$2,000  once a day, whereas previously  the  limit

was $500 once every three days. At any Post Office

Savings  Bank  branch  the  amount  that  can   be

withdrawn  is higher, namely $5,000 in  cash  once

every day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also enquired as to the activities of

the  Neptune  Orient  Lines and  Intraco.  Neptune

Orient  Lines' success should not be judged solely

by  the  record of its profits. The Government  is

not  disappointed  at  the progress  made  by  the

national shipping line. It is not the Government's

intention to curb the freedom of shippers for  the

short term benefit of Neptune Orient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



Lines  by making it compulsory for our exports  to

be carried on the national line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Intraco, its principal activity remains in

international  trading. Export sales  account  for

60% of the company's turnover. I am pleased to say

that,  since  its  inception  in  1968,  Intraco's

turnover  has  increased from $11 million  to  $63

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked about export promotion efforts

of  the  Government. I have made quite a  detailed

statement  on export promotion during  the  Budget

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also mentioned the re-discounting of export

bills just now in reply to the Member for Thomson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also touched on the higher

prices  being  charged  by consumer  supermarkets.

Consumer  supermarkets provide a valuable  service

in  stabilising prices of goods, particularly when

there  are unfounded rumours of shortages of goods

due   to   hoarding  in  anticipation   of   price

increases.  These supermarkets help to  force  the

private dealers to sell at reasonable and even  at

lower levels. However, because of higher overheads

and  a  faster  turnover of stocks, there  may  be

isolated  cases  where goods are  sold  at  higher

prices  in supermarkets as they have to pay higher

prices  for  new  stocks. In the  end  it  is  the

consumers  who  must  make every  effort  to  help

themselves and make more use of the information of

prices  supplied daily by the Department of Trade.

They   should  refrain  from  buying  from   shops

charging higher prices and instead patronise those

selling at fair prices.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked questions regarding the civil

service. On leave allowance, I would like  to  say

that  the  allowance  is fixed  according  to  the

divisional  status  of the  officer  and  not  his

grade.  An  increase in leave  allowance  is  only

given  if  the  officer is promoted  to  a  higher

division,  for example, a promotion from  Division

IV to Division IH. This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



because  under the old leave scheme  an  officer's

eligibility was based on his divisional status and

his leave would be revised to a higher rate on his

promotion   to  a  higher  division.   The   leave

allowance' compensates officers for the number  of

days'  leave  which  they  gave  up,  and  it   is

therefore not logical to allow a revision in leave

allowances  except when there is a change  in  the

divisional status of the officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's question regarding the 13th month

allowance,  it was quite clearly stated  when  the

allowance  was introduced that it was  not  to  be

confused  with  bonus.  A bonus  is  uncertain  in

amount and it may or may not be paid. But the 13th

month  allowance, like the National Wages  Council

payment,  is a wage supplement. These are  orderly

adjustments   of  wages  pending  a  comprehensive

revision of salaries. I see no reason why the 13th

month allowance should not be maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the merit increment scheme, I

recollect  explaining in the  last  Budget  debate

that  merit  increments are awarded  to  deserving

officers in the basic grades in the administrative

and  professional services. It is  meant  to  give

recognition  to outstanding officers who  are  not

yet  ready for promotion but who deserve a  faster

increase   in   their  salary  than   the   normal

increments  would  allow.  For  1974,   62   civil

servants were granted merit increments as follows:

two  were  given one increment; 59 were given  two

increments; and one was given three increments. In

addition   to   the   merit   increment    scheme,

outstanding  officers  in the  administrative  and

professional   services  may  be  considered   for

accelerated promotion. This will help  to  enhance

the quality of the civil service by attracting and

retaining every bright and capable officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to thank the Member for his

suggestion  regarding income tax forms.  I  assure

the  Member that in designing the income tax forms

convenience  of  the taxpayer is always  borne  in

mind. The Inland Revenue Department is continually

striving to improve and simplify the form as this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



not   only   benefits   the  taxpayer   but   also

facilitates processing by the department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment

on  the  Minister's reply in respect of  the  13th

month  payment. If I heard him correctly, he  said

that  the 13th month payment is a wage supplement.

By  that,  it would mean that it is a  form  of  a

deferred  wage which is paid to a public  employee

at  the  end  of  the year for his  12  months  of

service. I would presume that interpretation to be

correct.  If  the  13th month payment  is  a  wage

supplement, and if my interpretation is correct, I

wonder  whether the Minister would reconsider  his

earlier  decision not to pay public employees  who

retire prior to 31st December of any year. I  feel

it  is  only fair that they ought to be paid  this

wage supplement. If a public employee works for 10

months  or  11  months in the year, surely  he  is

entitled to that portion of the 13th month payment

on a pro rata basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will consider this point

because   this  has  given  rise  to  a   lot   of

unhappiness  among civil servants. Having  put  in

years  of  dedicated service,  just  because  they

happen to retire one day short of the full year in

the  year of retirement, they are deprived of such

a wage supplement, as the Minister calls it, which

is   due  to  them.  On  the  other  hand,  public

employees who resign after a very short period  in

the  civil  service enjoy the 13th month allowance

because  they choose to resign after  the  1st  of

January of the following year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the kind of situation that gives rise to

a  lot  of  discontent. Civil  servants  who  have

served  the Government loyally during their  whole

life  are in the last year of retirement not given

what is due to them. On the other hand, those  who

have  not  shown any loyalty know how  to  put  in

their  resignation at the proper time and so enjoy

the benefit of the 13th month payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will reconsider this matter

sympathetically. Even though it may  be  too  late

for some civil ser



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



vants  who have already retired, there is no  harm

because  the  decision  could  have  retrospective

effect, and this will make everybody happy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I do not think this is the particular place

for  me  to make a decision of this nature.  I  am

quite aware of all these representations. In fact,

this  is  not the first time that a representation

has been made and I do not think this is the place

for  me  to change the decision. I have  no  doubt

that  the  matter  raised by  the  Member  may  be

considered  again, hut I do not promise  that  any

consideration will lead to a positive result.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the Minister for his explanation and

I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past one week many Members have

criticised against undesirable attitudes of  civil

servants. Such criticisms are well-intentioned and

constructive in nature. The purpose is to help the

civil  servants  to  carry  out  their  duty  more

efficiently. In moving this amendment,  I  do  not

seek to criticise their attitude. I would like  to

fight for the benefits of the civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the civil servants are serving the country

and  the  people  loyally  and  faithfully,  their

welfare  should be looked after by the Government.

I  would like to lodge a complaint to the Minister

regarding    their   Municipal   Provident    Fund

contributions. I understand that on 26th November,

1974, the Ministry of Finance issued a circular to

the  effect that up to 31-12-74 members of the MPF

could  opt for conversion to the Central Provident

Fund scheme. Most of the civil servants opted  for

the  CPF  scheme. Under this scheme, the  members'

contributions will be credited into their accounts

in  the POSB. These contributions in the POSB will

then earn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



interest  as from 1st January, 1975. However,  the

Ministry  of  Finance has not yet paid  their  MPF

contributions into their POSB accounts.  I  wonder

when   will  their  monies  be  paid  into   their

respective POSB accounts. I hope that this  matter

of conversion and the payment of monies into their

POSB  accounts could be expedited. As a result  of

the  delay in crediting their POSB accounts,  many

civil  servants have lost a large sum of interest.

I  would  also  like to ask the  Minister  whether

their contributions will earn interest as from 1-1-75.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, under the special scheme offered to

Municipal Provident Fund members to withdraw from.

the Municipal Provident Fund, 1,005 out of a total

of 1,297 officers opted to join the CPF scheme and

to  have their MPF contributions transferred  into

their accounts with the Post Office Savings Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the large number of officers involved

in  the exercise, some delay in processing the MPF

contributions  for credit of the accounts  of  the

officers  is unavoidable. Each payment has  to  be

computed  by  the Accountant-General's  Department

and verified by the Audit Department. The position

is aggravated by the fact that the conversion date

coincided  with the closing date of the  financial

year of the Municipal Provident Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MPF rules do not provide for interest to be

credited  to a member who has withdrawn  from  the

MPF.  Interest, therefore, cannot  be  paid  under

present rules on contributions which have not been

paid  into  the  officer's POSB  account,  but  my

officers will do their best to cut down on delays.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1105*.



(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr N. Govindasamy.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government, as an employer, employs the

largest  number of workers. So the spate of  daily

staff  problems  and grievances in  such  a  large

service  must surely be innumerable.  It  requires

very  little  commonsense  to  understand  that  a

properly  constituted machinery  where  grievances

could be aired and problems attended to is a vital

prerequisite   to  good  industrial   relationship

between  the  Government as an  employer  and  its

employees.  But  one gets the impression  that  in

certain   departments  this  machinery   is   non-existent,  and where it exists one sometimes  gets

the  impression that the officers in  charge,  who

are   called  staff  officers  or  by  some  other

designation, do not seem to be competent enough to

deal  with  stall problems. A competent industrial

relations   officer  must  be  one  who  possesses

understanding and be able to temper decisions with

a  human  touch. One gets the impression that  the

only  qualification  all these  officers  have  is

their  ability  to quote relevant,  and  sometimes

also   irrelevant,  sections  of  the  Instruction

Manual in dealing with staff problems. A visit  to

a  staff  officer  reminds one of  a  visit  to  a

fortune  teller.  It  is not that  I  myself  have

visited  a  fortune teller. But from what  I  have

observed,  the authority of the fortune teller  on

the roadside is the book of oracle. If you consult

him,  he will use the book of oracle to tell  your

fortune.  While he understands what is written  in

the book of oracle, very often he cannot grasp the

significance of the text in that book. So we  have

the  staff officer who understands what is written

in the Instruction Manual, but very often fails to

understand  the  significance and  the  spirit  of

certain  sections in the Instruction Manual.  Like

the  incompetent  fortune teller, the  incompetent

staff  officer  gives  his  answer  each  time  by

referring  to the Instruction Manual as his  guide

and  authority. This must surely lead to a lot  of

unhappiness because the problems which are brought

up are very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



often human problems, and they must be attended to

with  regard to human feelings in order to  remove

the  grievances. Using the Instruction  Manual  as

the  only means of dealing with the problems  does

not  produce  that  kind of  effect.  So  we  find

problems  after problems coming up  in  the  civil

service  which are badly attended to and this  has

resulted in greater frustration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we hear in this House not only this

year but also for many years previously that there

are  frustrations  and  grievances  in  the  civil

service.  We also hear that it is not so much  the

quantum  of  pay that matters. Money  is  not  the

important  factor. There must be job satisfaction.

I think one of the causes of job discontent is the

lack of attention and the lack of care on the part

of  Government not only in constituting  a  proper

grievance  machinery to solve staff  problems  but

also in employing and training people to deal with

such  problems. It is necessary to train  officers

adequately to deal with such problems  in  a  more

qualified manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is this does the

Government  consider  that  attention   to   staff

problems  is  of vital importance in  ensuring  an

efficient  civil service? If so, is  it  not  true

that  the Government is not doing enough to ensure

that  the officers who man the grievance machinery

are competent enough? Should not the Government do

something  so  that problems can  be  solved  more

effectively  and discontent in the  civil  service

minimised? I would like to know from the  Minister

whether  there  are such plans afoot  and  whether

there  is going to be a change in its approach  in

dealing   with   staff   problems.   The   present

relationship  seems  to  be  that  of  master  and

servant.  If they do not like them, they  have  to

leave.  There  is  no  question  of  treating  the

officers with due respect. I do not think this  is

the  intention  of the political  leadership.  But

sometimes  because of an inadequate machinery  and

the  lack  of competent officers it can result  in

this sort of situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend

the Ministry of Finance for the improvement it has

made  to  the  format of the Main and  Development

Estimates  year after year. However, I would  like

to  make  two comments in respect of the Estimates

as presented this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first comment is that information on the staff

establishment  does not reflect the true  position

or the state of affairs in respect of personnel in

the Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second column in the Estimates gives the

number  of posts for the previous year. The  third

column  gives the provision of personnel  for  the

coming  year.  What is perhaps needed  is  another

column  next  to  tile establishment  requirement,

stating the actual staffing position. For example,

for  this  year it is stated that for  FY  74  the

Budget  Division was supposed to have 159 Division

I  officers,  but it is not known  how  many  were

actually  employed. But as I understand it,  every

one of the Ministers who spoke before the Minister

for  Finance  seemed  to be  talking  about  staff

shortages  in  their Ministries.  Perhaps  in  the

Budget  Estimates for next year we  could  see  an

additional  column showing the  actual  number  of

persons  working in each Department, and not  just

the establishment requirement alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second comment is this. If the Minister for

Finance could just turn to page 93 of the Main and

Development  Estimates, he would  notice  that  in

respect  of the salary of the Minister for Science

and  Technology  the wage mentioned  against  this

item  is  $7,000 per mensem but the  appropriation

for  FY  75 is only $42,000. Sir, it neither  adds

nor  multiplies. If the wage is $7,000 per mensem,

then  the  annual appropriation should be  $84,000

and  not $42.000. Sir, I know, and you know,  that

only  part of the Minister's wages is paid by  the

Government.  But the point is that  the  Main  and

Development  Estimates as a public  document  does

not  let everybody know that the Minister receives

only part of his wages from the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



I would have thought that a footnote at  the

bottom of the page or somewhere appropriate  could

be inserted to explain the difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am sorry to hear the Member for Moulmein's

comments  on  the  poor state  of  our  industrial

relations. I had the impression that our relations

with  the union representatives representing civil

servants  were  of the best, and most  harmonious.

This is certainly so over the last few years when,

I  think,  the question of wages was not  of  very

great relevance in our discussions because we give

regular  increases in salary. I would have thought

that under these circumstances there would be very

few complaints. Of course, our officials in charge

of industrial relations ought to be quite flexible

in  outlook  and not at all rigid.  They  are,  of

course,  bound by certain terms of reference  when

they go to the negotiation table, in the same  way

that  union representatives must be given  certain

terms  when they negotiate. But if, in fact, there

were  cases  where  we have  been  too  rigid  and

inflexible,  I  would like to know the  particular

instances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein must forgive me if I do

not  always accept general criticisms made  on  my

officers  by  persons who may sit on the  opposite

side of the negotiating table. In the same way,  I

do   not   always  accept  complaints   from   the

employers'  side  that union negotiators  are  too

rigid  and  inflexible.  I agree  that  industrial

relations  is  a very specialised field  and  that

there should be a special aptitude or training  so

that  negotiations will proceed more  smoothly.  I

think   some   of  my  officers  have   had   such

experience.  The Member for Moulmein may  wish  to

know  that one of the senior officers dealing with

industrial  relations  in  my  Ministry  had  been

seconded  to  the  NTUC Research Unit  and  served

there  for  seven  years.  So  he  should  not  be

insensitive   to  union  thinking  in   industrial

relations. Another senior officer has attended  an

overseas  course,  and  yet another  is  presently

overseas attending a six-month course with special

emphasis on industrial relations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah raised two matters.

He  also paid my Ministry some compliments on  the

improved  format of the Budget. But  he  suggested

that  there should be one further improvement  and

that  is the actual number of posts filled  should

also  be  shown in the Estimates. This is somewhat

difficult to adopt because the number varies  from

day to day depending on recruitment, transfers and

resignations. Since time is required to print  and

check  the  Estimates, the position shown  on  any

particular day when we prepare the Budget will  be

out  of  date  by  the  time these  Estimates  are

presented  to  Parliament.  Nevertheless,   I   am

grateful for having given thought to this  subject

and made the suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the provision shown in the Estimates

for  the  Senior Minister, Science and Technology,

the   explanation   is  that   the   appropriation

represents  the difference between his  salary  of

$7,000  per  mensem  as Senior  Minister  and  his

salary of $3,500 per mensem as Vice-Chancellor  of

the  University  of Singapore.  I  will  certainly

consider  for next year, if, in fact, it is  still

relevant,  the  suggestion of the Member  that  in

special  cases  like  this  an  appropriate   note

explaining  the position should be  given  in  the

Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, the reason for the Finance Minister to

think  that  there existed in the last  few  years

good industrial relations probably stems from  the

fact  that  there  has been an  absence  of  angry

speeches, strike notices and industrial action  on

the part of the civil service unions. But this has

got nothing to do with the speed and effectiveness

that  the grievances of the public employees  have

been   settled.  This  is  due  largely  to   very

responsible and reasonable attitude of trade union

leaders  whose  patience seems to be inexhaustible

in so far as staff relations affecting the kind of

unsatisfactory  attention from the  Government  is

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that there are a few such

qualified officers. I am not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



quarrelling  with the fact that there  are  a  few

competent  civil servants. But he must not  forget

that   there  are  so  many  thousands  of  public

employees. I believe the number of the monthly and

daily-rated employees exceeds 50,000.  With  three

or  four competent officers that the Minister  has

mentioned,  how  can they hope to  solve  so  many

problems  that  occur in the different  places  of

work? The three or four officers that the Minister

has   in  Fullerton  Building  is  not  all   that

sufficient. Competent officers must be present  in

the various Ministries, and not only that but they

must also be present in the different sections  of

the  Ministries because they have got a  very  big

staff. So I say that it is generally accepted that

a  sufficiency  of good personnel officers  is  an

important   prerequisite   for   good   industrial

relations  in the civil service. My  plea  to  the

Minister  is  that what he has at present  is  not

enough. He must increase the number. Probably  his

colleague, the Minister for Education, would  need

some   extra  qualified  and  competent  personnel

officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not complaining. The question is we must

always improve. If things work satisfactorily,  we

must  always aim for the better. That must be  the

objective.   While  generally  the  situation   is

satisfactory, there is much room for  improvement.

For a start, probably this could he one area where

he could look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I do not know whether my

colleague wants to raise any other matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes, I want to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> In that case, I will not withdraw my amendment

for the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in respect of staff, I am quite aware that

the staffing position changes. In the Estimates we

could  perhaps, give the staffing position  as  at

December of the year or at midyear. It would  give

us  some indication as to what the actual position

is. I think that would help us in our appreciation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



of  the  amount of work done by civil servants  in

the various Ministries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, my first comment on the

remarks  of  tile Member for Moulmein  is  that  I

accept his statement that there is always room for

improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Member for Telok Blangah, I will

give some consideration to put the actual staffing

position at particular dates if it is relevant.  I

think December may be suitable. But, as I say,  we

continually  keep on recruiting. We will  try  and

see whether in presenting tile format next year we

can  put  in  an  extra column. We will  also  see

whether  it  would be helpful to show  as  at  any

particular date how the actual staffing relates to

the  establishment  of  posts.  I  will  certainly

consider it for next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that the discussion

between  the  Minister  and  I  ends  in  complete

accord, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

J. F. Conceicao -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head V be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BBA 1109.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (4) has been withdrawn. Mr Chin,

amendment (5).



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CBA 1107.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years, Singapore has been affected

by  international inflation. The  prices  of  some

goods  have  accordingly  gone  up,  for  example,

bread,  kway  teow and mee. The  prices  of  these

commodities have been adjusted several  times.  In

fact,  "adjustment" means "price increase".  I  do

not  know  why the merchants do not use the  words

"price   increase"  but  prefer  to   use   "price

adjustment". Perhaps they want to use  euphemistic

words so as to confuse the minds of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these price increases are in multiples of 5

cents  or 10 cents. But during the second half  of

last year, food producing countries had reasonably

good  harvests.  Prices of basic commodities  have

come  down, but the prices of bread, mee and  kway

teow came down by only one cent or two cents.  The

increase  or decrease of prices of some  essential

goods  have  to  be approved by the Department  of

Trade.  Therefore,  I  would  like  to  ask   what

explanation can the Department of Trade  give  for

this  unreasonable situation. Bread, mee and  kway

teow are the daily staple foods of the people  and

changes  in prices affect their living to a  great

extent. Therefore, they are entitled to receive an

explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that retailers have a very unsociable

attitude  towards  consumers.  At  the  time  when

prices increase, they will immediately mark up the

prices  of  their existing stock.  But  conversely

when  the  prices of commodities come  down,  they

still  sell their existing stock at the same  high

prices.  This  is very unfair to the consumers.  I

would  ask  whether the Department  of  Trade  has

taken  any  action against such retailers.  If  no

action  has ever been taken, I wonder whether  the

Department  could  instruct the  wholesalers  when

selling  their  commodities to the  retailers,  to

mark  the  retail prices of those  commodities  in

order  to  prevent the retailers  from  exploiting

tile consumers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen :</b> Sir, I wish to congratulate the Member for

Aljunied  for  noticing  a  greater  tendency  for

prices to increase than to reduce. I cannot  claim

any   direct   responsibility  for  this   curious

economic    phenomenon.   The    Government,    as

represented  by  my Ministry, does  not  have  any

formal  control over the prices of  foodstuffs  in

Singapore, although we would like to be  satisfied

that price increases of essential commodities  are

justifiable on economic grounds. I think  in  most

cases, maybe in all cases, we are consulted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only suppose that the reason for this

tendency is that it is bad marketing strategy  for

a company to have a series



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



of small  price  increases, however justifiable,  for

its   products.  This  could  give  consumers  the

impression   that   the   company's   prices   are

continually rising and generate more ill-will than

necessary against the company. As a result, e is a

tendency   to   hold   back  small   eases   until

justification can be prod for an increase  to  the

nearest  round figure, say, 5 cents, 10  cents  or

even 50 cents, depending on the value the products

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, when prices of commodities

fall,   the   Government  has  often  urged   upon

companies that the benefits be immediately  passed

on  to  consumers. Consequently,  in  some  cases,

price  reduction  which they  reluctantly  concede

could be less than five cents ending on the prices

of  the  items concerned. It may also be  that  we

would  not as yet expect price reduces  to  be  as

large  as price increases, world commodity  prices

have  not  always fallen as rapidly as  they  have

risen.  Members may, however, like to  that  there

have been some cases of reductions in quanta of 10

cents, instance, prices of cooking oil in consumer

packs of various sizes have falls ranging from  20

cents to $1.50. But may I suggest that in the end,

it is duty of consumers themselves to be sure that

the  prices  will fall, and by larger  amounts  if

they so desire.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister not answered my

second    question   about   price   tagging    of

commodities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, these price tags have not been imposed by

regulations, many cases they are  the  result  of

efforts  of  CASE  and perhaps persuasion  by  the

Trade  Department officials. They  have  not  been

imposed  by regulations. I do not think that  they

are of much value because prices change so rapidly

that the traders can always suggest that they have

not  had  the  time yet to indicate  a  change  of

prices from previous rate to the prevailing rate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, whilst I agree with the Minister that it is

the duty of the consumers to ensure that prices of

commodities go down as fast as they go up, he must

consider  this very important point. The  consumer

needs commodities like bread, rice, kway teow, bee

hoon  and  so on. These are commodities that  they

cannot do without. So if consumers were to boycott

retailers   who  jack  up  their  prices   to   an

unreasonable extent, it is, I feel,  the  duty  of

Government  to  ensure that such exorbitant  price

increases do not occur in the market place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In more times than one the retailers have sought

the  permission of the Trade Department  to  raise

the  prices  of  commodities,  and  the  Consumers

Association  of Singapore has also been  involved.

But at each time they came up with arguments which

somehow  won over the Trade Department people  and

left the Consumers Association in a position where

it  was impossible to bargain for lesser increases

in prices. Therefore, I do not see any reason why,

when  the Trade Department notices that prices  of

commodities in world markets have dropped, they do

not  call up these retailers and CASE and come  up

with very strong arguments as to why the prices of

these  commodities  -  I am talking  about  staple

commodities  especially -should not  fall  in  the

same  proportion  as  the  fall  in  world  market

prices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I made it clear that some of the price

reductions  have  been the  result  of  the  Trade

Department  calling in the traders and  suggesting

to them that in view of the fall in food commodity

prices there should be reductions in the prices of

essential foods, like bread, rice and so  on.  The

result has always been a reluctance on the part of

these  traders. The reason why the falls have  not

been  in multiples of five cents is that they  try

to  get  away  with as little as possible  --  one

cent,  two  cents and so on. In some  cases,  like

cooking  oil and so on, there has been  a  greater

success  on  the part of our persuasion.  If  CASE

thinks  that  it  can help in persuading  them  to

reduce a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



greater  extent,  we will be  only  too  happy  to

accept any assistance it can give.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, can we be assured of the Trade Department's

assistance when we battle this matter out with the

retailers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Minister does

not seem to be able to do anything about it, I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head V be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead DAA 1105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received quite a number of complaints

from  principals of Government-aided schools  that

when  their  schools  are  due  for  expansion  or

reconstruction they have to apply for exemption of

tax  on  the  funds  to be raised.  Processing  of

applications  is very often delayed, and  approval

not  forthcoming. As a result prices  of  building

materials  would  have gone up several  times.  So

they have to take back their application forms and

to    submit   new   forms   again.   Very   often

contributions have been received but as they  have

not  yet  been granted a permit they cannot  issue

receipts for the donations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that all school building projects

approved  by the Ministry of Education  should  be

granted  exemption  of tax on  all  the  donations

received.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the existing procedures for application for

tax  exemption  by  educational  institutions   in

respect of donations for school building funds are

fairly simple. I am not aware that there has  been

any   difficulty  in  complying  with  them.   The

necessary  information  to be  submitted  includes

purpose  for which the funds are required,  amount

of  donations to be collected, details of  grants,

if any, from the Ministry of Education towards the

building project, and whether building plans  have

been  approved  by  the relevant authorities.  For

proper control of the donations, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



is  also  required that separate accounts be  kept

for  tile building project and the auditors of the

funds  will  have  to be approved  by  the  Inland

Revenue Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the relevant information is supplied and

requirements met, an application could be approved

and  gazetted  within two weeks. I  do  not  think

therefore  that  I  need  consider  the   Member's

suggestion  that  funds for all  such  educational

buildings should be exempted from taxation. It  is

very   necessary  that  there  should  be   proper

accounts  kept and that these donations should  be

also considered for eligibility for exemption from

income tax by people who make tile contributions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, it was not my intention to say that all

exemptions  can be dealt with in any  manner.  The

approval   of   these  applications  is   normally

delayed.  What  I  am trying to say  is  that  all

projects  supported by the Ministry  of  Education

should  be exempted by the Tax Department so  that

the  projects  can be proceeded with  as  soon  as

possible  and  the fund-raising campaigns  can  be

expedited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I do not know what is the difficulty. In

fact,  if  the  Education  Ministry  approves  the

building  obviously  it will receive  very  strong

support  from  the  Education  Ministry,  and  the

Income Tax Department will, as a matter of course,

approve them for tax exemption. There are so  many

examples of such applications and exemptions being

given  that I think it has now become  a  kind  of

routine. There should be no difficulty at all,  if

the   Member   for   Jurong  has  any   particular

difficulty,  perhaps he can get assistance  either

from  the  Education  Ministry  or  even  from  my

Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the Minister's reply, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead DEE 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members in this House must e read in the

press or in other reports t prices of real estate,

especially  in respect of residential  properties,

have e down tremendously during the last months or

so. In some instances the value has dropped by  as

much as 30% even 40%, so much so that there is w a

glut in housing stocks in the market. However, the

property  assessments  which  have  been  revalued

upwards  the  past, corresponding to the  increase

property  prices before 1974, have  named  at  its

peak.  Many people have said that this is like  an

oral  thermometer used by nurses  in  clinics  and

hospitals  measure the temperature of  a  patient.

goes  up  and  up,  registering only  the  highest

reading, but never comes down less treated with  a

violent  shake, rely a 30% or 40% drop in property

ices  is rather violent by any measure. Therefore,

I  wonder  if the Minister could inform the  House

whether  he has y intention to adjust the property

assessment correspondingly downwards view  of  the

current property market situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the Member for m Keat has been talking of

capital  values and the drop has been  in  capital

values.  The annual value of a property,  however,

is  based  on  rent, the annual .value  being  the

gross amount at which e property can reasonably be

expected be let from year to year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rents have not fallen, although the prices

of   properties  may  have  declined  in   certain

localities.  In  some  cases,  indeed,  they  have

risen.  So there is no justification for a general

reduction  in the annual values of properties.  In

specific  instances, it may  be  that  rents  have

fallen, it is therefore open to the owner  in  any

individual casa to object when the Valuation  List

for the ensuing year is open for public inspection

annually  in August. The tax system allows  annual

values  to  be revised regularly both upwards  and

downwards.  So  I would suggest that  the  violent

shaking   be   applied  by  the  owners   of   the

properties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, unfortunately appeals have rarely been

successful.   Despite  the  rather   disappointing

reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for head V be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 8201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this amendment I would like to ask the

Minister several questions relating to Jurong Town

Corporation and other relevant matters. I have  to

raise  them  under this subhead because  I  cannot

find   any  other  item  in  the  whole  Estimates

pertaining to the subject of my enquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Jurong Town there are two types of fiats,

the  standard,  low-cost flats and  the  executive

flats.  The low-cost flats are like the HDB flats,

and the purchasers of these flats can make use  of

their   CPF  contributions.  Purchasers   of   the

executive fiats, however, cannot make use of their

CPF'  contributions to buy them. The  Housing  and

Urban  Development Company is now building middle-class  type  of fiats for the middle income  group

and,  to my knowledge, applicants can make use  of

their  CPF contributions to purchase these  fiats.

Therefore, I would like to ask the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



Minister  whether  the  authority  concerned  will

allow  the  applicants to make use  of  their  CPF

contributions to buy the executive flats in Jurong

Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is in regard to sports and

recreational  facilities in Jurong  Town.  I  know

that  one of the aims of JTC is to provide  social

arid  recreational facilities for  the  people  in

Jurong   Town,   particularly  the   workers   and

residents.  In Jurong Town some sports  facilities

are  available  and  these include  a  stadium,  a

football  field  and a basketball  court,  etc.  I

would  like  to  know  whether  certain  community

organisations  in  Jurong  Town  which  have  been

registered  with  the Registrar of  Societies  can

make  use  of  these facilities and whether  their

applications   for  the  use   of   these   sports

facilities will be favourably considered or  given

certain  concessions. We all know that the rentals

or  fees  charged for such facilities  are  rather

high,  and since these organisations cannot afford

to  pay such high fees the sports facilities  will

be  hardly  used  and will be just  like  a  white

elephant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally I have no intention to raise my third

question  here, but now I feel I am duty-bound  to

raise it. At this time last year I had also raised

the  same question hoping that tile Minister could

supervise the JTC in its work. This concerns  tile

collection and disposal of rubbish in Jurong Town.

I  do  not  know  whether it  is  because  of  the

inability of the JTC to employ the required number

of labour to clear up the rubbish or whether it is

because   of  the  increase  in  the   number   of

structures or residents there that the rubbish  is

not  being  collected  daily.  On  many  occasions

rubbish is piled up for several days at a stretch.

It  has not been collected and sent to the rubbish

disposal  dump. This is detrimental to the  health

of  the residents and I have received a number  of

complaints  from  them. I would like  to  ask  the

Minister whether he has been supervising  the  JTC

in  regard to this matter. I hope I need not  have

to raise the same matter again next year. I also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



hope  that the Minister can take suitable measures

to deal with this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth question relates to Neighbourhood II

of  Jurong Town. It is called the Boon Lay  Garden

Estate.  The design of this estate is rather  odd.

It  was  only  designed for residential  purposes.

There was no provision for shopping facilities and

so  the authorities have to modify the residential

premises  for  use  as shops. Even  if  groceries,

clinics   and  other  types  of  shops   are   now

available,  there  is  still  a  shortage   of   a

particular type of shop, namely, the eating house.

Without  an eating house it is rather inconvenient

to  the  residents, especially single workers.  It

would be most difficult for them to go anywhere to

get  food. So they will have to travel to  the  13

1/2m.s. Jurong to get their food. I would like  to

ask  the  Minister  whether  he  can  remedy  this

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the purchaser of an executive flat in Jurong

Town  is not at present allowed to use his CPF  to

purchase  the  fiat. I realise that purchasers  of

HUDC fiats have only recently been allowed to  use

their CPF contributions. I have not yet considered

whether  purchasers  of  the  executive  flats  in

Jurong Town should be given the same privilege.  I

think  there  are certain conditions in  the  HUDC

scheme which would be quite different from the JTC

one.  At  present, CPF money can only be used  for

the purchase of low-cost fiats in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding tile second question on the hiring of

sports facilities, these are already subsidised by

the  Corporation  as  the football  field,  sports

stadium, swimming pool and other courts are  built

at  high cost with public money. I understand that

the  Corporation follows the similar  practice  on

the  comparative rates set by other  bodies  which

provide  for  concession  rates  for  schools  and

registered  sports bodies but they  charge  higher

rates for commercial users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third question regarding refuse collection

from  blocks  of  fiats  to  the  bin  centre,   I

understand  that  this is now  being  carried  out

every  day by a contractor appointed by the Jurong

Town



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



Corporation. A competent contractor was  appointed

recently to provide the service and with effective

supervision   the  work  is  being   carried   out

efficiently.  The  refuse  removal  from  the  bin

centre to the dumping ground is carried out by the

Ministry of the Environment, and this is also done

daily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth question regarding coffee shops and

eating   houses,   I  understand   that   in   the

residential   area  Neighbourhood  I,   which   is

virtually completed, there is provision for  eight

eating  shops  together  with  four  other  hawker

centres.  In  Neighbourhood Ii, where about  3,500

fiats  have been completed out of a total of about

10,000  fiats,  provision is being  made  for  136

shops  of  which about ten will be set aside  for

eating houses. In addition, a hawker centre with a

total  accommodation of 162 stalls will  be  ready

within the next three to four months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, concerning the use of CPF

contributions for the put-chase of executive flats

in   Jurong   Town,  I  hope  the  Minister   will

reconsider this matter seriously. If the HUDC  has

a scheme governing such privileges, I hope the JTC

will  also apply the same regulations in the  case

of  their  executive fiats. I do not know  whether

the Minister' will agree to this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the JTC executive flats are not purely for

our  citizens.  The idea was that  the  executives

living  in  Jurong should be enabled to apply.  So

the  conditions  of  the JTC executive  fiats  are

quite different from those of the HUDC. However, I

will  be prepared to look into this matter to  see

if anything can be done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of the assurance given by the

Minister, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $647,050,890 for Head V ordered to

stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $707,110,500 for Head V ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore Mr Deputy Speaker left time Chair of

time Committee and took time Chair of time House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to report that the
