<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Chay Wai Chuen].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh asked

about the progress of the Asian IT Belt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Internet revolution started around 1994 in USA.

In  the  first  five  years of the Internet  revolution,  the

revolution  was very much US-centric.  As a result,  USA  was

able  to pull far ahead of the other regions of the world  in

this  IT  revolution.   The  European  community,  under  the

coordination of the European Commission, decided to come  out

with  a concerted response.  Last year, they launched the  e-Europe   Initiative.   Basically,  e-Europe  is  a  concerted

response  from the European community to make  Europe  an  IT

powerhouse   and  become  active  players  in   this   global

revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Asia-Pacific, obviously we are not in any

position  to  do  so  because  the  Asian  economies  are  in

different  stages of development.  Also, we do  not  have  an

Asian Commission to do this kind of coordination.  But having

said  so,  it would still be highly desirable for some  Asian

countries and economies to find ways to work together so that

we  can pool our resources and expertise, so that Asia  as  a

whole  can  come out with the necessary response and  not  be

left  behind.   It  is  with this intention  that  our  Prime

Minister suggested the idea of the Asian IT Belt.  The  whole

intention is for some leading cities in Asia to link up  with

each  other  and provide the backbone of the IT belt  in  the

Asia-Pacific.  Over time, the other cities, as and when  they

are ready, can join this IT Belt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We envisage that this Asian IT Belt would comprise five

main  thrusts.   The first thrust is e-Infrastructure.   This

would include broadband connectivity as well as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



the standardisation of e-business rules and regulations.  The

second   thrust  is  e-Markets.   To  facilitate   the   mass

deployment of applications and services across Asia, we  need

to  put  in place some standardisation.  For example, in  the

case of secured transaction, we need to implement PKI (Public

Key  Infrastructure).   The third  area  is  e-Capital.   For

example,  the flow of venture capital fund within  the  Asia-Pacific,  so  that  funding support  for  entrepreneurs  will

become  more effective across Asia.  The fourth  area  is  e-Talent.  Basically, to work together on the development of IT

manpower,  and  facilitate freer flow of IT  manpower  across

cities  within Asia.  And last, but not least, is the concept

of  e-Ideas. Basically, it is for the Asian community to come

together   to  work  together,  to  innovate  with   emerging

technologies and come out with new ideas to exploit  the  new

potential of IT.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that by pursuing these five key thrusts, we

will  be  able to create a more conducive environment  within

Asia  to  facilitate the growth of e-commerce and e-business.

Over  time,  we  hope this will serve as a  backbone  for  IT

development  in  Asia,  and that more  and  more  cities  and

countries  will  come on board.  We would  then  be  able  to

realise our vision of a Digital Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked what are the concrete plans to

realise  this vision.  Sir, this being a regional initiative,

what  we  are doing now is to talk to like-minded  cities  to

pursue this vision.  Realistically speaking, we hope to start

with maybe three to five cities in Asia.  With these three to

five  cities, we can provide the first-cut backbone  for  the

Asian IT Belt.  As I said, over time, maybe more cities  will

come  on board.  Working together, we can realise the  vision

of a Digital Asia, hopefully sooner rather than later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, the Government

came  out  with  a World Class Land Transport  document  some

years  back  when it set forth its vision for  a  deliverable

World Class Land Transport system for Singapore.  In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



process  of  implementing this plan over the  years,  it  has

achieved  several important milestones, like ERP, inter-modal

seamless  transfer,  North-East  line,  and  LRT.   Will  the

Minister  update  the  House  on  the  programmes   and   his

Ministry's vision of a World Class Transport system?  Can  he

also  comment on the quality of service, for example, quality

of  ride,  time  to destination, accidents, schedules,  apart

from the infrastructures?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, as an

open  economy, we must have a highly efficient land transport

system  to  ensure free traffic flow.  Our public  roads  are

like the blood vessels in our body.  There should not be  any

blockage,  otherwise our economy would suffer  great  losses,

and our livelihood would be affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance and results of the Land Transport

Authority  (LTA) since its establishment in 1995,  have  been

very commendable.  But we must not be complacent.  With rapid

development, we must strive to achieve further progress  upon

our  current  success.  Right now, we have to review  to  see

whether we have effectively implemented the White Paper on  a

World  Class  Land Transport network, including the  proposed

Singapore Underground Road System (SURS).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, more importantly, we should be able to move

at  a  faster  pace to improve the public transport  for  our

people.   With  the completion of the airport extension  line

and   the  North-East  line,  will  the  Government  consider

extension  of  the rail network to link up the major  housing

estates  in Singapore, so that these housing estates  can  be

better  served  by  public transport?   Will  the  Government

consider  bringing  forward the plan to bring  LRT  to  other

housing  estates,  like  Sengkang and  Bukit  Panjang?    LTA

should  let  our people know by announcing  the schedule  and

implementation  plan for such a scheme  so  that  our  people

could plan for their future transport arrangements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with greater efficiency and speed in the

construction of public housing in new towns, I hope LTA  will

also  have  better  coordination with the relevant  agencies,

like HDB, URA and Ministry of Education.  Take Sengkang,  for

example.  Before the commission of the Sengkang East Road  on

22nd January, the old Punggol Road was the only approach road

to the new town.  This two-way narrow road had only two lanes

on either side, causing great inconvenience to the residents.

This  makes  us wonder if there is a lack of coordination  in

the  overall planning.  Because of earlier partial completion

of  the  new town, the school has to start operating earlier.

Nan  Chiau  Primary School  was opened on 2nd  January.   But

right  now,  buses  cannot stop by the  side  of  the  school

because  the  bus stop has not been approved by the  relevant

authority.   Therefore,  we  can  see  there  is  a  lack  of

coordination  here.   I  hope  that  the  various  Government

agencies can improve their coordination.  They cannot proceed

by the original schedule.  They must be more flexible to take

into  account  the  development pace and  the  needs  of  the

residents  to  make  timely adjustment to  the  plan  through

better coordination among the various agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of developments to the Hougang New Town,

Punggol  Central  and  Punggol South.   But  right  now,  the

residents  still  need  to  wait  for  bus  services  to   be

strengthened in this area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, the Ministry has announced that

the  open  bidding for COE will start sometime in the  second

quarter of this year.  Will the Minister inform the House why

there was this delay and what is the situation for the trials

and launch of this open bidding for COE?  Given that this  is

quite  a big system, there should be sufficient trials before

the  launch.   Singaporeans  are quite  intolerant  of  these

glitches, especially in the area of COE, where everyone is an

expert and has something to contribute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that there will be both closed and

open  bidding on alternate fortnight running parallel.  Given

that there will be disparity in the outcome of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



two  processes,  how  does  the  LTA  intend  to  manage  the

disparity in outcomes, or merge the processes in phases?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister also update the House on the new quota

for  the  new  year  and whether there  will  be  any  review

mechanism to be considered?



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, with the

forthcoming introduction of open bidding, it may be timely to

reconsider the bases of allocating COEs.  Currently, COEs are

allocated  for the different categories.  For motor vehicles,

there  are category A for cars with engine capacity of up  to

1600  cc; category B for cars with engine capacity above 1600

cc; and category E, which is open and can be used to register

any  type  of vehicle.  There used to be more categories  and

allocations, unfortunately started on a historical basis, and

have  only  served  to perpetuate the historical  pattern  of

demand.  To some extent, collapsing the old categories I  and

II  into  category  A has helped the situation.   There  were

times  when  the prices of category I COEs, that is  for  the

small  cars  of up to 1,000 cc, exceed that for  category  II

COEs  for cars with engine capacity between 1,001 cc and 1600

cc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that bidding for COE in any category was

open  to  everyone.  There was no practical  way  of  keeping

category I COEs only for those with a more modest budget.  On

the other hand, a limited supply of COEs in any category will

result  in  a higher pricing if the demand is there.   Having

different  categories  and varying supplies  make  the  whole

process   of   understanding  how  the   COE   system   works

unnecessarily complex.  It is not surprising that most people

would  gladly  leave  it  to the car dealers  to  handle  the

bidding on their behalf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that the entire supply of COEs

available at each bidding be placed in a single pool.  People

should  just  bid for COEs from the pool.  In this  way,  the

supply  for  any category of cars would automatically  adjust

according to the demand for that bidding.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having secured the COEs, there are two approaches. The

first approach will require all successful bidders to pay the

same lowest successful price.  The second approach will adopt

the successful bid price, as that for registering Category  A

vehicles,  and  the price for registering a  larger  capacity

vehicle  would be on a multiple of this base price.  One  can

make a very strong case for either approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would suffice to simplify the system by pooling

all  the COEs.  I believe it would lead to a more stable  COE

pricing  and also a simpler system would encourage people  to

do the bidding themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would

like  the  Minister to review the effectiveness of using  the

COE  system to regulate traffic flow on our roads.  The  cost

of  owning cars in Singapore is extremely high as compared to

the   cost   of   owning  cars  in  most   other   countries.

Singaporeans  travel quite frequently nowadays and  they  are

conscious of how costly it is to own cars in Singapore vis-a-vis  other  countries.  This can be attributed,  in  a  large

measure,  to  the  artificial cost of having  to  pay  for  a

certificate to entitle them to own a car.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COE prices fluctuate every month, sometimes, with huge

pendulum swings.  Such fluctuations impact buyers of new cars

and  second-hand car sales.  Those who bought brand new  cars

at  a  higher COE will find it financially not viable to sell

their cars when the COE prices have dipped.  Second-hand cars

that are of a cheaper range are usually those at the tail end

of the 10-year COE period.  In no time, such buyers will face

a  dilemma  of  having  to fork out  a  large  sum,  ie,  the

prevailing premium to renew the COE for another 10 years,  or

renew  it  for five years, and scrapping the car  thereafter.

In  essence,  therefore, a car owner's COE dilemma  continues

even after he has owned a car.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, Sir, many Singaporeans, including our

aspiring younger generation, find it extremely difficult  and

complicated  to own a car in an island that we want  them  to

call  our  home.  Singaporeans, especially those  with  young

children  and  elderly parents, would like a more  convenient

and  effective means of driving their infants,  children  and

elderly  about  in  their  own cars  during  off-peak  hours.

Cheaper cars would also benefit retirees who are looking  for

cheaper  or  second-hand cars without the fuss of  having  to

fork out another sum of money for COE renewal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we can find a creative answer to help

them  achieve  this.   After all, notwithstanding  the  great

improvements in public transportation, the MRT and  buses  do

not  take the elderly and the children right to their  homes.

And  at  certain times, at certain places, and peak hours  in

Singapore, to catch a taxi would mean an intolerable  waiting

time.   Our main concern is to control the number of cars  on

the  roads,  especially  during  peak  hours,  owing  to  the

economic opportunity cost of road congestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewing from this standpoint, it becomes less relevant

to  consider the number of cars owned by Singaporeans at  any

one  time.   If the number of cars on the roads  during  peak

hours does matter, then we should implement measures to  deal

with  this rather than curtail car ownership.  Let the family

buy  cheaper  cars  and use them over the weekend.   Let  the

retirees  buy cheaper cars with lesser COE renewal fuss,  and

let them use the cars during off-peak hours or periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the ERP system, we are harnessing technology to

better control the flow of road traffic using the pay-as-you-drive  principle.   Let  there be less artificially  injected

costs  so  that more people can own cars and make  those  who

drive during peak periods pay more for the use of the roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have implemented, modified and fine-tuned the

COE  system  over  many years.  With the advent  and  use  of

technology that allows us to better control the

flow of road traffic using the pay-as-you-drive principle,  I

suggest  that  it  is time for us to review the  COE  system.

Hence,  I  would  like the Minister to enlighten  us  on  how

useful is the ERP system as a means to regulate the number of

vehicles  on  the  road and whether his Ministry  intends  to

gradually  phase  out  the  COE system,  thereby  making  car

ownership more affordable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Sir, I would like the Minister to

consider  a  few  proposals in respect  of  the  COE  system.

Firstly,  can the small car categories in the bidding  system

be  reinstated,  as the experiment to date is not  conclusive

that buyers of below 1,000 cc cars are better off?  Secondly,

can  the Minister consider allowing COE renewals for a  five-year period without having to scrap the car thereafter?  This

will  make it cheaper for car owners to continue owning their

cars and for low-budget buyers in the second-hand market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> The principle behind offering COEs,

through  a  bidding  system, is to  allow  market  forces  to

determine   the   pricing  and,  indirectly,  influence   the

direction of COEs to those who need them most and are willing

to pay the price.  The common practice of packaging COEs into

car  sales  has  distorted the mechanism  and  therefore  the

pricing  of COEs cannot be said to be influenced strictly  by

demand pattern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the package deals, COEs are subsidised. Instead of

lowering  the prices of cars when the cost is down, a  dealer

will  prefer to subsidise the COE.  After all, a sale is  not

completed until the buyer is able to register the car.   From

the  perspective  of the buyer, leaving it  all  to  the  car

dealer in the package deal simplifies his life.  In addition,

by  not lowering the car price and, instead, subsidising  the

COE,  the  buyer  is  greatly assisted in  obtaining  maximum

financing of the purchase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, it would appear that the present arrangements

would benefit everybody.  I, for one, have always gone for  a

package deal and it is so convenient.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



I  am  raising this subject as I believe that, in the  longer

term,  it would better serve the consumer if the process  for

gaining  a COE is separated from that for purchasing  a  car.

By  breaking  up  the two functions, COE pricing  would  more

closely  reflect market demand.  Having obtained a  COE,  the

consumer  would then shop around for the best deal  in  town.

Since the prices of cars will no longer include the price  of

a COE, consumers would be presented with a clearer picture of

the pricing and make better judgement on the deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with the information, such as the open market

value  of  the car and the taxes that go with it, a  consumer

can gauge the amount of premium he has to pay in choosing one

car  over  another.  The present situation  allows  for  some

package  deals to cloud the judgement of the buyer.  In  many

cases,  a  consumer  wrongly believes that  a  COE  has  been

guaranteed only to find that he has to pay an additional  sum

of  hard  earned  money to buy the car he has  committed  to.

With the introduction of open bidding, it is time to consider

making  this  change  and stop cars  from  being  sold  as  a

package,  which includes the COE.  Consumers are  now  better

placed to make informed judgement and allowing package  deals

to flourish cannot be in the interest of consumers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, first, let me answer

the two cuts from Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang  on

world  class  transport.  Sir, both Mr Chay and Mr  Yeo  have

asked  for  an update on what has been achieved in the  White

Paper so far.  Mr Yeo has also asked whether we can speed  up

the  expansion of the rail system and in fact whether we  can

link  up  the different housing estates with the rail network

and  whether  we  are going to expand the LRT  to  the  other

housing  estates,  just as we have done  for  Bukit  Panjang,

Sengkang, and, later on, Punggol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first give an update on what we have

achieved in the White Paper so far, as requested by both MPs.

Sir, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



White  Paper  sets out four initiatives.  These are,  namely,

improving  public transport, developing a comprehensive  road

network,  demand  management measures on car  and  integrated

transport and land use planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go through them briefly. Sir, the land transport

system, the cornerstone of that system, is really our  public

transport system.  This is an area that we are focusing a lot

of  our  resources on.  Our aim is to have an expanded  Rapid

Transit System (RTS) such that it is comprehensive in network

coverage  and it is easily accessible.  Members  will  recall

that  in  the White Paper, we had envisaged a long-term  rail

network  of  160  km,  and when we say "long  term",  we  are

talking about 30 years.  At the time when the White Paper was

prepared  in 1996, the rail network at that time  was  67  km

long.   Today,  I  am happy to inform Members  that  the  RTS

network  is  now 92 km long, ie, we are more than halfway  to

the long-term target.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On recent achievements, LTA completed the Bukit Panjang

LRT  system in November 1999 and the Expo Station in  January

this  year.   In the next few years, we will be  opening  the

North-East line, the Sengkang LRT, the Dover MRT Station, the

Changi  Airport Extension, the Marina line, and  the  Punggol

LRT  line.  Sir, the completion of all these projects by year

2005 will bring the RTS network to a total of 146 km, ie,  we

are about 90% to the long-term target by year 2005.  Sir,  in

answer to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, in effect, we are actually  very

far ahead of what was envisaged in the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the linkage to the other housing estates and

whether  we are going to expand the LRT to the other  housing

estates as well, I would like to inform Members that  LTA  is

actively  studying  the  other  rail  projects  and  we  will

announce  the  projects as and when they are  finalised.   In

terms  of the LRT for the other housing estates, now that  we

have  one  operational in Bukit Panjang and we are  going  to

have the second operational very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



soon  next year in Sengkang, what LRT would like to do is  to

step  back  and  observe  how  well  these  two  systems  are

performing  and  how  do they compare  versus  the  bus-based

system for housing estates.  The system is very expensive and

it is prudent for us to make a review before deciding whether

to  further expand the system to the other housing estates in

the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good news for Members is that, over the long

term, instead of the rail network of 160 km, we envisage that

the  long-term  network  will now stretch  540  km.   So,  in

effect,  we  are  going to make the rail  network  the  basic

infrastructure for public transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of developing a comprehensive road network,

again, LTA has managed to proceed ahead of what was envisaged

in the White Paper.  By the end of last year, LTA had already

added 415-lane-km of roads.  This is much higher than the 225-lane-km targetted by the end of 2001, as set out in the White

Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of demand management measures, as you

know,  we  have  implemented ERP, as proposed  in  the  White

Paper.   It  is working very well and it is able  to  control

congestion  on the major roads.  And because ERP  is  working

very well, we do not need to expand the ERP system beyond the

current gantries.  However, if the congestion does worsen  as

the  vehicle  population  grows, then  ERP  may  have  to  be

expanded to cover other areas and other parts of Singapore as

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vehicle quota system (VQS) has indeed been

helpful in keeping the car population down.  Just now two MPs

raised points about the VQS.  I will reply to that later on.

<br>1.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last pillar of the White Paper was the

integrated  transport and land use planning.   Here,  LTA  is

working very closely with URA and HDB on integrating land use

in terms of town and transport planning.  This will enable us

to optimise the use of our land and to maximise the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



benefits of the integrated land transport system to consumers

and  to  residents.  As an example of the collaboration  with

URA  and HDB, the hon. Member for Sengkang would realise that

we  are seeing there the integration, in terms of the use  of

the  MRT  and  LRT  stations  together  with  the  commercial

operations, which will make the town a lot more attractive as

well.    The   other   example  of  the  building-cum-station

integrated development is the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station,  which

should be open very shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we can say that LTA has, indeed,

made  good  progress in the five years since the White  Paper

was released, and we are on track to developing a world-class

land transport system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked about the coordination

amongst  LTA  and  other agencies.  I understand  that  point

would  be  brought  up again later, and we will  answer  that

together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have four Members talking on COE. Let me reply

to them one at a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Chay asked about open COE: why the delay, when

will  it  be  launched, and whether there will be  sufficient

trials  because the public will not tolerate any glitches  to

the  system.  He has also asked for information  on  the  new

COEs  for  the next quota year (QY).  I will go  through  his

points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the delay to the open COE system? Sir, the online

COE  bidding  system that is being worked on at  the  present

moment is a very complex system.  As such, the contractor has

had to spend a little bit more time than originally envisaged

to  make  sure that the different elements of the system  are

well designed, and the software is written up properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the contractor has, in fact, completed the

development of the various components of the system.  What is

happening now is that LTA and the contractor are carrying out

a series of very comprehensive tests on the system.  This is,

as  Mr  Chay  had pointed out, to ensure that the  system  is

totally debugged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



before we launch it to the public.  We expect to complete the

tests by the second quarter of this year.  If everything goes

fine  with the tests, we should be able to see the  open  COE

system being launched around June or July this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the system is launched, we will introduce it on a

trial  basis  and, during the trial, as Mr Chay  had  pointed

out,  we are going to alternate between the open COE and  the

present closed COE bidding system.  The bidding will be  done

every  fortnightly.  What we will do is we would then  divide

that  month's COE into two portions:  one half for  the  open

COE  bidding and, a fortnight later, the other half, for  the

closed  COE bidding system.  As the two bidding systems  will

have  different  characteristics, it is quite  possible  that

they  will  also  have  quite different  outcomes.   We  will

evaluate the outcomes from the two bidding systems during the

trial  period,  and  correct any  shortcomings  that  may  be

observed   with  the  new  open  bidding  system.  LTA   will

discontinue  the closed bidding system once the open  bidding

system  has  stabilised, and the public  is  comfortable  and

familiar with the new system.  We expect the trial period  to

last between six to twelve months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the new COE supply for the new quota year,

Sir,  Members will be happy to know that the Government  will

continue  to  allow  for  a 3% growth  rate  in  our  vehicle

population   for  the  new  quota  year.   Based   on   LTA's

computations, the COE quota for QY2001 will be 86,831.   This

is  about  20% lower than for QY2000, but it is  much  higher

than  the  quota for the previous years.  As an example,  the

COE  quota  for  QY2001 is 27% higher than the QY1999  quota.

LTA  will  be  releasing more details  of  the  annual  quota

shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee has proposed that we come up with a single

pool  of  COEs, and he has given two options, if  we  have  a

single  pool.  One, let all the bidders pay the  same  price,

or,  two,  let them bid but use a multiplier to differentiate

between the different engine sizes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, this issue of whether to have a single

pool  of  COEs is not a new one.  The GPC had very  carefully

considered  this  question when reviewing the  Vehicle  Quota

System  in  1999.  It is fair to state that, from the  public

transport  point of view, having one category  of  COEs  does

make  for  efficient  allocation.   Basically,  what  we  are

interested in is:  how many vehicles are we going to have  on

the  road, and whether the vehicle has a bigger engine  or  a

smaller  engine.   In terms of road use, it does  not  really

make much difference.  In terms of efficiency, what Mr Gerard

Ee  has mentioned is correct.  However, the feedback from the

public  was  that some segmentation of the COE  quota  system

would  be  useful for social equity reasons  because  of  the

concern  that  if  we  do not have separate  categories,  the

potential  buyers of small cars may be squeezed  out  by  the

buyers  of the bigger and more expensive cars.  As such,  the

Committee  recommended that, as a first step, we  proceed  to

only merge the car COE categories from four to two, which  is

what we have today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of whether we should have a single pool, but

still  differentiate by having a multiplier,  the  complexity

that  is  going to be introduced is not going to make anybody

any  happier.   How do we allocate the multiplier?   Whatever

figure we pluck out from the air is not going to make anybody

happy  at  all.   So, I think the present system  is  working

well.   We  only  have the two categories for  vehicles  and,

therefore, it is working.  I think it is better that we stick

to  it.  Let us have the open COE bidding first, see how that

goes and, if the indications are that it makes sense later on

to  have a single category, I am sure the Government will  be

very happy to consider that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his point that having the different categories, in

effect,  fit  the  relative size of  each  sector,  based  on

historical  figures, I think Mr Ee need not worry about  that

because  we have thought about it.  That is why we  have  the

open  COE category: so that if there are more buyers  bidding

for small cars, for example, instead of all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



going  for  the  small car category and bidding  up  the  COE

prices,  they can still go into the open COE market  and  bid

for  the  open  COEs.   So  there is a balancing-tank  effect

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong lamented about the high cost of car

ownership in Singapore.  Sir, I think it is useful for us  to

take  a  step  back  and see whether we should  be  comparing

ourselves with countries which do not have space constraints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the reason why we need to have a very

strong  control on car population is that we are  land-short.

In  fact,  we  should be comparing ourselves with  the  major

cities of the world, like New York.  Very few people who live

and  work  in  New  York expect to own a car,  and  Singapore

really is a major city.  We do not have the open spaces where

we  can  have  a half-an-acre home and park 10  cars  in  the

driveway.    Unfortunately,  in  Singapore,   there   is   no

alternative  to  having  controls  over  the  car  population

because we have very limited land for roads and we have  very

limited  land for parking cars.  In fact, roads today already

take  up  12% of our total land space, and this is equivalent

to  the total land area used for residential housing.  So  we

are already using whatever land we have for roads, and it  is

going to be very difficult to build a lot more roads.  It  is

also  going to be very difficult to build much more car parks

in existing housing estates.  If we look at the older housing

estates like Toa Payoh, Queenstown, etc, the parking capacity

is  already  very, very tight.  So we must control  both  car

ownership as well as car usage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I think Mr Noris Ong made an interesting point.

He  is  asking us to reinstate the category for  small  cars.

This is in contrast to what Mr Gerard Ee has asked for, which

is  to  merge everything into one category.  This shows that,

really,  the  issue  of car ownership and  usage  is  a  very

complex one, and we will have to try to balance all interests

as much as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has also asked that we make it possible for car

owners who want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



revalidate  their COEs to do it on a five-year  basis  rather

than  on  a  10-year basis.  This issue was  again  discussed

quite extensively previously, and the reason for having  that

10-year COE is, again, an equity reason, because the new  car

buyers are buying COEs on a 10-year basis and, therefore, the

lifetime of each COE is really for a 10-year period.  And  if

a  car owner feels that his car has been very well maintained

and can last another 10 years, he is free to revalidate for a

full  10 years.  In fact, he can do it indefinitely, as  long

as  the  car  is  well maintained.  But we do recognise  that

there  will be other owners who do not feel that the car  can

last  10  years and therefore, we have made it  possible  for

them  to  have a final revalidation of the COE for  a  5-year

period,  ie,  this  5-year period  is  not  meant  to  be  an

instalment  payment scheme.  We should leave  the  instalment

payment scheme to the financing agencies.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee also touched on the point of package deals

for  COEs.   He  himself  recognises that  this  package-deal

system is actually a very convenient one and, in fact, it  is

one that the vast majority of car buyers use, and for all the

reasons  that Mr Ee has mentioned.  The question is:   should

we  now  step in and disallow the packaging of the car prices

with  the  price  of  a  COE?  This  would  be  unnecessarily

intervening in the free market mechanism.  As Mr  Ee  has  in

fact recognised, the package pricing of the car with COE,  in

effect, results in a discount being given by the dealers.  He

used  the  term "subsidise". I would rather not use the  term

"subsidise"  because I do not think car dealers  are  in  the

business  of  subsidising car buyers.  But  they  do  give  a

discount to make it more attractive for the car buyers to buy

the car from them with the COE included.  And I think that is

to the benefit of the car buyer but there is a hidden cost to

it.  And again, that is something which Mr Ee has alluded to,

and  the  hidden cost is that the buyer has no  control  over

what the car dealer is going to bid for the COE, and over the

timing of the delivery of the car that he has entered into an

agreement to buy.  So there is a hidden cost.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  in a way, the buyer who buys his own COE  is,  in

effect,  forgoing the discount but, in return, he is  getting

the  assured  delivery of the car he wants, at  the  time  he

wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think what we need to do is to encourage the car

market  to  be more competitive so that car buyers  can  shop

around and know what they are actually buying.  To this  end,

LTA  has done two things.  One is that it has made it  easier

for individuals, companies and car dealers to parallel import

the  cars  that  they want.  I have asked LTA to  review  and

further   streamline   the  import  procedures   to   further

facilitate  parallel car imports.  Of course, the  cars  that

are  being  parallel imported must still meet our safety  and

environmental standards and regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part that LTA is doing, and would be doing

more,  is to post every month on its website full details  of

the car prices, and this would include the OMV, customs duty,

ARF  and  COE  payable, ie, car buyers can then go  into  the

website and know exactly what he has paid for versus what  it

actually  costs  the  car dealer.   They  can  then  make  an

informed choice as to what to buy and whether to buy with  or

without COE.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, the North-East line which is

currently  being  built is going to be a driver-less  system.

Considering  the  several mishaps that have occurred  in  the

driver-less  LRT,  I  would like to  ask  the  Minister  what

safeguards or preventive measures are undertaken so that  the

driver-less  North-East line which travels at a  much  faster

speed and with heavier loads will be assuredly safe. Although

the  trains are driver-less, I assume that the control centre

is  hopefully  not controlled by robots.  Will  the  Ministry

ensure  that  people who run the control room  have  actually

done  stints  on the ground so that they are experienced  and

know  the  limitations on the ground when they make decisions

on the screen?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I would like to cover is whether there

will be fare linking and seamless transfers between the North-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



East  line and the MRT in order to minimise inconvenience  to

travellers  even though this would be operated  by  different

companies.   This  implies  that there  will  have  to  be  a

mechanism   for  fare  staging  electronically  between   the

different operators.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would rather call the North-East line not driver-less but an automated system. There is

a  difference between driver-less and automated.  "Automated"

means that there is still someone in control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay has asked how safe would the system be and

whether the control room would be manned by people or  robots

and  how  well they are going to be trained and, in terms  of

the  fare system, how integrated would that be with the  rest

of the public transport system.  Let me take them in turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of safety, I think that really was a

fundamental  concern  of LTA and the Ministry  when  we  were

considering  the North-East line because safety  must  be  of

paramount concern.  The safety system for the North-East line

has  been  designed  to  the  highest  international  railway

standards.  That I can assure the Members here.  LTA  started

on  the  design of the North-East line by adopting  the  best

existing features of the established fully automated  systems

elsewhere  in  the  world.  Then they  proceeded  to  further

enhance  the  design by incorporating the  latest  technology

that  is  available  today.  LTA has  also  established  very

strict  criteria  for hazard evaluation to  ensure  that  the

system is safe for commuters.  Furthermore, they proceeded to

bring in independent consultants to audit the design and  the

construction.  They have gone through many steps to make sure

that in the design and construction stages, safety is kept at

the forefront of everybody's attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the heart of the North-East line safety system is

the   automatic  train  protection  system.   What  is   this

automatic train protection system?  Essentially, this  system

develops an electronic envelope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



around  each  train,  and  it ensures  safe  speed  and  safe

distance  between each train.  The system uses  the  positive

contact between the steel wheels and the rails of each train,

and  on  each train, there are 24 axles, which means on  each

train,  there are 24 systems for feeding back to the  control

room  as to where the train is.  It is unlikely that  we  are

going to lose touch with the train.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, there is another independent system that

helps  to locate the train, that is, on the rails, there  are

sensors.   And  as  the train passes each of  these  sensors,

there  will be an automatic pick-up which would again be  fed

back  to the control system through antennas.  It is  a  dual

channel feedback system, a dual sensor type of system.  There

are  also several levels of redundancies to safeguard against

failure.   The  train  is also equipped with  self-diagnostic

system  which  allows  the train to continually  monitor  the

health status of the equipment and the functions on board the

train.   For  example, if on any of the  axles,  there  is  a

fault,  that  fault would be picked up and fed  back  to  the

control system, ie, we are not going to get to a stage  where

all  the 24 have failed before we find out.  So there  are  a

lot of redundancies available in the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of implementation, LTA would put the entire

North-East  line  system through several months  of  rigorous

integrated system and operational testing before  we  put  it

into  revenue service.  This is to make sure that the  design

work  has  been  carried out properly.  We  do  construct  it

properly, and we audit it, but there is nothing like  putting

the  system through a stress test.  We are going to  put  the

system through several months of stress testing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the control room, I am happy to tell Mr Chay

that there will be human controllers in the control room  and

they would be all cross-trained and  multi-skilled, including

the   train operation.  They are going to be put through  the

various functions, they are going to be involved in the train

operation  and  they  are going to have the  full  experience

necessary to run the control room.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also happy to inform Mr Chay that the North-East line would be an integral part of the rapid transit

network and it will have the same ticketing system.  In  this

way,  travellers would not have to leave the North-East  line

train  system and go out and then come back to join the other

parts of the system.  It is going to be a seamless travel for

travellers  on the North-East line.  I hope that answers  all

his questions.



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing me to join in the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why should the present duopoly system on bus

operations  be  maintained?  That is  a  pertinent  question.

Could  an additional player make bus services more efficient?

I  feel  that  there  is  room for another  bus  operator  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a few good reasons why a third bus

operator  should be encouraged. First, the commuter's  travel

time could be reduced with better realignment of routes.  The

more  frequent changeover between feeder bus system and  from

feeder  bus  system  to  MRT  could  be  avoided  and  better

reorganised. This would, in a way, help commuters to  get  to

their  destination on time. The second reason is  that  about

40% of the commuters travel by bus or by bus and MRT.  It  is

expected  that  the MRT-bus type of commuters  are  going  to

increase  dramatically in future as more new  towns  will  be

built  and there will be more commuters travelling in bus  as

well as MRT.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, with an additional bus operator, the present two

bus  companies  would be pushed to become more efficient  and

cost-effective.  That, I think, prevents these two  companies

to  monopolise the routes that have been carved  out  between

the  two  companies.   We can change the  present  status  by

allowing  Comfort  Holdings or others to participate  as  the

third  operator.  The question is whether the Ministry  would

want  to  change  its mindset and think  of  a  more  dynamic

policy.   The issue is that if you are looking for excellence

in  a  world-class transport system, why not  look  at  these

issues more closely?  The question is whether the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



commuters would eventually benefit from this exercise  and  I

think they will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can anticipate that the Ministry's answer will be:

two  is  enough.  My answer to this whole question  will  be:

three or more, if we decide in the interest of the commuters.

I  hope they do not stick to the old population policy  style

that two is enough.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, thank you

for allowing me to join in the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land transportation has an important impact on the

everyday  life  of  Singaporeans.  Through a  combination  of

control  of  vehicular  growth,  managing  vehicular   usage,

provision of public transportation system and a good  island-wide  network,  the  land transport situation  has  generally

served Singaporeans well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have a good island-wide land transport system,

the  same  cannot  be said of the intra-town  land  transport

system,  especially  in new estates.   In  new  estates,  the

development  of  a  comprehensive  land  transport  plan   is

essential   to   reduce  travelling  time,  prevent   traffic

congestion  and improve road safety. Sengkang  New  Town  was

touted  as being the first town where the entire road network

and  the  land transport system was pre-planned.   It  is  an

example of faultless planning but flawed execution.  Planning

the   land   transport  system  is  only  the   first   step.

Implementing  the  plan  is a more difficult  task.   Success

requires   close  coordination  between  various   Government

agencies,  including the planners, LTA and URA, the builders,

HDB and LTA, and the public transport service providers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the plan was near faultless, the same cannot be

said  of the execution.  The first year of living in Sengkang

Town  was  a nightmare.  What was inconceivable was that  the

entry  and  exit to the entire town was via the  old  Punggol

Road  with its limited width.  As the town grew, I was aghast

that  the  road  network  fell far  behind  in  its  pace  of

development. With the time taken to leave the town, taking as

long as half an hour, it was becoming unbearable.  This would

be the same if you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



imagine  that  all the Ang Mo Kio Town residents  could  only

enter  and exit the town via Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, or  if  all

the  residents in Tampines could only enter or exit the  town

through Avenue 7.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concerns were raised with the various Ministries,

and  I must be thankful that with the support of the Ministry

of  National  Development and MCIT, we formed a committee  to

look  at  the  development of the town.  It has been  a  very

enriching  experience,  not only  for  us  but  for  all  the

Government  agencies that have been involved in the  work  of

this committee.  And it shows that a lot of fine coordination

is  required  for execution of even the best of plans.   With

the support from the Ministry of National Development and the

Ministry  of  Communications and Information Technology,  bus

services  were  added  to provide an  alternative,  and  road

development was speeded up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, another major trunk road was

opened,  one year ahead of time.  For this, I have  to  thank

the  Minister for responding to our appeals.  This has  eased

the  traffic woes but not solved it.  The MRT and LRT  lines,

which  are due for completion, will also reduce some of these

traffic woes.  However, the problem remains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punggol Road remains the main life line of Sengkang

Town.   It  is also the link to Tampines Expressway.   Almost

daily,  during peak hours, you can see traffic  tailing  back

into  the  Expressway from the slip roads into Punggol  Road.

If  you think this was bad, the worst is yet to come, as  the

highly  touted town of the future, Punggol 21 or Punggol  New

Town  has  also  one arterial life line, and  no  prizes  for

guessing the right answer.  Yes, it is again our old  Punggol

Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As blocks of flats in Punggol New Town sprout out

quickly, more people will share the nightmare of the Sengkang

residents.  I am no town planner, but what surprised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



me  is  that  no one thought much of it.  When Sengkang  Town

grew  to  half  the  size of Ang Mo Kio  Town,  the  planners

assumed  that  an old arterial road would not only  meet  the

needs  of  the  new  town but would also  be  sufficient  for

another new town as well.  I think that the Ministry needs to

react  quickly.  New entry and exit roads need to be  opened.

Building of new expressway entry and exit points for  Punggol

and  Sengkang  New Towns need to be accelerated.   Additional

flyovers linking Punggol New Town to Sengkang New Town across

the TPE must be built to give the town a new life line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in Punggol New Town is rather precarious

presently.   Can  you imagine this  -   all  it  takes  is  a

traffic accident or a vehicular breakdown along Punggol  Road

to  prevent  entry or exit from the new town?  An entire  new

town  with one single entry and exit, and yes we are  talking

about  Punggol  21.   I  urge  the  Minister  to  consider  a

comprehensive review of the road network development schedule

in  Sengkang and Punggol New Towns to ensure that  they  will

measure up to the claims that these are towns with ideal land

transport plans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Goh Chee Wee is not here. Dr John

Chen.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):</b> Sir, I thank Members

for  their  questions.  Dr Vasoo asked  whether  the  present

duopoly  system in our public transport is good  enough,  and

whether  we  can  have another operator to compete  with  the

existing two operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have two existing companies providing public

scheduled  bus services throughout Singapore.  Between  them,

they  are  required  to cover most parts of   Singapore,  and

cover both the profitable as well as the unprofitable routes.

The  current  industry  structure has  allowed  the  two  bus

operators   to   provide  a  generally   high   quality   and

comprehensive  bus service, with affordable fares.    How  is

this achieved?  This is achieved through the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



Public Transport Council (PTC) requiring the bus operators to

meet  a set of quality standards, including service coverage,

frequencies,  operating hours and other aspects of  operation

to  safeguard  commuters'  interest,  even  for  unprofitable

routes.    This  is  what  we  call  the  universal   service

obligation  (USO) that the bus companies have to meet.   This

USO  is  not without cost to the bus operators, and therefore

Government  needs  to  consider very  carefully  whether  the

industry can sustain more operators.  Because, as it is,  the

bus  operators have to service the non-profitable routes, and

therefore they are, in a way, cross subsidising.  If we allow

another operator to come in, we have to consider whether that

operator would also have universal service obligation, and if

they  do  not have USO, then will it be fair to the  existing

operators?  And if you allow the new operator to cherry  pick

the  profitable  routes, then the viability of  the  existing

operators may be in question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, there is already some form of competition

between the two operators by way of the PTC benchmarking them

against  each other for service levels. If we were  to  allow

unfettered  competition  in the  bus  market,  this  kind  of

unfettered  competition can lead to unprofitable  routes  not

being served, and a decline in viability for all the players.

And the end result can be a decline in service standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I agree with Dr Vasoo that we should

increase competition where appropriate.  In this regard, some

steps were taken last year to introduce more competition into

the  industry.  For instance, the PTC called an  open  tender

last  year  to select the operator who could offer  the  most

competitive fares for providing public bus services to Jurong

Island.   The  PTC  also  invited  both  private  and  public

transport operators to submit proposals for introducing  more

night  bus  services.  We can do more along these  lines,  if

there  is demand for such services.  In fact, there are other

areas  where  we  allow competition.  For instance,  we  have

Scheme B bus services plying along certain trunk routes,  and

this was in response to complaints that these busy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



routes   were  not  adequately  served.   We  have  therefore

introduced Scheme B bus services in order to provide a higher

level  of service.  So, if there is any complaint about  poor

services, we will get the PTC to closely monitor those routes

and  tighten  the  standards, if necessary, or  maybe  invite

another  operator  to service those areas,  if  the  existing

operator cannot meet these standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Michael Lim questioned the implementation of the

road  network  in  Sengkang.   Earlier,  Mr  Yeo  Guat  Kwang

complained   about  the  coordination  problem  between   the

Government  agencies.   Yes, today,  there  is  a  system  of

coordination between LTA, HDB and other agencies involved  in

new town development.  And roads, for instance, are built  in

tandem  with  the  development of a town.   In  the  case  of

Sengkang,  however,  I  do agree with  the  Member  that  the

coordination  did  not work as well as it  should.   The  key

reason for this is that the ongoing construction of the North

East  MRT  line  and the LRT system has hampered  the  speedy

construction of some major internal roads in Sengkang, giving

rise  to  inconvenience to residents, and the  situation  was

aggravated by the rapid growth of Sengkang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also mentioned that the exit and entry

roads of the town via the Expressway are inadequate.  Because

of  the problems that the Member has fed back, LTA has worked

closely with the MP and grassroots organisations to solve the

problem.   And with the stepping up of this effort,  we  have

opened up some of these roads ahead of schedule, as mentioned

by  Dr Michael Lim.  For instance, we have opened up Sengkang

East  Way,  which was originally scheduled to open after  the

completion of the underground construction works in June this

year.   This was completed ahead of schedule in January  last

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sengkang East Road was also opened in January this year,

as  mentioned by Dr Michael Lim, almost a year ahead  of  the

original  schedule  in end 2001.  And  with  the  opening  of

Sengkang East Road,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



there  is another exit and entry point for Sengkang town  via

the  CTE.   I  will  continue to press LTA to  come  up  with

solutions to alleviate the congestion in Sengkang, even while

construction works are ongoing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Punggol, LTA will be building two more fringe roads.

This  is  in addition to the internal road network  that  HDB

will build in tandem with the town development.  One of these

two  roads  is  the  interchange at the  Tampines  Expressway

connecting  Sengkang  East Road,  and  this  will  serve  the

connection between Punggol Town and TPE, as well as  Sengkang

Town and TPE.  LTA will also build another flyover across TPE

connecting  Punggol Town and Sengkang Town.   I believe  work

will start in March this year and it should be ready in 2003.

So this will serve to improve the road network in the two new

towns,   as   well  as  connecting  them  to   the   existing

expressways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by assuring Dr Lim and Mr Yeo that LTA

will continue to work closely with HDB in developing the road

network  to serve the needs of residents moving into  Punggol

Town  and  ensure that the problems encountered  in  Sengkang

will not be repeated in Punggol Town.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I would like to seek a clarification from

the  Minister of State as to why we are so keen in protecting

the  interest  of  these two bus companies  which  have  made

respectable  profits.  He has mentioned  that  other  private

operators have come in to tender for routes.  Can we not open

the doors wider?



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I said, we are actually

acting  in  the  interest of both the bus operators  and  the

commuters, because we want to have efficient public transport

and,  at the same time, we want to make sure that this public

transport  operation  is viable.  We  also  need  to  provide

transport  to  virtually every household in  Singapore.   And

some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



of  these services will not be profitable.  The best  way  to

ensure  all  of these is to have dual monopolies  where  each

monopoly  is  given both profitable and unprofitable  routes.

This is the existing structure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we introduce new operators, we have to look at the

needs  of  areas that are not properly served.  If  they  are

properly served, and if we were to allow another operator  to

come  and  cream  off the profit of those profitable  routes,

then  it would make the existing operators less viable.  Then

perhaps  fares will have to be adjusted because if  they  are

not  viable, in the end, the service level will be  affected.

This  is  the  rationale  for having  this  existing  duopoly

system.   In fact, in many parts of the world, we do not  see

bus operations having free competition.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, one of the

most  familiar  types  of  visitors  to  the  meet-the-people

sessions  is the heavy vehicle driver.  Usually, he has  been

booked for illegal parking.  He wants the MP to help him  get

the  fine  waived or reduced.  Often, he comes  with  several

summonses.   I believe many Members have similar experiences.

At first I was somewhat perplexed by this group.  Either they

are  very bad statisticians who cannot calculate properly the

probability of being booked or there is a genuine problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a genuine problem. Heavy vehicle car

parks  are  sited  kilometres away from  residential  blocks.

That  is sound town planning policy.  But unfortunately  that

is  where the planning stops.  There is no follow-up from the

land  transport  policy  side.  Should  we  not  require  bus

operators,  for example, to operate early hour buses  to  get

these  people who work very, very early, about  four  in  the

morning, to their heavy vehicle car parks?  Initially I asked

them  why  they  did not take public transport.   The  common

response  -  no  buses  that early.   Why  not  taxis  -  too

expensive.  Why not use the motorbike - no licence.  Why  not

use bicycles - always stolen.  Frustrated, I was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



tempted  to ask: why not join brisk walking clubs.  But  that

would have added insult to injury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a small matter in the context of a national

policy on land transport, even smaller in the context of  the

aspiration  to  achieve a world class transportation  system.

But  I  must  really ask:  is there no transport supremo,  no

oversight  inter-departmental committee  that  could  finally

resolve  this small dot of the problem?  Is it too  difficult

to get the bus companies, the LTA, URA, HDB, to talk together

about how to help this unfortunate group of persons?  Can  we

not, as the MOS mentioned just now, ask the PTC to have a USO

(universal  service  obligation)  to  deal  with  this  heavy

vehicle  car park problem.  I would like to urge the Ministry

to  give  some priority to this issue and these persons  with

some chance of avoiding future bookings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, speaking of another form of public

transport,  namely,  taxis, totally unrelated  to  the  first

issue  I  raised,  I  should like to ask why  taxis  are  not

allowed  to  use bus lanes during the restricted  period,  as

common  in  many other countries.  The reason I ask  this  is

that  very  often, I notice that the bus lanes are  not  well

utilised even at peak hours while everyone else seems  to  be

cluttering  in the other lanes, adding to the congestion.   I

hope  that the Ministry will ensure that improvements be made

to   bus  services  and  other  means  of  public  transport.

Singapore  has  a  good  reputation internationally  for  its

clockwork-like efficiency in many sectors, and a good  public

transport  system  catering to the  needs  of  all  types  of

residents should be within achievable targets.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> I would like to ask

the  Minister  what  the  status is  of  the  action  on  the

recommendations  of  the  IMC on the Ageing  Population  with

regard  to  meeting the transport needs of elderly commuters.

It  has  been  a  year and a half since the  IMC  Report  was

published in 1999.  I am interested in the progress  at  this

point  in  time.   Because in the recent discussions  on  the

subject of making the environment family-friendly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



it  was  noted  that parents with young children  share  very

similar  challenges in using our public transport  system  as

the  older population.  A parent with a child in a pram faces

the  same  problem  negotiating flights of steps  and  narrow

automated turnstiles or gates in MRT stations, or getting  on

and  riding  in  a  bus,  as an elderly  frail  person  in  a

wheelchair.   A  parent  carrying a  child  on  one  arm  and

possibly shopping or other bags in the other experiences  the

same difficulty in getting on a fast-moving escalator in  our

MRT stations as a senior citizen who is perhaps not so steady

on her feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore ask if the North-east MRT line and the

LRT  stations currently being built will indeed have barrier-free  access,  and whether in fact any existing MRT  stations

have yet to be retrofitted with ramps and lifts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to buses, what progress has been made on the

proposed  pilot project to test the efficiency of wheelchair-accessible buses?  Has anybody taken that up?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year and a half, has LTA been more

successful  in  encouraging taxi operators to bring  in  more

wheelchair-friendly cabs and what are the proposals to reduce

taxes  for  this type of vehicle in return for reduced  fares

for the target users of this service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also two short-term measures recommended, ie,

of  looking into the pool of existing transport resources and

modifying current transport arrangements to ensure that there

are  affordable  and elderly-friendly transport  services  to

eldercare  facilities even now.  This was  to  be  undertaken

jointly  by MCDS, MOH, NCSS and the LTA.  What has  been  the

outcome of this effort?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the IMC gave a longer time horizon over which the

LTA  might  implement its recommendations, anticipating  that

the   numbers   of  elderly  would  really  start   to   grow

tremendously  in the next decade or two down  the  road,  the

challenge in making the environment family-friendly  is  here

with  us  today.  I would therefore like to ask the  Minister

what   the   timeframes   are  for  implementation   of   the

recommendations and if these timeframes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



can be speeded up for the benefit of both senior citizens  as

well as parents with young children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, I have two cuts. Can I be

allowed to take the two cuts together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Take the first cut, allow the Minister to

reply to it first before you proceed to the second cut.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Very well, Sir. I will take the

first cut first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): During the Budget debate last year, I

mentioned   that  the CTE was like a very  heavily  congested

artery  and  there  was a need for us  to  perform  a  bypass

surgery  on it.  The residents in the north-eastern  part  of

Singapore  are  very happy that the Minister has  decided  to

speed  up  the construction of Kallang/Paya Lebar Expressway.

I  hope  LTA would give us more details and advise us on  the

time-frame of this work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the very congested artery, the CTE, I think the

Government should consider putting in a "stent", that is,  to

expand the bottleneck part on the CTE or even convert some of

the  roads into two-tier highways. I hope that the Government

would  seriously look into this matter.  I am sure we do  not

wish to see more toll-gates along the CTE.  I think we should

convert  them into two-tier highways so that the traffic  can

be more free-flowing.  Also, the bottleneck situations at the

exits  are  very serious.  Whenever a vehicle  comes  to  the

exit,  it  would  run into a traffic jam  and  the  motorists

cannot  reach  their  destination on  time.   Then,  all  our

efforts to make our highway free-flowing would be in vain



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, Prof. Chin expressed the

woes of the heavy vehicle drivers.  In fact, as an MP, I have

also  received a lot of appeals and feedback  from  them.   I

shall restrict myself to the public transport part and not to

comment  on the National Development part about the provision

of parking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin feels that we should provide public transport

to  these workers in odd hours of the day.  I would  like  to

respond that there is a cost to doing so.  Because while  you

can  provide  a 24-hour service, but then the cost  would  be

quite  tremendous.  For this reason, we also do  not  service

shift workers, for instance.  Shift workers will have to find

their  own transport or their employers will have to  provide

transport for them to get home.  So there is a limit to  what

we  can do.  For now, in terms of demand for transport, it is

still  not  a  huge demand.  Therefore, to  provide  a  cost-effective service to them would be very difficult.  You  can,

but then the cost would be very high.  For this reason, shift

workers get their transport services from their employers  or

they use their own motorbikes, or whatever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, these heavy vehicle drivers are like shift

workers.   They  are small in numbers.  Some  of  course  are

working  for  bigger  employers, and these  bigger  employers

should be able to try to provide transport for them.  For the

smaller ones or the self-employed, it is really difficult  to

provide  a  bus service just to service a handful of  people.

If  they tell you that even if they use bicycles and they are

stolen, I think they have gone a bit too far.  So they  would

have to try to find their own transport arrangement to get to

work in these odd hours of the night.  In terms of trying to,

say,  start the service early, as proposed by Prof.  Chin,  I

can  ask  PTC to take a look.  But, again, you would have  to

weigh the cost versus the benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On taxis, Prof. Chin wants us to allow taxis to use the

bus  lanes.  I am sure he knows what bus lanes are for.  When

we  determine  the  drawing of the  bus  lanes,  there  is  a

standard,  and this standard is that at least  50  buses  per

hour  must  use this route in order to have a bus  lane.   In

CBD,  at the moment, there are about 120 buses per hour using

these  bus lanes.  There are in Singapore about 18,000 taxis.

If  you allow taxis to drop off and pick up passengers  along

the  bus  lane, it is definitely going to affect the flow  of

operation  of buses.  We know that public transport  is  very

important  and public transport by buses is a very  efficient

way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



of  transporting people, and commuters value such smooth flow

of  buses.   So the reliability of bus services is  therefore

very important to Singaporeans.  Therefore, we would not like

to  risk  disrupting such good bus services.  But we do  note

that  there  are areas where perhaps the bus  lanes  are  not

fully  utilised.  In fact, I asked the same question as Prof.

Chin when I drove along some of these roads and I saw the bus

lane  without  many buses.  Hence, since last year,  we  have

started  to allow bus lanes outside the CBD areas for private

buses  - school bus and private hire bus.  This is the  first

step,  so  as to utilise the bus lanes more fully.   We  will

review  after some time and see what is the impact  of  these

additional buses on the operation of scheduled public  buses.

If  we can, we will consider his suggestion of allowing other

types of vehicles to use the bus lanes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Jennifer Lee wanted an update on the programme

to  implement the IMC's recommendations.  It is our objective

to  make  our public transport system accessible to all,  and

that  includes  the  elderly as well as  mothers  with  young

children  in strollers.  Towards this objective, all on-going

rapid  transit system projects and new LRT lines will  comply

with   the  code  of  barrier-free  accessibility.   So  this

includes the North East line, Expo Station that we have  just

opened  and  the  LRT that we are going to operate.   So,  in

fact,  the  Bukit Panjang LRT, which was opened  in  November

1999, also has complied with this code.  For the existing  48

MRT  stations, LTA is currently embarking on an  exercise  to

retrofit  them with lifts, ramps, and disabled  toilets.   In

fact, currently, there are four pilot stations that are being

retrofitted  and  the  remaining 44  stations  will  also  be

progressively  upgraded in batches and  stages  between  next

year  and  late 2004.  So by end 2004, we should be  able  to

retrofit all stations.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for commuter facilities, such as taxi stands and bus

shelters,  pavements,  etc, accessible  facilities  would  be

progressively   provided   and  evolved   alongside   planned

development or major upgrading



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



works.   She also asked about buses.  The IMC encouraged  bus

operators to make the bus system more elderly-friendly in the

long  term  by introducing elderly-friendly buses,  as  older

buses  are  being  phased  out.  We cannot  do  it  overnight

because  the  existing buses are still in use.  As  they  are

being phased out, and when bus operators buy new buses,  they

will  make  sure that these buses are elderly-friendly.   SBS

and  TIBS  have  to-date brought in a total of  192  elderly-friendly  low  floor buses with either single or  zero  step.

And  this year, I am told that the operators intend to  bring

in another 120 elderly-friendly buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked about buses for wheelchair. That is something

which has to be looked into very carefully because it is  not

just  the  capital  cost, it is also  the  operation  of  the

wheelchair,  what they call kneeling buses, that  has  to  be

looked at because they may affect the efficient operation  of

our  existing bus operation.  So these are things which  have

to be further looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also asked about taxis that can take in

wheelchair  and whether we can facilitate those taxis.   Yes,

we  intend to make it easier for taxi companies to  buy  such

taxis  because  she is right that these taxis at  the  moment

cost more compared to the normal taxis.  So I think we should

incentivise  them to bring in such taxis which  can  take  in

wheelchair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third recommendation of IMC was to examine how

existing  transport resources can be pooled and  arrangements

modified  to  provide  affordable elderly-friendly  transport

services  to elder care services and facilities.   Individual

VWOs currently provide transport services to their clients by

means  of  contract buses or retrofitted vehicles capable  of

transporting  the  wheelchair  bound.   MCDS  and  NCSS   are

currently  studying the need to pool together and  centralise

the resources of the various VWOs for more optimal management

and utilisation.  In fact, the Ministry thinks that this is a

good  way of providing transport services to the elderly  and

to the handicapped.  Because at the moment, each one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



provides its own and that can be inefficient.  But if we  can

centralise them, the resources can be better utilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about the progress of KPE

and  what  we are doing to alleviate the congestion  in  CTE.

The  LTA  will  be constructing the Kallang  and  Paya  Lebar

Expressway  (KPE) to provide an alternative route for  people

in  the  North  East  sector.   The  tenders  for  all  major

contracts for the KPE will be called by the end of this year,

and  the  whole expressway will open in 2006.  The KPE,  when

completed, will help relieve congestion on the CTE.   In  the

meantime,  the  LTA  is expanding the CTE and  Braddell  Road

interchange.  This involves the construction of an  underpass

along Braddell Road, and the realignment and widening of  the

four  slip roads leading to and from the CTE.  When completed

in  December 2002, this project will facilitate the  flow  of

the  traffic  leaving the CTE and thus, help to  improve  the

traffic  flow along the CTE.   The opening of the  North-East

line  in  2002 next year will give people in the  North  East

sector another transport alternative, and remove some traffic

demand from the CTE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether we can have a double deck expressway

along  CTE.   To have this kind of double deck expressway  is

very  costly.   At  the same time, when  you  introduce  more

traffic on to the roads, you will also have problem when  the

traffic  converges to make sure that there is no  congestion.

I  think  we  have to be very careful when we  consider  such

double deck highway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In recent years, the

number of fatal accidents happening along the expressways  is

very  alarming.   Putting aside the  human  factor,  such  as

drunken driving, we want to ask whether or not the design  of

our highways has reached international safety standard.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has LTA conducted any comprehensive inspection on our

highways to ensure that the safety of our road users would be

protected?   We  would also like to remove all the  objective

and  environmental factors that would threaten the safety  of

the  road  users.   Many  residents  and  NTUC  members  have

reflected  to  me  that the safety measures provided  to  the

workers  who  are doing road repairing or tree pruning  works

along  the  highways  are not adequate.   I  hope  LTA  would

enhance the safety measures so that the workers who are doing

the  road  repair or tree pruning works would  be  adequately

protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the positioning of the traffic signboards

should also be looked into.  These signs should give a  clear

indication  as  to  when  there is an  exit  ahead.   If  the

signboard  is  positioned too near to the exit,  the  drivers

will  not be given sufficient notice to enable them to change

lanes  safely.   Noticing  the signboards   just  before  the

exits,  some rash drivers would just swerve their  cars  into

the lane of the other cars without due care and diligence for

the  safety of the other users of the road, resulting in some

serious accidents.  Moreover, very often these road signs are

blocked  by  the  trees.   I think  this  is  a  very  common

phenomenon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many residents are also quite unhappy with the frequency

of  the  diggings along the highway and they are  questioning

whether  LTA has been coordinating with the other Ministries.

Many  residents  in the private estates felt that  roads  are

being  dug up much too frequently by the various departments,

such as the Telecoms, PUB,  Ministry of the Environment, etc,

with  one  department digging it, patch up, and then  another

department  would come and dig it up again.    This  lack  of

coordination among the various departments causes  a  lot  of

inconvenience to the residents and danger to the road users.



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister

to  review  how taxi fares can be made better as well  as  to

reduce  the  waiting time for taxis.  First, the taxi  fares.

There are currently many types of supplementary taxi charges.

These are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



charges  for  dialing  in to make reservations,  charges  for

waiting time, charges for entering the CBD, charges for going

to the airport, charges for hailing the cab at certain hours,

and  so on.  These can be quite confusing for taxi passengers

when  the  supplementary charges are kicked  in.   While  the

meter  indicates one reading, the passenger may be  asked  to

pay  another  amount.  This amount may be  correct  when  the

various  supplementary charges are taken into  consideration.

But short of reasoning it out with the taxi driver, it is not

easy  on your own trying to account for the higher taxi fares

than what is indicated in the taxi meter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if our taxis are using the GPS system, I do not see

why they cannot harness technology to provide clearer reading

of  taxi  fares.   Our  taxis should be equipped  to  provide

printouts  so  that  if the taxi fare is different  from  the

meter  reading,  the printout will give a  breakdown  of  the

various  supplementary  charges.   This  will  avoid   giving

tourists  and visitors, who are unfamiliar with  the  various

supplementary  taxi  charges, the wrong impression  that  our

taxi drivers may be over-charging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the waiting time for taxis. It is extremely

difficult to hail a taxi during certain hours and at  certain

locations, for example, just before midnight, during the peak

period,  in the CBD, Orchard Road area, Turf Club, etc.   Can

the  Minister enlighten us on whether his Ministry  considers

the  waiting  time for taxis in deciding the number  of  taxi

licences?   What  is the average waiting time  for  taxis  in

Singapore and how do they fare as compared to other cities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the supply of taxis is a fine

balancing act and that an increase in the number of taxis  to

cater for the peak hours may result in excess capacity during

the  off-peak  hours  and therefore  lower  income  for  taxi

drivers.   This,  however,  may  be  partially  addressed  by

raising  taxi fares so that fringe commuters would decide  to

use  other means of public transport, or use the taxis merely

for  connection to MRT stations or bus routes.  I would  like

the Minister to elaborate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



whether   there  are  plans  on  hand  to  deal   with   this

predicament,  and whether the solution is to  introduce  more

taxi operators.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> I wish to raise the

concern of drivers who are employed to drive their companies'

vehicles.  Under the Road Traffic Act, the liability of  such

employed  drivers for certain offences is no  different  from

drivers who are also owners of the vehicles.  I believe  that

they should be treated differently as their circumstances are

very  different.   Owners must be held  responsible  for  the

maintenance of their vehicles.  On the other hand, being mere

employees,  employed drivers have little or no  control  over

the  maintenance  of  the vehicles they have  been  asked  to

drive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight two of such offences. First,

under section 15 of the Road Traffic Act, any person who uses

on  any  road any vehicle for which a licence is not enforced

is guilty of an offence.  I have come across a case where the

driver noticed that the vehicle's road tax had not been  paid

for  a  few months.  On asking his employer, he was  verbally

assured that the arrears had been settled when, in fact, that

was not the case and the vehicle had been deregistered due to

non-payment  of road tax.  The driver was in no  position  to

ask  his employer for documentary evidence that the road  tax

had indeed been paid and the licence was still in force.   He

could  only take his employer's word for it.  However,  after

he was stopped by the police, he was prosecuted for driving a

deregistered vehicle and asked to attend court to  answer  to

the charges.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, under section 72 of the same Act, the driver

of  the vehicle which emits smoke or visible vapour is guilty

of  an offence.  Sir, in the present job market, the employed

drivers are fearful of losing their jobs and their rice bowl.

If   they  were  to  raise  concerns  of  roadworthiness   or

registration of the vehicle with their employers, the chances

of  being  fired  are  rather high.   They  are  legitimately

concerned that they may lose their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



jobs and are, therefore, forced to take unwarranted risks  of

facing  the  dire  consequences  themselves.   For  them,  it

becomes a question of choosing between the devil and the deep

blue sea.  If they refuse to drive the vehicle, they will  be

fired  and  others, who are more desperate,  may  take  their

place.  If, on the other hand, they drive the vehicle on  the

roads,  they  may have to face the risk of being  caught  and

prosecuted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to review the law, such

that  employers  share a greater burden  of  maintaining  the

vehicles.   In this way, we are still maintaining  safety  on

our  roads  and yet placing the responsibility on  the  right

shoulders.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, before I speak

on the cut, I would like to declare my interest as a Director

of  Singapore Technologies Kinetics, which is involved in the

business of developing electric and hybrid vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Government's stand on the role of

electric  or  hybrid  vehicles should be  strategic  and  not

confined  to vehicle ownership considerations.  The rationale

for  using  the  environmentally-friendly  electric  vehicles

(EVs) is relatively clear-cut.  Besides, our small size makes

for  a  conducive  environment to use EVs to maximum  effect.

However,  it is also well-known that, despite the  20%  lower

OMV  incentive,  the cost of EVs can still end  up  some  50%

higher   than  those  of  comparable  conventional  vehicles.

Therefore,  other  things being equal,  there  is  really  no

incentive for consumers to switch to EVs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several other countries have put in place a framework

for  the  gradual  conversion of use to  electric  or  hybrid

vehicles.  In the US, for example, 10% of all new vehicles in

California  must use alternative fuel, of which  4%  must  be

zero emission.  Hong Kong is granting a one-time registration

exemption  for  zero-emission  vehicles  and  is  working  on

incentives for hybrid vehicles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to ask the Minister to consider

more substantive incentives to promote the use of electric or

hybrid  vehicles, and not to limit these to  passenger  cars.

Introduction  of  a certain mix to public vehicles,  such  as

buses  and  taxis, should also be contemplated  as  well,  as

these tend to spend more time on the road.  Any reduction  in

pollution will therefore be material.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to support such a strategic move, the

Government must also ensure that the infrastructure  for  use

of  EVs exists.  HDB, JTC and URA should, therefore, consider

setting  up  charging  stations  in  car  parks  under  their

control.   Otherwise, the inconvenience will negate  whatever

incentives  the Government has put in place, and there  would

be few takers.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has raised the issue

of safety on our roads.  I would like to reassure Mr Yeo that

LTA  looks very closely at our design, and we are putting  in

place a lot of measures to ensure that our roads continue  to

match international standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has raised the issue of construction on road sites.

Let  me  address some of the specific issues he  has  raised.

Let me first inform the House that LTA has a Code of Practice

for  Temporary  Traffic Control for works in  progress  along

roads.   Contractors and their workmen should follow this  to

ensure   that  the  appropriate  sign  posting  to   forewarn

motorists  of any works ahead, and on the safety measures  to

be  observed.   If  the contractors fail to comply  with  the

Code,  they  will  be fined and issued with  demerit  points.

They  can  also be suspended from carrying out any other  new

works  along  the  roads.  In addition, contractors  who  are

working along the expressways are required to notify the EMAS

control  room  of their roadworks so that we  can  flash  the

appropriate warning messages on the electronic panels located

along the expressways.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure that we have taken is that contractors

are  allowed  to work along expressways only during  off-peak

hours  and, if they wish to work along the expressways,  they

must   submit  an  application  to  LTA.   LTA  will   advise

contractors  to stop work and leave the site immediately,  if

any  congestion  is  observed.  So  these  are  some  of  the

measures that we have put in place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, if there are complaints with regard to

congestion and ill-placed signages, motorists can refer their

complaints  to LTA, which will investigate and take  remedial

measures swiftly.  My Minister has instructed LTA to step  up

enforcement, especially at construction locations, to  ensure

that  our  rules are strictly followed in view of the  safety

concerns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the blockage of the signages by plants and

signboards,  LTA  works  very closely  with  NParks,  and  we

conduct  regular  patrols on our roads to look  out  for  any

blockage.   Once  such a blockage is found,  LTA  will  alert

NParks  immediately,  if  there  is  a  need  to  remove  the

blockage.   LTA  is also careful that new signboards  do  not

block  motorists' view at road junctions.  It has,  in  fact,

recently  conducted  an exercise to review  the  position  of

existing signboards.  Some of the signboards have since  been

combined  to reduce the number of signboards and ensure  that

the motorists' view is not blocked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Yeo raised the issue of road digging. Road

digging  activities, Sir, are coordinated  through  the  Road

Opening  Coordination Committee, which the  LTA  chairs,  and

comprises representatives from organisations that need to dig

up   the   roads  to  lay  their  facilities.   They  include

PowerGrid,  PowerGas,  PUB, SCV,  SingTel  and  many  others.

Members  of  the Committee will coordinate their  works  and,

where  possible,  tie  in with LTA's  road  construction  and

maintenance programme, to minimise disruption to traffic flow

and ensure safety of road users.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a requirement that newly completed roads

can  only be opened up for laying of services two years after

the   completion  of  the  road  construction.    For   newly

resurfaced  roads, the ban on road opening is for  one  year.

However,  an exception to the above ban is made if the  works

are  of  an  emergency nature, such as  the  repairing  of  a

damaged pipe or a sewer pipe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, LTA and the members of the Committee

have  also  come  up  with many improvements,  including  new

methods  of laying pipes and cables without the need  to  dig

the  roads.  Notwithstanding this precaution, Sir, there  are

about  8,000 road digging works annually as a result  of  the

many development works and high demand for utility services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong has raised a few things about our taxi

industry.   Let  me  first  reply on the  question  regarding

fares.   Since  1997, taxi operators have been  progressively

replacing  taxi  meters  with more sophisticated  types  that

display the various fare components, eg, booking fees,  meter

fare  and  the various surcharges.  Today, about 92%  of  the

19,000  taxis  on the roads have been fitted with  these  new

taxi  meters.   Taxi commuters are able to  get  an  itemised

receipt  from  these taxi meters, on request.  The  remaining

1,500   taxis   will   be   equipped  with   similar   meters

progressively over the next 2 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the availability of taxis, Mr Noris Ong raised

the issue on whether or not we are looking into how to ensure

that  taxis  are available, especially in areas such  as  the

CBD,  or  after past midnight.  On the issue of taxi shortage

before  midnight,  taxi  operators have  the  flexibility  to

adjust their surcharges to match demand with supply, as fares

have  been deregulated since 1998.  TIBS' taxis, for example,

have  modified  their  surcharge to start  at  11.30  pm,  to

encourage  more  of their drivers to be on the  roads  before

midnight.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding some of these measures, Sir, we are

looking into putting in place a quality standard for the taxi

industry.   At  the  moment,  for example,  we  receive  many

complaints,  and  we  deal directly with the  taxi  operators

regarding  the  abuse of signages and people not  wanting  to

pick  up fares.  So there is an on-going review for the  taxi

industry.   Mr Ong has asked whether we could solve  some  of

these teething problems with a third operator.  We will leave

this to the review, as we deregulate the industry further, as

to whether or not there is a need for more than two operators

currently, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong has raised the issue of the liability of employee-drivers for vehicle offences. Sir, the law does place the

primary  responsibility on the owner of a vehicle  to  ensure

that  the  vehicle  complies  with  all  the  relevant  laws.

However, this does not absolve the driver, who also  has  the

responsibility to make the necessary checks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, a driver must ensure that his vehicle

complies   with   all  usage  requirements,   which   include

registration  and licensing requirements.  Other requirements

include,  for  example, complying with the vehicle's  maximum

laden  weight,  ensuring  the vehicle  does  not  emit  smoky

exhaust  and  is properly lit, as these would impact  on  the

safety or comfort of other road users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are parallel responsibilities placed by the law on

the  owner  and  the driver.  However, Sir, if  an  employee-driver  is able to offer mitigating factors for his  offence,

the authority will review his case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the question of electric vehicles

raised  by  Mrs  Lim,  I  would like to  thank  her  for  her

suggestion.  But, as she is aware, the Green Vehicle  Rebates

for   hybrid  and  electric  cars  were  implemented  at  the

beginning of this year, basically, to allow people  who  want

to  buy such vehicles.  The rebates are intended to lower the

upfront  and annualised cost differential between  green  and

conventional cars.  With these rebates and their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



lower fuel costs, the annualised operating cost of green cars

will be comparable to that of conventional cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not our intention to make green cars cheaper than

conventional  cars  as  the  primary  strategy   of   vehicle

ownership  still  holds.  But within this framework,  we  are

prepared  to  introduce  rebates to  try  to  lower  the  tax

component, so that the cost differential between conventional

and electric/hybrid vehicles is not too great.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of extending the rebates to buses and

taxis, LTA, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance,  is

prepared to consider this, if there are viable vehicle models

for importing into our local transport market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government will not intervene in the purchase

decision   of   transport  operators  by   stipulating   what

percentage  of  their  fleet should  be  electric  or  hybrid

vehicles,  as such decisions are best left to the  operators.

If  there  are attractive models available in the  market  at

prices  that  are acceptable to buyers, the  demand  will  be

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of infrastructure, Sir, the Environment

Ministry  is  the lead agency and, as I understand  it,  they

will  coordinate with other public sector agencies to provide

an   infrastructure,  as  and  when  the  technology  becomes

commercially viable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Will the Minister update the House

on the performance of Changi Airport?  It used to be a yearly

ritual that we will listen once again to the accolades it has

won,  or  survey results showing how well it is  received  by

business  travellers.   How  does Changi  Airport  stand,  in

competition with the regional airports in Hong Kong,  Bangkok

and  Kuala  Lumpur?  Does the Alliance grouping  of  airlines

affect  in  any way our airport's standing?  Given  also  the

prospect of longer-range and faster planes, will the dying of

distances have a likely impact on Changi Airport?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also request the Minister to give an update to

the  House on Terminal 3 and how he sees the traffic build-up

on the demand side for airport services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chay, would you like to proceed to the

next topic?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Thank you, Sir. On port

competition, I wish the Minister can update the House on  the

state  of  competition faced by PSA around this  region.   We

have  read of the recent developments of Tanjung Pelapas  and

Westport  in  Malaysia.  It must be fair to say that  Tanjung

Pelapas  has  made quite some progress since they  had  their

first  major  customer drawn away from the  PSA.   Would  the

Minister inform the House what is the percentage size of this

revenue  loss  from  the  Maersk pull-out?   What  about  the

significant  downstream  cost and  impact  of  this  loss  of

business?  Could PSA have averted the loss of the world's No.

1  shipping  line  as  customer, if it had  accommodated  the

customer's  need?   For example, we hear of privatised  berth

operation as a reason, correct me if I am wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many shipping MNCs have a need for integrated supply

chain logistics operations, and these require some degree  of

control  of  costs  and  schedules  for  their  supply  chain

rationalisation.  Such a need may indeed be a justifiable one

for shipping lines.  Are we answering to this need?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA did $2.4 billion of turnover in the year 2000, with

$1.4  billion of pre-tax profits.  That is a lot of room  for

competition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, all along,

Singaporeans  have taken pride in our port.   For  two  years

running,  PSA  has won the honour of being  ranked  the  best

seaport  because of the hard work put in by  the  PSA  staff.

The efficiency of the port has won acclaim from all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is said, "It is not easy to be No. 1, but

maintaining the leading position is even harder."  Today,  we

are  facing tremendous competition.  This is particularly  so

when 80% of our business comes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



from  transhipment services.  There is no  monopoly  in  this

business, and no shippers are duty-bound to stay loyal to any

particular  port.   Shipping  companies  can  transfer  their

business to any port, depending on the price, service levels,

convenience and preference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Maersk SeaLand sang "Goodbye, My Love" to PSA last

year,   is   only  one  example.   Though  the   company   is

contemplating  coming back to us, this does  not  change  the

fact  that we continue to face very keen competition  in  the

business.   One  real-life example is if 3 million  TEUs  are

handled  by Malaysian ports, there will be a drop of  16%  in

the  volume of cargoes handled by our port.  Even if shipping

companies do not intend to go to other ports, they  will  ask

for  more discounts and better rates by applying the pressure

of  competition.   West  Port has declared  that  within  the

region, their port was next to none, and Tanjung Pelapas said

that  it  was  the best alternative port and it  intended  to

surpass  PSA to become the darling of the maritime  industry.

Countries such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka are also trying  to

become the transhipment hub of the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have confidence in PSA, but I hope that

Government  would  take  heed of the  tremendous  competition

faced by our port.  We have to pay special attention to  this

as  it concerns the job security of the staff and workers who

work  in  the shipping, stevedoring and logistics industries.

I hope the Government will formulate policies and measures to

help  us  maintain our superiority in our sea port.  I  would

like  to ask: should the Government build a Jurong Port  when

PSA is already facing strong competition from other ports  in

the region?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Chay asked for an update on the

performance of Changi Airport and how does it rate versus the

other  airports, and whether the membership  of  the  airline

alliances has helped Changi Airport and the impact of the new

long-distance planes that are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



appearing over the horizon.  He has also asked for an  update

on Terminal 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Changi Airport continues to do very well. Last

year, the passenger movements at Changi Airport grew by 9.8%,

to  a total of 28.6 million passengers.  Cargo also grew very

strongly  by 12.1%, to a total of 1.7 million tonnes.   These

were  the  highest numbers in terms of passengers  and  cargo

movement  ever  handled  by Changi Airport  in  a  year.   In

addition,  Changi  Airport won 16 best  airport  awards  from

international travel and industry surveys in 2000,  and  this

includes the UK Business Traveller Best Airport award  for  a

record 13th time.  Changi Airport continues to do well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of competition, Changi Airport is facing tough

competition  because several new airports have opened  up  in

the  region.  At the same time, we are continuing to see  new

airports being proposed. This means that Changi Airport would

have  no choice but to continue innovating and upgrading  its

wide range of services in order to remain competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of ratings, Changi Airport continues to rate

very  well against new airports in the region.  The fact that

we  have several alliances flying through Singapore has  also

helped  Changi  Airport to register very strong  growth.   We

hope  to  continue  anchoring  those  airline  alliances   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of Changi Airport's strengths is its ability to

expand facilities ahead of demand and this allows the Airport

to  provide a high level of service to both the airlines  and

their  passengers.   In  line with  their  strategy,  we  are

expanding  Changi Airport by adding the third  terminal.   Mr

Chay has also asked for some updates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, construction work on Terminal 3 has started in

October  last year.  Tenders for the superstructure would  be

invited  in  the  third quarter of this year  and  we  expect

Terminal  3  to  be ready in the year 2006.  When  completed,

Terminal 3 will have a handling capacity of 20 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



passengers.  This will bring Changi Airport's total  handling

capacity  to 64 million passengers.   This will allow  us  to

meet very comfortably the needs of the aviation industry  for

many years to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the long-distance planes and the impact on

Changi  Airport,  the  key  is  connectivity  through  Changi

Airport.   If  we have the connectivity, then it  makes  good

reason  for the planes to land in Singapore in order  to  use

Singapore  to  re-distribute their passengers throughout  the

region.  And I think the passenger load in the entire  region

is  still  very significant.  Even though we have  the  long-distance  planes,  I  would still see  Singapore  and  Changi

Airport remaining as a key aviation hub in the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked about PSA. He asked about the state of

competition  versus  PSA and the impact of  the  pull-out  by

Maersk  on PSA.  Sir, the competition for transhipment  cargo

has  always  been there, even before the building of  Tanjung

Pelapas.   This  is because the transhipment cargo  does  not

really need to land in Singapore. They can be transhipped  in

many  ports  along the entire supply chain.   It  can  be  in

Kaoshiung, and also as far away as Malta and Sri  Lanka.   It

does  not  have  to  be transhipped just at our  neighbouring

ports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA has been meeting the competition very successfully

all  these  years and they have done it through a combination

of   well-developed  facilities  and  the  use  of   advanced

technology.  This allows both PSA and the shipping  companies

using  PSA to utilise technology to optimise their operations

and to improve their productivity.  PSA's competitive edge is

not  just  pricing.  PSA's pricing is not  the  lowest.   You

would  have read in the papers that many of the ports in  the

region do offer rates that are perhaps down to half the price

of  PSA.  It is not pricing alone.   It is, at the end of the

day, the total value-added that PSA can bring to the business

table and that includes the technology part and systems  part

that  help  the  shipping companies  derive  value  from  the

services that PSA is giving.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of Maersk's pull-out, Maersk made up about 10%

of  PSA's throughput.  No doubt, the pull-out by Maersk would

impact  PSA  somewhat.  Over time, the growth  of  businesses

from  the  other customers will help to offset  the  loss  of

business from Maersk, but PSA is not sitting still.   Members

would  have read in the papers last week that PSA and  Maersk

had  entered into a new agreement which would still see  some

of the major ships from Maersk calling in Singapore.  I think

this  will  help bring back part of the Maersk's business  to

PSA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On dedicated terminals, whether this is a factor in

companies  thinking about leaving Singapore and is this  part

of  the  supply  chain  factor, I would  say  that  dedicated

terminals  are useful in cases where the port  is  a  gateway

port,  ie, there is no need for connectivity.  The ship  just

comes  in,  unloads,  the containers  and  cargoes  are  then

distributed by land to the hinterland.  In the case  of  PSA,

the   bulk   of  the  business  involves  transhipment.    So

connectivity   between  lines,  connectivity  with   regional

shipping  companies to tranship to the regional markets,  all

these are very important.  In the case of Singapore, we  have

the added element that we are really very short of space.  We

need  to  optimise  the available space that  we  have  here.

Therefore, PSA's common user terminal operation allows us  to

optimise  the use of the limited land that we have, and  yet,

at the same time, achieve a very high productivity and a very

high  throughput.   This  gives us  tremendous  economies  of

scale, as well as the shipping connectivity, which is why the

common  user  terminal  approach has been  a  very  effective

competitive tool utilised by PSA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also commented on PSA's profit. I think his

implication is that it is very high and that this would  lead

to  even greater competition.  Let me put this in perspective

because  I think it is very important.  PSA handled a  record

of  17 million TEUs last year and even then, the revenue fell

by  3.3%.   As  a group, PSA's after-tax profit increased  by

11.7% to $838 million.  I think Mr Chay mentioned the before-tax figure.  This increase in profit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



can  be  attributed, amongst others, to improved productivity

from PSA's port operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The container port is a highly capital intensive one and

PSA  therefore  needs to invest in costly infrastructure  and

highly  sophisticated equipment in order to achieve the  high

service  levels  and the productivity expected  by  its  many

customers.  PSA's fixed assets currently amount to some  $6.8

billion   and   this   investment  is   going   to   increase

substantially  in  the years to come.  I  will  give  you  an

example.  PSA now has about 36 berths.  The new Pasir Panjang

Terminal, Phases I and II, will have only 26 berths  and  yet

the projected cost for these 26 berths will come to about  $7

billion.   The investment requirements are going to  be  even

greater  in  the years to come.  And yet, for all  the  risks

that  it has to undertake to put in all the huge investments,

PSA's return on assets last year was only 12.3% which I think

most analysts would agree it is not unreasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about Jurong Port. He also

talked  about the competition from Tanjung Pelapas and  other

ports  and  what would the Government do to help  ensure  PSA

survives  so  that the jobs we have would not be  lost.   The

only way for PSA to continue doing well is for it to keep  on

enhancing  productivity through the greater use of technology

and through better training of the workers.  I think that  is

what PSA has been doing all these years.  I am sure that  PSA

will  continue  to do so because they have very  good  people

there,  who  are very skilled.  They have a lot of  expertise

and  they have been able to compete very effectively  against

regional and international competition.  What we will  do  is

that  we  will continue to encourage PSA to explore  all  the

possible technologies that can be applied to the operation of

the  port  and  make sure that they continue  training  their

workers so that they remain competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Jurong Port, it has always been there.

It  is  not a recent development.  In fact, Jurong  Port  has

been  operating since 1965 and it competes with PSA for  both

the conventional bulk cargo as well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



as for a small number of container traffic.  What Jurong Port

has done recently is to purchase two container quay cranes in

order  to  improve their productivity in handling  the  ships

that  bring in containers to Jurong Port.  At the end of  the

day,  the capacity will still be very small because  the  two

quay cranes would only give Jurong Port a capacity of 200,000

TEUs  a  year  versus PSA's over 17 million TEUs  capacity  a

year.    Jurong  Port,  in  effect,  will  only  be  a  small

complement  to  PSA and it will not be a true competitor  for

the container business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the

Minister  for  his  comprehensive answers and  beg  leave  to

withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Yeo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, the issue has been raised

yesterday by other Members and answered by the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeo is not moving. Mr Ang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code IA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in last year's Budget debate, I raised the issue

that  the elderly in Singapore, aged 60 years old and  above,

should  be given full day bus concession.  Although this  was

not  fully accepted, I am very grateful to MCIT and  the  bus

companies for advancing the hours on Saturdays, from 2 pm  to

10  am.   This revision was implemented smoothly without  any

hiccups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the use of concession cards for senior

citizens is restricted to the off peak hours.  They can  only

enjoy the concession after the peak period, from 10 am  to  4

pm,  and  after 7 pm from Mondays to Fridays.  On  Saturdays,

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



can  enjoy the concession after 10 am.  On Sundays and public

holidays,  they enjoy whole day concession.   Right  now,  we

have  about  370,000 senior citizens who  had,  during  their

younger  days, contributed to the prosperity and progress  of

Singapore.   Their welfare should be looked after  with  more

objective measures, and transport concession is only one  way

to   express   our  appreciation  to  them  for  their   past

contribution.  I feel that we should relax the time limit for

senior  citizens  so that they can enjoy concession  for  the

whole day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many reasons for my plea. First, the

relaxation  of concession will facilitate senior citizens  to

go  out  and  take part in social and grassroots  activities,

and  to  visit their friends and relatives or to  help  their

children to look after their grandchildren.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the MCIT and the bus companies may be

concerned  that  after the relaxation, senior  citizens  will

travel  more  frequently  during  peak  hours  and  the   bus

companies'  income would be reduced.  These  senior  citizens

are taking buses not only when they are old.  I think many of

them  had been taking bus services even during their  younger

days.  They are life-time bus commuters!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole day concession has already been implemented in

European  countries  -  Canada and Hong Kong.  The concession

to  senior  citizens is only a small gesture of  respect  for

them.  It is not completely free.  It is only a concession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope MCIT and the bus companies can reconsider

this  issue.   To  start with, perhaps  they  can  extend  it

further by one more hour, say, from 9 am, instead of  10  am.

After all, after 9 am, it is not the peak period.  Later  on,

they  can  monitor  the situation and extend  the  concession

period to the whole day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, first, let me

declare  that I am a member of the Public Transport  Council,

but I am not speaking on behalf of the Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of public transport for Jurong Island, I

want  to say that Jurong Island is an impressive development.

Just  looking  at  the sand that is poured into  the  sea  to

reclaim  land, it must have cost billions of dollars   -   $5

billion or more.  And just driving around looking at the  oil

refineries, chemical plants, petrochemical complexes and  the

utility providers, it must also amount to billions of dollars

of  investments   -  $10-$20 billion, a lot  of  investments.

All  these investments can only yield returns with the people

who are working there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that lots of incentives and privileges are

given  to  the companies in Jurong Island.  However,  on  the

question  of  public  transport for the workers  to  man  the

plants  and  industries, more could be done.  At the  present

moment,  the  public  transport  that  goes  there  uses  the

farecard system.  But our people who use the farecard have to

pay  10 cents more than normal fares.  And the reason is that

the buses that ply there have to pay COE, and the workers pay

for the COE.  But for the rest of Singapore, because they are

public  roads, the SBS and TIBS buses do not have to pay  for

COE.  I think this is an anomaly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have driven along Jurong Island. I do not see the

roads in Jurong Island any different from the roads in Jurong

Industrial Estate or, for that matter, the rest of Singapore.

So  why should Jurong Island workers have to pay for COE when

the  rest of us do not have to?  Moreover, we say that we are

going to have a world-class transport system.  I think world-class transport system must include bringing workers to  work

as  quickly as possible, as cheaply as possible and as safely

as  possible.   And it must also mean allowing them  to  come

home quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that there will be a review of the system

and  there  will be improvements in the public transport  for

Jurong  Island  workers.    And  I  hope  it  will  be   more

convenient, cheap and more comfortable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I want to inform hon. Members that we have

fallen behind schedule again on this Head.  Dr John Chen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked

that the public transport concession rates for the elderly be

extended  either to 9.00 am or for the full day.  The  public

transport  operators had introduced concessionary travel  for

senior  citizens  to  help  defray transport  costs  for  the

elderly  who  are  retired.  The concessionary  fares  apply,

therefore,  only  during off-peak hours to  encourage  senior

citizens  to travel during these times, instead of adding  to

the crowd going to and from work and school.  This is because

being retirees, they have greater flexibility in timing their

travel.   If they travel in great numbers during peak  hours,

then the bus companies will have to put on more buses because

of  the higher demand.  That is costly.  So I think it  is  a

win-win  situation under the current arrangement because  the

time of the retirees is more flexible and therefore they  can

take  their  time to travel during off peak hours  and  enjoy

concessionary fares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the operators have been sympathetic to

requests  for the concessionary travel period to be extended.

And  as  Mr Ang has mentioned, they have brought forward  the

starting  time  on Saturdays from 2.30 pm to  10.00  am.  The

public transport operators will continue to review the scheme

from  time  to time, and to decide whether it is  viable  and

sustainable in the long term to extend the concession to full

day travel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas raised the issue of public transport in Jurong

Island.  I would like to give the House the background.   The

PTC  called  for an open tender for bus services  for  Jurong

Island, because of the unique transport demand pattern there.

Services  are concentrated within the peak periods with  very

little  ridership outside the peak periods.   Therefore,  the

PTC  decided  to call for an open tender, as an  open  tender

would promote competition and ensure that the operator offers

the most competitive rates for those travel demand patterns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS won the contract to run the Jurong Island bus

services,  which  commenced operations  in  June  2000.   The

contract is for three years with an option for a further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



extension of  two years.  SBS competed on the same  basis  as

other   tenderers  with  non-exempt  COE  buses.   The  other

tenderers are private operators.  And these buses are not COE-exempt,  because  the  successful  tenderer  will  not   have

universal  service obligation.  So we could  have  a  private

operator  winning the tender and that private  operator  will

not  have  to  operate other routes that are not  profitable,

like  the  two public bus companies.  The successful operator

could also redeploy the buses for other uses outside the peak

hours  in  order to reduce cost.  This is the  background  to

what has happened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to inform the Member that the PTC will

review the matter nearer the expiry of SBS' contract.  I know

what the Member is requesting.  He is requesting for the same

fare like the other parts of Singapore and therefore it is 10

cents  cheaper.   We  will ask the PTC to review  the  matter

nearer  the date.  By that time, Jurong Island will  also  be

more   developed  and  the  ridership  position  should  have

improved, and we  will ask the PTC to review it favourably.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

to provide an update to the House on the state of development

of  the Pasir Panjang Terminal.  I understand the Terminal is

built for 30 million TEU capacity.  Please correct me if I am

wrong.   And with this capacity, including the current Keppel

Terminal   capacity,   there  will  be  considerable   excess

capacity.  Will the Minister enlighten the House on how  they

intend  to  fully utilise this planned capacity  in  the  two

terminals?  One is a newly built one and the other  has  been

in existence for many years.  Obviously, the armotisation and

depreciation  charges are different, but given the  state  of

port competition internationally and regionally, what are the

plans  in respect of Pasir Panjang Terminal vis-a-vis  Keppel

Terminal?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, Pasir Panjang Terminal

first started operations in October 1997.  Today, it has  six

berths



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



with  15-metre  draft  which can handle the  world's  largest

container  ships.  In 2000, Pasir Panjang Terminal handled  2

million   TEUs,  or  about  12%  of  PSA's  total   container

throughput.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terminal uses cutting-edge technology such as remote

Bridge Crane System which allows operators to control  up  to

four  Bridge  Cranes  via remote control  at  any  one  time,

greatly boosting flexibility and productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pasir Panjang Terminal will be further developed as

the  need  arises.  The total capacity of the  terminal  when

fully  developed is not 30 million, but 35 million TEUs.   We

will  look  at the demand for port services and  see  whether

there is a need for further development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> Sir, thank you for the replies. I

beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code IE 3100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State, Dr John Chen, has already given

us his answer to an earlier question raised by Prof. Chin Tet

Yung on whether taxis should be allowed to drive in bus lanes

during restricted hours.  I would like to ask the Ministry to

consider  whether taxis could be allowed to go into  the  bus

lanes,  not to drive for long distances but just to  pick  up

and  drop  off passengers.  I raise this because,  given  the

competition among taxi companies, complaints by customers are

taken  very seriously, recorded and demerit points  given  to

taxi  drivers  who  do  not  provide  service  according   to

customers' wishes.  A taxi driver  risks  the cancellation of

his taxi rental agreement if he is not up to stuff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the complaints by customers is that taxi drivers

do  not pick them up or drop them off in the bus lane.   This

is  compounded in situations where the bus lanes run  for  an

entire stretch of the road.  Some passengers do not or refuse

to appreciate that it is against the law for taxi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



drivers to do so during restricted hours.  This can result in

a  complaint  being  made  against  that  taxi  driver.   The

complaint  may not be directly about not being picked  up  or

dropped  off in the bus lane.  But when one is upset,  it  is

easy  to  complain  about  rudeness, inconvenience  or  extra

charges.   At  times,  the  taxi  driver  complies  with  the

customer's  request, goes into the bus lane and  risks  being

caught, because he does not wish to be complained against.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it does not take much time for a taxi to enter the

bus  lane to pick up or to drop off passengers.  I think this

should  also  facilitate  better  taxi  service  and  a  more

satisfied customer.  I hope the Ministry will consider this.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I have explained to

Prof.  Chin just now why we could not allow taxis to use  the

bus  lane  not  just for driving but even for picking  up  or

dropping  off passengers, because the number of  buses  using

the  bus  lanes is voluminous.  For instance, if we have  130

buses per hour, that is every half a minute there will  be  a

bus  travelling.  And if you have 18,000 taxis, even for just

picking  up  or dropping off passengers, it will  affect  the

smooth  flow of bus operation.  So the answer is that we  are

not prepared at this point in time to allow taxis to pick  up

or drop off passengers in bus lane.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his concern about passengers wrongly accusing the

taxi drivers just because the taxi drivers did not allow them

to drop off in the bus lane, I can assure the Member that LTA

investigates  every  complaint very carefully  and  will  not

press  charges against the drivers for offences that are  not

committed by them.

Development Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code II

5200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take my two cuts together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I just have five points

to make where promoting e-commerce is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to ask the Minister if funds for

companies  and  trade  associations to promote  Singapore  e-business   and their own companies or to represent  Singapore

in  international bodies like the International  Chambers  of

Commerce and the United Nations' CEFACT; whether these  funds

could be used to help them represent Singapore just like  TDB

uses   funds  to  promote  Singapore  business  by  Singapore

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question is: the National Trust Council has been

announced by the Minister and this will promote Singapore  as

a  trusted e-hub.  I wonder if there are enough funds to make

sure that the National Trust Council would operate to deliver

such a very big task to success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third question, Sir, is: the content industry, which I

mentioned yesterday, needs a lot of encouragement, grants and

tax  rebates.  There  are a lot of things  that  the  content

industry  needs, for example, in film animation  and  perhaps

even  in electronic publications, grants and perhaps  a  more

liberal  seed funding and venture capital scheme, and venture

capitalists could also be given tax breaks to allow  them  to

absorb  some  of  the losses that may happen in  experimental

ventures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth question, Sir: the policies we need to attract

talent  for  this  development of  the  IT  and  the  content

industry for e-commerce may need to be liberalised.  We  know

that  the  Government has certain rules like if  somebody  is

earning  more  than  $3,500  a month,  he  probably  gets  an

employment pass much easier.  But I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



we  are pricing ourselves out of the market if we say that it

has got to be $3,500 and no less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth question: I think competition rules have got to

be  stricter because sometimes the big boys may want to  kill

off  the  SMEs  with their predatory practices and  that  the

Singapore  One highway is choked because there  is  only  one

access provider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second cut on funding of IT projects, I have two

questions  for the Minister on the funds that  VWOs  and  the

People's  Association would need to help bridge  the  digital

divide,  I  hope  that the Minister can  give  some  idea  of

whether  and  how  these funds could be  channelled  in  that

direction,  so that the various groups of people  who  cannot

access the Internet can be helped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Sir, is particularly for those who

are  disabled.   We  have in our midst some  people  who  are

disabled  and associations that help them to cope with  life.

IT  is  really one of the most important tools that they  can

use  to help them live relatively normal lives.  Some of  the

software   and  hardware  used  by  the  disabled  are   very

expensive.  I wonder if the Minister could help channel funds

for these VWOs to help the disabled to help themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Prof. Toh See Kiat brought up a

few  suggestions.  The first is on promoting e-commerce.   He

asked  whether funds allocated to trade associations  can  be

used by them to promote Singapore companies overseas.  I have

no  idea what specific aspects he is suggesting.  Since trade

promotion  comes  under TDB, he may  want  to  take  this  up

further with TDB and MTI.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on trusted hub, he asked whether the National

Trust  Council would be given sufficient resources to perform

its  task.  The National Trust Council has just been  formed.

They are now in the process of working out its workplan.   In

the event that the Council does require some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



funding support, my Ministry is prepared to consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, he asked if there is any incentive scheme for

companies  to go into film animation and so on.   Sir,  under

the IBBMM (Interactive Broadband Multimedia programme), there

is  a  sub-programme on New Media.  These companies can apply

to   the  MCIT  for  funding  support  under  the  New  Media

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh asked if the losses by venture capitalists can

be  offset.  Sir, policy on venture capital fund comes  under

the purview of MTI and EDB.  He may wish to bring this up  to

MTI and EDB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he asked whether IT talent earning less than $3,500

would  be allowed to come into Singapore.  I am not aware  of

such  a policy on the $3,500 cut-off.  Again if there is  any

specific  incidence,  he  is most  welcome  to  bring  to  my

attention, and I will look into it further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point he asked is whether we have in place some

competition  rules to make sure that the big players  do  not

penalise  the new start-ups, the SMEs and so on.   Under  the

code of practices for open competition, IDA does regulate big

telecom companies from two angles.  Firstly, the network must

be  able  to  inter-operate.  Secondly, we  do  require  open

access to all infrastructures.  So in the event that you hear

of  any SMEs that are being penalised by the big telcos,  you

are  most welcome to bring up to the attention of IDA.  As  a

regulator, they would look into the specific incidence  under

the code of practices for open competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On digital divide, Prof. Toh asked whether there is any

funding support for the VWOs to implement programmes targeted

at  the  disabled Singaporeans.  Sir, I am happy to say  that

there  is  indeed a programme where IDA works  with  NCSS  to

provide  funding  support to refurbish used PCs  and  develop

software and applications targeted at the disabled people.  I

assure  him that more funding support will be forthcoming  as

and when the need arises.  At this moment, there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



funding support available and the funding has not been  fully

used up yet.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  of State whether we should be looking  at  a  legal

regime for competition and whether, even if not, there should

be  some  kind  of  watchdog body other than  IDA  that  will

specifically be looking at telecommunications competition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, IDA is exactly the kind of body.

IDA   is   both   a   regulator  and  a  developer   of   the

telecommunications  market.  As far as  telecommunication  is

concerned, the competition code is already in place.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $468,838,020 for Head I ordered to stand part

of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,709,558,700 for Head I ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head E -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head E - Judicature. Mr Jeyaretnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head E of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code EA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister, or whoever answers this,

is: do we really have to charge the fees in court that we are

at  present  charging?  At one time, it used to  be  said  in

Britain  that the doors of the courts there were as  open  as

the Savoy, which was a very expensive hotel in the Strand  in

those  days.   Are we going to say that our court  doors  are

also open to the public, just as Raffles Hotel is open to the

public for them to go in and use the hotel?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, justice must be made available to all members of

the public, that goes without saying.  If it is not, then  it

is a denial of justice to a substantial sector of our people.

If  I  may just quote a few fees at random.  If you  want  to

take an appeal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



from  the  Subordinate Courts to High Court - it is  a  civil

appeal  -  you  have to pay $600, just to file  a  Notice  of

Appeal.  I do not know why that is necessary - $600 to file a

Notice  of Appeal.  And if you take an appeal from  the  High

Court to the Court of Appeal, it is $1,000 to file the Notice

of  Appeal.   That  is  not all.  If  you  want  to  make  an

application   to  the  Court  of  Appeal,  an   interlocutory

application  concerning the appeal that you have  before  the

Court of Appeal, then it is $1,000 again; and similarly  with

the Subordinate Courts, if you wish to make an application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in an appeal to the Court of Appeal, a sum of

$3,000  has to be paid to file your case to be argued  before

the  Court  of  Appeal.  May I know what is the justification

for  these  fees in our courts?  Are the courts in  business?

Have they been told that they must pay their way for the work

they  do, or is it the policy of this Government to see  that

everyone, regardless of his wealth, regardless of his income,

is  able to take his complaint or grievance to the courts and

as  cheaply  as is possible?  Justice is an important  factor

and  has  a  very  important  role  in  keeping  the  society

together.   If  a  number of people feel  denied  of  justice

because  they cannot afford the fees to take their  cases  to

the  courts, then clearly, they will be right in  saying,  in

Singapore, it is very difficult to get any justice.



<br>3.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So may I know from the Minister, or whoever is replying,

what  is the justification, what is the rationale, for  these

high fees in the courts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I ask why - I asked this of the Deputy

Prime  Minister  and  he  says,  "you  better  table  another

question",  I do not know why - is it that the courts  refuse

to  accept cash in payment of these fees?  It makes  it  more

difficult, more inconvenient for people if they do not have a

cash  card or a credit card.  Cash is legal tender.  Why  are

the  courts refusing to accept cash, making it more difficult

for the public?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, Singapore is not the only country that charges

court   fees.   It  is  done  in  other  countries  as  well.

Australia  does it.  Other countries which are not  doing  it

are  also  considering  doing it, for example,  Malaysia.   I

think charging court fees is the thing to do because judicial

resources  are  scarce.  For example, if one appeals  to  the

Court  of Appeal, it is three High Court judges sitting  over

the appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is hearing fees. In so far as hearings

are  concerned, court fees are only charged after  the  first

hearing day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I was not referring to that.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> For Court of Appeal cases, it

is  the same thing.  They only charge after the first hearing

day.  In fact, charging court fees have a salutary effect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Are you giving way?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> No, Sir. I have got only two

minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Resume your seat, Mr Jeyaretnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have to clarify because it is a

question ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Resume your seat, Mr Jeyaretnam. Carry

on, Prof. Ho.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> So charging court fees in

fact  has a salutary effect of getting our lawyers to be more

prepared for trials, and that has helped to shorten the  long

backlog of cases that we once had.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a study done by the Supreme Court on costs in our

courts, it was found that court fees only constitute about 8%

of  the total costs borne by litigants because legal fees are

expensive.  There are also other disbursements.   Sir,  I  do

not  think  having  to  pay court fees  will  discourage  any

litigant from going to court.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of course is, with the vast array of

alternative dispute resolution processes available, one  can,

instead  of dragging out one's case in court, turn  to  these

alternatives.  Even for appeals from the High  Court  to  the

Court of Appeal, like I have said, in a civil case, the Court

of Appeal will sit with three judges.  Even if you pay $3,000

to  have  your case heard, and $10,000 security for costs,  I

think it is justified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is "guillotine" time. Mr

Jeyaretnam, can you withdraw your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I will withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $74,630,950 for Head E ordered to stand part

of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $24,282,100 for Head E ordered to stand part

of the Development Estimates.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head B -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head B - Attorney-General's Chambers. Mr

Jeyaretnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head B of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns the decision of the Public Prosecutor

whether  to prosecute or not to prosecute.  This question  is

prompted by the questions that I have raised in this House no

less  than  three  times.   The first,  of  course,  was  the

decision of the Public Prosecutor not to prosecute the  Prime

Minister, the Deputy Prime Ministers and others who, we  say,

quite clearly broke the law on Polling Day.  I know there was

an answer given, but that was given by the Minister of State,

I  think.   But the Minister of State can only guess  at  the

reasons behind the decision of the Public Prosecutor.  It  is

time  that  the  Public Prosecutor, when the public  interest

demands  a  prosecution, that he explains why he has  decided

not to prosecute.  What are the reasons?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes to my mind some time ago when the Attorney-General of Malaysia had to hold a press conference to explain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



why  he  did  not  prefer charges against  the  former  Chief

Minister  or  Head of Malacca State.  Should not  the  Public

Prosecutor here be also required to explain?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two other cases are, of course, the case of the

shooting of the man in Seletar Hill Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, are you expecting a reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, I am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are approaching "guillotine" time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Perhaps, I will carry on and then just

withdraw  my amendment, because I know what the replies  will

be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You do not want to have a reply. All

right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have asked then and the answer was

that the police had not committed any offence.  I pointed out

the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, can I ask you to return to

your seat?  I think in fairness, Prof. Ho Peng Kee would like

to say something.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, unlike Mr Jeyaretnam, I

would  not  ramble because the answer is in the Hansard.   If

you  look  at the Hansard two years ago, he raised  the  same

topic and the Minister for Law gave a full reply. I think  it

is   very  clear.   If  you  look  at  Article  35   of   the

Constitution,  it  clearly states that the  AG  has  got  the

discretion   to   institute,  conduct  or   discontinue   any

proceedings.   And it must be so because he  is  independent.

He  does  not  want  his decision to be subject  to  scrutiny

either in this House or out of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why should it not be?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> It should not be, because you

cannot  say  in one breath that constitutionally he  has  the

discretion and, yet, in the same breath, subject all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



his decisions to scrutiny.  This is not the practice only  in

Singapore, it is also so in other countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, can you withdraw your

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I will withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $44,119,790 for Head B ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head S -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head S, Ministry of Law, Amendment No.

(1).  Prof. Chin Tet Yung.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's Budget makes several systemic changes

to  the tax structure.  It is one that will help to transform

Singapore's  economy  to  a  knowledge-based  one.    Staying

competitive and well-trained, indeed, retrained - that is the

message  to all who seek to benefit from this year's  Budget,

whatever sector they may be in.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is also the focus that the GPC for Law will be

taking in this Committee of Supply.  Members in the GPC  will

be  covering  issues  that involve  the  supply  of  lawyers,

training  and retraining for lawyers in the new economy,  and

the cost of access to legal services.  At the end of the day,

we  are  aiming for a strong legal system which is  not  just

efficient or high-tech, but one that delivers justice to  all

who  seek it, whether they be foreign or local, poor or rich,

at  reasonable  cost.  Indeed, the need for  a  strong  legal

system  is  paramount  to  a knowledge-based  and  globalised

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence and trust in the legal system is generated

not  only  in the accolades given to it by outside  agencies,

although the positive reviews of the judiciary and the  legal

system  generally do Singapore proud.  It lies in the  impact

that  it has over the lives of those who come before it;   it

lies  in the unrepresented defendant, for example, who, after

his  day  in court, accepts the decision, regardless  of  the

consequences to him;  it lies in the feelings of the divorced

couple,  that after all is said and done, they felt  that  it

was   the   best  that  could  be  expected  from  a   broken

relationship;  it lies in the mouth of the foreign CEO  of  a

multinational  corporation  who,  after  resolution  with   a

dispute  with  a  local  company, nonetheless  professes  his

confidence  and trust in the Singapore legal system,  whether

the  outcome of the case is favourable or not to him  or  his

corporation.  Such confidence, Sir, can only be  obtained  if

the system itself were to constantly upgrade, especially in a

changing  world.  Lawyers must be seen to represent  clients'

interests soundly and firmly, judges must be seen to dispense

justice fairly, the cost of access to justice must not be  so

prohibitive as to deny parties from their day in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to ensure that there are sufficient lawyers

in Singapore, such that costs are kept at a reasonable level.

At  the  same  time, there must be a realisation  that,  with

globalisation, there is a demand for Singapore lawyers beyond

our shores.  Law graduates are also in demand in jobs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



outside  of  the  legal sector.  Legal  training  provides  a

certain  measure  of versatility.  This is reflected  in  the

large  proportion of law graduates who do not enter into  the

profession  and  legal service, despite the  relatively  high

salaries for newly qualified lawyers.  For those who  are  in

the  profession,  there is a need to  ensure  that  they  are

constantly  retraining, so that they  can  better  serve  the

demands of a knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what is the legal

framework that has been put in place to facilitate the growth

of  Singapore's knowledge-based economy.  What are the  plans

for  increasing the number of lawyers in Singapore so  as  to

alleviate   the  tight  market  conditions   that   are   now

prevailing?  Would the Minister support the development of  a

Technology  Law  and Policy Centre that could  spearhead  the

development  of  Singapore  as  a  hub  for  high-tech  legal

services?   I  ask this because there is a  need  to  have  a

catalyst for legal training and legal research, especially in

the  areas  of information technology law, telecommunications

law and biotechnology law.  Such a centre may be located at a

local  university, but linked to other institutions  such  as

the  Academy of Law and the Law Society.  Together,  such  an

institution can focus on developing Singapore's position as a

centre  for  high quality legal services.  Such a centre  can

assist  also  in  the formulation of legal policies  for  the

knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone in Singapore has been urged to adjust to

the  demands of a knowledge-based economy.  The legal  system

and  the legal profession are not immune from the transition,

and  Singapore's laws and its legal institutions must respond

swiftly to the challenges ahead.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, first, let me declare

my  interest.   I  am  a lawyer practising  in  the  area  of

intellectual property law and have clients who would  benefit

from  a  change  in law.  But I speak with a conviction  that

what I say is critical to our national interest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are on the brink of a new millennium and heading into

the  New  Economy, where knowledge is wealth  and  intangible

intellectual   property  is  more  valuable   than   physical

property.   For the New Economy, we must have a legal  system

which strongly protects the fruits of the mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Government's credit, much of our intellectual

property  laws have been reformed to bring them  up  to  date

with the advances in the rest of the world.  We have also set

up  special  teams  in the police to deal  with  intellectual

property  offences,  as we realise that good  laws  are  only

platitudes if not strictly enforced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, the EDB and the TDB work hard to bring

investors and traders to Singapore, and many come along  with

their  intellectual assets.  Yet our image in  the  world  is

still  not  very  good.  Though we are no longer  the  piracy

capital of the world, we are still seen as a place where  the

long  arm  of the law seems to be impotent against those  who

steal  intellectual property rights (IPRs).  This is regarded

as  due to a lack of will, as we boast one of the best police

forces in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock answers given to investors who call for

stricter  intellectual  property laws  and  concerted  police

action are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We have laws as good as any in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We allow intellectual property owners to take

prosecutorial action or civil suits, on their own initiative,

to obtain redress in our very efficient courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We are doing the best we can, but we are short-handed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Our policemen do not know how to identify whether

an  item  has  breached anybody's IPRs and, indeed,  probably

these are very true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a country where law and order is almost a

religion,  and  the  police  have the  enviable  position  of

advertising  "Low  crime does not mean no crime",  and  where

respect for the police is very high,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



it  is  odd that they are clueless and helpless when it comes

to  prosecuting  intellectual  property  offences.   This  is

simply not credible in the eyes of foreigners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, in the HDB estates, at various trade fairs

and along the pathways leading to MRT stations - hawkers sell

pirated  films,  softwares, music CDs, DVDs,  VCDs,  etc,  on

makeshift  stalls  in  broad daylight.  Others  sell  pirated

hardware,  such as mobile telephones.  The pirates  are  also

very extremely mobile and disappear very quickly when the law

looms  near.   Yet  others operate blatantly  from  permanent

premises in shops and booths in shopping malls.  Their  goods

are ridiculously cheap and packaged in flimsy fashion.  Is it

so difficult to ascertain that their goods have infringed the

law?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is time to change our intellectual property

laws  radically.   We  can build in a rebuttable  presumption

that those who sell products at ludicrous prices in packaging

which is makeshift are selling pirated wares or, perhaps, the

presumption  kicks  in  the moment  the  IPR  owner  makes  a

statutory declaration to that effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden is then on the pirates to prove that they

have  the  copyright owner's licence or  that  they  are  the

copyright owners themselves.  On top of that, we can impose a

sort  of  occupier's liability on landlords and  tenants  who

rent out or sublet premises to others who are pirates or  who

are  found to be selling or manufacturing pirated goods.  And

when  they are convicted, they must be made to pay  fines  as

serious  as those in the Computer Misuse Act, and even  given

long  imprisonment  terms.  And they  must  be  made  to  pay

royalties to the rightful IPR owners, with interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no longer a good excuse to say, "No other country

in  the  world has such laws, so we cannot be so  draconian."

If  we aspire to be a developed country, then we must realise

that no other developed country has so extensive a problem of

piracy  as  we  do.  They are out there in the streets  every

day.  And we cannot say we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



have  no  precedent  in our law;  the immigration  laws  come

immediately to mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we agree that this problem is serious and we want to

do  something about it, we must seize the bull by the  horns.

We  must  rid  our nation of this blight and  threat  to  the

survival of the New Economy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, three days ago, the

tabloid  Today  had  an article on its front  page  headlined

"Lawyers  Go  for  Hong  Kong  Dollars:   Higher  Pay   Draws

Singaporeans to Hong Kong."  Of late, there have been various

reports  in  the media concerning the shortage of lawyers  in

Singapore.  There are also reports of a large number of young

lawyers  leaving  the  profession as a  result  of  the  very

stressful work, and of a lawyer even becoming a car salesman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legal service is an important component of

business  and  financial transactions.   Hence,  we  have  to

ensure that there are enough lawyers of the right calibre  to

provide the necessary support for our growing economy.  Also,

in  the light of the trend towards globalisation and the need

to  bring  in a wide range of expertise and experience,  will

the  Government consider recognising law degrees  other  than

those   from   the  United  Kingdom?   Given  the  increasing

complexity of issues which lawyers have to deal with in  this

fast-changing  world  of business, will the  Government  also

consider  recognising  joint  degrees  instead  of  pure  law

degrees?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I find myself in the

unusual  position of arguing for more lawyers  in  Singapore.

Nevertheless, I think there is a clear need for a  sufficient

number  of  lawyers,  and of the right quality,  to  maintain

Singapore's position as a premier financial and business hub.

And, there is both a quantitative and a qualitative dimension

to this need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quantitative side, as Mr Chng Hee Kok has also

mentioned,  media  reports would  suggest  that  there  is  a

squeeze on the number of lawyers in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



Singapore,  partly because several young lawyers are  leaving

the  profession  and  it would also manifest  itself  in  the

rising  starting pay of lawyers.  Meanwhile, the  demand  for

legal  services has been rising, in tandem with  our  growth,

both  economically and in specific niche areas.   These,  and

also  the  phenomenon of globalisation, would mean that  more

lawyers trained in Singapore and practising in Singapore  are

in  demand  not just here but elsewhere as well.  I  believe,

with  more  local firms striking alliances with international

law firms, this will further accelerate that demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the qualitative side, we need different types of

lawyers.   The  plain vanilla litigator or corporate  finance

lawyer  is,  on one hand, important to the traditional  legal

businesses.   On  the  other hand, as  we  go  into  the  new

economy,  we need lawyers who have the knowledge in  specific

areas  of science, engineering, and also in certain new areas

but  relating  to  these disciplines,  such  as  intellectual

property  rights, those that come under the WTO arrangements,

and the like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, Sir, our supply of lawyers in Singapore

has  been, to some extent, constrained.  I know that in 1993,

the  Minister  appointed a committee which recommended  that,

besides  NUS  law  degrees,  only  law  degrees  from  15  UK

universities  be  recognised for admission to  the  Singapore

Bar.  In addition, the graduates from the UK are required  to

attain  at  least  a Second Upper Honours degree,  while  NUS

graduates  are  required to attain at least  a  Second  Lower

Honours   degree.    I  believe  that  the   Committee   also

recommended that the situation be reviewed periodically.



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I gather that the Committee chaired by the Attorney-General has recently reviewed the situation and I understand

that  the  Attorney  General's Committee  has  submitted  its

report  to the Government.  May I ask the Minister  what  the

recommendations  of  that  Committee  are  and  whether   the

Government will accept



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



the  recommendations.  In particular, given the  need  for  a

wide  range of expertise and experience in Singapore, can  we

broaden  the  pool  of universities from which  we  recognise

qualified lawyers?  Also, can we exercise greater flexibility

in  recognising those who do dual degrees, perhaps in Science

and  Law, Engineering and Law, Accountancy and Law,  and  the

like?  Some institutions also offer shorter courses in law, a

2-year course or so, for those who already have a degree  and

professional  experience but wanting  to  acquire  the  legal

knowledge in order to better apply that in specific  context.

Would those be recognised?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, recently, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan

suggested  that law could be considered being  offered  as  a

post-graduate programme.  I would like to know whether  there

are any developments in that regard.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I will

take  the  points raised by the GPC Chairman, Prof. Chin,  Mr

Iswaran and Mr Chng Hee Kok because they are related,  and  I

will then reply to Prof. Toh See Kiat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Prof. Chin asked about the framework of our legal

system,  what changes are we making to gear up  for  the  new

economy.   Let  me say first that, as a general principle  in

our  approach  to  the legal system, we  consider  the  legal

system  to  be important, not just for our people's security,

safety  and resolution of disputes.  A sound legal  system  - and   by  that,  I  mean  all  sectors,  the  private   legal

profession,  the  legal  profession, the  judiciary  and  the

public  sector's  legal services -  is a critical  supporting

pillar   of   our  economic  growth  to  ensure   Singapore's

competitiveness.   A legal system, which has  people  in  all

sectors of competence, of integrity, with a sufficient number

of skilled people, is essential.  That has been our approach,

and  in  response  to  Prof. Chin, I would  say  that  it  is

probably  even more important now when advances in technology

and  globalisation have transformed the way we live and work.

He  is  right  that no sector, and certainly  not  the  legal

sector, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



immune  from  these changes.  Therefore, I  completely  agree

with him when he says that the legal system, if it is to play

a  role  in  the  new  economy, must be geared  to  meet  the

challenges ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, where do we start in explaining the various aspects

of  the  framework which we are attending to?  I  will  first

start  with  the  question of talents because  if  the  legal

system  does  not have enough skilled persons and  sufficient

numbers, it would not be able to rise to the challenge.  Here

is  where  I  will deal with questions of supply  of  lawyers

which all the three MPs have touched on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, with the Attorney General's Committee,

which I would refer to as the first Committee, we revised the

system  on supply of lawyers and we had the system  where  15

universities  in  the  United Kingdom were  recognised.   For

those who wish to practise law in Singapore, they must have a

Second  Class (Upper) Honours Degree and they must do a  one-year  Diploma  course  here.  We also provided  for  NUS  law

graduates to practise law if they have a Second Class (Lower)

Degree.   Since some years had passed, we asked the Attorney-General  to form a new Committee to review the situation  and

to  propose  changes  necessary  in  the  light  of  changing

circumstances.  The Attorney-General has presented the report

of his Committee.  Let me say that he found that there is now

a  current  shortage  of lawyers, largely  due  to  increased

demand  for lawyers brought about by the formation  of  joint

law  ventures and formal alliances, as well as the fact  that

increased  numbers  of  lawyers are leaving  the  profession,

either to become in-house counsel or to pursue other careers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, based on projections concerning the size of

the Singapore population and the growth of the economy in the

coming years, the Committee concluded that there would be  an

increased  demand for legal services over the next 10  years.

To  help meet the projected increase in demand, the Committee

had  recommended increasing the annual intake of law students

from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



the  NUS  Law  Faculty, as well as increasing the  number  of

overseas  universities whose law degrees would be  recognised

for the purposes of practising in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring a wider range of perspective and experiences to

our  legal  talent  pool, the Committee  has  recommended  to

include  some  Australian and New Zealand universities  among

the  overseas universities to be recognised.  In addition  to

the  15  universities,  other universities  from  the  United

Kingdom  would  be  added to the list.   In  all,  19  United

Kingdom  universities, 4 Australian universities  and  2  New

Zealand  universities will be recognised  for  this  purpose.

This  meets  the point raised by Mr Chng Hee Kok about  other

universities to be included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress, and Mr Iswaran made an important point,

that  this exercise is not just about numbers.  It must  also

be  about  quality.   We  must ensure that  people  of  right

standards   and  capabilities  enter  the  legal  profession.

Therefore, we will continue to insist on Second Class (Upper)

Honours Degree for graduates from the United Kingdom, and for

the  Australian and New Zealand universities, because not all

of  them  grade their degrees in the same way as  the  United

Kingdom  universities,  the  Committee  recommended  that  it

requires  graduates for purposes of practice to  come  within

the  top 30% of their graduating cohort.  The Committee  also

made  two  other recommendations.  First, it recommended  the

Board  of  Legal  Education be allowed to  recognise  certain

double degree programmes from scheduled universities for  the

purposes  of admission to the Singapore Bar.   I  think  this

recognises the point made by Mr Iswaran about the complicated

environment   of  the  future  where  lawyers   with   inter-disciplinary backgrounds would be an asset.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also recognises the importance of the

Board  of  Legal Education  being given wider  discretion  to

recognise as qualified persons those with multiple skills and

wide  range of experiences, which will be desirable  for  our

legal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



sector.  This can also be a route to help meet any short-term

demand in any specific area of legal work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should inform the House that the Government has

considered  and accepted the Committee's report, the  details

of  which  will  be  released  later  today.   These  changes

represent, in my view, a balanced and multi-pronged  approach

to  ensuring that Singapore has sufficient legal resources to

meet  the  continuing needs for its economy.  While  ensuring

that  our  legal profession continues to take in talents  and

entrants  of  sufficiently high quality, we will continue  to

ensure that our legal sector will be able to play its part in

supporting Singapore's growth and development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran also asked about law being a post-graduate

degree.  Let me say that no decision has been taken.   It  is

true  that Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan made  a  speech

which  included this point.  But he did not make a definitive

proposal.  I believe his intention was to provoke thought and

discussion.   I believe he was right in doing so  because  in

the  legal  sphere,  just  as in  other  important  areas  of

Singapore's  development, it is absolutely important  to  re-examine fundamental assumptions on which we have operated for

many  years.   In  that context, we should  see  whether  our

scarce  resources are being optimised to the  fullest  extent

and  is there a better way of doing things.  In that context,

we  will  examine whether the law degree should  be  a  post-graduate degree, as well as any other possibilities.  We will

look  at all the pros and cons.  One important consideration,

of  course, is whether the course will be unduly long,  given

the  present law course, and whether we can fine-tune  it  to

achieve  the  benefits  of a graduate  legal  education,  for

example, in the United States.  Other aspects which  we  will

consider will include the impact of graduate education on the

quality  of lawyers and the number of entrants to  the  legal

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other options, for example, of permitting law

undergraduates to read law and non-law subjects leading,  for

example, to a double degree.  We are still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



exploring  all these possibilities and a decision is  someway

to go yet.  As I have said, the key approach is not to assume

that  what we have been doing all these years and the way  we

have  been  doing it is sacrosanct.  We must be  prepared  to

examine all aspects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the point raised by Prof. Chin Tet Yung

on  other steps we have taken on our legal framework, I  need

to  mention very quickly a major step we took last year about

joint  ventures and formal alliances.  That was an  important

development to bring in top-tier legal talents from  overseas

to  increase the pool of legal talents in Singapore.  So far,

eight  joint law ventures and two formal alliances have  been

formed.  Prof. Chin will also remember that in the course  of

last year, we have also allowed law firms to corporatise  and

to  form  themselves as corporations, and this  would  enable

greater  flexibility for them and in the short space of  time

since  we  announced  it  in  October,  at  least  four   law

corporations have been formed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, an important development was the move we took on

the   recommendation  of  former  Justice  Goh  Joon   Seng's

Committee  to abolish the conveyancing scale of fees  in  two

years'  time.   Apart from the fact that this  will  increase

competition,  it will also have the effect of increasing  the

overall efficiency of our law firms and we hope that more and

more  of  our  lawyers, who are highly skilled professionals,

would  shift their focus towards higher value-added  work  as

conveyancing becomes simpler with technological advances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say in response to Prof. Chin's comments on

gearing  ourselves to a knowledge-based economy that we  have

formed  an  inter-agency committee to coordinate  efforts  to

develop  competency and expertise in ICT law.  The  Committee

will  explore  and develop new opportunities for  ICT-related

legal  services  and in positioning Singapore internationally

as  a  reputable ICT law centre.  In this regard, let me  say

that I would fully support the idea that he has raised of  an

IT and communication



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



law  centre in the NUS.  I think this would be helpful in the

overall scheme of gearing up our legal framework for the  new

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on Prof. Toh See Kiat's points on

intellectual property.  I would say first that we  are  fully

committed  to the protection of intellectual property  rights

and  we  have developed a three-pronged strategy.  First,  to

implement  good  legal framework to protect  IP;  second,  to

adopt  effective  deterrence and enforcement against  piracy;

and third, to educate consumers and inculcate in our public a

culture of respecting intellectual property rights.  He  says

that  our image in the world is still  not very good.   I  am

not  sure  I agree with him because we have been consistently

rated as having one of the best IP regimes in the region.  In

fact,   according  to  the  ASEAN-Pacific   Legal   500,   an

independent  survey of regional legal markets, Singapore  has

the  strongest and best enforced IP regime in Southeast Asia.

He  also  said  that the long arm of the law in Singapore  is

impotent  and  the  police  are  clueless  and  helpless   in

prosecuting IP offences.  I am not sure I can agree with that

either.   Of  course, we do not rest on our  laurels  but  he

should know that in order to undertake sustained and enhanced

approach  against  IP  violations,  the  police  set  up   an

Intellectual Property Rights Branch (IPRB), and the facts are

that  the  IPRB  has  smashed seven syndicates  island  wide,

seized  more  than $16 million worth of pirated articles  and

arrested  187  persons.  This compares  favourably  with  the

statistics  in previous years.  Together with these  improved

enforcement measures, the Singapore courts continue to impose

stiff  penalties for copyright and trade mark  infringements.

Offenders  are  consistently given jail  sentences  of  three

months to four years, and fines ranging from $15,000 to  $1.5

million.



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his points about enforcement at trade fairs,

these  are licensed by the Ministry of the Environment, which

specifically  imposes conditions against  such  malpractices.

If he or any other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



Members  in the House know of such violations at trade  fairs

in  their  constituencies,  I  hope  they  bring  it  to  the

attention of the authorities.  But when action is taken, I do

hope  Prof. Toh See Kiat and other Members do not then  write

in to the Minister appealing for waiver of the summonses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure taken is the establishment of a new

statutory  board called the Intellectual Property  Office  of

Singapore  (IPOS), details of which were given in the  Second

Reading speech on the Bill here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have to raise IPR awareness, and this is

being  done  not  only by IPOS, but also IPOS in  conjunction

with   other   international  organisations   in   organising

workshops, seminars and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat made some proposals on changing our

laws.  I am always open to suggestions but, at this stage,  I

can only give preliminary response to some of his points.  He

wanted landlords to be made liable for letting their premises

to  be  used  for selling pirated goods.  I am  not  sure  we

really  would want to expect landlords to constantly  monitor

the  activities of their tenants.   Whether we should  go  so

far   as  the  Member proposes, to impose  the  liability  on

landlords,  is something we have to very carefully  consider.

And  if I may take the analogy of theft, since IPR piracy has

always been made an analogy with theft, there is presently no

landlord liability provision concerning sale of stolen goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also proposed introducing presumptions, eg, if

somebody  is  selling IPR goods at very  low  prices,  he  is

deemed   to  be  engaging in piracy.   Here  again,  we  will

consider  his  suggestion, but I would  be  very  careful  in

making  such a wide presumption that might affect  legitimate

business activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to give time for the other cuts, I will

pause here and let other Members speak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, one of the desired

outcomes  stated  in the Budget for the Ministry  of  Law  is

accessibility to justice for persons of limited means.   This

is  the  basis  for  Singapore's Legal Aid Bureau  under  the

Ministry of Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, the quality of a legal system is

to  be  found  in  how accessible it is  to  those  who  seek

justice.   If  costs  are prohibitive for people  of  limited

means, then the legal system will mean little, no matter  how

up-to-date it is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, in the last decade, has seen impressive

improvements  in  the  legal  infrastructure.    The  use  of

technology  has made Singapore's courts the envy of  many  in

the  world.   Added to that have been significant changes  in

the approaches to the settlement of disputes, whether they be

commercial  or personal, criminal or civil.  The  quality  of

young  men and women going into the law is among the best  in

Singapore.   But  all this comes at a cost.   As  Singapore's

legal  system  and  procedures develop, we  see  also  rising

costs.   Lawyers  now cost more.  Global competition  reduces

supply  and drives demand for lawyers.  Procedures  are  more

elaborate.   Take a simple case in the Family  Division.   An

uncontested divorce can now cost a couple of thousand dollars

at least.  A contested one many times more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now mediation sessions to resolve matrimonial

disputes.  If lawyers are present, they will charge  for  the

time  spent.   Costs increase even though  mediation  may  be

free.   It  is  not as if Singapore has a very  sophisticated

system  of  dealing  with  matrimonial  disputes.   In  other

jurisdictions, for example, child counsellors are employed to

assess  what  would be the best solution to the dispute  from

the  viewpoint of the child.  Here, more often than not,  the

judge  has  to  interview the child or  children  himself  or

herself.    If  we  institute  such  a  system,  costs   will

undoubtedly increase further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my GPC colleagues will elaborate further on the

issue  of legal aid.  But suffice it to say that one  measure

of the quality of a legal system lies in its ability



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



to cater to as many of those who seek its assistance.  I hope

that the Minister will consider ways and means to improve the

access to legal services by reviewing the means test,  so  as

to allow more lower income people to be assisted by the Legal

Aid  Bureau.   Currently,  the  disposable  income  limit  is

$7,000.   Given  the rise in income levels  in  Singapore  in

recent  years, I would like to suggest that it should  easily

be  doubled,  say,  to $14,000, and that there  should  be  a

corresponding  increase  in legal officers  assigned  to  the

Legal Aid Bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, permit me to acknowledge in this House the

real contributions of the dedicated officers in the Legal Aid

Bureau, who often work long and hard to help those who are in

real need of their assistance.  They perform both social  and

professional duties with dedication and enthusiasm.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the legal aid

provided  for  those  who  cannot afford  legal  fees  is  an

essential  service  for the lower income group  of  Singapore

citizens.   However, there are many cases where  Singaporeans

need legal advice and yet fail to qualify for the means test,

as  set  out  by the Legal Aid and Advice Act.  Although  the

maximum  sum of annual income of $7,000, excluding deductible

items  such as personal and CPF deductions, works out  to  be

the maximum a person earns that can qualify for legal aid  to

be  slightly over $1,000 per month,   this is often found  to

be  too low.  Because after having to pay HDB instalments  or

rental  and  providing  for monthly expenses  and  children's

support, he or she would have hardly any money left for legal

fees,  especially  now that the legal  fees  in  the  private

sector have increased considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to request the Minister to consider

raising  the  capping  of  the  income  limit.   Perhaps  the

Minister should also consider, even after raising the  income

limit, exercising flexibility on a case-by-case basis, accept

deserving  cases  as  the fee one has  to  pay  for  engaging

private lawyers will still be way beyond some who earn  above

such limit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



I  think  Prof.  Chin  has just outlined  the  high  cost  of

engaging lawyers in legal cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to request the Minister to consider

strengthening  the  Legal Aid Bureau, as  it  may  need  more

manpower  to assist those who need help, even after the  case

has been settled in court.  I have often come across cases in

my  meet-the-people sessions where even after the victim  has

received court judgement, he still requires the services of a

lawyer  to  take  follow-up action to ensure that  the  court

order  is  being enforced when the other party defaults,  and

the  victim  is at a loss as  to whom to turn to and  how  to

proceed in order to have the court order enforced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I would like to declare

my  interest as an advocate and solicitor, and that  I  would

have an interest in what I am about to say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of the extent to which we extend legal aid to

Singaporeans has been discussed several times in this  House.

I think the primary concern is essentially whether or not the

means  test  under the Legal Aid and Advice Act is  something

which puts many Singaporeans out of reach of legal assistance

from  the  State.  This issue was raised last  year  and  the

Minister,  in  his  reply, said that the allowance  given  is

adequate  because  if  you  put in  the  various  deductions,

Singaporeans earning $1,200 may qualify for legal aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that, and as was indicated and said

earlier by my colleague, Prof. Chin, Singaporeans are earning

higher   wages,  and  certainly  it  is  not   uncommon   for

Singaporeans to earn more than $1,200 a month.  At  the  same

time, legal fees have actually gone substantially higher than

before.  A three-day trial in a subordinate court can  easily

set a party back by $10,000, and even higher if the party has

to  bear  the other side's legal cost as well.   And  in  our

legal system, in the context of criminal prosecution where  a

party is able to successfully defend against a charge against

him, the ability to recover his legal fees is limited indeed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the high cost involved in getting legal

representation, many Singaporeans refrain from seeking  legal

assistance, if they can help it.  Or they are just not  in  a

position to do so because of lack of resources.  What happens

then  is  that  access to justice is limited  to  those  with

ability to pay, and is denied to those who cannot afford  it.

In  short,  those who are charged for criminal  offences  may

take the convenient route of pleading guilty, just to get  on

with  their  lives.   I  therefore would  like  to  urge  the

Minister  to  consider  making legal  aid  more  flexible  by

perhaps  giving more discretion to the Director of Legal  Aid

to  consider each case on its own merits, and not just  using

the  means test as a main factor in deciding whether  or  not

one  qualifies.  For instance, a person can be  earning  more

than  $3,000  a month, but may be supporting a large  family,

leaving him with a limited disposable income for any form  of

funding for his legal requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an intermediate assistance scheme where some

form  of subsidy may be considered.  Presently, the Act  does

provide  some  form  of  co-payment.  However,  this  is  not

commonly  known  and  if the Director can  establish  certain

guidelines and criteria for such form of assistance and  have

this widely publicised, I think it will allow more members of

the  public  to gain access to legal aid.  I would  therefore

urge the Minister to consider these recommendations.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, for sometime now,

there  has been considerable discussion about mandatory  jail

sentences for landlords whose tenants are illegal immigrants.

I  have asked the Clerk of Parliament to distribute Tables  A

to  E,  but given the shortage of time, I am not going to  go

through  them, but they compare sentencing in the context  of

the Immigration Act contrasted with other Acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point, Sir, as I have listed in Table A, the

offences for which mandatory sentences have been set out  are

very grave  -  mutiny, kidnapping, violent rape



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



and  so on.  When it comes to other offences, judges have the

discretion  on the sentence to be imposed.  And in  my  view,

the  Immigration Act represents a serious erosion  into  that

principle.   The  point  is  that our  landlords  are  to  be

classified with mutineers, kidnappers and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the justifications for mandatory jail sentence

for  Singaporeans, in respect of this sort of offences?   The

three main ones that have been given are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that illegal immigrants pose serious social problems;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that judges are easily swayed by defendants giving

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"excuses"; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) that a deterrent effect is needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that each of these three reasons can be

challenged.   First, that illegal immigrants pose  a  serious

social problem.  Agreed, but that does not automatically mean

that every landlord who may have been negligent goes to jail.

The  flaw with this argument is that it confuses the  offence

with the offender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When punishing someone for an offence, there are always

two factors to take into account:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the nature of the offence; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the particular circumstances of the offender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What mandatory sentencing does is to remove one of these

two  factors from the equation.  And the question is: is that

justified?  That is why we have church deacon, illiterate and

widowed  old  ladies  and otherwise morally  faultless  young

accountants  going to jail.  Surely, we need to  be  able  to

consider the circumstances of the individual offender.  And I

quote  the  Chief Justice when he had to dismiss  the  church

deacon's  appeal.  He said, "I feel sorry for the people  who

are charged and convicted."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I would make is that flexibility

in  sentencing  and the ability to show mercy and  compassion

where appropriate is necessary for the proper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



functioning of the criminal justice system.  Let me now  turn

to  the  second excuse that is often given, that  judges  are

easily  swayed by defendants giving excuses.  Again,  I  have

difficulties with that reasoning.  We have to have  faith  in

the  judicial  system's ability to mete out  the  appropriate

punishment.   And  if  a  punishment  is  inappropriate,  the

prosecution  can always appeal to the High Court,  where  the

Chief Justice will hear the appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that judges will be able to differentiate

between those who deserve to go to jail and those who do not.



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with the third reason that is often

given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said sometimes that deterrence is the reason for

mandatory  jailing.   Again, I do not find  that  convincing.

Deterrence is almost always an aim for punishment.  But  that

does  not mean automatically that you need to send people  to

jail, regardless of the degree of culpability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Straits Times has over the years been reporting

all  these  cases, and you would have seen them - the  church

deacon, the accountant, the illiterate, the old lady, and  so

on.   Do  they  need to go to jail in order for there  to  be

deterrence?  I think one can easily argue otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also said, well, the AG's Chambers will exercise

its  discretion not to prosecute in appropriate cases.   Sir,

you  heard  the  Hon. Minister of State  just  now  that  the

Chambers'  exercise of discretion is not  open  to  scrutiny.

There  is  no accountability.  How would the public  know  in

which  cases the Chambers choose to prosecute and which cases

the  Chambers do not choose to prosecute?  That is  why  this

sort  of  discussion is left to the judges who have  to  make

their  decisions  public,  publish  the  reasoning,  and   if

somebody is not happy, either the prosecution or the  accused

can always appeal.  Once you leave this sort of discussion to

the  prosecution, there is always a question  of   "has  that

discretion been exercised fairly".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say this legislation, which seeks to send a

variety  of  people  to jail without seeking  to  distinguish

between  those  who are negligent and those who  are  morally

culpable,  has  caused  many  right-thinking  people  to   be

concerned.   And  I listened with concern when  hon.  Members

stand up and say, "Let's extend this to intellectual property

rights.   Let's punish other landlords."  It  is  a  type  of

thinking that could lead to a serious erosion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask that a change to the law be made as

soon as possible.  I note from the Straits Times that it  was

announced  last year that the law was being reviewed,  and  I

would hope that this be seriously considered.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, let me first deal with

suggestions by Members to raise the legal aid means test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the means test was last revised in October 1995.

The key component is the applicant's disposable income, which

is arrived at after subtracting the allowable deductions from

his income.  Currently, the disposable income limit is $7,000

per  annum  and the allowable deductions are $2,000  for  the

applicant and $1,000 for each dependant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MinLaw periodically reviews the means test to make legal

aid available to a larger number of low-income applicants.  A

recent  review was done, taking into account higher costs  of

living  and  increased litigation costs.   I  am  pleased  to

inform  Members  that,  with  effect  from  1st  April,   the

disposable  income  limit will be increased  to  $10,000  per

annum, not quite the $14,000 the GPC Chairman has asked  for,

but  still  a sizeable increase, and the allowance deductions

for  calculating the disposable income will be  increased  to

$3,000 for the applicant and $2,000 for each dependant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give the House a simple illustration as to

how   lower  income  Singaporeans  will  benefit  from  these

increased limits.  In a family of, say, four, comprising  two

parents  and  two dependent children where only  the  husband

works, the family would qualify



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



for legal aid, under the enhanced test, if the father's gross

monthly  income is about $1,850 (after making deductions  for

himself,  CPF  and  the dependants), provided  the  husband's

disposable capital limit comes within $7,000.  That stays  as

a  limit.   Currently,  for  such a family,  the  applicant's

monthly income must not exceed about $1,200 for the family to

qualify  for legal aid.  I am sure the Members will be  happy

with this enhanced limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other points made by Members, I will assure

Prof.  Chin  and Mr Kenneth Chen that Legal Aid  Bureau  will

have  the  capacity to handle the increased  workload,  about

20%.   More staff will be engaged and, indeed, work processes

will be improved and manpower will be further trained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin asked whether Legal Aid can be more flexible in

assessing  whether  or  not  aid  can  be  granted,  and   in

particular, he suggests that some form of subsidy be given to

those  who  do not qualify for aid.  Sir, Legal Aid  Bureau's

mission  and purpose is to provide quality aid and advice  to

those  of limited means.  It does not cover the provision  of

monetary  subsidies.   However,  that  does  not  mean   that

everyone who fails the means test will be left high and  dry.

Most  of  those who fail the means test, indeed, now  receive

legal  advice on the law and procedure and available  courses

of  action.  In any case, now with the high income limits,  I

think this would be less of a pressing problem.  Our approach

has worked well.  So I would tell Mr Sin, let us keep it like

this  for  the  moment,  and we can  review  the  means  test

periodically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go on to Mr Shanmugam's point. Mr Shanmugam

says that mandatory imprisonment to six months for harbourers

found guilty of harbouring immigration offenders is too harsh

and  indefensible.  I strongly disagree.  The  punishment  is

strict,    but   under   today's   circumstances,    entirely

justifiable.  I urge Mr Shanmugam and people of his like mind

to look at the big picture.  The nature



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



and  magnitude  of our illegal offender problem  justifies  a

tough  approach.   Last year, we arrested 16,500  immigration

offenders  -  a large number by any account.  As reported  in

the  media - you read about it often - they are still  trying

to  come in by all means.  An unchecked inflow of immigration

offenders to a small island will cause grave social harm  and

pose immense security and safety risks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot lift the mandatory imprisonment

requirement  now.   Why?  Because it  would  send  the  wrong

signal  and it would put Singapore and Singaporeans at  risk.

In fact, we should stiffen our resolve to tackle the problem,

and  that  is  being done not just by the Government,  but  I

would  urge  also Singaporean employers and landlords  to  do

likewise.  So this is the larger context from which  we  must

view  the strict punishment.  Larger countries in the  region

face  immense problems caused by a large illegal  immigration

population.  We must not let that happen to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam says that imposing mandatory imprisonment

on  harbourers  makes  a  serious  inroad  into  the  general

principle  that  the  law should provide for  mandatory  jail

sentences only in very exceptional situations.  This is  just

such a situation - the serious problem that we face which  is

a  grave threat.  That will be very real if we do not keep up

our efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of renting out a room to one or even a few

immigration  offenders in itself may seem innocuous.   It  is

not  a violent act.  No one is hurt.  That is a seductive but

flawed  argument - because if many people do it,  the  safety

and  well-being of Singaporeans, indeed the social  stability

of Singaporeans, will be threatened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Mr Shanmugam and others like him that the

Government invokes mandatory minimum sentences sparingly  and

only  after  very careful consideration, taking into  account

not only the nature of the offence but also the consequences,

if the offending acts are left unchecked.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not let our resolve be shaken by

misplaced sympathy for the cases of convicted harbourers.  As

Mr  Shanmugam  well knows, as a lawyer, hard cases  make  bad

law.   Should we change our approach because of these  cases?

No, we should not.  Mandatory imprisonment for harbourers has

been  in  place since 1984.  Many harbourers had been  jailed

before.  There was no public outcry.  This only started  with

the case of Mr Seow Boon Wah whose cause was picked up by the

media.   The media focused on the fact that he was a  deacon.

By  profession, Mr Seow was in fact an insurance  agent.   Mr

Seow's mitigation plea stated that he was an insurance agent,

and I quote, "He was an insurance agent until recently.", and

"He is currently serving the church ministry full time on  an

honorary basis."  But the press reported him as a deacon  and

the public was seized with that image.  Surely, it cannot  be

suggested that deacons cannot break the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam also mentioned an old illiterate and poor

lady  who did not know any better.  Well, Sir, many of  these

elderly harbourers are not as innocent as they appear.  Quite

a  few have been warned before for letting out their premises

to  immigration offenders.  But they persisted.   They  could

have  and  ought to have sought help, not least  from  family

members, to conduct the checks.  But they did not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being lenient towards these elderly landlords will

result  in  them  being  used as a  front,  say,  by  illegal

syndicates to beat the law.  To bring home the point, let  me

quote one example.  In a widely publicised case last year,  a

73-year-old  lady was jailed for harbouring five  immigration

offenders.   She did not check the passports or work  passes.

She was previously warned for harbouring four PRC immigration

offenders,   just  10  months  earlier.   The   warning   was

administered  in  the  presence of her  two  daughters.   She

obviously  did not learn her lesson.  Some thought  that  the

law  was too harsh on her.  But, in reality, she was a  smart

and  scheming lady and knew what she was doing.  She was even

smart enough to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



HDB  for a ride.  She had been allocated a 1-room rental flat

by HDB in 1991.  In June 1994, she bought a private  property

together with her daughter.  This was not known to HDB  until

a  year  later in 1995, when she was served a notice to  quit

the  HDB flat.  She appealed successfully through her MP  for

her  to be allowed to rent the flat on the condition that she

would  relinquish  her  share of  ownership  of  the  private

property.    However,  investigations   revealed   that   her

relinquishment of ownership was only on paper.  The  transfer

document  clearly  indicated that she was  to  be  given  all

rights  to continue staying in the private property and  that

her  daughter would have no right to dispose of the  property

without  her  prior consent.  Further, she  would  bear  full

responsibility  during her occupation of the  unit.   Is  she

therefore  really an "old, illiterate and poor lady  who  did

not know any better", as Mr Shanmugam puts it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cited these cases at some length to highlight the

danger of typecasting harbourers as "the poor deacon" or "the

old   and   illiterate  poor  lady".   These  are   appealing

caricatures which normally do not tell the full story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam is right in that landlords who have been

convicted  come from diverse backgrounds.  Nevertheless,  all

of  them,  by  their  act  of renting  out  the  premises  to

immigration  offenders,  have  contributed  to  the   serious

problem  today.   Their diverse backgrounds  notwithstanding,

there is a common thread linking them.  They have rented  out

their  flat and that have enabled some illegal immigrants  to

stay.  Their liability under the Immigration Act must be seen

in  this context, which is the requirement set out clearly in

the  Immigration Act for landlords to make some basic  checks

when they rent out their premises.  These are termed the "due

diligence requirements" in the Act.  These requirements  have

been  widely publicised.  No one should claim he is not aware

of  them.  Indeed, these commonsense checks are not difficult

to  fulfill.   Landlords  know that  they  are  dealing  with

foreign  tenants.   Yet, many do not bother  to  check  their

tenants' passports, despite the widespread and regular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



publicity  over  the  years about the  immigration  offenders

problem.   Some merely look at photocopies of their  tenants'

work  permits; others just leave the checking to the  housing

agents.  That is why offenders mentioned by Mr Shanmugam  are

convicted and jailed.  That is not good enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative development of the Immigration Act makes

clear  that the introduction of due diligence checks in  1993

was  to  prevent landlords from escaping liability by  merely

arguing that they had checked some documents proffered by the

tenants.   In  other words, to make clear  that  careless  or

negligent checking would not do.  In 1991, Justice F A  Chua,

in relation to a harbouring case, said that the social policy

of  the  Act,  and  I quote, "would not be achieved  if  mere

negligence  and  recklessness on the part of the  accused  to

enquire  about  the  status  of  the  illegal  immigrant   or

overstayer,  if he knows or has reasons to believe  that  the

person  is  a  foreigner, would be sufficient  to  rebut  the

presumption of knowledge."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice in a later case on appeal (1993) said

that, and I quote, "to allow an employer to evade the section

by  shutting his eyes to the immigration or employment status

of   his  foreign  employee  will  make  proper  control  and

enforcement impossible.  It cannot be placing too  onerous  a

duty  upon  employers in Singapore to require them to  screen

their   foreign  workers  before  employing  them  to  ensure

compliance with immigration policy and law."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, from the outset, both the courts and Government

were  in  agreement that our immigration  laws  must  not  be

defeated  by  a harbourer or employer simply making  a  claim

that  he  did  not know that the tenant, the worker,  was  an

immigration offender.  The judges agreed that our immigration

laws  should be interpreted strictly; in other words,  it  is

reasonable  to  impose some form of screening  or  checks  by

landlords and employers.  Being careless and negligent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



in  conducting the checks was just not good enough.   Indeed,

the  Chief Justice, in another case said, "Social and  public

policy dictates that the law relating to immigration offences

is  deliberately  strict.  Those who come into  contact  with

foreign workers are required to learn one way or another what

they must do and what they need not do in their dealings with

foreign workers."  The same can be said of landlords who deal

with  tenants  who are immigration offenders.   Hence,  being

careless or negligent is not good enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head R of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have come a long way in the promotion and

development of the arts in Singapore.  We are no  longer  the

cultural  desert  that  we were in  the  70s  and  80s.   The

Government  has  done much to facilitate and  assist  in  the

development of the arts.  Funding for the arts has  increased

manifold in the last ten years.  Busking is now legal.  There

is also an increased outreach programme in schools, parks and

communities.   Funding  for  the  arts  education  has   also

increased  in recent years.  Some arts groups are now  housed

in  permanent  locations  and are  partially  funded  by  the

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



Then  there is also the Annual Arts Festival and Singaporeans

today   are   able   to  enjoy  the  benefits   of   numerous

international shows in a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also building the $600 million arts

centre  called The Esplanade - Theatre at the Bay which  will

be  ready in the second half of next year.  Sir, credit  must

go  to  the  National Arts Council  and the various  agencies

under   MITA   for   promoting  and   developing   the   arts

successfully.  Perhaps, it is time to take stock of what  had

been  achieved in the past decade of the development  of  the

arts.  I would therefore like to ask the Minister if he would

update  the  House  on  his  Ministry's  mission  to  develop

Singapore as a Renaissance City and where do we proceed  from

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the same cut, I have a specific question to ask

and  that pertains to the criteria for state fundings of  the

arts.  I am concerned that, in our haste to promote the  arts

in  Singapore, we may have inadvertently forgotten  the  fact

that  we live in a multi-racial, multi-religious society with

strong  moral and ethical standards.  Of late,  a  number  of

productions  by artistes, both local and foreign,  have  been

staged  in  Singapore to public audience which have  included

rather controversial and sensitive topics.  Take the case  of

Talaq   which  covers  one  Indian-Muslim  story  of  marital

violence  and  rape.  Then there is Rent,  a  rock  'n'  roll

musical  that  included positive treatments of  homosexuality

and drug abuse.  And there are others like Asian Boys Vol. 1,

the S and M Musical "Chameleon", and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not averse to letting artistes expressing

themselves.   However,  left to their  own  decisions,  I  am

concerned  that  art  for arts' sake can include  just  about

anything  that  may not be in the interest of our  community.

It  is  therefore necessary to ensure that state funding  for

the  arts, whether through the NAC or other agencies,  should

be a lot more selective with some definable criteria.  Whilst

we  would  like  to support creativity and  develop  our  own

critical  mass of local artistes, we may have to  be  careful

when public funds are poured into productions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



that  have themes that are anathema to the wider interest  of

our  society.   Lines  have to be drawn to  maintain  certain

standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to propose that MITA has clearly

defined  rules  setting out criteria in granting  funding  or

sponsorship of the arts so that the artistes are  more  aware

of  what  the  playing field is.  In addition, perhaps,  MITA

could  come  out  with a code of practice  binding  corporate

sponsors for the arts as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to inform hon. Members that

discussions on Mr Chew's amendment should end by 6.25 pm.  Dr

Jennifer Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, the National Arts Council's

mission  statement  speaks  of developing  Singapore  into  a

vibrant  global city of the arts.  This is not just a  luxury

that  we  can now afford to allow ourselves but, in fact,  an

integral  part  of  what  needs to  happen  to  make  this  a

satisfying  and indeed an exciting place to live in  both  to

engage  our own young talented people and keep them  here  as

well  as  to attract the additional foreign talents  that  we

need to our shores.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.51 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Government is supportive is clear from its

acceptance last year of the Renaissance City Report  and  the

commitment of $50 million in funding over the next five years

towards  this initiative.  Sir, the NAC has a great challenge

ahead   of  it.   Let  me  start  by  saying  that  from   my

conversations  with various arts groups and practitioners,  I

have   heard   much   positive  comments  about   the   NAC's

accessibility, about its efforts to establish and maintain  a

good  dialogue with the arts community and its responsiveness

to  suggestions  and  recommendations made  about  assistance

schemes  and  training grants that would be most helpful  and

supportive.  Building depth in industry is not something that

can be achieved overnight.  And currently, it is difficult to

find enough good and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



experienced  people  from players to technicians,  production

managers,  all categories of people, for all the  events  and

activities that are now being organised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying problem is the inability to pay enough to

build  a  good solid core of full-time professionals  in  the

arts  industry.  It seems that, apart from a  few  in  senior

positions in the big very well established groups, either you

need  to  have very supportive and understanding parents  who

will  allow  you to live with them, probably well  into  your

geriatric years, or you have still to be working part time in

the  arts  and  sustain  yourself in another  day  time  job.

Because, historically, the arts group has been functioning in

this manner.  From our days of a completely amateur community

in  the  arts,  the operating budget all this time  has  been

built  on a base of token salaries and allowances.  They  are

caught  now  in  a bind.  How can you justify  quantum  leaps

percentage-wise  in  your  manpower  costs  in   putting   up

programmes?   The  groups  are  very  appreciative   of   the

additional funding they have been getting lately.   But  much

of  it  is  going to more programmes and activities and  very

little to adjusting salaries and allowances to anything  even

close to what would be needed in the longer term to make  any

difference  in  growing a core of full-time professionals  in

the arts, which is what you are going to need if you want  to

build that group in the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, and from the perspective of supporting

most  wholeheartedly what NAC is seeking to achieve,  I  must

say  that  it must be a very tough task to develop  a  global

city  in the arts with an annual budget of $32 million  which

is what the NAC has for FY 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice that the projected increase in next year's

budget  is  only about $3 million in operating budget.   When

you look at the $50 million over five years that has been set

aside for the Renaissance City initiatives, this seems rather

less than what one would expect.  Possibly, the NAC



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



is  being  prudent and saving more to be spent in  the  later

part  of the five years.  But I would encourage it to be more

aggressive and pump in the resources early, to jump-start the

effort  so  that we can get to the critical mass of  industry

players and participants to really make the difference.   And

to  support and, in fact, encourage arts groups in its review

and  approval  of  grants,  that they  should  factor  in  in

increasing  the amounts needed to start moving  artistes  and

arts  professionals'  remuneration towards  levels  that  are

necessary to make careers in the arts more viable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I also pick up on Mr Chew's point on concern about

regulation  in  the  view  of  the  more  liberal  and   some

controversial  and  possibly provocative programmes  that  we

have  been  seeing lately?  I do understand that,  given  our

very  varied and diverse community, this would be a  concern.

I  know that currently, there is a review going on as to  how

the  arts  should be licensed and regulated.  I  would  argue

very  strongly to keep in fact the regulating  body  and  the

funding body separate because, otherwise, it is going  to  be

extremely difficult.  You are going to get tied up  in  knots

as  to what you should be funding, as an agency promoting the

arts,  and  what you need to be taking care of, in  terms  of

sensitivity to our communities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Government has

increased funding for the arts.  This is a very positive step

forward  for  the arts scene in Singapore.  At present,  four

established groups receive $2 million each, 17 smaller groups

share  another  $2  million, with the  remaining  $2  million

shared  by  another 60-odd groups.  However,  community-based

and  clan association-based groups are not eligible for funds

from this scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation in funding does not acknowledge the

important  role the small groups play in forging cohesiveness

as  well  as  in  promoting  understanding  among  groups  of

different cultural backgrounds.  With a very small population

in  Singapore, it is very difficult for performing groups  to

solely rely on its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



own  community  to survive, not to say flourish.   Without  a

vibrant  arts  scene  at the grassroots level,  it  would  be

difficult for Singapore to cultivate arts as an integral part

of every Singaporean's life, the foundation for a Renaissance

City.   However, we have been very fortunate to have a  group

of   successful  Singaporeans  who  are  also   strong   arts

supporters.   It  is this group of arts supporters  who  have

been  contributing to the small groups.  And each  year,  the

National Arts Council confers its prestigious Patron  of  the

Arts Awards, Friends of the Arts Awards and Associate of  the

Arts  Awards to those who contribute $50,000 and  more.   The

supporters of the small groups have been neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the NAC launched the New Arts

Supporters  Award  this  year  to  recognise  this  group  of

sponsors  who have contributed less than $50,000 towards  the

promotion  and organisation of the artistic activities.   The

contribution of this group of small time supporters  has  not

been recognised for a long, long time.  However, it is better

late than never.  I would like to urge MITA to also award the

Outstanding  Small  Performing Arts  Group,  based  on  their

performance and potential.  The award can be in the  form  of

cash  grant, plus training opportunity.  At present, most  of

the  arts  groups survive on a very lean budget.   Funds  and

opportunities for training should be extended  to  the  small

arts groups, especially in the area of arts management.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I am delighted with

the  multitude  of  art  events  that  are  taking  place  in

Singapore daily.  In fact, on some days, Singaporeans have  a

difficult  time choosing what art events to attend.   I  must

congratulate MITA, in particular, the National Arts  Council,

for   implementing  many  of  the  public   suggestions   and

recommendations contained in the Renaissance City plan.  I am

particularly glad that NAC has started using the $50  million

Government  fund to fund various performing  arts  groups  in

Singapore.  With all these efforts and the completion of  The

Esplanade  -  Theatre at the Bay in 2002,  we  can  certainly

proclaim ourselves as a global city for the arts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to give us an update on

the    progress   made   on   the   implementation   of   the

recommendations contained in the Renaissance  City  plan  and

the future plans of the Ministry to bring arts to the people,

particularly to those in the HDB heartland.



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the concerns that has been raised by those

in  the  arts  arena is to have greater transparency  in  the

grant  of  funds by the NAC, for arts groups.  I  have  often

heard  complaints of certain arts groups being favoured  over

others.   I  would like to ask the Minister  to  explain  the

process of how NAC considers grants, and how far the NAC  can

go,  to make the process a transparent one so that the public

can see for themselves how the funds are disbursed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point that I would like to raise is that

one  of  the yardsticks for success as an artiste is to  gain

international recognition.  I am sure that we have many local

artistes who are well known internationally.  There are  many

more  local artistes who will need international exposure  to

continue  their  learning  through  exchange  programmes  and

overseas  performances.  I would like to ask the Minister  as

to  the measures that have been taken by MITA to provide  the

necessary international exposure to these young budding local

artistes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, there has already been some

debate  on  this  subject  of media liberalisation  recently.

However,  I  would like to reinforce the concern  that  media

liberalisation, which has thus far involved the proliferation

of  a great number of newspapers generally reporting the same

news, may lead, if we are not careful, to a deterioration  in

quality   standards  of  newspapers,  in  order  to   attract

attention and ensure circulation volume.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public now has a wide variety of newspapers to

choose from.  These include our traditional Straits Times and

the  mass  circulation  New Paper,  Streats,  Today,  Project

Eyeball.  In order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



compete  for readership and, hence, advertising revenue,  our

press has occasionally resorted to sensationalisation at  the

expense  of  providing  pertinent and  reliable  information.

Sir, it is not just Project Eyeball or Streats which displays

centrespreads of a scantily-clad Jennifer Lopez, for example.

Even the venerable Straits Times has not been spared the need

to  highlight sex and violence occasionally.  Take the Sunday

Times  of  25th February 2001, for example, where  the  story

about a couple making love on board a British Airways flight,

covered  a significant part of the front page of that  paper.

News  on  ministerial walkabouts or national  policy  news  - which  certainly cannot compete as juicy news - do not always

steal a front page story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the local print media is still protected by

legislation  from foreign competition.  It has  therefore  an

obligation  to  continue  to support the  national  interest,

which  is to raise the awareness of domestic and other issues

which  are critical to nation-building.  We cannot afford  to

have this role negated completely for commercial interest as,

once  we  start on that slippery slope downhill, it  will  be

difficult  to  crawl back to higher standards of journalistic

integrity, which our media should aspire to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to propose to the Minister that

the  Publication  Advisory Committee (PAC) of  MITA  step  up

efforts  and  take  on a more pro-active  role  in  reviewing

journalism  and editorial standards of our newspapers.   Like

the  other  two  more  active programme  advisory  committees

overseeing programming and development in the other two media

-  the broadcast and Internet - I propose that the PAC should

report to the Minister regularly as a check against any  drop

in standards of reporting by our local newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, last year, the

Government  liberalised  the media.   There  are  three  more

newspapers now.  Singaporeans are aware of the keen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



competition in print media and they know that it is better to

have  competition because they can get free  newspapers.   On

the other hand, in order to stimulate their sales volume, the

newspapers  have resorted to feature all kinds of sensational

news.  But it is too early to conclude whether the additional

newspapers are good or bad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broadcasting and TV stations will also be plunged

into  competition.  We have to make use of SCV to serve every

home  in  Singapore as well as homes outside Singapore.   The

Minister,  in answer to questions about the media,  has  said

that  the opening up of the newspapers and the press is good,

although  there  are  some  newspapers  which  feature   some

scantily-dressed ladies on their front-page  to  attract  the

readers.    Will  MITA review the guidelines  on  the  media?

Whether  they are in English, Chinese, Malay or Tamil,  there

should  be  some  fair  guiding principles  so  that  our  TV

stations will not lower their standards and resort to sex and

violence  in  order  to  get  more  viewers.   What  kind  of

assistance will be given to our local stations to  cope  with

the  competition by the foreign stations?  We cannot deny the

fact  that many Singaporeans have started to switch  over  to

foreign stations as they find foreign TV programmes of a very

high   standard,  in  terms  of  programming,   content   and

packaging, etc.  Therefore, we have to catch up with foreign-made  programmes.  It is possible that after watching foreign

programmes  for  some time they may not switch  back  to  our

local  stations and be oblivious of what has been   happening

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am

a   bit   more  optimistic  about  the  experiment  on  media

liberalisation so far, compared to the previous speakers, and

rise  to  urge  the  Minister  to  allow  and  consider  some

regulation  of  the  media to keep  pace  with  the  expected

further liberalisation down the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a recent meeting of the feedback group on mass

media,   participants   expressed   the   view   that   media

liberalisation has brought about greater choices



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



and   variety   of   news  reporting,  with  newspapers   and

broadcasting  stations targeting on specific  niche  markets.

This  is very good because readers can now choose the  papers

and  TV  channels that would best cater to their  own  needs.

And, fortunately, despite the competition and availability of

free  newspapers,  we  have so far  escaped  the  much-feared

negative  impact  that media liberalisation could  bring,  as

experienced in some countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspapers, in general, have not been tempted or

distracted to sell sex, sleaze and crime as a means to  boost

circulation,  but there is one qualifier.  This afternoon,  I

am  tempted  to  change  my mind after  Prof.  Toh  See  Kiat

distracted  my  attention and showed  me  the  centrefold  of

today's Today newspaper.  A large part of the success, except

for  this  exception, is primarily due to the restriction  on

ownership  of  the media that still remains in the  hands  of

trusted  Singapore Government-owned companies, which  carries

with  it special voting rights. Generally the press has  been

responsible  in  balancing its rights  and  responsibilities,

trusted  for  its  role in public service, and  impartial  in

balancing  reports and views - sometimes,  I  notice,  taking

pains to separate information from opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I find it very ironic that while the local

media  is  trusted  to serve the general good  of  Singapore,

protecting  our culture and religious values, and  recognised

as  important partners in nation building, yet it is not good

enough to regulate or self-regulate or look after some of its

internal interests.  My own view is that the press has earned

the   public  trust  to  be  self-regulated,  and  we  should

encourage this, at least for two very important reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Further liberalisation can be expected. New

technologies will mean greater availability and accessibility

of  all  kinds of news media being delivered right  into  our

homes.   We  must, therefore, start paving the  way  for  the

media   themselves  to  establish  some  of  the  rules   and

regulations  in which they operate.  It would be increasingly

difficult  for  the Government to continue  to  regulate  the

media in its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



existing   form  in  the  face  of  new  and  ever-increasing

information  channels brought about by new  technologies.   A

responsible media is ultimately better placed to decide  what

is  desirable and what is not.  If we can achieve this,  just

like some of the regulations on Internet, then regulations on

our media can be administered with a lighter touch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We still need to do a lot more to overcome the

unfortunate  negative perceptions associated with  the  local

media  implied by the statutory regulations - that of  heavy-handed  control  of  censorship,  or  the  encouragement   of

censorship,  and  the fear that the very organisations  which

are  more often the subject of hard news, ie, Government  and

institutions,  are judging the rules on how  they  should  be

covered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that a Press Commission be set up with members

from  the  media representatives and lay persons,  and  given

powers  to  take complaints from the public and to judge  the

behaviour  of  its  members according to an  agreed  code  of

practice.  If need be, this autonomous body can still  report

to  the  Minister.  The Commission can, for  example,  settle

disputes on unethical practices and unfair behaviour  by  the

media.   For example, the recent revelation of the  financial

circumstance  of  a  TCS actress raised in  some  people  the

legitimate fears of media intrusion into what should  be  the

private  lives of individuals, especially of persons who  are

neither officials nor public figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it could pave the way for further

liberalisation,  if  the system proves  media  capability  to

sustain responsible and ethical behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there are adequate laws and provisions that

currently exist to ensure that self-regulation will not  lead

to  a free-for-all situation or an adversarial or ideological

partisan media environment.  I, for one, would agree that the

existing  defamation laws, for example, must remain in  force

to  ensure  that the media continue to strike the appropriate

balance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



between   the  protection  of  regulation  and   freedom   of

expression.   But I am hoping that the Minister  acknowledges

that in the long-run, self-regulation is a necessary step  in

the on-going process of media liberalisation.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Thank you, Sir, for letting

me join in the debate, and thank you, Encik Zulkifli, for the

teaser.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a liberal age and our various monopolistic

and   cartelistic   businesses  are   being   introduced   to

competition.  Telecommunications, power generation, you  have

it.  and,  now,  television  and  newspapers.   We  are  also

becoming very liberal in our values.  But I jump ahead of  my

story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, I sat down to watch a television

programme which my newspaper TV schedule proclaimed to  be  a

documentary.   It was called "The Making of  Perfection".   I

should  have  known better, as that title was the advertising

slogan  of  a  luxury brand of cars.  It was  15  minutes  of

shameless  self-praise.   For such a  programme  in  America,

there  are  laws requiring the insertion of a footer  on  the

screen stating that it is a paid commercial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, sometimes we make mistakes, errors of judgement

and,  in  that  case, the TV station admitted  it  was  their

fault,  and  apologised  for  the  wrong  labelling  of   the

programme.   Still, a legally-mandated footer on  screen  for

such  programmes,  as also for TV shopping programmes,  would

have been proper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some days ago, I saw the gory picture of a girl with 70%

burns,   in  full  colour,  on  the  front  of  two   evening

newspapers.  No surprise to many of us, I suppose.  But  that

picture  appeared too in the English tabloids and  -  take  a

deep  breath - in full colour, on the front page,  of  a  so-called  "quality, family newspaper" (but greatly  reduced  in

size, as if that reduces the offence).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspapers, magazines, television programmes, radio

programmes - no one is apologetic these days that there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



an  increasing  supply  of  sex, blood,  scanty  clothes  and

prurient  "news stories" - the kind where sexual  organs  are

cut  by  furious wives, sexual offenders whose  offences  are

described in graphic detail, transsexuals who play volleyball

-  you  name it, they have it.  And, in case you want  me  to

give  you  an  example,  this is what Mr  Zulkifli  mentioned

[indicating] - on the pretext of reporting the decline in the

morals  of  fashion  shows  - full  colour,  scantily-clothed

ladies.  Sir, would you like a closer look?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrepentant radio programmers even urge critics to

switch  off  the  radio if they do not like  the  programmes.

That,  to  me, Sir, is akin to saying, "Let us allow  Playboy

magazine to come in and, if any one objects to it, don't  buy

it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times, Today, Streats, Wanbao - what have

you  -  they have all cut close to the fringes of bad  taste,

murky  morals  and dodgy ethics.  Advertisements masquerading

as  staff-written feature articles.  Here is another example.

Today's Today, page 34, a full-page feature on the glories of

Dubai  and  a  full page advertisement, next page,  on  Dubai

itself.   Coincidental?  Not related at all?  Tell me another

one.   Sir,  what  is wrong with journalists  praising  their

advertisers?   Well,  for one, deception,  or,  at  the  very

least,  breach of trust.  Journalists are supposed  to  write

investigative pieces from an unbiased angle, uninfluenced  by

monetary  inducements.  Their views  are  trusted.    Another

problem,  and I think opposition politicians think they  face

this alone, is refusal to print corrections to errors in news

stories, or printing corrections in obscure inside pages when

the  erroneous news story appears in banner headlines on  the

front page.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember once when I was CASE President, a certain

newspaper  published a series of articles laden with  errors.

Another  time, they had a sensational front page  story  that

was  based on misinterpretation of what I said, and  this  is

before liberalisation.  Both times, I asked for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



right  to reply.  Instead, the Editor negotiated with me  for

an  apology.   I  had  to  give  in.   Why?   Well,  as  CASE

President,  I  needed to be in their good  books.   They  can

lionise you, even give you credit for things you did not  do,

or they can shut you out.  As CASE President, I really needed

their support for my cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there is the question of deception and

misrepresentation  to  obtain news  stories.   Recently,  the

Straits  Times ran stories on the MPs of 1997 who are rising,

or  who are grassroots MPs.  I thank them for listing  me  as

one  of  the  five  grassroots  MPs.  But  I  agree  with  my

colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, that public speeches are no way

to  measure  our work as MPs. What I am more concerned  about

today,  however,  is  that  they  got  me  to  send  them  my

curriculum  vitae with this letter:  "Dear Sir,  we  need  to

update our database to ensure it is accurate"  and not  "Dear

Sir, we want your updated CV because we want to write a story

about  you after comparing your CV with other MPs' CVs."   If

they did that, they would not have got their story.  Who  can

I  complain to to stop what I see as the first step down  the

slippery  slope  to  yellow journalism?  There  should  be  a

neutral, independent watchdog body for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for advertising ethics, that is supposedly covered by

a   self-regulatory  scheme  called  the  Singapore  Code  of

Advertising Practice (SCAP).  That document was last  drafted

in  1976  and hopelessly out of tune with the times.   It  is

also  a  code imposed only on members.  The new media owners,

the  electronic  publishers, the print publications  and  the

broadcasters  - they are all out of reach because  they  have

not  joined as members.   Besides, the code has no teeth  and

works  as  long as the media owners cooperate.  In  1997,  as

CASE  President,  I presented a proposed  new  SCAP  for  the

industry   body,  the  Advertising  Standards  Authority   of

Singapore,   to   consider.   They   are   reportedly   still

considering.   There  is  no will to  change  and  unlike  Mr

Zulkilfi,  I have a dimmer view of media self-regulation.   I

think there should be, at the very least, co-regulation  with

the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As moral standards slide, the regulators are standing by

inert.  The  sins  are  not serious  enough  yet.   And  that

convenient cop-out:  we already have this and that and  other

committee.  In any case, in the age of converging  media,  we

can  no  longer  have different agencies governing  different

categories  of  media. This agency for print, that  authority

for broadcasting, that board for films, etc, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed time for a Media Watch Council (MWC) with

powers to impose penalties on infringements of morals, ethics

or  bad  taste,  regardless  of the  medium.   Merely  making

recommendations  for  future  change,  such   as   what   the

Publications  Advisory Committee and other advisory  councils

currently  do,  is  a  mockery.   No  one  takes  note.   The

penalties  imposed  by  the MWC can  range  from  censure  to

withdrawal  of  the  programme  or,  perhaps  funding   where

relevant,   or   cancellation   of   the   advertisement   or

modification and amendment.  The MWC should also  have  power

to  order corrections to be made with the same prominence and

in  the  same space as the original error-ridden publication,

and the power to fine those whose infractions are already too

late  to  remedy  or too serious to ignore. The  MWC  can  be

composed  of a mix of lay persons and the pillars of society,

as  is  presently the case in the various advisory committees

of  MITA.   In  this  way, we can allow  for  some  room  for

changing value systems in the society at large.  I am mindful

of  the  fact that some people say we used not to be able  to

look at ankles of ladies, now we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, without such a Council, it is every man and media

owner  for himself/itself.  It is not a pretty situation.  If

we  do not act now, we will slowly but surely acclimatise  to

the  lower  standards.  Like the frog in the  slowly  boiling

water,  we  would be dead before we even realise  we  are  in

danger. That cannot be what the silent majority wants.   That

cannot be what the Government wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to act now, as preventive

medication is always better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



and cheaper than curative medication and treatments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I will be less emotional. I

make  this  cut  to  express my concern over  the  increasing

proliferation  of  violence in our various  mass  media.  For

example,  in  a widely accessible TV programming,  Sportscity

shows  the  World Wrestling Federation (WWF) at 10.30  pm  on

Fridays,  6.00  pm on Saturdays and 5.00 pm on  Sundays,  and

these  are  all prime hours.  The recent WWF programme  shows

that  wrestling can also be a bloody experience.  A programme

that  glorifies violence has now been telecast  as  wholesome

family entertainment.  It has been reported that children  in

schools,  who are not properly supervised, try to  mimic  the

acts  of  these wrestlers.  I am not alone here.   In  recent

times,  letters that appear in the Forum Page of the  Straits

Times have also expressed the same concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the SCV cartoon channel has deteriorated to include

scenes of gratuitous violence.  One particular culprit is the

"cow and the chicken" cartoon series which is screened almost

at  all  times of the day.  I am concerned that it  does  not

just  stop there. This is but a couple of examples on society

that  is  now  flushed  with violent images  and  programmes.

Whilst  we  have been focusing on sex on the big screen,  and

R(A)  ratings  are routinely given for films and  productions

which  have a sexual content that is beyond a certain  level,

the  level  of general violence in non R(A)-rated  films  may

have  gone unnoticed.  Glorification in the press for  movies

like  Hannibal,  for example, and the print  media  focus  on

photographs,  like  what  the  earlier  speakers  have  said,

depicting violence on the front pages to catch attentions  of

readers, is also disturbing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the studies on the influence of TV and film and

cartoon  violence  in US and Japan have not been  conclusive,

there  are  parallels that can be drawn between the  horrific

violent crimes in Japan and the United States and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



ambivalence of its youth to it.  Even the subject of violence

did  not  escape  the  eyes  of the MITA  Programme  Advisory

Committee on TV and radio programmes.  In its recent  report,

it  has  highlighted  that  programmes  with  strong  violent

themes,  like  WWF, should be avoided during  family  viewing

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is timely to review our censorship

policy  on violence in general in our various media.   May  I

therefore  propose  that  MITA  initiate  a  review  of   our

censorship policy on violence with a view to minimise its bad

influence on our young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkfili Bin Baharudin: Sir, even after listening to

Prof. Toh, I am still of the view that a self-regulated press

commission  would  have  achieved the desired  objective  and

probably   would  have  censored  the  centrefold   that   he

mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to my cut on censorship, the last Review

Committee  on censorship was done in 1992.  I must  say  that

they  must  be  credited for recommending  major  changes  in

censorship,  especially  for  its  role  in  stimulating  the

mindset  changes  needed to balance the  growing  demand  for

creative  space and maintaining a morally wholesome  society.

Since  then,  much  has  changed,  especially  in  terms   of

technology  which makes it necessary and urgent  for  another

review  to  be done to address some of these dilemmas  facing

the censors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just explain a few examples. One, currently R(A)

movies  are  allowed  to  be screened in  specially  licensed

theatres outside public housing estates.  I really doubt,  in

a small country like ours, whether allowing such movies to be

screened  in  Orchard Road and not in Ang Mo  Kio,  is  still

relevant  today.   Two, there seems to be an anomaly  between

what  is considered private and public consumption.  You  can

see  R(A) movies in cinemas because it is considered private.

But  you  cannot  possess the same CDs,  even  for  your  own

personal pleasure, as it is considered public simply  because

of  the  ease of distribution.  Perhaps, we need to re-define

some of these terms and differentiate the rules regarding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



accessibility,  possession  and  distribution.   The  present

tools  appear  too blunt for what is now a more  complex  and

dynamic  phenomenon.  For example, you can view  pornographic

materials.  The policeman may be standing next to you and you

still  do  not  break the law.  But you cannot download  such

materials as it may be tantamount to distribution of  obscene

or objectionable materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ban on Cosmopolitan is still in force but many more

such sites are available on the Internet.  Therefore, for the

new  review,  we  need to come out with a different  approach

about  regulating the media.  The review is  also  urgent  to

deal  with a growing problem of pornographic Internet  sites.

For  example,  in  a  survey  conducted  by  the  School   of

Communication  Studies  in NTU and  again  discussed  at  the

Feedback Group Meeting, a large number of students were found

to  have regular access to pornographic Internet sites.  Many

Singaporeans, both young and adults, are, in fact, by-passing

regulatory framework to access pornography on-line.  A higher

proportion, some estimated to be as close as 90%, have access

to pornography through Internet sites rather than traditional

formats like magazines and video.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to find new and innovative ways to counter

an  equally innovative content provider.  There is now strong

support  on  the  need for a rating system to allow  Internet

users   to  make  their  own  choices,  like  having  content

providers  to  advise  the  public so  that  the  appropriate

choices   can   be   made.   We  need  to   balance   content

classification  about  outright  censorship  and  review  how

family access network and a filtering software can be further

developed due to its less than encouraging popularity amongst

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to find better answers to balance the

dilemma  between giving adults greater freedom of  choice  on

the one hand, and restricting access of undesirable materials

to  young  and children on the other.  We also need  to  have

more  citizen  participation  and  consider  the  role,   for

example, of the Parents Advisory Group for Internet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



(PAGI) which can be expected to take on a bigger role in  the

face of more complex changes.  This is especially so when the

survey  shows  that most parents really do not  know  how  to

supervise their children.  Citizen groups and civil societies

should also be encouraged to form censorship watch groups  to

develop,  what  Minister George Yeo  calls,  a  civic  immune

system.  Private sector players and service providers  should

also  be  made to play an active role to provide  cleaner  or

family-friendly alternatives.  Censorship will  be  an  issue

that  we  need to deal with constantly and ad-hoc or periodic

reviews may not be sufficient. Therefore, we need to find and

put  in place a system to ensure that censorship laws do  not

end up playing catch-up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, during the past

few  years,  there have been quite a number of charity  shows

over  TV  to  raise funds for the National Kidney  Foundation

(NKF)  and the National Heart Association (NHA).    When  the

audiences  see their TV artistes performing the stunts,  they

would  call  in  and  pay  $5 per call  to  contribute  their

donation.   For NKF and NHA charity shows, the   targets  for

the  amounts to be raised have become higher and higher, from

$1  million  to $2 million.  Accordingly, the  stunts  to  be

performed  by  the  TV artistes on these  charity  shows  are

becoming more and more dangerous.  Many people think that the

artistes  were  risking their lives with the  performance  of

these stunts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing charity is good but to ask artistes to risk their

lives  for higher fund-raising targets is against the  spirit

of  charity and good deeds. Artistes are not trained acrobats

from  the circus and the spectators are not watching a circus

performance.   So why are they made to watch their  favourite

TV  artistes pressing their bodies on  the spears and hanging

upside down with a heavy chain tied to their necks until they

almost  suffocate.   What happens if  something  were  to  go

wrong?  The  organisers stated that they had taken  insurance

coverage  for  these artistes.  This is  not  a  question  of

having  insurance  coverage or not.   It  is  a  question  of

conscience.  If you hang a dog upside



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



down, the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA)

will  certainly lodge a protest and complain.   Do  you  want

your  children and family members to watch all these tortures

to  their  favourite TV artistes before they are  willing  to

call  in and donate to charity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, our TV stations screened the programme called

"Super Change" from Japan. In the programme, colleagues  from

the same company or members of the same family would team  up

to  create some very creative scenes.  It is a very novel way

to  promote creativity and at the same time encourage  family

members   or  colleagues  from a company  to  work  and  play

together  as  a  team, thereby fostering better  relationship

among them.  Why do we not learn from them?  Instead, we  are

going for violence and sadism.   With the further opening  up

of the media and competition by a new TV station, I hope that

this  kind of  unhealthy programme will not appear again.   I

hope that the media can exercise some restraint and that  the

SBA  will  provide some kind of guidance.  If the TV  station

persists  in torturing the  artistes, we should boycott  them

by  not  calling  in  because it is no  longer  a  charitable

performance, but an act of violence and sadism.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, MITA granted TV

Mobile licence for buses.  Ever since the launch, there  were

many  complaints  from the public.  The Straits  Times  Forum

page  received 62 letters on TV Mobile.  Of these, only  five

or  8%  were  in  favour of this so-called  innovation.   The

Straits   Times   interactive  survey   showed   that   1,450

respondents  or 62% gave the thumbs down, while  479  or  29%

were  indifferent.  Another street poll done by Straits Times

from  Bishan  to Orchard Road also showed close results.   In

view of the animosity towards TV Mobile, will MITA re-examine

the  current  licensing policies?  Sir, my  second  question:

are  there  any plans to allow TV Mobile to be  installed  in

other forms of public transport?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, Mr Seng Han Thong said

that  television programmes are to be watched.   By  Mr  Chew

Heng  Ching's  example of WWF, Mr Seng's example  of  charity

shows  and  if  you  want  another example,  the  example  of

"Survivor",  I think we really need to look at the kind of TV

programmes  we are paying for with our licence fees,  because

"Survivor" does not teach us anything good at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We inherited from our former British rulers the idea of

a  State-run radio and TV station funded by licence fees.  In

those  days,  it  made  sense.  Radio and  TV  were  powerful

channels of communication to the masses and had to be closely

regulated and licensed to prevent chaos and disorder.  And  I

wonder perhaps maybe a bit of Second World War attitude where

radios  could  be used to communicate with the enemy.   Those

days are gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio and TV stations are private businesses now.

Licences are anachronistic in the age of the Internet.  We do

not even need radios or TVs now to listen to radio programmes

or  to  watch television narrowcasts.  The need still remains

for us to fund public service programmes and to encourage the

production of programmes with local values and content - good

values  and content also, I must add.  Because of  our  small

market,  such programmes are expensive and cannot  solely  be

funded  by  advertising.  On the other hand, if they  are  so

important  to  the national good, should they not  be  funded

entirely  from  the Government budget, just as  education  or

health care is?  I do admit that perhaps there could be  some

form  of  co-payment from users according to use, if that  is

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us call a spade a spade. We are not paying for

licences  to  own  our  radios  or  TVs.   We  are  paying  a

broadcasting tax, or perhaps a fee for use, in which case  we

should  have  a  mechanism to ensure that  bigger  use  means

bigger  fees.   And  lousy programmes do  not  get  my  fees!

Perhaps  then the SBA would not need to explain   ad  nauseam

why we still collect licence fees in this day and age.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Sir, I wish to thank Members for their comments and

suggestions.  With their support and critical feedback,  MITA

aims  to  do more and hopefully better each year, to  realize

our goal of turning Singapore into a vibrant, global city  of

the arts and media hub.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on broadcasting and media issues

raised  by  Mr Chew Heng Ching, Mr Seng Han Thong, Prof.  Toh

See  Kiat and Mr Zulkifli.  They have asked about the  impact

of  competition on the media and how we should  regulate  the

media  in this Internet age. Last June, I announced  that  we

will  issue an additional broadcasting licence to SPH  and  a

newspaper licence to MediaCorp. The liberalisation is to meet

public  desire for a greater variety of views and  programmes

as  well  as to inject some competition into our local  media

industry.  The aim is to strengthen the local media  so  that

they  are  better  able to hold the attention  of  our  local

audience  to share Singaporean viewpoints and experiences  in

the  face of increasing competition from foreign media across

all media platforms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constructive competition for the local media will

attract  much  needed  talent, augment consumer  choice,  and

improve  the quality of local content in the long  term.  Our

media  companies  will  have to be vigilant,  innovative  and

adaptable  to stay ahead of the competition.  It  is  already

evident that competition has injected new vigour to the local

newspapers.  Feedback has shown that Singaporeans welcome the

expanded  choice of newspapers and I am confident  that  each

newspaper  will find its place, with offerings  from  serious

news to entertainment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, there have been some concerns raised by

Members  and  others  on  the  need  for  standards   to   be

maintained, given the proliferation of English newspapers and

additional  TV channels following the liberalisation.  I  can

assure  Members that MITA shares this concern and is  closely

monitoring the situation.  We would like the local  media  to

maintain high journalistic standards and make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



sound editorial judgements of what constitutes good taste and

decency.  Like Prof. Toh See Kiat and Mr Chew Heng  Ching,  I

have  also observed that there is an occasional tendency  for

some newspapers to  publish pictures which cross the line for

good  taste  and intrude into the privacy of some members  of

the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two local media companies, in their drive to outdo

each  other,  should also be mindful that  biased,  one-sided

reporting  is  not  in  keeping  with  the  spirit  of   fair

competition  and  professional conduct, especially  if  third

parties are hurt in the process.  This is illustrated by  the

negative  coverage  of  the  recent  Miss  Singapore-Universe

beauty pageant. I thought the contestants did reasonably well

considering the pressure that they were under with  the  live

telecast  to  many Singaporean viewers. However, the  reports

that  came  out  blasted  them for  being  "beauties  without

brains."  This  was unfounded, ungracious and unfair  to  the

contestants.   The organisers did make some  slips  in  their

first   attempt  at  live  broadcast  of  a  beauty  pageant.

However, someone told me that the extremely negative  reports

in  several newspapers could be partly because of  the  media

competition.  I am not sure if there is any truth in that. In

any  case,  I  would  expect our media companies  to  compete

fairly  and  professionally, even if the report is  about  an

event  concerning their competitor. Our media should  compete

on the basis of better quality and not negative reporting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proliferation of alternative viewpoints in the

media, the public has to adopt a more discerning and critical

attitude towards the information they receive. Any attempt by

the  local media players to dumb-down, sensationalise or stir

up  controversial  issues  may  appeal  to  some  readers  or

audience.    However,  it  could  also  damage  the   media's

credibility  and risk consumer backlash.  On our  part,  MITA

will   encourage   our  media  to  set  high   standards   of

professionalism, accuracy and objectivity.  We  are  assisted

in  our  efforts  by  several advisory bodies,  such  as  the

Publications  Advisory Committee and the Programmes  Advisory

Committee,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



which include members from a wide cross section of society to

reflect public opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked if the role of the Publications

Advisory  Committee (PAC) will be stepped up.  The  PAC  will

continue  to  advise  MITA  on  the  content  and  trends  of

newspapers  and publications, consider complaints by  members

of   the   public,   and  review  newspaper  and   publishing

guidelines. MITA intends to tap on the PAC on a more  regular

basis.  The  PAC  will also submit an annual  report  of  its

findings  to MITA, similar to the practice of the  Programmes

Advisory Committee for the broadcasting industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat and Mr Zulkifli have also proposed

the  setting up of media self-regulating bodies,  such  as  a

Media Watch Council, to set media ethics and standards.  This

is  something   which the industry may wish to  consider  if,

despite  the  intense competition, it  is  able  to  reach  a

gentleman's  understanding to subject itself  to  public  and

competitor scrutiny.  It may not be practical yet to have  an

umbrella  body for the entire media industry as the different

components of press, broadcasting and Internet have different

characteristics  and  functions.  MITA,  on  our  part,  will

continue  to  exercise  overall responsibility,  through  the

Films   and   Publications  Department  and   the   Singapore

Broadcasting Authority, to uphold high standards of print and

broadcast content.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong has also asked if MITA has any

guidelines  to  protect  Singaporeans  from  the  undesirable

outcomes  of  foreign media competition.  Where  the  foreign

media are concerned, the rules are simple. They operate  here

as a matter of privilege and not of right. We welcome them to

come to Singapore and report on local developments, based  on

the  principle  of  accuracy, fairness and balance.  However,

they must not engage in our domestic politics, as this is the

preserve of Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Newspaper and Printing Presses Act already

establishes this policy in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



relation   to  foreign  newspapers  and  magazines.   Foreign

publications deemed to be engaging in domestic politics would

have  their  circulation restricted.   Over  the  years,  the

foreign media have come around to accept this policy and  our

right of reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA intends to extend this policy to include foreign

broadcasts in Singapore. I will soon be introducing a Bill to

amend the Singapore Broadcasting Authority Act to provide the

Minister  with the power to declare any foreign  broadcasting

service to be engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore,

and  to  limit its distribution. The Minister can then impose

conditions  on  errant  foreign  broadcasting  services.  The

system  of regulations on foreign broadcasts will be  similar

to  that  on  foreign newspapers.  Our  aim  is  not  to  ban

information   but  to  restrict  subscriber  and  advertising

revenue to an errant channel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching has suggested that we review our

censorship policy with regard to violence as portrayed in our

mass  media.   The  next  review of  censorship  policy  will

certainly  focus  on  this important issue,  amongst  others.

Concerning  violence  in TV programmes,  MITA  and  SBA  have

received  very  few  public complaints, as broadcasters  have

generally  conformed  with  the  guidelines  on  TV  violence

stipulated  by  SBA's  TV  Programming  Code.   The  Code  is

constantly   updated,  incorporating  feedback   from   SBA's

Programme Advisory Committee (PAC) and the public, to  ensure

that it meets current requirements and expectations. The  PAC

is  mindful that action movies with violent themes or  scenes

are  not  appropriate for prime-time family viewing, and  SBA

has   advised  broadcasters  to  exercise  greater  care  and

sensitivity  when  scheduling  programmes.   As  for  cartoon

violence,  no  major areas of concern have been expressed  by

the  public or SBA's Children's Programme Advisory Committee.

Nevertheless, MITA will look into the cartoon called `Cow and

Chicken'  that Mr Chew has raised. SBA currently  funds  some

1,500  hours  of local children's programmes annually.   This

should  hopefully provide some balance.  Concerning wrestling

programmes on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



Sportscity, I am aware of the different opinions expressed in

the  Forum pages on this issue.  SBA will continue to monitor

this  area  to assess if further guidelines and  actions  are

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli has spoken eloquently on the need to review

the  censorship policies.  And as he has rightly pointed out,

we  have taken a light-touch approach with regard to Internet

regulation  that  emphasises industry's  self-regulation  and

public education.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member that the situation is

not  static.  Although the last review was done in 1992, over

the  years, as technology changes and with the advent of  the

Internet,  the  Ministry  has  in  fact  moved  and  taken  a

pragmatic  approach.  For example, we have only  blacked  out

100  sites, mostly pornography sites, as a statement  of  our

values.   We  have  also  provided parents  with  alternative

access  to  what is known as the Family Access Network.   The

question is how to make this network more effective  and  how

to  introduce this network to more parents, some of whom  are

not  computer  literate or who may not be aware  of  what  is

available in the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed out what he called certain inconsistency in

our   guidelines.   This  could  be  partly  because  of  the

different  media.   It is obviously not possible  for  us  to

apply the rules of the Internet to the wider world.  Because,

with  the Internet, it is almost impossible to control.   But

out  there  in  the  cinema, on our  TV  especially,  we  are

especially careful because these are open to all and  sundry,

including  young children.  That is why we have  a  graduated

approach  for  different categories of media, with  the  most

severe  being  for TV shows.  That is why although  we  allow

R(A)  films to be shown in the cinemas, we do not allow  R(A)

VCDs  in  the homes.  The thinking is that the VCDs could  be

viewed  by children.  So that points out really to  the  need

for  self-regulation, for parents to have a  greater  say  in

what  their children do and to decide for themselves what  is

appropriate for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



themselves.  But anyway this is something that will  have  to

be  all looked into in the context of a future review of  the

censorship policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong raised a query with regard to the

safety  of  MediaCorp artistes performing in  charity  shows,

that efforts to attract audiences are not made at the expense

of  safety.  I share the Member's apprehension.  I was  quite

concerned  last year when I saw a cyclist perform  an  aerial

jump  over  some local artistes lying on the stage.   If  any

unforeseen accident had happened then, we would not  be  able

to  see  some of our brightest stars on Caldecott Hill today.

I  asked  my staff to check with MediaCorp whether  this  was

necessary.  They were told that the safety of the actors  and

actresses  is a primary consideration.  Whenever  stunts  are

performed, maximum precautions are employed, and professional

trainers are on hand to help the artistes execute the  stunts

comfortably and confidently.  It does not make sense to  have

the  artistes hurt as this would harm MediaCorp's  reputation

and  production efforts.  Nonetheless, I have asked MediaCorp

to  be  extremely careful in deciding whether certain  stunts

are really necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Prof. Toh See Kiat's query on PSB

funding  and  licence  fees.  This has also  been  raised  by

several  persistent writers in the Forum pages.  Let  me  say

that  almost all the funds collected go to paying for  Public

Service   Broadcast  programmes.   These   pertain   to   the

production  of  current affairs, local  drama,  and  minority

language  TV  and  radio shows which reflect our  Singaporean

values  and way of life as well as local sports and  selected

arts  programmes. Such local programmes may  cost  up  to  30

times  more  than  canned entertainment  programmes  acquired

overseas and cannot be funded by advertisements alone.  For a

multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-cultural  society  like

Singapore, PSB programmes are a crucial element of our nation-building efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB programmes can either be funded through the

collection   of  radio  and  TV  licence  fees,  or   through

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



taxes.   We  have opted to collect radio and TV licence  fees

because it is still the best way to fund PSB programmes.  The

fee  is  not  used to fund local entertainment programmes  as

these  usually attract larger audiences.  Compared  to  other

countries such as the UK which also collect TV licence  fees,

the  licence  fees in Singapore are relatively low  and  have

remained unchanged since 1994 at $110 per annum for a  colour

TV  licence, or less than $10 per month, and $27  for  a  car

radio  licence.   They are also low compared to  the  monthly

fees for cable TV, which is something like $35 per month  for

a  basic  package.  In fact, most HDB residents who have  not

subscribed  to  cable TV have been enjoying  much  better  TV

reception through cable without having to pay a cent more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin raised the issue of TV Mobile on buses and

whether we should review the granting of such licences.   Let

me  say  that  TV  Mobile is part of the move  to  eventually

introduce  Digital  TV  services to  Singaporean  households.

Traditional  broadcasting services are giving way  to  better

quality,   interactive   and   mobile   forms   of    digital

entertainment   and   information  in  developed   countries.

Already,  the US and Europe have launched full scale  Digital

TV  services  and  are building up their digital  programming

capabilities with interactive services like email access  via

TV.   Last month's launch of TV Mobile in Singapore, a  first

in  the world, was done after a two-year feasibility study by

MediaCorp, Singapore Bus Services, and SMRT, and a  one-month

public   trial   in  1999  which  received  positive   public

responses.    MediaCorp   is  also  currently   field-testing

terrestrial  digital television broadcasting  with  some  200

homes  in preparation for a commercial DTV service launch  in

the near future.  DTV allows numerous new and better services

to  be  introduced,  as  well  as higher  quality  broadcasts

including High Definition TV.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of new services often involves change

in  consumer behaviour.  Given time, the benefits will become

evident.  We are living in exciting times;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



some  projects will thrive and others will fail, but we  must

keep  up  with  the  changes  and  make  them  work  for  us.

MediaCorp  has already taken action to resolve  the  teething

problems  encountered with TV Mobile.   They  are  installing

additional  transmitters  to  improve  reception   and   also

lowering the sound levels in buses.  MediaCorp will  also  be

looking  into other suggestions by the public to  improve  TV

Mobile.  It is in MCS' interest to win over the public to the

value and benefits of TV Mobile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho also asked whether there are plans to introduce

this  scheme to other modes of transport.  The answer is yes.

If  it  works well, it will be extended to the MRT and taxis.

But,  of  course,  we  have  to first  overcome  some  public

resistance  in the area of buses.  Perhaps one way  could  be

for  the bus commuters to buy a very simple radio set,  which

may  cost no more than $10 with earphones, which can be tuned

to  channel 89.3, and they will be able to receive the  voice

over the TV.  In that situation, we will be able to lower the

volume of the TV set.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with issues raised by various Members

regarding  the  arts scene.  The development  of  Singaporean

arts  and  artists  lies at the core of our Renaissance  City

vision and the bulk of funding has gone into major grants for

top  arts  organisations.  The new two-year and annual  grant

schemes  are  aimed at advancing the professional development

of  our  local  arts  companies.   With  more  support,  arts

companies  will  be  able to improve  the  quality  of  their

productions.  To date, four companies have received the  two-year  grant and 13 companies the annual grant.  I  think  the

total  sum  involved for all these 17 companies is  something

like   $3.8  million.   Because  of  the  additional  funding

available  from this new Renaissance City scheme,  the  funds

that  would  otherwise have gone into these 17 companies  can

now  be  made available to other companies.  Hopefully,  many

more small arts companies would be able to benefit.  Many, in

fact,  are  working  with PA in the CCs and  elsewhere.   NAC

itself has to be selective because we have to really groom up

the best and not just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



support all and sundry who want to dabble in the arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More funds have also been expended on arts training.

NAC  has  set  up  new  schemes for  skills  development  and

professional  arts  scholarships.   We  recognise  that  arts

practitioners,  arts  managers and production  personnel  are

crucial   to  the  production  process  of  the  arts.    The

Professional   Skills  Development   fund   is   to   provide

opportunities for them to upgrade their skills through short-term  training courses locally or abroad.  NAC's Professional

Scholarship  Scheme  has  been set up  to  provide  financial

assistance  to arts managers and practitioners  who  wish  to

pursue   full-time  undergraduate  or  postgraduate   studies

overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also intensifying efforts to give international

exposure  to  our top artists.  Examples of arts groups  that

have  performed  overseas  include  the  T'ang  Quartet,  the

Singapore  Chinese  Orchestra,  TheatreWorks,  and  Singapore

Dance  Theatre.  Singapore will also be participating in  the

prestigious Venice Biennale this June. The Biennale  features

top  and  emerging visual artists like painters and sculptors

from around the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major arts events will be improved upon qualitatively

and  quantitatively.   The SPH-NAC Golden  Point  award,  for

example,  will  include a poetry section for the  first  time

this  year,  while the National Piano and Violin  Competition

has   plans  to  go  regional  in  the  near  future.   Other

activities that will contribute to the vibrancy of  the  arts

scene  include Nokia Singapore Art and the Singapore  Writers

Festival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also intensified arts outreach to the masses by

bringing the arts to the community in the heartlands.  One of

the   activities  targeted  at  the  HDB  heartland  was  the

Community  Arts Day last October, which was jointly organised

by  NAC and Sembawang-Hong Kah CDC.  Another is the NAC-Shell

Community  Arts  series  of outdoor concerts,  held  at  town

centres,  such  as  Clementi, Hougang and Yishun.   NAC  also

actively  collaborates with the private sector to  bring  the

arts to the working population.  NAC joins hands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



with  Raffles  City to bring Arts in the City,  a  series  of

regular  lunchtime concerts at the Raffles City  Atrium,  now

into its third year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also expanded our arts education programme to

more schools and students.  Currently we cover 86% of schools

and  more than 50% of the student population. The AEP,  which

aims  to  bring  the arts to every student through  exposure,

experience   and  excursion  programmes,  was   extended   to

Institutes  of  Technical Education for the first  time  last

year.   NAC  hopes the AEP will reach out to all  schools  by

2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the National Heritage Board (NHB) works

closely  with  Ministry of Education to promote awareness  of

our multi-ethnic heritage among the younger generation. NHB's

outreach   activities   include  the  Community   Involvement

Programme  for  schools,  the Heritage  Badge  for  uniformed

groups, travelling exhibitions, educational workshops, talks,

cultural  performances  and other activities.   NHB  will  be

holding  the  inaugural Heritage Festival  this  month.   The

activities  of the week-long festival, such as  talks,  music

and  dance  performances  and demonstrations  of  traditional

games, will take place in various parts of the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still at an early stage of our cultural

development.  In terms of the number of arts events,  artists

and  audiences, we are behind cities like Melbourne and  Hong

Kong,  let alone London and New York.  The Renaissance  funds

increased  per capita annual arts expenditure from  about  $7

(before  the  report) to $9 last year.  This is still  modest

compared to the cultural capitals of the world.  For example,

London's  per capita spending is S$108, 12 times higher  than

ours  while Hong Kong's is nearly four times higher at  S$33.

Nevertheless,  our  modest increase of 30%  last  year  is  a

relatively big step for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Jennifer Lee for her support of

the  arts and for her comments on the NAC.  I think  the  NAC

has  been doing a good job and it is true to some extent that

it is difficult for NAC



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



to  juggle both the roles of promoter as well as a funder and

regulator.   This is why for plays like Talaq,  it  has  been

necessary  for  PELU,  which is under the  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs,  to  take  the  final  decision,  based  on  various

considerations,  including the views of MUIS  concerning  the

religious  sensitivity of the play.   The  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs  has  suggested that this function be transferred  to

MITA.    This   is  something  that  we  are   now   actively

considering.   If  it does come to MITA,  then  I  think  the

licensing and approval functions will go under our Films  and

Publications  Department  and NAC  will  concentrate  on  the

promotion of the arts.



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure all Members that in approving the

staging  of  plays  and  funding for the  arts,  we  exercise

sensitivity  and flexibility so that local and  international

works   with   artistic  merit,  even  some   difficult   and

provocative ones, could be encouraged in Singapore.   But  at

the  same  time, we acknowledge that public funding  for  the

arts  should  be  prudent so as not to project  wrong  social

values and to cause societal conflict.  For example, NAC  did

not  fund the musical Rent as it presented homosexuality  and

alternative lifestyles as an accepted way of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that MITA has clear guidelines

and  criteria  for  the  support of  art  productions.   They

include  artistic  merits and track  records  of  applicants.

However,  for private sponsorship of the arts, we would  like

to leave it to the respective corporations to decide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I move on to the next cut. In

raising this cut, I would just like to ask the Minister if he

will update the House on the construction of the new National

Library  building,  next  to  the  Bras  Basah  Complex.   In

particular,  he may like to tell us why the National  Library

Board  has recently decided to pursue a develop-and-construct

approach to the project as distinct from the design-and-build

contract arrangement which was earlier envisaged.   Will this

new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



approach  result  in  financial savings for  the  Government?

Will  the completion of the new National Library building  be

further delayed?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, some years ago, the NLB

and the PCF collaborated on a very praiseworthy initiative to

start  community children's libraries (CCLs).  And currently,

the  CCLs  are doing a good job, promoting reading among  the

very young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the new economy where we want to have a good

quality workforce, reading skills will be very important  for

self-learning in this lifelong learning process.  So  indeed,

it  was  a surprise to me to find out that there is  no  line

item  in  the  budget  for MITA, specifically  for  community

children's  libraries.  As I understand it, it  is  run  from

savings  made in other parts of the NLB budget  and  while  I

must  praise the executives, like Dr Christopher Chia in NLB,

I  think it is not right for incidental scraps from the other

pieces  of  the budget  to be given to CCLs which is  a  very

important initiative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the CCLs, as I understand it, are operating on a

deficit  and  even  those  who want to  introduce  innovative

financing schemes, such as conducting fee-based courses,  are

not  allowed  to  do  so  in case they  run  afoul  of  their

charitable  status.   I would like to urge  the  Minister  to

consider more specific funding for CCL because this would  be

needed to train librarians at their local levels so that  the

level of professionalism would be high and they will be  able

to institute innovative programmes for the young.  This would

also  mean  more  books,  magazines, comics,  CDs  and  other

resources  that  would teach children to be literate  and  to

love  books,  and,  of course, finally, for  the  operational

costs of the CCLs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> First of all, let me congratulate the

National  Library  Board  for  doing  an  excellent  job   in

developing  the new libraries, particularly, at the  regional

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the topic of CCLs. Sir, the Prime

Minister,  in opening the first Community Children's  Library

in Marine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



Parade,  called  for the creation of 100 CCLs  in  Singapore.

Since  then,  many  CCLs  have been  developed  in  many  HDB

estates.   However,  with  the  creation  of  these  regional

libraries,  there appears to be a tussle for the same  target

users of children below the age of 12 years group.  The  only

difference  in the two types of libraries is that  membership

at  the  NLB libraries is free, while at the CCLs,  they  are

charged  $24  per  year.   In view of  the  location  of  the

regional  libraries, there are books catering also  to  adult

family  members and an equally good collection of  children's

books.  They actually end up competing with CCLs for the same

age  group child users.  In the light of this competition and

the  fact  that CCLs are heavily subsidised by the local  PCF

committee,  I  would  like to ask the Minister  whether  MITA

intends to fully develop all 100 CCLs as originally envisaged

or whether there will be a rethink on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang :</b> Sir, can I take the two cuts

together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, recently, there

was  a very popular Chinese movie whose title in English  was

Crouching  Tiger and Hidden Dragon.    I did  not  understand

the  meaning  of it. Subsequently, I learnt that the  Chinese

title to this movie was   Wo hu cang long.  The English title

appears to be a literal translation of the Chinese title and,

as it appears, it makes no sense at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of weeks ago, I came across a bilingual booklet

published by the Speak Mandarin Campaign Committee.   On  one

of the pages, I saw a name which sounded somewhat familiar  - Wu Jun Gang.  I did not know who it was referring to.  It was

only when I read the Chinese section that I realised that  it

was  referring to me, but my name "Goh Choon Kang" was  spelt

as  "Wu  Jun Gang".  I do not know who translated it,  but  I

guess it must have been translated by a Chinese national  who

does not know the who's who in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these two examples, we can see that very often,

people  do  not  pay much attention to the translation  work.

The  talents  in  the  field  of translation  are  often  not

accorded  the recognition and respect they deserve. Probably,

this  is due to a lack of awareness of the importance of  the

translators or interpreters among our people.  Perhaps,  they

are   misled   by   preconceived   ideas   that,   with   the

implementation  of  bilingualism  in  our  education  system,

everybody  knows two languages and therefore there is no need

for translation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we were made a laughing stock. The Chinese

version  of  our  publicity booklet "Contact  Singapore"  was

distributed in China.  In this booklet, the Prime Minister of

Singapore  was  wrongly translated as Shou Xiang  instead  of

Zong Li.  The language used in this booklet was also full  of

mistakes.   A reader of Lianhe Zaobao wrote to the  newspaper

and  described it as unbearable.  Many Singaporeans feel that

this  is indeed a disgrace to Singapore. Actually, we do  not

lack talents in this field, but the trouble is they have  not

been accorded the due stature and respect they deserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of Prime Minister can be expressed in Chinese

in   two  distinct  ways.   Generally,  "Prime  Minister"  is

translated  as  Zong Li.  It is only in countries  where  the

monarchy  system is practised, eg, Japan, the United Kingdom,

Thailand, that the Prime Minister is known as Shou  Xiang  in

Chinese. If we were to address our   Prime Minister  as  Shou

Xiang, then our President will become a King.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue may appear to have no relevance to MITA.

But,  had  the  translation of this  publicity  booklet  been

vetted  by  the Translation Section of MITA, such unnecessary

mistakes  could have been avoided, and we can be  spared  the

agony of being disgraced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my understanding, there are only four translators in

the  Chinese  Translation  Section  in  MITA  today.  If  all

translation works required by the various ministries  are  to

be undertaken by this small section of translators, then they

would not be able to cope.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we are going regional and global, I think we

should  also recognise the importance of translation experts.

We  must give them the proper remuneration and promptly groom

up  their  successors.  Right now, it is  very  difficult  to

recruit   good   translators  and  interpreters.    Even   in

Parliament  itself, there is great difficulty  in  recruiting

good   part-time  interpreters.   I  observe   that   veteran

interpreter like  Mr Lee Seng Giap has been helping out  here

for  a  very   long time, and he has still  to come  here  to

assist our resident interpreter even today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Government seriously

consider the setting up of a Central Translation Bureau,  and

recruit  some  first-class translators  to  provide  all  the

official translations of the Government, like the way  it  is

done  in  Hong  Kong,  so as to avoid the  kind  of  mistakes

committed in the "Contact Singapore" pamphlet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attractive remuneration package must be offered to

attract   some  first-class  translators  to  translate   the

official  documents and publications of the Government  which

will  be  authoritative and to support the  public  relations

officers  of  the  various Government  Ministries.   This  is

necessary  also because it is very difficult to get bilingual

people  to be our Public Relations Officer.  By so doing,  we

will be able to establish translation and interpretation as a

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to raise another related issue, that

is,    the   setting  up  of  a  committee  on   standardised

translation  of  names  and terms.  Right  now,  we  have  an

informal   kind  of  committee  in  charge  of   standardised

translation  of names and terms.  The members come  from  the

Chinese media and representatives from MITA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been the Chairman of this committee for the past

three years.  I feel that the kind of work undertaken by this

committee is very important, albeit very few people  know  of

its existence. The important main task of this committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



is  to  come out with a standardised translation of all   new

terms  so  that  all Chinese media, TV stations,  newspapers,

etc,  could adopt.  This committee has published a number  of

booklets,   like  the  booklet  on  the  standardisation   of

translation  of Government departments, IT terminologies  and

economic  terminologies,  etc.  These  are  all  very  useful

publications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because this committee is informal,

organisationally  it is a bit loose and it  lacks  authority.

If  we  can  officially establish a committee on standardised

translation of names and terms, and secure an expert in  this

field to head the committee, then the committee will be  more

authoritative and more effective.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, the Singapore Film Commission has

been  formed  to promote the film industry in Singapore.   It

was the right decision that has helped fund many budding film

producers  locally.  Sir, I would like to know what  progress

has  been  made  so far.  How much has been  spent  and  what

achievements  have  been  made?   What  are   some   of   the

fundamental  issues confronting the film  industry  and  what

measures  would be taken to overcome them?  I would  like  to

suggest  to the Singapore Film Commission to widen its  scope

of work to include the nurture  and training of local talents

for  both  the  front  end and back end production  of  local

movies.  When bringing in instructors and course leaders,  we

should widen the scope to include also professionals from the

East - from Hong Kong, from China and Japan - where there are

many well-known producers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Film Commission should also help in

building   up  the  supporting  industry,  such  as  dubbing,

animation  and  post-production houses.  Sir,  the  Singapore

Film Commission could work closely with the Singapore Tourism

Board  to  promote  Singapore as a good location  for  making

movies.   Promoting Singapore as an international  production

centre,  we encourage the use of Singapore location,  service

facilities   and  personnel.   We  could  provide   financial

incentives for foreign film makers to come to Singapore.  For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



example, the Yukon Film Commission in Canada offers a  travel

rebate  to  assist  production companies  in  the  course  of

getting there.  And the Yukon labour rebate will be given  up

to  35%  of  wages paid for eligible Yukon labour working  on

foreign  productions.  Bringing foreign production houses  to

Singapore  will produce many good job and career  development

opportunities  for  local talents.  It  will  allow  a  local

talent  to  work  with international big budget  movies  with

opportunities for international exposure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, shall I move on to the next one?



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will let Mr David Lim reply first.



<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Minister of State for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Information and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Thank you very much, Sir. I shall try to

be brief, in view of the fact that time is running on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take the cuts first on the questions on the

National Library and the Community Children's Library  (CCL).

But  before I do so, I would just want to make a point  about

public education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a speech on Monday, when this House debated the

Minister  for  Finance's Budget Statement, Mrs Lim  Hwee  Hua

spoke   of   the  psychological  divide  between  those   who

understand and accept change, and those who do not.  I  think

that  this  is  an  important idea that we should  give  some

attention  to.  What challenges and divides us are  not  just

the  things we have or do not have, but the understanding and

rapport we have or do not have with each other.  Her plea was

that  the  Government  should do more to  close  this  divide

through public education and, specifically, that more  should

be  done  to explain Government policy.  I agree, but  public

education is a broad concept that applies also to raising the

general level of awareness and knowledge, not just of  public

policies or technical subjects, but also of the arts  and  of

general knowledge.  In our society, where we will become more

diverse  in interests and viewpoints, a broader knowledge  of

the  world  around us will give people more common points  to

relate to each other.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that our libraries contribute

significantly to this broad goal.  I thank the  speakers  who

have  acknowledged the accomplishments of our Library  Board.

They  have  achieved  a revolutionary breakthrough  in  their

mission  to enhance interest and capacity for learning  among

Singaporeans.  They have tried out innovative ideas like  the

Library@Orchard, and the use of radio frequency technology to

facilitate the loan and return of books.  By sheer hard work,

I  think  they  have  achieved  international  attention  and

recognition, and I am glad to say that Singaporeans can  look

forward to a new National Library building in the year 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to Mr Chew's specific question about the NLB

building.   The  NLB  tender for the  new  NLB  building  was

originally intended to be awarded as a design contract and  a

separate  construction  contract.  The  design  contract  was

awarded  to  a consortium led by Swan & MacLaren  Architects.

As   the   project  progressed,  however,  the   NLB   became

dissatisfied  with  the consortium, as they  were  unable  to

assign adequate resources to the project and the project  had

begun  to slip behind schedule.  However, the consortium  had

already completed the architectural schematic design for  the

new building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, NLB then decided to complete the project under a

develop-and-construct arrangement, in order to avoid  further

delays   and   slippage  to  the  project   schedule.    This

arrangement is a variation of the design-and-build  approach.

Under  design-and-build,  the  contractor  undertakes  design

responsibility,   in   addition  to  the   construction   and

completion of the building.  In this instance, however, there

was  no  need  for  a  re-design of the building,  since  the

schematic  design had already been done.  For NLB's  develop-and-construct  approach,  a  main contractor  will  undertake

detailed   design,  based  on  the  completed   architectural

schematic  design,  and construct the building.   This  saves

time and costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under this approach, the NLB maintains

control over design



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



integrity,   through   the  schematic   design,   while   the

contractor,  being responsible for detailed design,  will  be

able   to  enhance  the  construction  buildability,   design

efficiency,   and   construction   methodology    to    boost

productivity  and  also, thereby, to  reclaim  whatever  cost

savings that may be possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such arrangements are in line with the Building and

Construction Authority's Construction 21 strategy to  upgrade

the professionalism of the construction industry.  NLB called

the tender on 19th January this year, and expects the new NLB

building to be completed in 2004.  Since the tender  has  not

yet  been  awarded I cannot give you specific cost  data  and

whether or not there will be savings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of libraries, let me now turn to CCLs.

NLB has a special commitment to our young readers, and we  do

believe  in  inculcating the reading habit from a young  age.

And,  because  of  this,  we have set up  special  children's

sections  in  both  regional and community libraries,  as  Mr

Ravindran  has pointed out.  But Mr Ravindran  and  Prof  Toh

have  raised quite different points of view.  Prof Toh thinks

we  should  put  more  money in;  Mr Ravindran  thinks  that,

perhaps,  some  CCLs  should  not  be  built  because   these

facilities  are  duplicated  in the  regional  and  community

libraries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is not just one of money. CCLs are intended

as complementary facilities, but, when we locate them in void

decks,  we brought the library closer to the homes  of  young

children.   In  doing so, however, we limited  the  range  of

books  and facilities that we can offer, and that is  because

they  now serve a much smaller catchment, so you cannot  have

them  on  a  same scale.  Some parents, therefore, prefer  to

bring  their children to the community libraries and regional

libraries   because  of  the  wider  variety  of  books   and

facilities, and also because it is free.  Others  prefer  the

convenience  of  having a library near their homes,  so  they

take them to the CCLs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So CCLs can only work well if we have the support of the

community  where they are located.  If there  are  sufficient

numbers of parents in the locality who want this facility and

a  critical  mass can be formed, then there  will  be  enough

scale  to make a success of the project.  But CCLs that  lack

community will not succeed even with more Government funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to Dr Ho's query on the film industry in

Singapore.  Dr Ho will be happy to know that, over  the  last

three years, from 1998 to 2000, Singapore produced 17 feature

films, or an average of about six films a year.  One, "Eating

Air", has been shown at the Deauville Asian Film Festival  in

France just recently.  Another five are in production or have

been  completed, and should be released this year.  The  Film

Commission  has also given out six letters of intent  so  far

for  feature film investment.  One film, "Chicken Rice  War",

which  you  may have caught, has been released.   One  is  in

production, three are looking for top-up funds, and the  last

one  withdrew  because  it already  has  enough  funds.   But

compared  with  the  early 1960s, the  heydays  of  our  film

industry, we are still some way behind.  Then, we produced 18

films a year; now, we are only doing about six.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give a boost to this industry, the Commission takes a

more  generous  approach when it comes to giving  grants  for

short  films, because it is on short films that  film  makers

cut  their teeth.  Last year, it awarded grants for 35  short

films,  bringing  the overall total to 66 grants  made  since

1988.   The  Commission also believes in  the  importance  of

nurturing  local  talent.  To this end, it  has  awarded  two

overseas scholarships and 11 bursaries, and has invited eight

well-known  film  makers  and  experts  to  conduct   special

seminars,  master  classes  and  scriptwriting  workshops  in

Singapore.  I agree with Dr Ho's suggestion that getting film

makers  to  produce their movies in Singapore  will  generate

spin-offs  for  the economy in general, and  the  local  film

industry  in  particular, and MITA will  encourage  the  Film

Commission  to  continue their work with EDB, STB  and  other

industry experts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



to make Singapore a regional hub for film production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to Mr Goh's comments on the need for a

Central  Translation Bureau and standards of  translation  in

Singapore.   I  agree with Mr Goh concerning his observations

that  we need to do more to raise the standards.  Mr Goh  has

pointed  out  the  difficulty  of  hiring  highly  proficient

translators  in the civil service, and this is  a  need  that

needs to be seriously addressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh has proposed that we set up a Central Translation

Bureau.  This may not solve the problem.  The translation and

interpretation services in the Government were  decentralised

in   1981   and  reviewed  in  1985.   We  felt   that   this

decentralised  arrangement  is  better,  as  translators  and

interpreters  need to be aware of the relevant  policies  and

the  use  of  correct terms.  So placing them  out  with  the

different Ministries and Organs of State is better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this arrangement, MITA's Translation Service

Section  focuses its resource only on its core responsibility

of  providing translation services to Government leaders, and

translating MITA materials meant for public consumption.  But

I  agree  with Mr Goh that we should upgrade our professional

translation standards, and MITA will raise this with PSD  and

work with it to see how the scheme of service for translators

and interpreters can be made more attractive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh has also suggested that MITA standardise the

translation of certain terms, especially the names of  titles

and   programmes  in  the  Government.   I  agree  with   his

suggestion,  and  MITA will consider Mr Goh's  suggestion  to

formalise   and   appoint   a   Translation   Standardisation

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, transparency and

accountability are principles by which democratic governments

are  governed  by these days.  The change in the  culture  of

governance has, in part, been motivated by a desire,  as  far

as  possible, and without compromising on national  security,

to  free up information to the people so as to allow them  to

make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



informed choices.  Not only that, it also serves as  a  check

against  the excesses of government.  Increasingly, there  is

much expectation by the people for the government to free  up

as  much  information as possible.  Knowledge is, of  course,

power.  It will be difficult to fully justify our position as

a   knowledge-based  economy  if  there  are  many  plugs  to

information flows.  Besides, there is always this deep-seated

suspicion,  if  government and public affairs are  constantly

shrouded in secrecy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many western countries, freedom of information

legislation is becoming increasingly a necessary part of  the

statutory  landscape.   In the US, for  instance,  it  has  a

Freedom of Information Act that enables its citizens to  gain

access   to  records  kept  by  government  departments   and

agencies.  In the UK, the government periodically reviews and

declassifies information for release to the public.  It  goes

without  saying  that the fact that many of  these  documents

will one day be public documents, does have a salutary effect

on civil servants and politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, broadly, there are two facets to the issue of

freedom  of  information.  First, there is  a  right  of  the

individual  to  information amassed on him by  others.   Very

often,  decisions are made based on information  provided  by

others.  For those who are affected by adverse decisions,  it

would  be unfortunate indeed if they are not given a clue  as

to,  or  the  opportunity to know, the basis on  which  these

decisions  are made.  I can, for instance, think of appraisal

records,   or   the  reason  behind  certain   administrative

decisions.   At the very least, if such information  is  made

available  to  the  person, there is an opportunity  to  have

these  records corrected, if they were erroneous.   Secondly,

freedom  of  information  envisages the  regular  reviews  of

public  documents and information for release to the  public,

if possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In undertaking this exercise, besides the issue of

transparency and accountability, it will also have the effect

of educating our people on the circumstances surrounding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



certain  events  and why certain decisions  or  policies  are

taken.  This will help our posterity in avoiding some of  the

errors perhaps that were committed earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the above reasons, I would therefore, urge the

Minister to consider looking into the possibility of enacting

a Freedom of Information Act.



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Sir, in

reply  to  Mr  Sin  Boon  Ann's  query  on  the  freedom   of

information,  MITA recognises that the National  Archives  of

Singapore  is  a  rich  repository  of  historical  data  and

pictures  that are invaluable to researchers and  historians.

In  Singapore, the majority of public records transferred  to

the   National   Archives   are   systematically   appraised,

declassified  and released in consultation with the  relevant

Ministries.  As stipulated in the National Heritage Board Act

in  1993 and in line with international practice, most of the

materials  in  the  archives are made  available  for  public

consultation  after a 25-year period.  Records which  contain

sensitive information may have a longer embargo period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin cited the situation in other countries - the US,

Canada  and UK.  I would like to point out that although  the

US  and  Canada  each has a Freedom of Information  Act,  the

release of information is still subject to certain disclosure

conditions.  For example, the disclosure of records must  not

be  injurious to the conduct of the Government, threaten  the

safety of individuals or nation, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, on behalf of Members who

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to ask the Minister, in the light

of  the  increase in sexual crimes on girls due  to  Internet

use,  what is the Government doing to make the Internet  safe

and  what  funds  are given to PAG(i), the  Parents  Advisory

Group  for  Internet  to  raise  awareness  of  parents   and

children.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, Prof. Toh See Kiat has

expressed concern  about whether current laws are adequate to

protect unsuspecting people, especially children surfing  the

Internet.   Sir, Internet has always remained as a medium  to

exchange views freely and anonymously.  It will remain so for

a   long  time.   In  our  view,  instead  of  resorting   to

legislation,  it will be more meaningful to emphasise  common

sense  and  public  awareness on  the  dangers  of  Internet.

Public  education,  for example, through  PAG(i)  is  another

effort  that  we could mention.  It is one of the  approaches

that  could  help to achieve this objective.  However,  those

who  misuse  the  Internet anonymity to  engage  in  criminal

activities, such as molest or rape, as have been reported  on

a  number of occasions in our newspapers, would be dealt with

severely according to our law in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3). Mr Ravindran.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code RG 3100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I must commend the Media Corporation

of Singapore (MCS) on the improvements made in the quality



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



of  television  programmes.  I would like to  highlight  some

good  and negative points of the various channels run by MCS.

Let me first start off with Channel NewsAsia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that Channel NewsAsia has

distinguished  itself as an Asian television station  with  a

deep  understanding of Asian affairs.  Their current  affairs

programmes have intellectual depth, and they have always  got

the  best  in  the  different fields  to  comment  on  issues

affecting  the  region.  In doing so, they  have  managed  to

capture  a  good  segment  of  the  political,  business  and

academic  audience.  I congratulate them on  their  excellent

work and I hope that they will make this Channel a station to

be watched by everyone with a keen interest in Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must ask MCS to look at two important issues.

The  first is the inadequate reach of Channel NewsAsia in the

neighbouring  countries.  There is no provision  for  Channel

NewsAsia  in many of the leading hotels in the region  and  I

hope  that  MCS will work harder to sell Channel NewsAsia  in

the  region.  The second is the parallel broadcast of Channel

NewsAsia programmes in the morning from 6.30 to 9.30 on  both

Channel 5 and Channel NewsAsia.  I think this is a pure waste

of  time and I hope that the Ministry can look into how  best

the  broadcast  time-slots can be better used  on  Channel  5

during this time period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to Channel 5. The issue of having multi-ethnic casts in local dramas is a matter of concern to many

Singaporeans.  It is no use for the Prime Minister and  other

leaders to talk about multi-racialism and integration if  the

broadcast  media, which is a macrocosm of Singapore  society,

does  not  reflect the same in its programmes.  We must  show

Singaporeans and the world which watch our programmes that we

are  indeed  a  multi-racial society and our programmes  must

reflect  this.   We  do  not want the  world  to  think  that

Singapore is a Chinese, Malay or an Indian society, depending

on  what  language is used in the Singapore  drama.   I  have

given up hope that MCS has understood the numerous calls from

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



public  to  re-assess the way it portrays Singapore  society,

especially  one  that involves Singapore society  and  multi-ethnic  Singapore.    The new dramas fail  to  truly  reflect

Singapore  society.  This could be due to the fact that  both

Channels  5  and  8 are under the same corporate  management,

while  Suria  and  Vasantham Central are  under  a  different

corporate  management.   We have to  carefully  look  to  see

whether  the  MCS management, producers and scriptwriters  of

local programmes really understand Singapore society, whether

they  do  mingle and have friends from various ethnic groups,

and if they do not, whether there is a need for a process  of

orientating  these  key individuals on what  makes  Singapore

unique  and their important role in reflecting this  tapestry

of Singapore society in their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the day where many more television

productions,  which  are truly local  and  multi-racial,  are

produced and which reflect Singapore society as they are.   I

hope  the  new station under MediaWorks will not  follow  the

ingrained footprints of MCS, but is creative and bold  enough

to  reflect  the real Singapore society in their  dramas  and

other  programmes. If the broadcast media does not understand

this  important role and do something about it, then  we  can

continue to talk about multi-racialism and integration  until

the  cows  come  home, literally, the task of preserving  and

promoting  multi-racialism would certainly become  an  uphill

one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to Vasantham Central and be brief here.

First of all, I must say that programmes on Vasantham Central

have  improved  very drastically.  Last year,  I  highlighted

that  there  was  a need to reconsider whether  Hindi  movies

could be moved to Suria.  Indeed, what I notice is that Suria

now  has  Hindi  movies,  but in addition  to  the  slots  on

Vasantham Central.  My first question is:  is there a need to

broadcast  Hindi  movies on both Suria and Vasantham  Central

when the idea was to free up Vasantham Central for more Tamil

educational programmes?  The second query that I have is,  in

the  light  of  comments made on Hindi  movies  in  Malaysia,

whether there have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



similar comments on Hindi movies in Singapore and whether the

Ministry is looking into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, in respect of local sporting programmes, I would

like  to urge MCS to see whether we can increase funding  for

local   sports  broadcasts,  particularly  live  events   and

especially school competitions.  Those are my comments, and I

hope that the Minister can look into them.



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Mr Ravindran raised four questions

in  relation to our television programming, Channel NewsAsia,

Channel 5, Vasantham Central and Sportscity.  I would like to

say  that  he has been following the developments in  Channel

NewsAsia and we are happy to learn that he is now saying that

it  is  making  good  progress.  Of course,  I  realise  that

Channel  NewsAsia  is moving to expand its  coverage  in  the

region, and it is doing it stage by stage.  I understand that

CNA  has been sending its people to India, Nepal and Thailand

and  that this is the kind of marketing which requires  time.

I  believe  the  time will come when the  Member  visits  New

Delhi, he will see Channel NewsAsia being shown there.  We do

hope that when he is in Cambodia, he will be able to see news

reporting by Channel NewsAsia.  I think it has been done  now

but it takes some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the need to have multi-ethnicity projected through

our television media, I think this is a critical question.  I

do  agree that it is important for our media, especially  the

local  media,  to  project the kind of  multi-ethnicity  that

Singapore possesses, its richness and the way multi-ethnicity

in  Singapore develops and works.  But we must recognise that

there  is  a  limit.  For example, if you  have  a  drama  on

classical Chinese stories, shot somewhere in Beijing,  it  is

impossible to have Indian or Malay characters be placed  into

that  kind of story.  But on local modern dramas produced  in

Singapore,  I think it is crucial for the Channel to  reflect

the  reality of our country and use this to their  advantage.

I think the scriptwriters are aware of this requirement and I

have seen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



a  number  of them making efforts to move into this  area  of

projecting  Malay/Indian characters  in  Chinese  dramas  and

likewise in the Malay dramas, you have Indian characters  who

could  speak  in  Malay, trying to interact  with  the  Malay

actors  to project the reality in Singapore.  But, as I  said

earlier, this requires some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Vasantham Central, we will ask

MediaCorp  to  look into it and see how Suria  and  Vasantham

Central  could  also  play  this role  of  projecting  multi-ethnicity to their respective communities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on Sportscity, I understand that sports is a

very passionate event.  It is very close to our hearts and as

locals, it is not wrong for us to expect Sportscity to  cover

more  local events.  But we leave it to MediaCorp  to  decide

because there is also the economic consideration.  They  must

weigh the balance between the viability of the programme, its

attractiveness  and  our objective of  projecting  the  local

sports  event.   On  the Hindi Channel  as  is  happening  in

Malaysia, I would ask MediaCorp to look into it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> I would like to ask for clarification on

the point of broadcast times of Channel NewsAsia between 6.30

am and 9.30 am.



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> As far as broadcasting of the news

in  Channel  5  as well as Channel NewsAsia is concerned,  we

understand  that  this is not an easy  solution.   The  ideal

solution, and what I believe the Member would like  to  have,

would   be   to  see  the  two  channels  showing   different

programmes, because Singaporeans wishing to watch news  could

just  switch to Channel NewsAsia and switch to Channel 5  for

something  different.   But the cost  of  producing  separate

programmes is high and running different shows in the morning

when  the  viewership  is low may cost financial  strains  on

MediaCorp.   Nevertheless, I would still take Mr  Ravindran's

suggestion  and  hope  that  MediaCorp  would  look  into  it

seriously.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I do hope that MCS will have the

creative  juices to think how to make use of  this  broadcast

time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



between 6.30 am and 9.30 am, because if they cannot even make

use  of  this  simple time-slot, I do not know how  they  are

going  to compete when MediaWorks comes on the scene, because

naturally,  people will tend to move towards  MediaWorks.   I

guess this is what competition is all about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4).



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code RI 3100.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the heritage centres being set up by the Government

are a very commendable effort to showcase the heritage of the

different  communities of Singapore.  These heritage  centres

would  certainly transmit the cultures, traditions and  sense

of  history of the different communities in Singapore.   They

also  have  the  potential of attracting tourists  and  other

visitors.   I  would like to ask the Minister to  update  the

developments  on the Chinese and Malay Heritage  Centres.   I

would also like to know what steps the Ministry has taken  to

develop  the Indian Heritage Centre and whether the  Ministry

has  taken  any pro-active steps to bring together interested

organisations to move on with the projects.



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, MITA's concerted efforts to

cultivate  the arts are also evident in the preservation  and

promotion  of  local  heritage.   Mr  Ravindran  asked  about

Government's  support  for the Indian  Heritage  Centre.   In

1992,  the  Government  agreed to the provision  of  suitable

premises on nominal leases to the Chinese, Malay, Indian  and

Eurasian  communities for their respective community heritage

centres.  The Government has also agreed to the provision  of

one-off  matching grants for each heritage centre  to  enable

them  to set up endowment funds.  The grant will be a dollar-to-dollar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



matching  basis  against funds raised by the communities  for

their  respective endowment funds, subject to  a  cap  of  $5

million,  $2  million, $1 million and $0.25 million  for  the

Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian communities respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the efforts of each community to set up

centres  for  the promotion of their heritage.   The  Chinese

Heritage  Centre has been in existence since 1992  and  I  am

pleased  to  inform  him that the groundwork  for  the  Malay

Heritage  Centre is progressing very well.  MITA  would  thus

encourage  the Indian community to set up an Indian  Heritage

Centre  and  the National Heritage Board would  be  happy  to

extend  its  support  and assistance in  setting  up  such  a

centre.
