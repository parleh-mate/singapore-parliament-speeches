<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister,

in  the  light  of  recent changes imposed by  Malaysia  on  the

currency  and stock market rules, what steps are being taken  by

the  Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Stock  Exchange  of

Singapore  Ltd  to  provide  a better  sense  of  direction  and

assistance  to  the  public  so that  they  will  be  adequately

prepared.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister (a)

how  many investors suffered losses from trading in Clob due  to

the  financial  control measures announced by Malaysia  recently

and  what are the estimated losses of the investors; and (b)  to

what  extent will the closure of Clob affect the revenue of  the

securities industry and Singapore as a financial investment hub.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  Government will consider taking steps to see  that  the

investors'  interest in the Central Limit Order Book  System  is

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister what

are  the  effects  on  the financial sector  and  the  Singapore

economy with the closure of Clob International.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang) (for the</b>

<b>Deputy Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your

permission to take Question Nos. 1 to 4 together?

<br><br><!-- Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent closure of

trading  of  Malaysian  shares on Clob, after  Malaysia  imposed

capital controls and new rules on the clearing and settlement of

Malaysian  shares,  has highlighted the risks  of  investing  in

shares.  There  is a price risk inherent in any  share.  But  in

addition,  shares listed on overseas exchanges  are  subject  to

regulatory  risk arising from changes in rules by  the  overseas

exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government cannot protect investors from such risks.

Investors  have to keep their eyes open and judge for themselves

whether the returns are adequate to justify the risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian government's opposition to trading of

Malaysian  shares on Clob is long standing, and has always  been

reported in the press. When the SES established Clob in  January

1990,  after Malaysia unilaterally delisted all Malaysian shares

from  the  SES, the KLSE objected strongly. It declared publicly

that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>

Clob  was  an unrecognised market, and warned investors  of  the

dangers in trading Malaysian shares on Clob.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as August 1998, the National Economic Action

Council  of  Malaysia called for the closure of  Clob.  The  SES

responded that Clob would remain viable only so long as there is

demand from investors for its services. This exchange was widely

reported in the press, and put investors on notice of Malaysia's

intentions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES has issued a statement explaining why it did not

stop  trading of Malaysian shares on Clob earlier, for  example,

immediately  after  the KLSE announced its  new  rules  on  31st

August  1998,  or  even  before  that.  It  apologised  for  not

reassuring  investors earlier than 7th September 1998  that  the

Malaysian actions had not made their shares worthless.  However,

this  omission did not make a material difference  to  Malaysian

share prices on Clob.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after the SES had given repeated assurances to

investors that their shares were not worthless, shares  on  Clob

continued  to trade at a deep discount1 to prices on  the  KLSE.

Once the Malaysian measures were announced, nothing the SES  did

could  prevent a decline of share prices on Clob. Many investors

evidently preferred to sell their shares on Clob and receive the

proceeds  in Singapore dollars, rather than wait to  dispose  of

their  shares  on  KLSE  and retain their  proceeds  in  Ringgit

accounts  in  Malaysia for one year, as required under  the  new

Malaysian rules.

<pre>

1  On 28th August 1998, Clob shares were traded at a discount of

only 9% on average, compared to the prices of the shares on  the

KLSE.  Following the amendment of the Malaysian measures on 31st

August  1998 and 1st September 1998, the discount on Club prices

widened  to  49% on 3rd September 1998. Club was suspended  from

trading on 4th September 1998, and subsequently reopened  for  5

trading days from 9th to 15th September 1998.  At the end of the

trading period, the discount on Clob shares averaged 42%.

</pre>

<br><hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st August 1998, 197,000 investors held Malaysian

shares  on  Clob.  90%  were Singaporean investors.   Many  Clob

investors  sold their shares after the Malaysian  measures  were

announced,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>

including 24,000 who sold all their Malaysian shares. They would

have  made  losses.   But for every seller there  was  a  buyer,

hoping  to  make  a  gain by buying the shares and  subsequently

selling them on the KLSE. Most such investors, be they buyers or

sellers, were Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closure of trading of Malaysian shares on Clob is a

loss  to  Singapore's  financial sector, but  the  loss  is  not

significant  relative to the size of the financial  sector.   In

1997,  the  stock  market accounted for  10%  of  the  financial

sector's  value added, or 1.1% of overall GDP2. Clob represented

about  24% of the SES' turnover at that stage. But more recently

from June 1998 to August 1998, Clob's share had declined to only

3-8%  of the total turnover in the stock market. Moreover, since

the  closure  of Clob trading of Malaysian shares,  some  retail

investors have channelled their interest into Singapore shares3.



<br><hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>

<pre>

2   In  1997,  the  share of the stock market in  the  financial

services  sector was 9.9%, and the financial services sector  in

turn had a share of 11.4% in overall GDP.

3   For  the  period from 1st September 1998 to  15th  September

1998,  the  average  daily  turnover  of  Singapore  shares  was

$190.3m.  This has increased to $201.1m during the  period  from

16th September 1998 to 30th September 1998.

</pre>

<br><hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>



Over  the  years, the SES has taken steps to develop the  market

for  local  and foreign shares. Clob is not a market solely  for

trading Malaysian shares, although because of historical reasons

and  investors' familiarity, the bulk of the trade on  Clob  has

been   in   Malaysian  shares.   The  SES  will   continue   its

developmental efforts to provide investors with a broad range of

options for trading of Asian shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's financial sector provides a wide range of

services  and  products, and serves a large pool  of  investors,

borrowers and financial intermediaries. The regional crisis  has

shrunk  the  volume of financial activity, but  the  sector  has

remained resilient. Some financial activities have continued  to

grow  despite  the  slowdown.  A recent Bank  for  International

Settlements  survey found that daily turnover in  the  Singapore

foreign

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>

exchange  market  has  increased  by  32%  since  1995,  whereas

turnover  in  the other major Asian financial centres  declined.

SIMEX  is  also  experiencing a record year in  trading  futures

contracts.  Investors increasingly appreciate  our  AAA  country

risk  rating, and the transparent, predictable and open business

environment  that  Singapore offers. We are therefore  confident

that despite difficulties and occasional setbacks, Singapore  is

strengthening its position as a financial hub in the region.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on 3rd

September 1998, SES announced that Clob would continue  as  long

as  there is demand.  On 4th September 1998, it suddenly decided

to  suspend trading and close Clob.  Would the Minister  explain

what  situational changes between 3rd and 4th September resulted

in SES making an about-turn?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second supplementary question is: why did SES wait

until  7th September 1998, about a week after Malaysia announced

the  new  measures,  to assure the investors that  their  shares

would  not be worthless?  Was SES itself not sure, prior to  7th

September, about the status of the shares traded in Clob?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third supplementary question is: was the Government

aware,  during  the setting up of Clob, that Clob  itself  could

face  eventual closure under some circumstances if Malaysia were

to take extreme measures?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When the Malaysians first made the

announcement, as SES explained in the press statement, SES could

not  straightaway close the market.  There was no reason for  it

to   do  so.   As  Members  will  remember,  subsequently,   the

Malaysians also imposed currency controls and, as a result, that

removed the arbitraging between the Singapore Clob and the KLSE.

When  that  happened,  it became obvious  that  Clob  could  not

continue any more and that is why SES suspended trading to  make

the  announcement that trading would continue for  another  five

days, after which the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>

nominee accounts would be migrated to the KLSE.  I think SES has

responded correctly at every stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key issue is when to suspend trading on stock

exchanges.  This is something that you cannot take lightly and I

think  SES  made the right decision in providing an orderly  and

free market so that investors can trade in the securities.   But

when  conditions became clear that it no longer could trade  any

more because the arbitraging between the two exchanges could not

take place, SES had to suspend trading and close down Clob. This

explains the about-turn.  It is not just the closure of Clob but

also the imposition of currency controls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also asked why it took one week. This is because of

the announcement subsequently by the Malaysian government on the

currency controls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third question was, if we knew that Clob could be

closed,  why  did we not take measures to prevent it.   SES  has

explained that Clob exists only to service investors.   As  long

as  there  is a demand for its services, there is a  reason  for

Clob  to  exist.  Clob also services the Malaysian investors  by

providing  liquidity  and  more volume.   So  it  is  a  win-win

situation  for  both  sides  in  having  Clob.   But  once   the

Malaysians decided on currency controls, then they are  prepared

to  accept the disadvantages of not having Clob, in having lower

liquidity,  etc.   They  are  prepared  to  take  that  loss  in

furtherance of their overall currency controls and,  under  such

circumstances, Clob cannot exist any more.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I do not think the Minister has

answered  my question.  My question is: why was there an  about-turn between 3rd and 4th September 1998?  On 3rd September,  SES

announced  that Clob would continue as long as there is  demand.

The  currency controls imposed by Malaysia was announced on  1st

September  1998.  After this announcement of currency  controls,

SES  announced that Clob would continue trading.   Then  on  4th

September, it was suddenly decided to close down Clob.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: why did Clob not assure investors

earlier  that  their  shares would not be worthless?   Why  wait

until  7th September?  Was SES itself not sure about the  status

of the shares?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> With hindsight, it is always possible to

raise  these questions.  These events took place rather rapidly,

and  as  the  market  adjusted it was not possible  for  SES  to

intervene  and  make  an announcement and unsettle  the  market.

When  the  announcement was made about the rules for  Clob,  SES

responded by saying that it would remain open and it would trade

as long as there is demand for its services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the currency controls were imposed and the differences

started to widen between the two markets, it became obvious,  as

the  days  went  on,  that they could not  arbitrage  any  more.

Therefore, the very vital feedback link was no longer there  and

you were just trading within yourselves without taking advantage

of the price changes in the KLSE.  That is why on 4th September,

SES decided that it was no longer possible to continue with Clob

and had to suspend trading and close down Clob.  You do not make

that  kind of decision immediately.  You have to weigh the  pros

and  cons  and  you  have  to assess the  impact.   You  do  not

immediately  close  Clob.  What happens if that  was  the  wrong

decision?  Then investors would be disadvantaged.  I think it is

fair  for  SES to make its decision after consultation with  all

the  players  and  after assessing the impact  of  the  currency

controls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next question was why SES did not tell the investors

that  their  shares  were not worthless.  I think  SES  did  not

realise  that  Singaporeans  thought  that  their  shares   were

worthless.  These were controls imposed by KLSE.  If you are  an

informed  investor,  you know there is an  omnibus  account,  of

which  your  own  stocks  can  be  migrated  to  the  KLSE  MCD.

Therefore,  there is no reason for Singaporeans  to  think  that

their stocks were worthless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two things happening in the market during that

period.  First, there was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>

a  lot  of uncertainty.  The KLSE was changing rules practically

every  other  day.   So  there was  a  lot  of  uncertainty  and

confusion.  Second, there was a great premium to get out of  the

market.  As Members could see, the difference between the  share

prices  in Clob and the KLSE prices widened to 49% and  even  at

the end of the trading, it ended at 42%, which shows there was a

high  premium.   Singaporean investors have  decided  that  they

wanted  to get out of it and they wanted to take their  proceeds

in Singapore dollars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances of uncertainty as well as a high

premium  on  getting  out and having the proceeds  in  Singapore

dollars,  it  was  not obvious to SES that people  were  trading

below  the  value of KLSE just because they thought  that  their

shares  were worthless.  The interpretation is that Singaporeans

wanted  to  get  out  their proceeds in  Singapore  dollars  and

therefore were prepared to accept the heavy discount.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> It seems to me, from the Minister's

answer,  that  SES was not able to fully appreciate  the  market

situation  as  well as the rules that would affect the  trading.

Would it not be more prudent for SES then to suspend trading  on

Clob  on 1st September after knowing the effect and at the  same

time assessing the impact on Clob rather than to suspend trading

later?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have said earlier, a decision to

suspend  trading is something that you do not take lightly.   In

fact,  SES  has suspended trading on the market for  only  three

days in 1985, and that is to SES' credit that we keep the market

open.   That is the role of the Exchange, ie, to keep the market

open.   As long as there is equal information available to buyer

and  seller, the role of the Exchange is to keep it  open.   The

Exchange  only suspends trading if it is assessed that there  is

inequity in the availability of the market information.  In this

case,  buyers  and  sellers were operating  on  the  same  level

playing field.  The announcement was made by the Malaysians.  It

is  up  to you to decide whether to buy or sell and whether  you

are going to make money or lose

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>

money.  For every seller, as long as there is a buyer, there  is

a  basis  for the market.  But if SES feels that the information

is only available to one group and not to the other group, then,

of course, to be the referee, it ought to suspend trading on the

market.  So such conditions were not there on 1st September  and

there was no reason for SES to suspend trading on the market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, will the Minister

remind  the House that when trading on the stock market in  1985

was suspended by the Stock Exchange, Singapore was subjected  to

a  great deal of criticism for doing so?  So I think there is  a

very high price to be paid for the suspension of trading on  the

stock market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When the SES suspended trading on the

market in 1985, because of the Pan-El crisis, that decision  was

also criticised by many investors.

<div align="center"><b>MALAYSIA'S CURRENCY CONTROL MEASURES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry what is the extent of the impact of Malaysia's currency

control measures on our economy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether Malaysia's imposition of capital and  exchange

controls will have any adverse effect on economic cooperation in

ASEAN.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I have permission to answer Question  Nos.  5

and 6 together, as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Given the close interdependence of the

Singapore  and  Malaysian  economies,  it  is  inevitable   that

Singapore  will be affected by Malaysia's capital  and  exchange

control   measures.   The  closure  of  CLOB  is  an   immediate

consequence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activity in Singapore's foreign exchange market has been

reduced by the cessation of Ringgit trades.  However, trading in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>

Ringgit had already declined over the past months and was only a

small  proportion of total turnover just prior to  the  exchange

controls.   There  will also be some loss of  business  for  our

banks  and  fund  managers as they can no longer accept  Ringgit

deposits  or trade in the currency.  Offshore loans to  Malaysia

through Singapore's Asian Dollar Market, albeit a small share of

total offshore loans, could also be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures are also likely to affect bilateral trade.

Companies  with  substantial  Ringgit  contracts  have  to   re-negotiate  their  contracts and financing  arrangements.   There

will  be additional administrative costs as all settlements must

now  be  in  foreign  currency.  A  double  conversion  cost  is

incurred  as traders have to convert their export earnings  into

Ringgit and convert their Ringgit to foreign currencies  to  pay

for  imports.   The ease of getting Bank Negara's  authorisation

for   obtaining  foreign  exchange  for  trade  and  for  profit

repatriation purposes will be critical.  Any bureaucratic  delay

will mean higher business costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 60% of our trade with Malaysia are intra-firm, intra-MNC trade. These are mainly denominated in US Dollars. These

operations  are  unlikely  to be affected  much  by  the  recent

measures.   Only about 6% of bilateral trade are denominated  in

Ringgit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures will also mean a drop in Malaysian investments

into  Singapore  as  there will be limits imposed  on  Malaysian

investments abroad.  However, such investments account for  only

a  very  small  percentage  of  total  investment  inflows  into

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern is the potential downgrading of investor

interest in the region.  The outlook for foreign investment  has

already  weakened  because of the regional crisis.   Uncertainty

arising  from Malaysia's capital controls may further discourage

foreign investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia's capital controls represent a step backwards in

ASEAN's   efforts  to  liberalise  its  trade   and   investment

environment.   ASEAN  will have to work  harder  to  bring  back

investor confidence into the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>

region.  The ASEAN Economic Ministers who met last week in

Manila have endorsed the Framework Agreement on the ASEAN

Investment Area to enhance the investment climate in ASEAN.

Singapore will continue to work with other ASEAN members to

press ahead with further economic cooperation and trade

liberalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the positive side, if the measures are temporary in

nature and the Malaysian government makes use of this period  of

stability  to  bring about the necessary reforms,  we  can  look

forward to an earlier recovery of the Malaysian economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Will the Minister be able to quantify

what is the direct impact?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, it is too early to make an accurate

assessment.  I do not have any figures at the moment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Is there any sense

that  the  other  ASEAN  countries are  slowing  down  on  their

liberalisation momentum because of this recent event,  including

Malaysia's imposition of exchange controls?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just came back from

the  Manila meeting last week.  My assessment is that the  ASEAN

Economic  Ministers are aware that, in fact, with  this  current

crisis,  it is all the more important for them to open up  their

markets  and  stay  on track as far as trade  liberalisation  is

concerned.   Of course, they are closely watching the  Malaysian

situation.   And  even  Malaysia  is  keen  to  attract  foreign

investments.   So  we were discussing the possibility  of  maybe

bringing forward the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area

as  a  strong signal to the market that we are on track and,  if

anything,  we  want  to push forward even more  vigorously  with

trade liberalisation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Is there any sense that there is a

thinking among the ASEAN countries to impose capital controls as

well?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Apart from Malaysia, my assessment is

that countries like Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines  and

others, are not taking up capital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>

controls.   I  think Mr Ginandjar has mentioned something  about

the possibility of getting their traders to convert their export

earnings  back to rupiah.  So this is something that has  to  be

watched.  But the overall tone is that they are aware that these

capital  controls, in fact, will be a step backwards and  it  is

better  to  keep the market open and leave the current situation

on exchange controls as it is.

<br><br><!-- Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As at 31st August 1998, the six local

banking  groups had exposure of S$37.3 billion (or 15% of  their

total  assets) to Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Korea  and  the

Philippines.  Excluding the assets of Thai Danu Bank acquired by

DBS  in  March 1998, the total exposure of the six local banking

groups was S$31.3 billion.  This is a 16% drop from the December

1997 figure.

The  non-performing  loans of the six local  banking  groups  to

these  five countries amounted to 17% (S$5.9 billion)  of  their

loans  to  these  countries  as  at  31st  August  1998.   As  a

percentage of the local banks' total loans, the ratio was 2.7%.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including domestic loans and other global loans, the total

non-performing loans of the local banks amounted to 6.1%  as  at

31st August 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the public's and market's interest in the level

of  non-performing loans of the local banks,  MAS  will  release

such data henceforth on a quarterly basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore banks' non-performing loans in the region are

likely  to rise. The banks have set aside substantial provisions

for this reason, and are likely to make further provisions so as

to  maintain  their  conservative stance towards  possible  loan

losses  and  to preserve market confidence.  The level  of  non-performing  loans, present or projected, does not  threaten  the

financial health of any of the local banks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Deputy Prime Minister):</b> The

Asian  financial  crisis has indeed become globalised.   Through

the inter-linkages of the financial markets, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>

crisis  has  affected even countries with strong policy  regimes

such   as   US  and  Europe.   President  Clinton  himself   has

acknowledged  that  this  is  the "biggest  financial  challenge

facing  the world in half a century" .  Among the G-7 countries,

there  is a greater sense of urgency and the recognition of  the

need for action with respect to the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no reason to be unduly pessimistic. The

US economy remains robust and Europe continues to grow strongly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their latest meeting on 3rd October, the G-7 nations

continental  European  nations have  committed  to  implementing

urgent  structural  reforms  and  reducing  unemployment.   Such

measures  will  form  the  basis for  a  continuation  of  solid

economic growth in the industrialised countries and thus support

recovery in the rest of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Singapore's strong fundamentals, we will not be

insulated from developments in the world economy.  This reflects

the  high degree of openness of the Singapore economy.  In fact,

external sources of demand account for almost two-thirds of  the

total demand for our goods and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the financial crisis worsen and lead to a widespread

downturn  in global economic activity, the expected recovery  in

Singapore  and  the rest of the Asian region will be  postponed.

Given  our  small size and heavy dependence on demand conditions

in  global  export markets, we are restrained in our ability  to

pursue  specific unilateral policy initiatives.  We need  to  be

realistic and recognise that ultimately the external environment

must  improve before an enduring economic recovery in  Singapore

can take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Government will take the necessary steps

to  help  alleviate some of the short-term pain as  the  economy

adjusts to the shock of the financial crisis.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the exchange rate policy, the Monetary Authority of

Singapore  has been managing the Singapore Dollar exchange  rate

with  greater  flexibility.  The objective is to maintain  price

stability with a view to ensuring the conditions for sustainable

economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On fiscal policy, the Government is pursuing somewhat more

expansionary  policies, for example, in  increased  spending  on

economic  infrastructure.  However, because our  economy  is  so

dependent  on external demand, we cannot hope to pull  ourselves

out of the downturn by just stimulating domestic spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the main focus of the Government's response is on

reducing  business costs in Singapore, with a view to sustaining

our    competitiveness.     The   Committee    on    Singapore's

Competitiveness  is  undertaking  a  comprehensive   review   of

measures   to   reduce   business  costs  decisively   and   its

recommendations will be ready by the end of the year.

<div align="center"><b>SCRAP VALUE OF CARS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Refund in cash)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Dr Wang Kai Yuen -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. To ask the Minister for Communications whether the

Government will consider refunding in cash the scrap value of  a

car being scrapped.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Question No. 10, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Preferential  Additional  Registration  Fee

(PARF)  scheme  was  introduced  in  1975  as  a  concession  to

encourage timely replacement of cars, so that our car population

remains  young and roadworthy.  The concession is given  in  the

form  of  a  rebate  that can be used to offset  the  Additional

Registration Fee (ARF) of a new car.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has considered refunding the PARF benefit in

cash  but  decided  against it.  This is because  it  creates  a

potential  cash liability in the Government's budget.   A  large

amount

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>

would  have  to  be  set aside to ensure  that  there  would  be

sufficient funds to meet the liability, in case many owners  de-register  their cars at the same time.  This amount  would  have

been  better allocated for other worthwhile expenditure, instead

of being locked up as a contingent liability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware that with the current economic

situation,  some car owners are not getting the full benefit  of

the  PARF value.  The Government has therefore decided to  allow

greater  flexibility  in the use of the  PARF  certificate.   We

will:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Allow the PARF certificate to be used to offset the various

one-time  upfront vehicle taxes and fees, namely, the  ARF,  the

COE and Registration Fees (RF), at the point of registration  of

a new car.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Allow the use of more than one PARF certificate per car,

and  conversely allow the PARF benefits to offset the  ARF,  COE

and RF of more than one new car.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Extend the validity period of PARF certificate from the

current 6 months to 12 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of the validity period of all unused existing

PARF  certificates  will be with immediate  effect.   The  other

measures  will be implemented from 1st November 1998  after  the

computerised vehicle registry system is amended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA will announce details of these measures shortly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to ask the Minister

whether  he  thinks it is fair for the Government to budget  for

revenue  from COEs and the import tax of cars but  at  the  same

time  it cannot budget an amount to pay back the scrap value  of

cars in cash.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think the Member does not understand the

concept  of  PARF. It is not a question of fairness.   It  is  a

policy measure to encourage car owners to scrap their cars

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>

before 10 years.  It is a concession.  It is not a deposit  that

people  have to put with the Government and before 10 years,  if

they  scrap  their car, they are going to get this amount  back.

That is the first point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that in terms of prudent financial

budgeting, we must provide for a contingent liability because in

the case of people wanting their money back, we must be prepared

to  give  it  to them, if we decide to give back in  cash.   You

could  argue that in the case where there is the same number  of

people  registering  new  cars and the  same  number  of  people

scrapping their cars, that the money from PARF can be offset  by

ARF.   That  may  well be so now.  What happens  if  we  have  a

situation,  one  could  argue that it is an  extreme  situation,

where  everybody  wants to scrap his car  but  nobody  wants  to

register new cars?  You can say that is extreme. What happens if

it  is  close to that situation? Do you know how much money  the

Government  would have to set aside?  Billions of dollars.   Why

don't  we want to do that?  Because every cent that is put  into

contingent  liability is money that cannot  be  used  for  other

worthwhile purposes.  So we recognise the problem but  we  think

this  is a better and more practical and safer way to solve  the

problem.   The  measures that will be implemented will  actually

make  the  PARF  certificate more valuable  and  even  in  these

extreme  economic conditions, people will be able to  make  full

use of the PARF certificate.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Would the Minister make an

exception,  particularly for those who are retiring or  retirees

above the age of 65? Would he consider alternative measures  for

them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> What has he in mind? If we have a policy, we

should  have a policy that applies to all.  Whether  it  is  for

retirees or not, that is a separate matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> But in keeping with the policy to take cars off the

road,  retirees  do  not  want to drive  any  more.   Would  the

Minister consider their case for cash payment?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> With the new measures, it is not too

difficult for the retirees to be able to redeem their full cash

value.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRONIC ROAD PRICING</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Minister for Communications (a)

how  much  has  been spent on implementing the  Electronic  Road

Pricing  (ERP)  System so far; (b) how much will be  the  annual

operating  cost of the system and how it campares to the  annual

operating  cost of the old manual system; and (c)  in  terms  of

revenue  per month, how much is collected under the  ERP  system

compared to the sale of monthly and daily coupons under the  old

system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Cyrille Tan</b> asked the Minister for Communications

whether his Ministry will consider lowering the Electronic  Road

Pricing  rates for commercial and industrial vehicles so  as  to

reduce business costs in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen</b> asked the Minister for

Communications whether his Ministry will consider  (i)  reducing

road  taxes  or  other statutory charges for private  and  goods

vehicles;  and  (ii)  reducing/adjusting  the  Electronic   Road

Pricing charges for optimizing traffic flows, in order to reduce

business costs for businessmen and individuals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to

take Question Nos. 11, 12 and 13 together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, let me first reiterate the objective of

the  Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) System.  It is  to  keep  our

roads  free-flowing,  in order to reduce  the  overall  cost  of

transporting  goods and people.  It does so by  using  price  to

spread  traffic  on  our roads evenly throughout  the  day.  The

purpose of ERP is not to generate more revenue. That is why,  as

part  of  the  implementation of the ERP, we  have  reduced  the

upfront and annual costs of vehicle ownership.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Reducing upfront taxes/ERP rebates/Phasing-in ERP charges</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer Mr Chay, under the new vehicle tax structure that

has  been  implemented since 1st April this year, upfront  taxes

such  as Registration Fees (RF) and Additional Registration Fees

(ARF) had been reduced drastically for the majority of vehicles.

For  example,  the RF for heavy goods vehicles was reduced  from

$14,000  to $140 (99%). The ARF for tourist coaches was  reduced

from  55%  of  OMV to 5% of OMV, resulting in savings  of  about

$28,000  per vehicle.  In addition, most vehicle owners  enjoyed

savings  from reduction in their annual road tax or diesel  tax,

ranging from an average of $280 per year for car owners to a few

thousand dollars for goods vehicles and buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also giving ERP rebates to motorists over the next

few  years, starting with $200 per PCU for the first year of ERP

implementation  starting 1st September  this  year.   For  those

motorists  who do not need to or decide not to pass through  ERP

gantries,  and these motorists are in the majority, this  rebate

is a bonus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help businesses adjust to the ERP system, we have phased-in the rates for taxis and commercial vehicles over the next

four   years.   Taxis  are  currently  levied  one-third   while

commercial vehicles pay only one-quarter of their respective ERP

rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire package of road tax reduction and ERP rebates,

not  taking  into account revenue from ERP, will save  motorists

and businesses about $1.5 billion over the next five years.

<br><br><i>Cost/revenue of ERP System</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew asked about the cost of ERP. The development and

implementation of the ERP system cost about $213 million.   This

includes  the  cost of fitting the In-vehicle Units  (IUs)  onto

653,000 vehicles during a 10-month long IU fitting exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual cost of operating the ERP system is about $9

million.   The   manual  Area Licensing Scheme  (ALS)  and  Road

Pricing  Scheme  (RPS)  cost $17 million  per  year,  mainly  in

manpower cost. While the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>

primary objective of ERP is not cost reduction per se,

nevertheless, it is less labour intensive, and therefore more

cost-effective in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of revenue, the Government is collecting less from

the  ERP  than from the old system.  In September 1998,  revenue

collection  from ERP was about $6.6 million, which is  23%  less

than  the average monthly revenue of $8.6 million under the  old

system.

<br><br><i>ERP implementation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the first phase ERP since 1st

September  1998 has led to a significant improvement in  traffic

conditions   within  the  CBD.   Traffic  volume  entering   the

Restricted  Zone  has been reduced by about 24%,  while  traffic

conditions on the ECP and PIE have also remained good.  However,

on  the  CTE,  traffic  congestion has  worsened,  with  average

traffic  speed falling to 35-50 kph, which is below the  optimal

level  of  50-55 kph.  This is primarily due to the  substantial

increase  in  the number of taxis and commercial vehicles  using

the CTE .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fully realise the benefits of the ERP system, we must

ensure  that  rates are set such that roads and expressways  are

neither  overly  congested  nor  under  utilised.  If  so,  then

adjustments  to  the ERP rates will have to be made  to  achieve

better  traffic conditions.  Over time, traffic conditions  will

also  change. ERP rates must respond accordingly.  To make  full

use  of  the  flexibility of the ERP system, reviews of  traffic

conditions will be carried out regularly and rates adjusted,  if

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has noted that the traffic patterns in the CBD and

expressways  have  stabilised.  It is  currently  reviewing  the

rates  to bring about more optimal use of the roads.  Where  and

when  the  roads are under-utilised, ERP rates will be  lowered.

Conversely,   where   and   when  the  congestion   levels   are

unacceptable,  the  rates  will be adjusted  upwards.  LTA  will

finalise  the changes in the ERP rates and announce the  details

soon.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Cost-cutting measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in response to Mr Cyrille Tan, let me stress that

we  must  not  mix the objectives of ERP with that of  the  cost

cutting  measures  that  Government  is  implementing  to   help

business.   With the ERP, we can rely more on usage measures  to

manage  traffic and this will allow us to further reduce upfront

taxes  like ARF.  Indeed, the sooner and the more fully the  ERP

system is implemented, the more leeway the Government will  have

to  reduce  these statutory charges on vehicles, and  hence  the

overall cost of owning vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me end by saying that the greatest contribution of

the  ERP  system really is its ability to keep our  roads  free-flowing,  in  an  efficient and effective manner.  We  take  our

traffic  conditions  for granted. Yet, many  cities  around  the

world are grappling with the problem of congestion and the costs

it  imposes  on  their economies and their  societies.  The  ERP

system  that  Singapore has put in place  after  many  years  of

planning and implementation has been acknowledged and recognised

by  international traffic management experts and  policy  makers

as an effective and fair way to solve the problem of congestion.

So,  let me take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts and

the  contributions of all those responsible for successfully and

smoothly   implementing   the   ERP   system,   especially   the

contractors,  the media, the staff and all motorists  for  their

understanding and cooperation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> The Minister has said that

the  CTE has become more congested. What is the Government doing

about it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, we have just spent the last eight years

trying  to solve the problem of congestion through ERP. I  think

the  CTE  problem  is  a  unique one which  has  to  be  tackled

specifically  because  the  other two  expressways  are  not  so

congested.   LTA  will be looking at this in  closer  detail  in

terms of the types of vehicles using it and the times they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>

using  it.  LTA will then make the necessary adjustments to  ERP

rates in order to smoothen the flow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The problem is probably due to too many COEs

being  released. There are too many cars on the road.   That  is

why you are getting congestion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I am glad to hear the Member talking

about  car  population  control as  one  of  the  ways  to  ease

congestion on our roads.  Because that is precisely what we  are

doing.  We are using the COE system as well as the ERP system to

control congestion on our roads. One or the other alone will not

do.  So  ERP alone is not going to solve the problem. COEs  plus

ERP will solve the problem. I would like to thank the Member for

re-emphasising  that  point.  But having said  that,  the  total

number  of  COEs  being  issued is based on  very  rough  global

estimates of how many cars Singapore roads can accommodate.   As

to  where and when these cars travel, I think it is not possible

for  us  to determine how many COEs should be issued for  people

living in Potong Pasir, for example, because they happen  to  be

congesting the CTE.  But I think the ERP will solve the  problem

of localised congestion, whether it is on the CTE.  So if we use

both  these  measures judiciously, COEs to control  overall  car

population and ERP to control localised congestion, I  think  we

will  be  able,  most  of  the time, to control  the  congestion

problem  in  Singapore.  I say "most of the time" because  there

will  be  other situations when there are traffic  jams  due  to

accidents, bad weather and so on, which are beyond our control.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask the Minister whether he would agree that the ERP system will

actually  transfer loading of the transportation cost  from  the

non-business  sector to the business sector.   In  the  process,

actually the cost to the business sector is increased, which  in

turn  is  against  the current Government's intention  to  lower

overall business cost for the business sector.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I dispute that entirely because, as I

have   indicated,   for   the  bulk  of  the   industry,   their

transportation  costs have actually been lowered.   There  is  a

small  sector  of the business community which depends  on  very

frequent  use of ERP-controlled roads which will see an increase

in  their  transportation cost.  I think it is inevitable  in  a

situation  like  this that there will be some  businesses  which

cannot  lower  their transportation cost, even if  they  try  to

change  their travel patterns, but these are, I submit,  in  the

minority.   The indications are that the bulk of businesses  are

actually  saving  and some of them are saving  very  substantial

amounts.   So, the question really is: what do we  do  with  the

very  small percentage of businesses which are affected by  this

higher  business  cost?  I would say that the first  thing  that

they  would have to do is to relook at their business conditions

and see whether there is a way for them to reduce cost by making

less  use  of  ERP-controlled roads, by  changing  their  travel

patterns,  by relooking at the total logistics system.   But  we

cannot  change the entire system just because a small percentage

of  the  business community is adversely affected.  Indeed,  the

fact  that  ERP  is  successfully keeping  our  traffic  flowing

smoothly  is benefiting the overall business community.   If  we

were  to  ditch  that, how is it going to help  Singapore,  when

roads are heavily congested, when people take inordinate amounts

of  time to get to work or meetings, when goods are stuck on the

way  to  the  port and to the airports or on their  way  to  the

factories?   I  think the cost to Singapore will be  much,  much

higher, especially the cost to business.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I understand that

since  the  implementation of the ERP, there is  a  shortage  of

taxis  in  the  CBD.   For  businesses like  taxis  and  courier

companies, I do not know whether it is possible for the Minister

to  impose a certain maximum deduction from the ERP cashcard per

day,  so  that we cap their  cost for entering the CBD per  day.

This would help them to contain their cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that since the ERP started, the ring

roads around the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>

CBD   like  Scotts  Road,  for  example,  which  is  within   my

constituency,  have  been really congested  during  the  daytime

whereas Orchard Road, which is just around the corner, is empty.

It  appears  to  me that actually there is a bit  of  mispricing

problem.  Perhaps during the off peak hours and during the day -

<br><br><!-- Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lew, what is your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to

perhaps  consider changing the pricing of ERP  during  off  peak

hours so that at least the traffic along the ring roads will  be

evenly spread out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> As far as pricing is concerned, as I have

indicated, LTA is now reviewing the traffic flow in the CBD area

as  well as along the expressways and, if necessary, adjustments

will  be made.  In so far as capping the maximum amount  of  ERP

rates  is  concerned, to do that would be defeating the purpose,

because  the  idea  of  charging  per  pass  is  really  to  let

individual  motorists who are passing through  the  gantry  take

considered decisions as to whether they wish to make that number

of  trips  or not.  As I indicated earlier, there will  be  some

businesses including taxis which will be making multiple passes.

But  for  taxis,  if  they pass through with  a  passenger,  the

passenger  is the one who is paying.  And to help  ease  in  the

implementation,  we have kept the rates to one-third.   So  they

are actually paying one-third what the car should be paying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the times when they go in without a passenger, I

think  this  is for the taxi drivers and the taxi  companies  to

decide  how they wish to resolve the problem, because since  1st

September fares have been deregulated and they are now  free  to

reconfigure the tariff structure to resolve this problem.

<div align="center"><b>VOTING SYSTEM FOR VOTERS WHO ARE OVERSEAS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Prime Minister whether a

voting  system will be implemented for eligible voters  who  are

overseas and, if not, why.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng) (for the</b>

<b>Prime Minister):</b> Sir, our existing voting system is simple,

transparent  and  effective. On average, 95% of eligible  voters

cast  their  votes in elections.  The system achieves  foolproof

voter verification.  Except for the blind, every voter marks his

ballot  paper himself.  There is complete transparency,  because

candidates  and  their  polling  and  counting  agents  can   be

physically  present  to witness the voting  and  vote  counting.

There  is  also absolute security of the cast ballots, from  the

polling station all the way to the counting table.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elections Department has studied the issue of overseas

voting  since  1983,  and examined how other  countries  do  it.

There  are  various  methods  -  voting  in  overseas  missions,

electronic  voting,  postal voting, or proxy  voting.   However,

each has limitations and operational difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only have 26 overseas missions. Many electors will not

live  or  work close enough to one of them to go there to  vote,

especially in a large country like China or the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic voting looks attractive, but at present still

has fundamental technical deficiencies.  Elector verification is

not  foolproof,  and there is no trail or hard evidence  like  a

marked ballot paper to refer to in case of a dispute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overseas voters are a very small minority. Elections

Department  estimates that only 3.5% of electors are  unable  to

vote  because they are overseas.  It is therefore better not  to

complicate  the voting system for the sake of this small  number

of electors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the issue is not just numbers or operational

difficulties.   The 3.5% of Singaporeans who  are  overseas  are

away for various reasons.  1.4% are away on holiday and 0.7% are

studying  overseas.  The remaining 1.4% are  working  or  living

abroad.  Some are on overseas postings, perhaps working for  the

Government  or  for Singapore companies in their regionalisation

efforts.   But  others have emigrated.  They may be  waiting  to

take up foreign citizenship, or they may have gone abroad

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>

many years ago and lost touch with events back home, even though

they have not given up their Singapore passport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case for overseas voting is stronger for some of these

groups  than  for others.  But, in practice, it is difficult  to

distinguish between them.  So we have kept the requirement  that

a  Singaporean must return home to vote, as a practical test  of

whether he still maintains his links to Singapore and will  make

the effort to exercise his duties as a citizen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has therefore decided not to implement

a  system for overseas voting.  However, it recognises that this

is   not   a   static   situation.   With  globalisation,   more

Singaporeans will work abroad, and the case for overseas  voting

may  change.   We will therefore review the issue from  time  to

time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I want to know the number of

estimated overseas voters.  The Minister quoted the percentage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me take the 1997 general

elections  and  using the percentage I mentioned earlier,  about

31,000  out  of the 765,300 electors did not vote  in  the  1997

elections.  Among them were about 9,300 who were elderly  infirm

or  those who were sick and unable to vote.  About 4,340 of them

were  studying  overseas; about 8,680 of  them  were  holidaying

abroad  and  about 8,680 were either working or  living  abroad,

more  or  less  permanently.  So if the Member is talking  about

people who are working overseas or staying overseas permanently,

the number is about 8,600.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the

Minister  consider the use of exit voting, given that canvassing

for  polling is only nine days and people may already have  work

or other commitments to be abroad?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Elections Department has also

studied  exit voting, in other words, people going overseas  and

they  want to vote before they go away.  I think there are  also

other complications and we have decided to stay with the present

system.   Polling Day is fixed.  If a person decides to  make  a

trip abroad

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>

because  he  cannot  change  the  date,  so  be  it.   He  goes.

Otherwise, he could make an alternative arrangement, which is to

stay at home and vote on Polling Day.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister for Defence how the Malaysian Government's decision  to

terminate  various arrangements governing the use  of  Malaysian

airspace  by  the  Republic of Singapore Air Force  (RSAF)  will

affect  RSAF training and operations and Search and Rescue,  and

what  measures  were  taken up by the RSAF  to  deal  with  this

development.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Cyrille Tan</b> asked the Minister for Defence, with

the  restrictions  imposed on the usage of  Malaysian  airspace,

what measures are being considered by the SAF to (i) work around

the  restrictions;  and (ii) improve on their  search-and-rescue

operations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr Matthias Yao Chih)</b>

<b>(for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Sir,

may I have permission to take Question Nos. 15 and 16 together?

<br><br><!-- Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Thank you, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia's decision to terminate the various

agreements  and  arrangements  have  not  affected  the   RSAF's

training  and operations, but it will have an adverse effect  on

search  and  rescue  operations.  On 17th September  this  year,

Malaysia   informed  the  Ministry  of  Defence  that   it   was

terminating  various agreements and arrangements  governing  the

RSAF's  use  of  Malaysian airspace.  Their decision  came  into

effect  on 18th September, giving us less than 24 hours  notice.

This  was a unilateral decision by Malaysia.  We were not  given

prior notification nor consulted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia's decision affected the agreements and

arrangements covering:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) RSAF flights through South Johor to the South China Sea

Training Area;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) RSAF training within Malaysia's Low-Flying Area;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) RSAF navigational training flights in Peninsular and East

Malaysia;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) RSAF aircraft taking off from Tengah Airbase using South

Johor airspace; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The combined Search and Rescue operations and exercises.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF and the SAF plan for all contingencies and Malaysia's

decision  has not curtailed the RSAF's training and  operations.

When  the  decision  was conveyed to us,  the  RSAF  immediately

implemented alternative arrangements.  Today, the RSAF  conducts

its training and operational flights with the same frequency and

tempo  as  before.  RSAF aircraft proceeding to  their  training

areas  no  longer  transit through Malaysian airspace  but  take

alternative  routes.  In doing so, we have  not  compromised  on

safety.   The RSAF has been working closely with CAAS to  ensure

the  proper sequencing of RSAF flights and civil air traffic  so

that air safety is not compromised.  We have also minimised  the

number  of  RSAF  flights  over built-up  areas.   However,  the

adjustments  in  flight paths could mean some  inconvenience  to

those living on both sides of the Johor Straits as more aircraft

now  have  to  fly over Singapore's territorial  waters  in  the

Straits.   In  fact, several of the arrangements which  Malaysia

terminated had been designed to reduce the aircraft noise level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RSAF does not depend on any one country for its training

needs.   The  RSAF  has established extensive overseas  training

arrangements.  These have provided valuable training  areas  and

also  the  opportunity to train and exercise with  other  highly

professional  air  forces.  We will continue  to  look  for  new

training  areas  in other parts of the world.  In  addition,  we

have  invested heavily in advanced training simulators.  We will

continue  to  conduct more sophisticated training and  exercises

and make more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>

extensive   use  of  simulators  to  ensure  that   the   RSAF's

operational and training effectiveness continues to  be  of  the

highest standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF would like to clarify some of the misconceptions about

the  agreements and arrangements covered by Malaysia's  actions.

First, the arrangements did not allow  RSAF aircraft a free  run

of  Malaysian  airspace.   For safety  and  other  reasons,  the

arrangements -

<div align="center"><b>POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(TRANSFER OF UNDERTAKINGS AND DISSOLUTION) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House mainly deals with the transfer of

the undertakings and employees of POSBank and Credit POSB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>

to  DBS,  the dissolution of POSBank and the repeal of the  Post

Office  Savings  Bank  of Singapore Act. It transfers  POSBank's

existing  property, rights and liabilities to DBS,  excluding  a

list   of   assets  and  liabilities  and  makes  the  necessary

arrangements for the transfer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government announced the privatisation of POSBank and

its  acquisition by DBS for $1.6 billion on 24th July 1998.  DBS

will  pay  for it with new non-voting convertible DBS preference

shares.  I  would  now  take  the House  through  the  rationale

underlying the privatisation of POSBank.

<br><br><i>Rationale for privatisation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSBank was set up in 1972. Its specific purpose was to promote

thrift and saving among Singaporeans. POSBank has fulfilled this

function very well. The objective of encouraging savings remains

valid  today.   However,  the banking  environment  has  changed

substantially since POSBank's inception more than 25 years  ago.

The large mass of depositors now have access to the local retail

banks,  which are able to offer them a full range of competitive

services.  Not being a commercial bank, POSBank cannot offer the

full  range of services such as fixed deposits, foreign currency

deposits,  asset  management services and so on.   At  the  same

time,  it is facing tough competition in its core business,  ie,

its  deposit-gathering business, which it is  not  in  a  strong

position to counter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSBank's depositors have become more sophisticated. As other

banking  avenues have opened up, they are much more  aware  that

they may be better served elsewhere.  For instance, when the gap

in  interest  rates  on  savings deposits  between  POSBank  and

commercial  banks  increased last year,  these  depositors  were

quick to move their deposits to the commercial banks.

Government  has  concluded that the idea of a  limited  function

savings  bank is largely out of step with the times.  There  can

be  a continuing role for POSBank, but only if it is competitive

with full banks.  We believe that enabling it to compete as a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>

full  bank  via  merger with DBS is the best way forward.   This

would   enable  Government  to  lift  the  fetters   that   have

constrained  its  operations and distorted  market  signals  and

consumer behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also useful to note that most developed countries, and

many  of  our Asian counterparts, no longer operate post  office

savings banks or national savings banks. The list includes  USA,

Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Norway

and  Germany's national savings banks are also being privatised,

with  commercial banks likely to take control.  In  the  region,

only  India,  Japan and Thailand still operate national  savings

banks.

<br><br><i>Transitional arrangements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax exemption on POSBank deposits is one example of how the

constraints  on  POSBank,  built up over  time,  had  led  to  a

situation where our regulations increasingly risked losing their

original purpose.  The reason for granting POSBank's tax  exempt

status was to encourage small depositors to save.  However, over

the  years, personal income tax rates have been brought down  to

such a degree that nowadays, most small depositors no longer pay

any  income  tax, and so do not benefit from the tax  exemption.

POSBank's data show that some 85% of their depositors do not pay

income  tax.   The tax exemption therefore ended  up  benefiting

only  15%  of  POSBank's  depositor base,  primarily  the  large

depositors with high income and high marginal income tax  rates.

This is not the group that the tax exempt status was intended to

help.   We  are therefore no longer serving the original  policy

intent.    To  compound  the  problem,  Government  had  imposed

constraints  on POSBank's investment and lending  activities  in

the  belief that POSBank's tax exempt status should not unfairly

disadvantage  the  commercial  banks.   This  led   to   product

limitation,  low  savings  interest  rates,  and   a   lack   of

alternative  uses  for its deposits. This in  turn  resulted  in

Credit  POSB  pricing its mortgages below market rates,  in  its

drive  to  gain market share within POSBank's limited  scope  of

business.  In

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>

effect,  the  good  intentions of  the  tax  exempt  status  had

resulted  in Government providing subsidised mortgage  financing

for private housing. This was not Government's intention.  There

is little public policy justification for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that these market distortions have to

go.    However,  to  ease  the  burden  of  adjustment  in  this

privatisation  exercise,  we  are taking  care  to  ensure  that

painful  disruptions for POSBank's depositors and borrowers  are

minimised.   We therefore set out a transitional arrangement  to

help all parties adjust over time.   For depositors, the removal

of  tax exemption will be phased over a period of six years;  it

will be entirely removed only from 1st January 2005 onwards.  To

ease  the  burden  of  adjustment for  existing  borrowers,  the

Government  has  asked  DBS  to maintain  the  differential  gap

between POSBank and DBS mortgage rates of between 1.5% and 1.75%

until the end of 1999, and thereafter to close it gradually over

a  three-year  period.  This four-year transition is  more  than

fair.

<br><br><i>No better alternative to merging with DBS</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A viable future for POSBank requires it to be competitive with

full  banks.  But the financial services environment today is  a

very  tough  place. With rapid developments in the  variety  and

complexity  of  financial  products,  banks  can  only   compete

effectively by having the strength to carry increased market and

currency  risks,  and  larger asset size to  reap  economies  of

scale. This is why the Government has been encouraging our local

banks  to  consolidate.  Within this framework,  it  makes  most

sense for POSBank to merge with a successful local bank than  to

strike out on its own.  This route would best enable it to serve

its  customers better.  This would of course also help  set  the

pace for the other banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS was a natural choice as the most suitable partner for

POSBank.  Since the Government is a major shareholder of DBS, it

can  be  more  confident that DBS will preserve  the  spirit  of

POSBank's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>

social  responsibilities.  The merger  will  at  the  same  time

significantly   strengthen  Singapore's   banking   sector   for

international competition.

<br><br><i>Specific provisions of the Bill</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now proceed to explain the specific key provisions

of the Bill, which are:

<br><br><i>(a)   Clauses 3 and 18: Transfer/Dissolution dates</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the usual practice of dissolving the statutory

board  and  simultaneously  transferring  all  the  assets   and

liabilities to the successor company, the transfer date and  the

dissolution  date will be distinct. This is to allow  Government

to  comply  with  Presidential safeguards on the  protection  of

reserves, which will be covered in the Second Reading speech  on

the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No.  2)

Bill.

<br><br><i>(b)  Clause 4(3): Excluded assets and liabilities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS will not be taking over all the undertakings of POSBank in

this transaction. There will be some assets and liabilities left

with the Government, including the POSBank Tower and some equity

and  bond  investments. DBS has asked the Government  to  retain

POSBank Tower, which is still under construction, as DBS has  no

need  for another large Headquarters Building. The equities  and

bonds  held back by the Government are to enable DBS  to  comply

with  section  31  of the Banking Act, which requires  that  the

investments  of  a  bank should not exceed 40%  of  its  capital

funds.  The  assets retained by Government amount  to  about  $1

billion.  The list to be specified under this clause spells  out

the  assets  and  liabilities that are  being  retained  by  the

Government;  all  other assets and liabilities will  legally  be

transferred to DBS.

<br><br><i>(c)   Clause  7(7):  Supplementary provisions on disclosure of information</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secrecy provisions contained in section 47 of the Banking

Act,  which  does  not apply to POSBank prior to  the  transfer,

forbids banks to reveal any information on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>

their  customers' accounts, unless, among other conditions,  the

customer  or  his  personal representatives  had  given  written

permission  to do so.  Therefore, POSBank's terms and conditions

for  its  accounts  as  well as Credit POSB's  loan  agreements,

unlike the commercial banks, generally do not contain disclosure

authorisation  clauses.  The POSBank accounts, including  Credit

POSB's  loan portfolio, to be transferred to DBS will be subject

to  this provision.  Like most banks, DBS obtains its customers'

written  consent as a standard feature in its account  documents

and  loan  agreements.   To put POSBank customers  on  the  same

footing  as  existing  DBS customers, DBS  can  write  to  every

POSBank  customer to seek written permission, but  it  would  be

obviously  impractical to do so.  There  is  no  guarantee  that

these  customers  will agree or even bother  to  reply  to  give

consent.    This  clause  therefore  allows  DBS   to   disclose

information  only  for the administration of POSBank  customers'

accounts,  and only insofar as it is in line with DBS'  existing

practice.   I should point out that in practice, this clause  is

not  a  material change because POSBank has had,  and  has  been

disclosing  such  information to third parties all  these  years

where  required in the normal course of its work.  The  proposed

amendment  essentially  ensures  that  DBS  would  be  able   to

administer the POSBank accounts after the transfer, in a  manner

which   complies   with  the  Banking  Act  and   with   minimal

inconvenience  to  POSBank's 3 million customers,  so  that  the

transfer of POSBank to DBS is as seamless as possible.

<br><br><i>(d)       Clause 8: Staff provisions.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with other privatisation exercises, all POSBank and

Credit POSB staff would cross over to DBS at existing terms  and

conditions of service.  DBS has stated that, as far as possible,

it  will retain and re-train POSBank staff, to provide them with

better prospects and broader career opportunities.

<br><br><i>(e)       Clause 15: Consideration shares.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS' purchase consideration would be offered to the

Government in the form of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>

non-voting preference shares, instead of ordinary voting shares.

These preference shares enjoy the same dividend rate as ordinary

shares.   They  will  not be listed on the Stock  Exchange,  but

would  be convertible to ordinary shares which can then be sold.

However,  the  Government has committed not to sell  the  shares

until  2002  at  the earliest.  The preference  shares  will  be

convertible on a 60(Local):40(Foreign) ratio so as not to  upset

the existing Local/Foreign tranche balance.

<br><br><i>(f)       Clause 18: Repeal of the POSBank Act.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will repeal most sections of the existing POSBank

Act  with  effect  from  the Transfer  Date.   However,  certain

sections  of  the Act will still be retained, and will  only  be

repealed  upon  POSBank's Dissolution Date.  This  is  to  allow

POSBank to remain as a shell statutory board to see through  the

disposal  of its residual assets and to finalise any  management

issues remaining.

<br><br><i>(g)        Clause 19 and the Schedule: Consequential amendments to other laws.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax Act will be amended to allow for the

extension of tax exemption on POSBank savings deposits, for both

existing and new POSBank accounts.  Consequential amendments are

also made to other Acts.

Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the object of this

Bill  is to implement the Government's decision to allow DBS  to

buy  POSBank.  As explained by the Minister, this move to  merge

the   two  large  Government-owned  financial  institutions   is

motivated  by the desire to create a new super Singaporean  bank

to  support  and  spearhead the plan  to  push  Singapore  as  a

regional  financial centre.  My view is that this objective  can

be  supported.  A larger, better capitalised Singapore bank will

therefore  have  better  resources to compete  in  the  regional

markets.  Local depositors will also get to enjoy a wider  range

of financial services and facilities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the merger of POSBank with DBS will mean the

dissolution  of  one  of  the most loved and  trusted  financial

institutions  in Singapore.  The POSBank has been  a  symbol  or

icon  of  the  virtue  of thrift in Singapore.   We  lament  the

passing  of  this powerful icon of thrift for Singaporeans.   We

can recall the days in the seventies when as young students,  we

were  encouraged by our schools and parents to save a little  of

our  daily pocket money and deposit them into POSBank.  Over the

years, we have learnt to save and put out trust in POSBank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger of DBS and POSBank would mean that a larger bank

will serve the local depositors.  But I would like to point  out

that  a  larger  bank  does  not necessarily  equate  to  better

facilities  or  a  safer  bank  for  depositors.   Allow  me  to

elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there will be better resources and with more

advanced  computer technology, the enlarged DBS can create  more

services and facilities.  However, many of the original  POSBank

customers, especially the older folks, would not go near an  ATM

and  they  would prefer their monies to be put and  recorded  in

POSBank  passbooks, instead of holding them as  passcards  which

they  cannot read and see.  The POSBank customers are also quite

satisfied  with the service provided by the friendly  smiles  of

the  POSBank tellers and the 133 conveniently located  branches.

This large pool of housewives and older folks do not need better

services.   They are indeed very happy enough with  the  present

services of POSBank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also does not mean that a super bank is a safer bank.

Super  banks  can make super mistakes.  There were instances  of

large  banks  around the world, eg, in America,  Europe,  Japan,

where they have to be rescued by the government on the brink  of

collapse.  Hence, many of our local depositors see the  POSBank,

which is Government-owned and Government-backed, as a AAA credit-rated  savings bank that they can trust fully.  Now the enlarged

DBS  may  not  give  them the same sense of  security.   POSBank

depositors do not mind the slightly lower

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>

interest  rates  in  return  for  better  security  and   better

convenience, and they can sleep well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reported in the press, DBS' acquisition of POSBank has

raised two main concerns.  One is the possibility of higher home

loan  interest rates and the loss of the Government's  guarantee

on  deposits  which  POSBank offers.  The Minister  has  just  a

moment  ago  explained  how DBS will take  certain  measures  to

alleviate the above worries of depositors.  I hope the  Minister

can do more.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Post Office Savings Bank is an

institution  in  Singapore  which  is  synonymous  with  saving.

Saving  is, of course, a virtue which the State should inculcate

among its citizens.  The State wants its citizens to save.  That

is  why it gives incentives for people to save.  The deposits in

the POSBank accounts are tax exempt up to a limit.  Almost every

man  in  the street in Singapore in his lifetime has  a  POSBank

savings  account.  But with the merger, the image of the POSBank

as  the  people's  bank  shall be taken away.   The  tax  exempt

concession  enjoyed by Singaporeans for the last 26 years  shall

also come to an end, except for those below 21 years of age  and

those  who  are  serving National Service.  This concession  has

very little benefit because most of those who are below 21 years

of  age have not started working.  As for those serving National

Service, their NS pay is very low.  Hence, even if they save the

whole  of their NS allowance, the amount of interest accrued  is

very little.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the tax concession given to those below 21

years  of  age  and  those serving NS is insignificant  and  not

meaningful.  The people who are most unhappy are the people  who

have taken loans from Credit POSB to buy homes of their own  and

future purchasers of property for their own use.  The POSBank is

a  source  of  cheap  funds for people who want  to  purchase  a

property.  The difference of interest rate between that  offered

by  Credit  POSB and the commercial bank is about 1.5%.   Credit

POSB's rate is lower than the commercial banks' rate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the high property prices, up to January of last

year,  the  amounts borrowed by home purchasers are  very  high.

The  monthly  interest paid is correspondingly high.   The  home

owners have to seek loans from private commercial banks when the

grace  period  given by Credit POSB ends on 31st December  2002,

and they have to pay substantially more.  It was reported in the

Straits  Times  of 28th July 1998 that home owners  had  to  pay

between  $78 and $103 more a month for every $100,000 loan  when

Credit  POSB's  cheap  housing loans are  phased  out  by  2002,

provided interest rates remain the same.  Those who have taken a

25 or 30 years' loan shall be the most hard hit as their monthly

repayment amounts are higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic downturn and property values have also

nose-dived,  the banks are not going to show magnanimity.   They

want  their customers to top up or make bigger monthly repayment

amounts.  In one Straits Times' report, a borrower was asked  by

the  bank  to  pay  $4,000 more each  month.   This  may  be  an

exception  but such horror stories go to make people aware  that

once property prices fall, all kinds of hardship can occur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the bad economic situation, I would urge

the  Minister  to  extend  the grace period  of  increasing  the

interest rates of Credit POSB to those of the commercial ones to

six years rather than four years.

As  regards  the  purchase of POSBank  by  DBS,  newspapers  had

commented  that DBS got POSBank rather cheaply at $1.6  billion.

The  purchase price paid by DBS for POSBank is 1.37 times of its

tangible  asset  value, and this is said to be below  the  norm,

which  is  about  2 to 2.5 times for banks.  I  would  like  the

Minister to comment on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister why is the takeover of

POSBank  taking place at this point of time.  Has DBS  lost  too

much money in its overseas investments and needed help?  We  all

know that POSBank has about $25 billion of depositors' cash.  Is

DBS  eyeing  that  amount of money to bail  itself  out  of  its

losses?  I wish the Minister could enlighten us.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me

this  opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I am in support of  the

Bill,  although I have some reservations with some clauses which

I will come to later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed merger of the Post Office Savings Bank with

the  Development  Bank of Singapore has drawn a  great  deal  of

public interest.  This is because POSBank has been regarded as a

national  institution.  Though the Act came into being  only  25

years ago, the institution has existed for almost a century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us remember starting our savings through the Post

Office  bank accounts.  In the early days, we used to buy stamps

and  we would stick them to a book.  Of course, new Members  may

not  realise it, but this is the way we were encouraged to save.

Sir, a larger question that the House would be interested in  is

that,   in  the  interest  of  the  financial  institutions   in

Singapore  and  the  banking industry in  particular  -  I  have

mentioned this earlier and I reiterate - we should have not more

than  two to three banks, and the signal should be sent  to  the

other  banks  that they should consider merging in  the  greater

interest  of financial institutions in Singapore. This trend  is

seen all over the world, in USA and Japan.  In fact, recently in

India, there was a report on banking. They too encourage merger.

I  think it is timely. Of course, I share some of the grievances

Mr Chiam has mentioned earlier.  I urge the Minister to consider

the grace period.  He has asked for six years.  I think it is  a

fair figure.  At least it should be more than four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, members of the public have asked why is there a need

to  have  this merger now.  Is it to bolster the DBS'  financial

position?  The Minister should state the position to this  House

so  that, once and for all, we have these doubts cleared in  the

minds of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question which many people have asked is why did

Post  Office  Savings  Bank  go with  DBS,  and  why  not  other

commercial  banks.  This is like a marriage. You do not  propose

yourself to many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>

suitors.  You  look for suitors and then decide.  Both  of  them

share  a  common background, being Government-linked  companies.

So  I do not see any wrong. In fact, it is quite appropriate for

these two institutions to merge and the public should take it in

this spirit.  I am sure when the other banks are going to merge,

they  would  merge with those banks which are near and  dear  to

them.  They are not going to marry somebody who is not close  to

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another aspect which I would urge the

Minister  to  convey to DBS. I have been a user of  Post  Office

Savings Bank, and the friendly service is something which I hope

would  be  continued  by DBS so that the man-in-the-street  will

find the service as good, if not better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to join

in the debate on the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed a pity to dissolve POSBank. POSBank has

tremendous historical value, a long history, and a lot of people

are  associated with it.  If you ask the account holders whether

POSBank should be closed, I can tell you that they will say that

it  should be kept going.  And I feel, at this stage, it is more

important to see that we do not short-change the account holders

of POSBank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are about 3 million POSBank account holders and

that  is  a tremendous following which we should recognise.   We

also  know  that POSBank has been making money and  for  a  bank

which has been making money, I do not understand the reason  why

it  should  be  closed down.  I could understand  the  need  for

amalgamation.   But  if  we  so  decide  to  amalgamate,  it  is

important  to  look  at this transition to  ensure  that  the  3

million  account  holders  are to an extent  supported  and  the

transition does not bring serious impact on them and  they  will

support  the change.  This is a crucial issue that the  Minister

should  look  into.   I see that there are many  people  in  the

working  class  who  are  associated  with  POSBank  and   their

sentiments

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>

and loyalty should be appreciated.  I hope DBS will continue  to

provide the same service and maintain the relationship that  has

been  established with many people in the working class who  are

account holders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSBank, as Members know, has a very wide reach. It

reaches  the  old,  the young, and the housewives  in  the  many

housing  estates.   And I hope that with this amalgamation,  DBS

would be able to find the same reach to the neigbourhoods in the

housing estates.  There are concerns that the reach may  not  be

there  and  it may cause dislocation, particularly to the  older

account  holders,  and the young ones too.  POSBank  has  become

very  visible.  If you move around the various housing  estates,

you  will find POSBank in many locations, and that is the widest

reach that we should look at.  That would be the objectives  for

which banks should strive to meet and it is important to look at

the dislocation it would cause as a result of this change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several implications that one needs to pay

attention  to.   One is the service charge, ie, whether  service

charge  to  small account holders could be reviewed and  whether

DBS could be advised that the service charge would not be raised

unnecessarily at the expense of the small account holders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, housing loan. It is very important to examine

the  housing  loan issue because many of those  who  have  taken

housing  loans with the expectation that loan changes would  not

be  that  dramatic.  I personally feel that  the  terms  of  the

housing  loans  of  these  people  should  be  honoured.     The

agreement  which they have entered with Credit  POSB  should  be

honoured by DBS itself, at least for a longer period.  For these

people, there should be no changes in loan terms which have been

accorded by Credit POSB. That I think would be keeping  in  good

faith with these people who have taken their housing loans  with

Credit POSB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is to ensure that the banking service to

ordinary account holders, particularly the old, young and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>

children,  would not be displaced as a result of these  changes.

I  hope  that  would  be  taken into  serious  account  in  this

transition.  The Minister should ensure that DBS looks into  the

question  of support for the ordinary account holders  who  have

given well-established support over a long period of time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I rise to support

the  Bill.  I am pleased that, despite the trying times that our

economy is going through, the Government  has the foresight  and

determination to ensure that Singapore comes out of this  crisis

stronger  and better able to meet the challenges of the changing

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commercialisation of POSBank is timely as it forces our

GLCs  and our banking system to be more efficient, enabling  the

domestic  market  to employ capital more effectively  so  as  to

compete on the same footing as the larger players in the  global

market.   We  cannot afford to allow subsidies in  the  cost  of

capital  to  distort investment decisions of our  GLCs  or  even

purchase  considerations of individuals financing  their  homes.

Our  GLCs  would  have  to be able to make commercial  decisions

based  on market realities so as to realise their full potential

and  not  be  molly-coddled  by  easy  access  to  cheap  funds.

Similarly, cheaper access to credit from Credit POSB could  have

contributed to the present housing market over-shooting  in  the

mid-1990s with the resultant effect being a drag on the  economy

and on the individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In specific, Sir, the resultant DBS-POSBank entity would

have  the capacity to undertake larger projects as Asia rebuilds

itself  and serves as a spur to encourage other Singapore  banks

to  consolidate in line with the global trends in the  financial

industry.   It  is indeed critical that for Singapore  to  be  a

major  financial  centre, we should have the  infrastructure  in

place  and  the underlying efficiency in our domestic banks  and

the  capital markets to cater for this development. The sale  of

POSBank  to DBS would serve as a catalyst and as a spring  board

for faster progress in these fields.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some disquiet over the specifics relating to

the  sale  of  POSBank to DBS.  Most of the public concerns  are

with  regard to the possible rise in the cost of servicing their

Credit  POSB  mortgages.  I am appreciative that the  Government

has  mandated  DBS  to start re-pricing the  mortgage  rates  to

market  levels only from the end of 1999 onwards over  the  next

three  years, as the Minister has explained.  Effectively,  this

allows  for  a  four-year transition period and  presumably  the

Minister is assuming that economic recovery will happen, perhaps

in the Year 2000, for this transition period to take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By removing subsidies across all levels and benefiting the

majority  of POSBank depositors, the Government has indeed  been

very  astute  in nipping a potential problem in  the  bud.  This

could ensure that our financial system remains strong, our banks

remain  healthy and we can thus avoid the pitfalls of  potential

bank  failures that are dragging down some of the  economies  in

the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, given that there is no clear end to the current

economic crisis, I want to ask the Minister whether it would  be

possible  to  have perhaps a caveat or provision put  in  place.

That   caveat  or  provision  is  that  the  present   four-year

transition period will hold, subject to a review at the  end  of

1999  whereupon, if the economic crisis worsens or deepens,  and

if  economic  recovery  is  further  delayed,  then  extend  the

transition  period accordingly, beyond four years,  maybe  five,

six,  seven or eight years.  I believe this would alleviate some

of the present concerns of the public over the commercialisation

of POSBank as it would be a clear indication that the Government

is prepared to be flexible should circumstances require.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, whilst the Bill deals extensively with the transfer of

business  undertakings to DBS, there is no mention in  the  Bill

with regard to the tenure of employment for employees of POSBank

save  to  say  that the existing employment contracts  would  be

continuing under the DBS entity.  Would the Minister consider it

necessary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>

to include provisions in the Bill for POSBank employees in order

to  safeguard  their  employment interests  in  this  period  of

uncertainty,  at  least for a minimum period of  one  year,  ie,

would the Minister ensure that these POSB employees would not be

retrenched  for  at  least a period of one  year  following  the

merger of the two banks?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Minister has said that POSBank was offered only to

DBS  as  the  latter bank was the natural choice  because  of  a

common  denominator - Government ownership.  May I suggest  that

the  Minister  give  a  full explanation on  this,  because  the

concern  of  the  public, the citizens at  large,  is  that  the

Government  could  have  obtained a  higher  price  for  POSBank

through a more transparent and open tender system, and this will

benefit the majority of the taxpayers.  Would the Minister  shed

more light on this?

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister has given us

a  compelling  economic case for the acquisition of  POSBank  by

DBS.  Liberalisation of the financial services sector under  the

auspices  of  WTO and information technology will  redefine  the

nature  of banking and the recent mega-mergers in North  America

and  Europe  are  symptomatic of these changes.   Therefore,  an

entity  with  the  combined strength of  DBS  and  POSBank  will

certainly  be in a better position to compete in this brave  new

world  of  financial services.  And that is why I  support  this

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothwithstanding, these forceful cerebral arguments, it is

with  a  tinge of sadness and nostalgia that I join this debate.

Indeed, the Minister's speech sounded much like a requiem for  a

national  institution.  POSBank, as many of my  colleagues  have

already  said, has been an indelible part of Singaporeans'  life

and  it has offered a friendly and non-threatening face in  what

would  otherwise be a cool, if not cold, world of banking.   And

this  has encouraged many, including the young and perhaps those

not so accustomed to the world of finance, to take up savings.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of POSBank by DBS begs the question how the

Government  can  ensure that savings and thrift continue  to  be

promoted amongst Singaporeans, particularly the young.   One  of

the  key lessons of the current regional economic crisis is  the

value  of  savings and the habit of thrift.  We can  argue  that

Singaporeans  are  more sophisticated but even in  sophisticated

economies, saving is not a necessary factor of their lives.   It

is  important  that we continue to imbue our  young  with  these

values.  I do not mean to suggest that commercial banks  do  not

do  this but this is not their raison d'etre.  After all, we  do

not  hear  commercial banks telling us or urging us to save  for

tomorrow because tomorrow is worth saving for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point of tax exemption and the liberalisation of

mortgage  rates,  as  I  understand it, tax  exemption  will  be

completely  lifted  from  1st January 2005.   Tax  exemption  on

interest earned on POSBank savings deposits will continue on all

deposits till the end of December 2001 and thereafter,  it  will

be extended to the first $100,000 in the balance of each POSBank

savings  account depositor.  This means that this merged  entity

will  enjoy a subsidy of sorts from the Government till the  end

of 2004, albeit at reducing levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Credit POSB's home loan mortgage rates

will  be  allowed to gradually rise to competitive market  rates

from 1st January 2000.  Sir, I wonder whether it is not possible

for  Credit  POSB's  mortgage rates to be sustained  at  current

levels vis-a-vis DBS' commercial rates, at least until the first

tier  of  tax  exemption is removed on 1st January 2002.   After

all, I think the bank enjoys a certain subsidy and it seems  out

of sync that, on the one hand, the banks receive a subsidy which

will   be  gradually  removed  but,  on  the  other  hand,   the

liberalisation of its mortgage rates is executed  much  earlier.

I would appreciate it if the Minister could comment on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to declare my interest as an employee of

Temasek Holdings.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support this Bill.  Nevertheless, there are some concerns  which

I  would like to raise for the Minister's consideration  in  the

implementation of the provisions of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of the POSBank will be a social and historical

milestone.  Singaporeans will have many sentimental memories  of

POSBank,  which has been the national savings bank for  decades.

Set  up by the British in 1877, it was operated as an arm of the

Post  Office and intended to be the poor man's bank.  The modern

POSBank began on 11th July 1966 with an initial staff of 35  and

became  a statutory board in 1972.  It played an important  role

in  the shaping of Singapore as we see it today, particularly in

amassing  the  small savings of individuals in the whole  nation

for  the  building of national infrastructure.  As  some  of  my

colleagues  have  also  pointed out,  the  POSBank  was  a  non-intimidating place in the neighbourhood where those without very

much  money could go in to obtain banking services without  fear

of embarrassment, humilation or having to be sophisticated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank's objective was clearly defined in 1872 as, "to

encourage those in receipt of small incomes to practise  economy

by  affording them a safe investment for small amounts at a fair

rate  of interest, and also of affording borrowers opportunities

of  obtaining  loans  at  lower  rates  of  interest  than  were

procurable from other sources."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Post Office Savings Bank Act, which will be

repealed today if the Bill is passed, the principal objective of

the  Bank shall be "to provide means for the deposit of  savings

and  encourage  thrift;  to mobilise domestic  savings  for  the

purpose  of  public  development ."   The  corporate  policy  of

POSBank  has  been  reaching  a  maximum  number  of  people  by

providing  services and incentives in a number of areas  related

to  the  promotion of the savings habit.  Basic banking services

are  made easily accessible to the public and convenience to the

consumer  is  a  cornerstone of that policy, with  branches  and

automated teller machines (ATMs) in practically every corner  of

Singapore  and  especially in the Housing and Development  Board

estates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1983 actually, the Government had already

considered  converting the POSBank into a full commercial  bank.

However, after a review, the plan was not proceeded with, as  it

was  not in the national interest then.  Throughout its history,

the  POSBank  has  been  a  key  institution  of  our  financial

industry,  innovating and pushing the development  of  services,

such  as the ubiquitous ATM we have now and the NETS card,  when

the  commercial banks were cautious, reluctant or  perhaps  even

apathetic to the use of new technology and services.  They  were

able  to  see  the wider national interest untrammelled  by  the

desire  of  their shareholders to minimise risk  and  costs  and

maximise profit; and they had vast resources to implement  their

dreams.   If one were to look at this solution that is proposed,

we  could  actually  view  this as the final  sacrifice  of  the

POSBank  for  the national interest to make our Singapore  banks

fit  to  fight the wars that are coming up in the global economy

that  is broadening.  But perhaps it is still necessary for some

institution  that  could serve this role of a  catalyst  in  the

banking  industry  to prod and goad the other banks  into  doing

things  that  they  perhaps  are reluctant  to  do  for  various

reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for the acquisition of the POSBank by DBS have been

mentioned by the Minister.  Effectively, the Minister says  that

there  are two choices: one is to amend the Post Office  Savings

Bank Act to give the Post Office Savings Bank wider latitude  to

offer  full banking services; and the other is to merge  with  a

commercial  bank because in this world that we  have  now,  size

does matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives laid down by the Minister in his speech are

laudable  objectives, but this does not mean that the objectives

of  the  POSBank  I have enumerated earlier are irrelevant  now.

The  POSBank  may  need to re-engineer itself  in  the  national

interest for the new millennium and the era of the international

mega-banks.   But we must find alternative sources  of  low-cost

loans  and  safe investments for the millions of  small  account

holders, the 92,000 small and medium enterprises and the  23,000

hawkers and other sundry shopkeepers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>

and  stallholders.  For these people, the POSBank has met  their

needs  very well and these are not very sophisticated needs  and

they see no reason to dissolve the POSBank.  There is after  all

still  a  social objective that a national institution like  the

POSBank can serve, the social initiative of promoting thrift and

saving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to educate the public on the existence of

the  other  financial institutions which we  have  and  which  I

believe will be more than happy to move into the gap left by the

POSBank.   These are the institutions such as NTUC Income,  NTUC

Thrift  and Loan Society and the numerous other thrift and  loan

societies,   credit  unions  and  cooperatives   in   Singapore.

Alternative  financial institutions like these  should  also  be

promoted,  allowed to expand if need be, be given tax exemptions

and  the  rules  for their setting up liberalised  so  that  the

original  objectives  of  the  POSBank,  ie,  promoting  thrift,

savings,  safe  investments and low-cost  loans  for  the  small

income  earners,  all  these  would  remain  possible  in  these

troubled economic times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to its impact on the employees of the POSBank, I am glad to

note  that  clause 8 of the Bill provides that  these  employees

will be absorbed into DBS on the same terms as they received  in

the POSBank.  This is important as they had many of the benefits

of  statutory board employees which they will now lose with  the

merger if not for clause 8.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another concern which is not reflected in the Bill and

this relates to the down-sizing and possible retrenchment of the

POSBank  employees, as some of my colleagues in this House  have

mentioned.  I hope the Minister will assure this House  that  no

undue  economic hardship will be laid on the shoulders of  these

employees.  Besides retraining them for new jobs, perhaps a  job

placement  service could also be initiated to  assist  in  their

transition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laud the Minister for the various plans he has already put in

place to phase in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>

the changes such as higher commercial lending rates and the loss

of  tax  exemption,  and  for gingerly  balancing  the  national

interest  against the interest of the small account holders  and

small  businessmen, so as to smoothen the unhappiness and sorrow

at losing a  key national institution which, in the public mind,

has  not  lost its relevance yet.  But I wish to call  for  more

practical steps to allay the fears of consumers that they  would

soon  be  put in severe financial straits and be made  bankrupt.

One way to do this may be to allow the novation or assignment of

the  POSBank  loans to selected thrift and loan societies  where

the  circumstances permit it, rather than force all the accounts

to be transferred to DBS.  This gives the consumer the choice of

the financial institution he wishes now to put his trust in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future, Mr Speaker, Sir, is a frightening prospect, and even

big  banks  in  other countries have collapsed, as  some  of  my

colleagues have mentioned in their earlier speeches.  I urge the

Minister to ease the pain for the POSBank small account  holders

and  employees.  Ease them gently into the dark night that  they

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of the POSBank came as a surprise to most

Singaporeans.   For the keen observers of the financial  sector,

this acquisition may have been anticipated once the Keppel Bank-Tat  Lee  Bank merger was announced.  A merger of smaller  banks

and  the  bigger ones is also the new paradigm of the  financial

services  review  that  is  being spearheaded  by  Deputy  Prime

Minister.  Given the global mega-merger of big banks, one cannot

go  against the trend if banks in Singapore are to survive.  The

merger of the Dutch POSBank with NMB Bank and subsequently  with

Nationale  Netherland to form the ING group in  Europe  and  the

Travellers Group with Citibank in America are examples  of  this

global trend.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discussed this subject with Dr Wang Kai Yuen, who is a

board  member of the POSBank since 1987, and he communicated  to

me  many of his views, and I share his views.  They are all very

valuable.   So  some of the comments that I make here  are  also

shared by Dr Wang.  I have heard comments that the Government by

selling POSBank has given up its role in promoting the habit  of

saving  amongst Singaporeans.  I do not agree with that  as  the

promotion of the saving habit is already deeply enshrined in our

CPF  policy.  To promote saving in the form of a savings account

is a task that now rests on the shoulders of the private sector.

In  its public statements, Mr  Dhanabalan, the Chairman of  DBS,

has  said  that POSBank will continue in this role by  providing

basic  banking  services  at affordable  charges.   Indeed,  for

children,  students  and  full-time national  servicemen,  these

services will be free.  Moreover, I would like to point out that

the idea of privatising an organisation like POSBank is not new.

There  is a global trend, as more and more governments  find  it

more  efficient to focus on the business of the government while

privatising  other  functions such  as  running  their  national

savings bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1980s, the idea of corporatising POSBank was

actively  evaluated.   It  received  strong  support  from   the

management  and  staff  of the bank.  I believe  this  idea  was

scuttled when it met strong opposition from the local commercial

banks  who felt that a corporatised POSBank would provide unfair

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Singaporeans, on first hearing of the acquisition of

POSBank  by DBS, lamented the demise of POSBank.  Paradoxically,

this is also the strongest endorsement of the Bank.  POSBank has

been  relentless  in  its  pursuit to  provide  outstanding  and

convenient  service  to all its customers, including  the  small

depositors.   From a discussion with Dr Wang, I learned  that  a

third  of POSBank's customers, including children, students  and

foreign  workers, have deposits of $100 or less.  In fact,  over

90%  of POSBank's deposit base is contributed by only 20% of the

customers.  Therefore,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>

POSBank's accounts are being subsidised.  Moreover, the cost  of

servicing these accounts has been escalating all these years, as

costs  of  ATMs,  staff and premises have gone up  relentlessly.

POSBank  could  not  have  gone  on  subsidizing  such  a  large

proportion of its depositors.  The House might be interested  to

know  that  the  Bank had been considering  for  some  time  the

recovery  of  a portion of these costs from its customers.  Some

measures  have already been taken, for example, GIRO charges  on

service providers and charge for coin exchange.  More were being

contemplated.  As I have indicated earlier, whether  POSBank  is

merged  or  not,  the days of free services  from  POSBank  were

numbered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the POSBank has been outstanding in providing

service,  it has not been able to match the commercial banks  in

providing its depositors with a better rate of return.  This  is

so  because the investment avenues open to POSBank were severely

limited  by  the  Ministry of Finance which is  not  surprising,

because the deposits are guaranteed by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect customers' funds, the investments had to be safe

and these usually yielded lower returns.  The interest earned by

POSBank's  customers is tax-free.  To level the  playing  field,

POSBank  penalised  its  bigger  customers  by  giving  a  lower

interest  rate  for  deposits in excess of  $100,000.   This  is

counter intuitive if the goal is to attract more customers  with

bigger  deposits.  This principle was laid down by the  Ministry

of  Finance in 1978 and remained unchanged for nearly 20  years.

Meanwhile,   the  environment  has  changed.   Tax   rates   for

individuals  have  come  down.  Taxes have  gone  up.  What  was

considered  a  lot of money in the past is no longer  that  much

today.  Singaporeans  have become more  sophisticated  in  their

banking  needs.  There are also more investment options open  to

them.  Therefore, POSBank's two-tier interest rate structure was

reversed  in  the earlier part of this year, the better  reward,

the  bigger  depositors.  Not responding to changes  would  have

been suicidal in today's most competitive environment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a statutory board, POSBank has been constrained in its

response  to  changes. The growing financial  sophistication  of

Singaporeans  and  POSBank's limited product range  has  already

reduced  its market share of deposits.  If this trend continues,

the  Bank's relevance in the lives of Singaporeans will diminish

over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major complaints from Singaporeans regarding the

acquisition of POSBank is the prospect of paying higher mortgage

rates  for  their  Credit  POSB's  housing  loans.   The  merger

agreement stipulated a time-table for the mortgage rates to move

progressively towards the market levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to Dr Wang who told me that the difference between

the  rate of Credit POSB and that of DBS today is between  1.25%

and  1.5%.   As  the  loan base of Credit  POSB  is  about  $7.6

billion,  this could potentially mean an additional  revenue  in

the  region of between $95 million and $114 million per year for

DBS  if the rates were completely equalised.  I mention Dr  Wang

here because he had to go to Hong Kong with DPM.  Therefore,  he

is  not  in  this House.  So some of the points I have mentioned

here were also his.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who have borrowed from Credit POSB, including Dr

Wang  himself, will feel the pinch of the higher mortgage rates.

However,  we should consider this fact.  Most of the  depositors

of  POSBank  live in HDB flats. They obtain their housing  loans

from HDB. All the borrowers of Credit POSB are owners of private

properties,  like condominiums and landed-properties.   Mr  Fong

Yong Kian, Press Secretary to the Minister for Finance, gave the

following figures in the Straits Times Forum Page reply of  20th

August 1998:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The average Credit POSB loan is $460,000. Out of the

10,900  granted  in  the last two years,  1,650  loans  exceeded

$750,000 or 650 exceeded $1 million."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Fong that there is no justification for the

Government to provide these borrowers mortgage loans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>

at below market rates.  I think it is hard to argue the merit of

maintaining the lower than market interest rates of Credit  POSB

which  benefit private property owners and give a  higher  yield

for their depositors who are largely HDB residents.  There is an

argument  that  lower  mortgage rates help Singaporeans  to  own

homes.   But  we  must bear in mind that these Singaporeans  are

already in the higher income bracket.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share Dr Toh See Kiat's concern. Because POSBank is

a  statutory  board  it could place national interest  ahead  of

commercial  considerations in many of its operational decisions.

For  instance, it has always taken the lead to bring innovations

and introduce IT to banking in Singapore.  POSBank was the first

local  bank to computerise its savings accounts records, thereby

paving the way for on-line banking.  POSBank introduced GIRO  to

Singapore in 1974, and direct salary crediting as early as 1972.

POSBank pioneered the concept of the self-service banking, being

the  first  local bank to introduce the ATM in 1979, a  passbook

updating facility in 1993, and a cheque book dispenser in  1995.

Even  now,  POSBank is piloting a three-in-one ATM which  allows

cash   deposits  and  passbook  updating  in  addition  to  cash

withdrawals,  all  in one machine.  In this way,  POSBank  is  a

prime  mover  of  new banking innovations and performs  national

service.   I  am concerned that in future no banking institution

will  be playing this catalyst role.  This is important.  Unless

we  keep  on  harnessing technology to innovate and improve  our

productivity,   we   run   the  real  danger   of   losing   our

competitiveness and not achieving our objective of becoming  the

premier financial centre in this part of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by extending my deepest

appreciation  to the POSBank staff, past and present,  who  have

built  up the Bank from its humble beginnings to the pre-eminent

position it enjoys today.  We were all once POSBank's savers.  I

am  concerned  that  this sterling service will  not  always  be

remembered by all Singaporeans they have served all these years.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, globalisation is

here  to  stay. The present crisis is only a correction  to  its

unrelenting  growth.  Current oppositions to  its  progress  are

just  aberrations.  They will be smoothened out in  due  course.

The process will roll along after this interruption.  Hence, our

policies are sound and we should stay the course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will in the future be merged more closely with

the   world  financial  system.   Foreign  banks  and  financial

institutions   will  make  their  way  here.   Our   banks   and

institutions must in turn venture abroad.  The competition, both

at  home and abroad, will become more intense.  Size will  be  a

factor in the competition.  For a population of just under  four

million, the number of local banks and financial institutions is

too  many.  They are also small in comparison to those who  come

in  from  overseas.  I therefore support the merger of  DBS  and

POSBank, and hence the Bill standing before the House.  However,

it  is important to note that this merger came about not because

the  POSBank  is  no longer viable.  It is to  prepare  for  the

coming   competition.    POSBank  is  a  relevant   and   useful

institution  to  Singaporeans.  It is thus  important  that  the

merger  does not result in the disappearance of unique functions

and activities that it provides to the people in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now re-emphasise a few of them which several of my hon.

colleagues  in  the House have already spoken  on.   POSBank  is

recognised as the bank of the ordinary people.  Anyone, rich  or

poor,  young  or old, can open an account.  You do not  have  to

have a lot of money in the account.  This is not how other banks

operate.   In recent years, many banks have openly discriminated

against  the  less  wealthy.  If you do not maintain  a  minimum

monthly  average  of  typically a thousand  dollars,  a  service

charge  will be levied.  Their justification is that it  is  not

profitable  to  provide such accounts.  It  is  well-known  that

Singaporeans are a people who save their money. The  POSBank,  I

believe,  has  much  to do with Singaporeans  having  this  good

saving  habit.   No matter how much you have, you  can  squirrel

them into your

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>

POSBank  account.   To  make it easy  for  the  people,  POSBank

branches sprout out all over the island.  Over time, the amounts

in  these small accounts built up.  Campaigns were developed  at

the  young and adult population.  I believe that profit  is  not

the  driving  force underlying the operations of POSBank.   Will

this  national  effort go the way of the  dodos  if  the  profit

motivation of banks takes precedence?  Society will rue the  day

when this happens.  Unfortunately, this harmful effect will only

be seen in the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see another useful role the POSBank has played. Besides

giving  voice to the ordinary Singaporeans, it has also  spurred

the  services the bank provides to the people.  By  providing  a

reasonable alternative to the commercial banks, this  must  have

put  a  cap  to  the  charges that they have  imposed  on  their

services.   Due to the high quality of services the POSBank  has

provided,  this  must have spurred the other banks  to  also  up

their  services.   What  will replace this  benchmark  with  the

merger?  I would urge DBS to identify these unique functions and

services  of  POSBank.  These are strengths of  POSBank.   Those

that  are  needed  by the ordinary people and are  deserving  of

preserving should be preserved.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank all the

Members  who  have spoken in support of the Bill, especially  Dr

Tan  Cheng  Bock  who, in fact, answered half  the  questions  I

intend  to  answer.   I particularly join him  in  thanking  the

POSBank's staff for their sterling service over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one feature which has been commonly raised by all Members

here  who have spoken today is the seeming loss of an icon,  and

there  is  some suggestion that somehow after the  merger,  POSB

just  fades  away.  I can assure Members that is not  the  case.

The merger or the combination of these two banks achieves a very

important objective.  It is Government's policy to encourage the

growth   of   strong  Singapore  banks,  and   this   particular

combination  is  a beginning, so that we have a  Singapore  bank

which can compete effectively in the region and in the world.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSBank was chosen to be married to DBS because they have

complementary  strengths.   POSBank  has  a  very  large  retail

network  and extensive coverage.  Therefore, it is an  excellent

retail  bank  serving  a  whole  spectrum  of  small  and  large

customers.   On the other hand, DBS is a very strong  commercial

bank with strong corporate accounts.  So the merger and the  fit

is  excellent.  And I can assure the House that it  is  not  the

intention  of DBS - I hope they remember this - to make  POSBank

disappear.  Instead, it will build on its strength to retain all

the   good  features  of  POSBank  in  order  to  add   to   its

attractiveness as a combined bank.  Certainly the  network,  the

ATMs,  will  be maintained and DBS has assured us that  it  will

continue to provide services for the small depositors and indeed

children  up to 12 years, students up to 21 years and  full-time

National  Servicemen will all continue to  be  able  to  have  a

POSBank  account without a service charge.  In addition,  it  is

also   undertaking  to  retain  all  POSBank  staff  on  current

conditions and there would be no redundancies.  Of course,  they

cannot  guarantee  this over the long term,  because  conditions

change.   But  there is no intention of letting  anybody  become

redundant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share his sentiments about the loss of an icon. It is indeed

an   institution  which  is  so  well  known  that  you  see  it

everywhere.  But it is just the thought of an icon lost, because

many  features of the icon will remain, including the  logo  and

the quality of service which POSBank has built up.

Another  question  asked by Members was why Government  selected

DBS as the marriage partner instead of getting the best value by

tendering  the  POSBank  to  all.   The  reason  is  that   this

particular  merger  did not start off with a  purely  commercial

intent.   We  were  not  out  to maximise  the  profits  to  the

Government.  The objective, as I have explained earlier, was  to

build  on  Government's  wish  to  develop  a  strong  bank   in

Singapore,  and  at the same time we wanted to ensure  that  the

range  of  POSBank's  services would be  maintained  as  far  as

possible.  Of course,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>

over  time,  some things will have to change but, by and  large,

the best features will be maintained for as long as feasible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined bank, headed by DBS, will ensure that POSBank's

social  functions are retained, and this includes the  provision

of affordable banking services to small depositors. DBS has also

agreed  to  phase down the mortgage rates currently extended  to

Credit  POSB's borrowers over an extended period of  time.   The

tax  exemption features of POSBank will also be phased out  over

six  years.  These concessions will allow DBS to commit  to  the

maintenance of POSBank's social function as part of the purchase

and sales agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some concern has been expressed as to why the tax exemption

period  should not be extended.  I think six years is more  than

adequate - three years of tax exemption for all POSBank deposits

followed  by another three years of tax exemption for the  first

$100,000 of deposits.  It is only by the year 2005 that all  tax

exemption is entirely removed.  We cannot allow, of course,  the

combined  bank  to enjoy tax exemption indefinitely  because  it

would be unfair to the other commercial banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Credit POSB's mortgage interest rates which

are now between 1.5% and 1.75% lower than commercial bank rates,

we  have  said  that  Government's policy is  not  to  subsidise

purchasers  of  private  property.   Government  subsidies   for

housing are extended through the HDB housing programme and  this

is  unaffected by the changes in Credit POSB's mortgage interest

rates.   Dr  Tan  Cheng Bock has already quoted  some  published

figures which show that the great bulk of the borrowings through

Credit  POSB  is  by  people  buying  condominiums  and  private

properties  in  the  range of $460,000,  going  as  high  as  $1

million.   Persons with loans of this size are clearly not  from

the  low-income  groups  and it is not  Government's  policy  to

continue  to subsidise such loans indefinitely.  The reason  why

they  are currently enjoying lower interest rates is because  of

the  special  circumstances of POSBank in which restrictions  on

its investment opportunities have driven them to gain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>

market  share  in  the  housing loan market  by  offering  lower

mortgage interest loans through Credit POSB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phase-down period of four years is considered to be

reasonable.  The request for the phase-down to be extended  from

four  years to six years, in case the downturn should go  beyond

the  four-year  period, would not be fair in that the  four-year

phase-down was agreed by DBS at the time the sales agreement was

signed  in July.  Changing the terms now would impose an  unfair

new burden on POSBank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if the economic situation in Singapore should

remain bad or even deteriorate after the four-year grace period,

we would all indeed be in very serious trouble, in which case it

is  not just the Credit POSB's borrowers which Government  needs

to help but the entire Singapore population.  So I think we will

face  that problem when we see it.  I do not believe, therefore,

we should vary the terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal more specifically with the individual questions

raised  by  Members, although some of these  have  already  been

covered by what I have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee wants to know whether the removal of

Government's guarantee would mean that the new entity  would  be

as  safe as POSBank.  Obviously, it cannot be as safe as a  100%

Government guarantee.  But, in practice, I should point out that

no  commercial bank has ever received a Government guarantee nor

does  it need to do so in Singapore.  Singapore maintains a very

tight  supervisory oversight on its commercial banks  and  banks

are  encouraged  to  be  very careful on their  investments  and

ensure  that the security of their depositors' funds  is  always

adequately looked after.  There is no reason for savers  in  the

new  bank to have concern over the potential for losses to their

accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one issue which has not been raised, but I will mention

here, is that the MAS is studying the possibility of introducing

a  limited  form of deposit insurance for banks in Singapore  to

provide an added measure of protection for small

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>

depositors.   This  would  be  in the  context  of  Government's

intention  to  open up the domestic banking sector gradually  to

more foreign competition.  The issue is a complicated one and we

would  not want to rush into it.  But it is certainly an  option

we can consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Mr Chiam has misunderstood the tax exemption

scheme.   The phase-out of tax exemption over six years  applies

to  all  depositors, not just to persons below 21  and  national

servicemen.  However, post merger, children, students  under  21

and  full-time  national servicemen are the three categories  of

customers  who  will  continue to be  allowed  to  open  savings

accounts without a service charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also asked why POSBank was not sold by tender. I have

explained  earlier  that the sale was not treated  as  a  purely

commercial transaction.  In a sale by tender, POSBank  would  be

sold to any bank which offered the highest price.  This was  not

Government's intention.  We wanted to select a bank which  could

best  meet  and  implement our objectives. As Government  had  a

controlling  interest in DBS, there was assurance that  DBS,  as

the acquiring bank, would be best placed to continue to maintain

POSBank's  social  obligations.  Once DBS was  selected  as  the

potential partner, negotiations for the sale and purchase  price

was conducted along commercial lines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai recommends that after the merger, DBS should emulate

POSBank in providing a high quality of service to its customers.

I  can  assure  him  that the intention is not  to  degrade  the

quality  of service.  Instead, POSBank's quality image  will  be

preserved, together with its coverage network.

I think I have answered the question raised by Dr Vasoo.  I have

also  answered most of Mr Chew Heng Ching's questions, including

the question raised by Mr Iswaran.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Dr Toh See Kiat is satisfied with the answers I have

given so far.  Because a lot of what he said was also covered by

the other Members.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I really need to respond to Dr Tan Cheng

Bock.  He has helped me to answer most of the questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House deals with the amendment of the

Constitution  to delete POSBank from the Fifth Schedule  to  the

Constitution.   The  Fifth  Schedule  lists  six  key  statutory

boards,  which are MAS, BCCS, HDB, CPF Board, JTC  and  POSBank,

and  three Government-linked companies (GLCs) and these are GIC,

MND  Holdings  and  Temasek Holdings, whose  past  reserves  are

protected by the Constitution.  These statutory boards and  GLCs

are  required  by  the Constitution to ensure  that  their  past

reserves are not drawn down without the approval of the  Elected

President.  POSBank is presently in the Fifth Schedule. With its

privatisation and subsequent dissolution, POSBank will  have  to

be deleted from the Fifth Schedule.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the spirit of the Constitution, the

Government  will  remove POSBank from the  Fifth  Schedule  only

after all of POSBank's assets have been transferred back to  the

Government  and safeguarded in accordance with the  requirements

applicable to Fifth Schedule entities. The President has  agreed

to   this  arrangement.   The  transfer  will  be  done  in  the

followings steps:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Two Bills have been tabled before Parliament, which

are  the  Post  Office  Savings Bank of Singapore  (Transfer  of

Undertakings and Dissolution) Bill and the Constitution  of  the

Republic  of  Singapore (Amendment No. 2) Bill.  Both Bills  are

to   be   read  for  the  Second  and  Third  time  at   today's

Parliamentary sitting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Once the President has assented to the Bills, the

Government will bring into force the Post Office Savings Bank of

Singapore (Transfer of Undertakings and Dissolution) Act  first,

but not the Constitution (Amendment No. 2) Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Government will then set the date for the transfer of

the  undertakings of POSBank to DBS at 16th November 1998.  This

is the closing date for the transaction with DBS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) POSBank will still be in the Fifth Schedule on this

transfer date.  As the Government and POSBank are satisfied that

the  transfer of POSBank's undertakings to DBS is at fair market

value,  and  thus  will  not result  in  any  drawdown  on  past

reserves,  the  President's approval is  not  required  for  the

transaction.   Nevertheless, given the size  and  importance  of

this transaction, the Government has kept the President's Office

fully  informed of the details of the transaction.  It has  also

informed  the President's Office that it will treat all proceeds

received  from the sale of POSBank as the past reserves  of  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) On the transfer date, POSBank will receive new DBS shares

as  consideration for transferring its undertakings to DBS.   It

will  also  still  have  residual  assets  that  have  not  been

transferred to DBS.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) On or after the transfer date, all of POSBank residual

assets and DBS shares will be transferred to the Government,  in

a  manner consistent with the constitutional safeguards.  I,  as

Minister  for Finance, will give an undertaking to the President

in  accordance  with  Article  22B(9)  of  the  Constitution  to

transfer  assets,  (including all  the  new  DBS  shares)  which

comprise  POSBank's past reserves to the past  reserves  of  the

Government.   These  past reserves will  comprise  the  new  DBS

shares, and part of POSBank's residual assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) POSBank's current reserves will also be returned to the

Government.  The Government will voluntarily treat these  assets

received from POSBank as past reserves of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) We expect to finalise the audit of POSBank's residual

assets,  seek  approval from the President's  Office  for  their

transfer  to the Government and effect the transfer by  December

1998 or January 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) This will leave POSBank as an empty shell.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) The Constitution (Amendment No.2) Act will then be brought

into  force  through  a Gazette Notification,  thereby  deleting

POSBank  from the Fifth Schedule.  As a final step, a  day  will

also  be  appointed  under  the  Post  Office  Savings  Bank  of

Singapore  (Transfer  of Undertakings and  Dissolution)  Act  to

dissolve POSBank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Housing and Development

Act  in  three  main areas: first, to empower the HDB  to  raise

loans  inside and outside Singapore through the issue  of  bonds

and  other  financial instruments; second, to remove  insolvency

protection  attached to HDB flats in cases where the  flats  are

wholly  owned by Singapore permanent residents; and,  third,  to

confer upon HDB limited power to acquire individual strata units

within  HDB buildings for the specific purpose of upgrading  the

buildings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the issue of bonds - clause 8. The Bill seeks to enhance

HDB's  flexibility to raise loans from a wider range of  sources

in any way it deems advantageous.  At present, HDB's development

programmes and operational requirements are financed  mainly  by

Housing Development Loans provided by the Government.  With  the

passing of the Bill, HDB will launch its first bond issue in the

later  part  of this financial year to fund part of its  housing

development programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By tapping the bond market, HDB can reap the benefits of a more

efficient   financing   structure  that  closely   matches   its

development  expenditure  needs.   The  issuing  of   bonds   by

statutory boards will also help broaden and deepen the Singapore

bond market, adding to its diversity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the protection of HDB flats owned by

Singapore  permanent residents - clauses 6 and 10.  The  present

Act  protects all HDB flats whether owned by Singapore  citizens

or  Singapore permanent residents (PRs) from being vested in the

Official Assignee following the bankruptcy of their owners.   It

also  provides that no HDB flat shall be sold by court order  to

satisfy  a  judgment  debt.  The Bill proposes  to  remove  such

protection  in  cases  where  HDB  flats  are  wholly  owned  by

Singapore PRs.  We want to restrict the scope of the Act  in  so

far as the issue of immunity from insolvency law is concerned to

make a distinction between Singapore citizens and Singapore PRs.

The amendment will cover all Singapore PR flat owners regardless

of  when they might have purchased their HDB flats.  However, it

will  apply only to persons who are declared bankrupt after  the

commencement of the amendment Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third change is the acquisition of HDB flats for the purpose

of the Main Upgrading Programme - clause 7.  The Bill also seeks

to incorporate a new provision in the Act to confer upon HDB the

limited  power  to  acquire individual strata units  within  HDB

buildings  for  the  specific purpose of implementing  the  Main

Upgrading Programme (MUP).  This will be necessary in  order  to

build additional features in some MUP projects.  For example, in

blocks with no void decks, the ground floor units may need to be

acquired and cleared in order to set up communal facilities  not

provided  for  in  the past, such as a kindergarten  or  an  old

folks'   corner.    Let  me  assure  Members   that   compulsory

acquisition will be carried out only after careful evaluation of

the  various possible options.  Furthermore, the final  decision

lies  with the residents of the block in question who will  vote

for  the  MUP  package  that they prefer.   The  flats  will  be

acquired only if 75% or more of eligible voters are in favour of

a particular upgrading package which involves such acquisition.

HDB  will give the affected lessees a fair compensation  package

based  on market value similar to that given under the Selective

En-Bloc Redevelopment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>

Scheme.   In this way, affected lessees will not lose out  as  a

result of the compulsory acquisition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the three main amendments I have touched on,

the  Bill also includes administrative changes to enhance  HDB's

enforcement  of  public housing rules and  policies.   The  Bill

empowers the Minister to make rules to regulate the carrying out

of  renovation  in  properties sold by HDB to ensure  compliance

with building and safety regulations. This is provided in clause

4.   Next,  the  Bill empowers the Minister to  make  rules   to

require that all agreements for private sales of HDB flats shall

be  in  a  prescribed form and that all other forms of agreement

shall be void.  The purpose of this amendment is to protect both

buyers  and  sellers of HDB flats.   Another amendment  aims  to

curb speculation by providing that Sales and Purchase Agreements

entered  into  before the seller has occupied the flat  for  the

minimum occupation period shall be void.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve operational efficiency, the Bill allows HDB to

appoint  a wider group of persons to sign conveyancing documents

on  its  behalf.  This is in clause 2.  It also streamlines  the

procedure  for the appointment of HDB's Chief Financial  Officer

as  this  post is similar to HDB's other Heads of Department  in

that all are responsible to the Chief Executive Officer, who  in

turn  is responsible to the Board.  Furthermore, the Bill allows

HDB,  with the approval of the Minister, to enter into and carry

out  agency agreements that do not relate to housing or building

ancillary services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the

Housing  and Development (Amendment) Bill.  However, I  do  have

some concerns on two of the three main proposed amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amendment Bill introduces a new provision in the Act

to empower the HDB to raise loans inside and outside

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  through the creation and issue of bonds or otherwise.

I would like to ask the Minister how this provision, which gives

the  HDB added flexibility to raise funds, would translate  into

better  pricing  of HDB flats for Singaporeans.  Does  borrowing

from  the  market  mean higher costs versus borrowing  from  the

Government?  Currently, how does the Government charge for funds

extended  to  the  HDB  for its housing programmes?   Since  the

Singapore Government has very large reserves, does it  not  make

sense  to  borrow  from  the  market only  when  the  Government

reserves  are  in fact earning more than the cost  of  borrowing

from the market?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, are these bonds targetted at institutional or

retail investors?  For the issue of bonds in Singapore, I  would

like  to urge the HDB to consider issuing these bonds in smaller

denominations  of,  say, even $10,000, so that  the  Singaporean

retail  investor can also participate in these bond instruments.

This  would give the man-in-the-street another avenue to  invest

his  surplus funds which, I believe, will give a slightly higher

yield than fixed deposits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the HDB, together with the MAS, should help to create

a  more  liquid secondary market for these bonds for the benefit

of retail investors.  The HDB should also apply to the CPF Board

to  allow  the  use  of  CPF funds for such  investments.   Such

instruments  give  a fixed income at much lower  risk  than  the

equities market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 65J of the Act confers on the HDB

the  power  to compulsorily acquire the whole of any  particular

flat in the precinct for the purpose of those upgrading works to

be  carried out in that precinct.  I am very concerned about how

this  provision will affect certain individual owners  who  have

lived  in  the precinct for many, many years.  One  could  argue

that he would be giving up his flat to benefit the majority, who

might be given a kindergarten or an old folks' corner to utilise

and  enjoy.   However, this provision should be used very,  very

judiciously,  and  perhaps only with the support  of  the  local

Member of Parliament.  We should balance the right of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>

the  individual to continue living in the precinct that  he  has

chosen  many  years ago, with the public good and interest.   In

the case of the acquisition of homes for roads or MRT lines, for

example,  it  is more obvious that many thousands  will  benefit

from  the acquisition. In the case of acquisition of a flat  for

some  communal  facility,  the number  of  neighbours  who  will

benefit is much smaller and, in my view, less justifiable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such an acquisition is deemed absolutely necessary for

whatever reason, I feel that the compensation should not  be  at

the  last transacted price of a similar flat in the precinct  or

block, or even the average of the last few transactions, but  at

a  significant premium above the market.  This will make the HDB

think  very carefully before acquiring.  It will also compensate

the  affected  owner who has to move away from the neighbourhood

he has grown accustomed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these two comments, I have no other comments on

the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the

Bill,  in particular the provisions enabling HDB to issue  bonds

as  this  would  have the added benefit of contributing  to  the

development  of our capital markets.  However, I would  like  to

seek  clarification on the amendment set out in clause 7 of  the

Bill  in  relation  to the compulsory acquisition  of  flats  in

upgrading projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB upgrading programmes have, in general, met with good

public response since its introduction.  Many owners of upgraded

HDB  flats  testify to the greater enjoyment of  their  improved

homes and surrounding environment as well as the appreciation in

the  values  of  their  flats.  This is despite  the  fact  that

inconvenience  and disruption may be caused  to  carry  out  the

upgrading works.  For example, it is sometimes necessary to gain

access into individual flats in order to carry out the works  on

other  parts  of  the  building.  In such cases,  the  Board  is

presently  empowered under section 65J of the principal  Act  to

authorise  entry into any flat for the purpose of  carrying  out

such works.  Under the proposed amendment to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>

section  65J,  the  Board  is to be given  a  further  power  to

compulsorily acquire HDB flats for upgrading works to be carried

out  in  an  approved project.  In view of the broad wording  of

this  section, could the Minister give assurance  to  the  House

that  this  power  of acquisition will not be exercised  by  the

Board  for  situations other than those which he  had  mentioned

just now?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fear I have is that for practical reasons, the

contractor may wish to have access to a particular flat to carry

out upgrading works to other parts of the building and therefore

it  may  be expeditious for the contractor to lobby the  HDB  to

acquire  the flat for him to carry out the works in other  parts

of  the  building.  Could the Minister assure us that this  will

not  be  the  case and that the power of compulsory  acquisition

will not be exercised in such situations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the flat unit is needed to become part of some

communal facilities under the upgrading plan, the flat,  as  the

Minister has pointed out, would be acquired by the HDB  for  the

use  of  the  flat to be changed. The main concern of  the  flat

owner  would  then be the amount of compensation which  he  will

receive.   In this regard, could the Minister clarify the  basis

upon  which  HDB  will determine the compensation  to  be  paid?

Would  the quantum of compensation be based on valuation of  the

unit as an HDB flat as provided by qualified HDB valuers, or its

value as part of a kindergarten or senior citizen's corner,  for

example?  Further, the new  subsection 9 provides that the owner

may  object to the compensation offered by the Board by  stating

his grounds in writing.  I have some queries in relation to this

issue.  What are the grounds of objection which can  be  validly

raised  by  the  owner?  Is it a valid ground  that  the  market

valuation  obtained from qualified HDB valuers  is  higher  than

those offered by the HDB?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have raised the above issues in relation to the

compulsory  acquisition  of flats because  I  feel  that  it  is

important  for  the  public to know when and  how  they  may  be

affected  by  this power to be given to the HDB to  acquire  the

flat.  While the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>

actual  number of flat owners who will be affected is likely  to

be  very  small, I believe these issues should be  clarified  to

prevent any misconceptions which may affect the support given by

HDB  flat owners for upgrading projects in their precinct.   For

example,  as  the  Minister has clarified just now,  whether  to

proceed  with the upgrading works will be left to the  residents

and  they  have  to  obtain more than 75% of the  votes  of  the

residents  before  they can carry out the  upgrading  programme.

But to the aggrieved flat owner whose unit is to be acquired  by

the  HDB, it is no comfort to him to think that the majority  of

the  residents  of the estate would of course want  the  HDB  to

acquire his flat for some communal facilities which will  be  of

benefit to the majority of the residents.  After all, the  money

for the compensation will be paid by the HDB, and not out of the

upgrading  project budget, or out of pockets of the majority  of

the residents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am surprised to note that the HDB

needs  to issue bonds as an alternative source of funding.   The

traditional way of HDB funds is from the Government.  They get a

loan from the Government and they pay an interest.  This loan is

used  to  build  HDB  flats and in turn the flats  are  sold  to

members  of  the  public.  Once the profits are  taken  in,  the

Government is repaid their loans.  I am just curious why at this

stage  funds  have to be raised from outside Singapore  or  from

other  sources  other than Government funds.   My  question  is:

Have  the Government funds in fact been dried up that there  are

no  Government  funds now to finance HDB  projects?   Or  is  it

because  of the bad economic times that funds are short  because

the  Government has to help out in many areas?   We  have  noted

that  even  the upgrading programme of the HDB has to be  slowed

down.  So my curiosity is aroused.  Why is there a need to raise

money other than from the traditional source?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area that I would like to comment is this new

draconian  clause 7(b) whereby the HDB is given  new  powers  of

acquisition.  My fear is that once

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>

compulsory  acquisition powers are given  to  the  HDB,  we  are

opening the Pandora's box.  Now the HDB can tell members of  the

public  that they are acquiring only a flat on the ground  floor

and making more provisions for the other flat dwellers.  But who

knows,  in  time to come, this power can be used very  liberally

because in new subsections 7 to 14, which give power to the  HDB

to  compulsorily acquire a flat, nowhere does it say that  these

powers  cannot be extended. This is the fear of the public  that

once these powers are given, we are opening the Pandora's box.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the HDB has renovated and upgraded hundreds of

flats.  Why was there no need to have this power of acquisition?

Why  is  there a necessity now to compulsorily acquire  a  flat?

Are  there that many cases that the Minister has mentioned,  ie,

these  flats that are in the void decks?  As far as  I  know,  I

have  not come across any of such flats.  Can the Minister  name

where these flats are situated in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the occasions when a flat is needed for the

construction  of  a  block?  Can this flat be also  compulsorily

acquired  if the upgrading cannot be proceeded with unless  that

flat is acquired?  I would imagine that, if that is the case, it

would  be a more compelling and cogent reason, and not  just  to

acquire a flat for the benefit of the other flat dwellers.  This

exercise of compulsory acquisition must be rarely used.  Can the

Minister assure us that all possible remedies or solutions would

be sought first before a flat is to be acquired?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in regard to the procedure of appeal, the appeal is only to

a  Minister,  and  one  would imagine  that  a  Minister  is  an

interested party, if not in that flat, at least in that block or

in that project.  Appeal must normally be made to an independent

body,  rather than to a person who has interest in the  project.

So  I  would suggest that the final appeal must be to  the  High

Court, even after having gone through the Minister.  I think  it

is  fair  because a person's home is being taken away from  him.

The final appeal must be to a higher authority which has got  no

interest whatsoever on the matter.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the payment of compensation, again the section

seems  to  be rather unsatisfactory.  Because it does not  spell

out  how  compensation is to be paid, what  amount  and  if  the

amount  is to be given, at what date that amount will be  taken.

Unlike the Act on compulsory acquisition of land, there is a cut-off date.  So the amount is fixed, say, on 1st January 1975,  or

1995, or whatever date is given.  But in this case, there is  no

cut-off  date.   So  in times of plenty, the  HDB  may  be  very

generous  but  in hard times like these, the flat owner  may  be

given  a  small  amount.  And if that happens,  he  will  suffer

twice.   Firstly,  his flat will be acquired and,  secondly,  he

will  be paid a derisory amount.  I hope the Minister would have

a second look at this particular clause.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this

opportunity to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in support of the Bill. But there are certain

provisions which I have my reservation.  I support the  move  to

protect  only  the  citizens.  Only  citizens  should  have  the

benefit  of the Bankruptcy Act.  I think this piece of amendment

should have been introduced long ago.  I suppose initially  only

citizens could buy a property, but subsequently there were  some

amendments allowing PRs to purchase it.  I think there should be

a  distinction between citizens and non-citizens, and I  support

the Minister that it is a right move at the right time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also support the new section 49A. It would have a

standard  form of contract.  This will allow for certainty.   It

would also save the purchaser, instead of going to lawyers,  and

he  would  know what he is expected to meet.  I only  hope  when

this  standard  form  of  agreement is  drawn  up,  it  will  be

favourable to both the purchaser and the seller.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must raise my objection to new section 65J, and Mr

Chiam has mentioned it earlier.  I have no objection at all that

the  Government acquires a property for the common good  of  the

community  and  the country.  I think we have to upgrade  and  I

must compliment the Minister and his Ministry for having

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>

done  such  a  good job.  Those areas which I have  visited  and

which  have  been  upgraded  have  really  benefited  from  this

upgrading  scheme.   But  clauses 8,  9  and  10  are  not  very

satisfactory.   I will go further than what the earlier  Members

have  mentioned.  HDB is going to acquire a property and  it  is

going  to  be  judged in its own course.  Every law student  and

lawyer  will  tell  you that you cannot be judged  in  your  own

course.  Here the Board is going to acquire a property and  tell

you how much it is going to be, and that is not fair.  I think a

fairer  solution would be to have an independent panel and  that

panel can decide what is a fair compensation.  Because not  only

you must not be judged in your own course, there is also another

principle of law that justice must not only be done but seen  to

be done.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the HDB will act  bona

fide.   But  the  public, the majority of  Singaporeans  in  HDB

flats,  must be assured that the compensation they are going  to

be  paid  is  a fair compensation.  And I share the view  of  my

learned  friend, Mr Chiam, to have an independent panel.   There

is   already  an  existing  provision  for  a  Land  Acquisition

Tribunal.  Or you may set up another tribunal.  So for a  member

of the public, I think there would be very unhappy circumstances

to  have  a clause where you raise an objection and the Minister

considers  and  gives  his decisions,  and  it  is  final.   The

Minister  cannot be judged in his own course.  And in  order  to

provide  for the right of the HDB flat owners, the Minister  may

want to consider some other solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be a bit too late at this stage to have the Bill

amended but, nevertheless, I would urge the Minister to consider

the  position of setting up some panels or at least there should

be mechanism in the HDB itself where members of the public could

sit  in this panel and they could see that a fair hearing and  a

fair  consideration  are  given to the property  that  is  being

acquired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these reservations, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I share the concern of the speakers before

me as regards the powers of acquisition.  Clearly, there are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>

provisions   under   the  existing  laws  for   either   general

acquisition  of  land  or  the Selective  En-bloc  Redevelopment

Scheme.   I  am  not  sure that we need to add another  specific

power to the various powers that already exist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly concerned, Sir, that the criteria for the

exercise  of powers are not made clear in the statute.   In  the

Minister's  statement,  the reasons he gave  us  were  perfectly

reasonable but not being in the statute, we cannot be sure  that

this  will  always  be  so.   I would suggest,  therefore,  that

subsidiary  legislation or regulations should be promulgated  to

set  out  the criteria.  These criteria would serve not just  to

reassure  people  but  would also therefore  serve  as  relevant

criteria  to take the objections, from the owners, that  is,  if

they should object.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Sir, I would suggest that another mechanism that

may be of use to the Minister in exercise of these powers is  to

provide  by policy that before any acquisition is made  pursuant

to  this power, a public social impact statement should be made:

that  is  to  say,  in any particular case, the  situation,  the

upgrading  plan  should  be  studied  thoroughly  and  a  public

document  issued stating how many blocks are affected, for  what

purpose, and this would give a much better ground for people  to

make the decision that would vote yes or no for the upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister offers us a 75% voting ratio for upgrading as

a safeguard.  This is usually sufficient.  But in the event that

those  affected would be less than 25%, the 75% could be  easily

obtained  by  those  who  benefit even if  all  those  who  were

affected  would  say  no.   In this regard,  I  think  the  best

safeguard  would be to require a double majority; that  is,  the

existing  75%  of  all occupants to agree  to  upgrading  and  a

certain  percentage  of those affected.  Some  might  say  those

affected  will, of course, not agree, but as the Minister  says,

if  the  compensation  is fair and attractive,  then  perhaps  a

certain  percentage would.  This percentage could be lower  than

75% of course.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation quantum needs also to be thought through

more  carefully.  I think that, given the context of  upgrading,

the first question must be whether this compensation would be on

pre-upgrading criteria or post-upgrading criteria.   After  all,

the  purpose  of the upgrading is to increase the value  of  the

assets.   Those stripped of an asset before upgrading will  then

be  double  losers - they lose the asset as it is and they  lose

the  chance to upgrade the asset.  And surely, Sir, that  cannot

be a point of upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few months ago, we looked at a very similar law as

regards  the  Land  Titles  (Strata)  (Amendment)  Bill.    Very

briefly,  one of the key differences between that provision  and

this  is  of  a  reference  to a third party  for  mediation  or

otherwise  to  try to settle the matter.  I would encourage  the

Ministry to think of including such third-party measures, if not

as law, then, again, as a matter of policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> First of all, let me thank Members for

raising  the various points.  Let me just address the  point  on

issuing  of  bonds.   Let me assure Members that  this  idea  of

issuing bonds is not because Government funds have dried up.  We

wanted  to  raise bonds because it makes for a better  and  more

efficient   way   of  raising  capital.   Today,   all   housing

development bonds are raised from the Government as well as from

the  banks, including POSB.  This is not the most efficient  way

because HDB's development projects are long term in nature and a

better  matching of our requirements versus our source of  funds

can  be  achieved by having a mixture of bonds  and  loans.   Of

course,  we  will try to raise the bonds at a period  where  the

cost of funds will be most advantageous to us.  This will depend

on the rating of HDB by external agencies and also on the market

conditions at the time that we raised bonds.  So, we will try to

do so at a time most advantageous to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the purpose of raising the bonds is to provide the

capital  market  in Singapore with breadth and  depth.   As  you

know, we are trying to develop Singapore as a debt centre and we

are trying to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>

provide   more  sources  for  both  institutional   and   retail

investors,  a  range of bond issues with different  tenures  and

different  risk ratings.  To develop this market,  we  recognise

that  we  should provide liquidity and ensure that the secondary

market  is liquid.  And I am sure MAS will take up with CPF  the

issue  of  allowing  CPF  funds for  investing  in  such  bonds,

including the HDB bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, let me turn to the issue of acquisition. Perhaps I used

too  much shorthand in explaining how we are going to go through

it.   Let  me  explain in greater detail.  When I use  shorthand

like  SERS  and  all that, I thought it would be easy  for  most

people to follow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the problem and how we are tackling it. As you

know,  in  many of our old estates, we have flats  on  the  void

deck, on the ground floor.  So when we do the upgrading, we  are

obligated  to  also upgrade the units on the ground  floor.   In

some  of these estates, the open space is very limited.   So  we

find  we cannot provide communal space for the units.  In  areas

where  we  can provide communal space, there is no intention  to

acquire  the ground floor flats in order to create the  communal

facilities.   A good example will be Kim Keat - the first  pilot

project.  There was plenty of space, so you can provide communal

space  in open space without having to disrupt the ground  floor

units.  In the case of Mountbatten in Old Airport Road, we found

the  space to be very tight.  There was not enough space for  us

to  provide communal facilities.  And the way we went  about  it

was  to  persuade the ground floor units to give  up  the  flats

individually, everyone of them.  Fortunately, we  were  able  to

persuade them and they all gave up their units and as a  result,

we  were  able  to  come out with a very good upgrading  package

which  benefited everybody - the majority as well as the  owners

on the ground floor units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are introducing this amendment to address such situations

where  the ground floor units are occupied, where the  space  is

very  tight  and we have no choice but to acquire the  units  in

order  to  provide communal space.  Let me assure  Members  that

there are enough checks and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>

balances.  The  Minister  is not an  interested  party  in  this

exercise. In fact, the whole exercise is under the charge of the

advisor  who is the Chairman of the Working Committee which  has

to  work  out the upgrading package. The advisor has to sell  to

his residents, including the residents on the ground floor, that

there  is  not  enough space and therefore  acquisition  of  the

ground  floor  units is part of the package.   The  compensation

goes  to HDB budget for that precinct. So, there are checks  and

balances. The advisor cannot go round acquiring all the units he

wants  because he is going to bust his upgrading  project.   So,

the Minister is not an interested party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the advisor has managed to sell his upgrading package to

his  residents, and they have taken a vote (75% say  yes),  they

will send the plan to the Ministry and if we think that it is  a

sensible plan, the Minister would sanction the acquisition.  And

for  the  flats to be acquired, we are providing them  the  same

SERS  package. When I say SERS package, it means,  firstly,  the

compensation  is  under the Land Acquisition Act  with  all  its

channels for appeal. It is done by an independent valuer on  the

date  of  1st  January  1995.  We pay them an  ex-gratia  market

supplement  to bring the compensation value of 1st January  1995

to  the  present  value, as at the date of the announcement.  We

offer  the  lessee  whose flat is acquired a  new  flat  in  the

vicinity with 20% discount in the new flat.  If he cannot afford

a  new  flat,  we offer him a three-room buy-back  flat.  If  he

cannot  afford a three-room buy-back flat, we offer him a rental

flat.   Under  the SERS package, the compensation  is  extremely

fair  and  we  do not anticipate many problems from  the  people

whose flats are acquired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me summarise:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) this will be done extremely selectively;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the compensation package is undertaken through the SERS

model which is fairly well tried out and with enough avenues  of

appeal; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the advisor has to initiate and sanction the upgrading and

make  sure that this is for the benefit of the majority  in  his

precinct.



I  can assure Members that there are enough safeguards and  this

will not be done except very, very selectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole issue about the criteria for exercising power or the

social  impact  are all covered by the advisor  in  his  Working

Committee.  He has to deal with the Residents Committee  members

and  residents.   In the Main Upgrading Programme,  the  process

takes  several  iterations.   It goes  back  and  forth  to  the

residents several times before they actually take a vote on  the

package.  Let me assure Members that these powers will  be  used

judiciously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to add to the comments about the Bankruptcy Act. It is true

that  was  covered when HDB flats were all bought  by  Singapore

citizens.  When we liberalised and allowed PRs to buy  in  1989,

we  could   have removed that protection then, rather than  now.

The  standard sales and purchase agreement will be fair to  both

buyer  and  purchaser.  It is the sales and  purchase  agreement

that  we are using today in all resale purchases.  It is working

well. We just want to provide the legislative basis to make sure

that  everybody  uses the same document.   We  have  had  estate

agents  who  provide  supplements  to  the  standard  sales  and

purchase agreement and try to bypass the provisions. So, this is

to prevent such abuses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Other than Mountbatten, what other estates

have flats on the ground floor?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When you walk around Redhill, Queensway and

Queenstown, many of the flats were built before HDB undertook to

build  the  satellite  towns in a very  comprehensive  way.   We

provided flats on the ground floor. Maybe he should walk around,

besides Potong Pasir, or his party should do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> But these were all built in as part of the

building. They were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>

not in the original plan as void decks.  Am I correct?  They are

already  part  of the structure of the building.   You  want  to

remove  them  to  make into void decks. That is  another  matter

altogether.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> That is the whole point. When we built these

old buildings, we maximised the space and we built flats even on

the ground floor.  Later on, as we went into Toa Payoh, we tried

out  this  concept of void decks. After 30 years of  experience,

void  decks  do provide an added advantage to Singaporeans,  not

just  in making the estate look more spacious, it provides space

for  communal  facilities, etc.  That is  why  void  decks  have

become a standard feature in HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we upgrade the old estates, we could just upgrade all the

units as they stand, without improving the estate's ambience  by

creating  a  new  void deck.  In some of these old  estates,  if

there is space elsewhere to provide communal facilities, we  can

do  so  without disturbing the units on the ground floor, as  we

have done in Kim Keat and other areas.  In some of these housing

estates,  it  is very tight and if you want to provide  communal

facilities to your senior citizens or kindergartens, there is no

space.   One  option is to remove the units on the ground  floor

and   therefore  create  a  void  deck  so  that  you  get  more

spaciousness  in  your  estate.  This means  you  will  have  to

compensate  the people who are presently living  on  the  ground

floor.  That is the whole purpose of the provision.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The HDB says it is to give better ambience

to  the residents there.  But do the residents themselves demand

for  it?   Are there complaints that there are no void  deck  in

their block?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I explained, that is entirely up to the

advisor  and  his  Working Committee. In the  precinct,  if  the

residents  are  happy  and do not want to  create  new  communal

facilities, the Minister is the last person who will want to  go

and  disturb  them.  It is entirely up to the  advisor  and  his

Working Committee. We are the last person to want to acquire the

flats  but if the majority of the residents feel that they  want

to upgrade and provide

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>

more communal facilities and, in so doing, they need to remove

the units on the ground floor, we are prepared to offer them

SERS compensation, which is very attractive.  And I can assure

you  that the reason why we are able to persuade everyone of

those in Mountbatten to give up their flats voluntarily is

because the compensation is very attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee

of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the

<div align="center"><b>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br><i>Overview</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House principally focuses on the

liberalisation  of the law to allow companies to  conduct  share

buy-backs. Apart from this major amendment, opportunity is  also

taken  to  incorporate seven other amendments. These  amendments

seek to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) update the concept of "deemed interest" under section

7(4);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) extend the lifespan of employee stock options under

section 77 from the current 5 years to 10 years;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) exclude trade franchises from the ambit of the

Companies Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) empower the Minister to make regulations to regulate

the  administration of unit trusts by managers and trustees, and

to extend the life of unit trust prospectuses;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) remove all restrictions relating to substantial

property transactions under sections 160A to 160D;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) allow a company to purchase insurance for any officer

of the company

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>

against liability on negligence or breach of duty to the company

not occasioned by any wilful act or default on his part; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) exempt foreign companies from being required to be

registered in Singapore in certain instances.

<br><br><i>Share buy-backs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first deal with the amendment relating to share buy-backs. The Bill proposes to allow for the purchase or

acquisition  by a company of its own shares out of distributable

profits,   after   obtaining   the   necessary   mandates   from

shareholders.  It presents a direct and more efficient means  of

returning  cash  to  shareholders, than  the  capital  reduction

procedure  that  is currently provided under the Companies  Act.

For  example,  a capital reduction exercise may  take  at  least

three  months to complete and also requires confirmation by  the

High  Court.  In  contrast, a share buy-back affords  a  company

greater  flexibility  in  the timing, procedure  and  amount  of

capital  to be returned to shareholders.  It thus increases  the

company's  ability  to adjust its capital base  and  debt-equity

ratio  and  can  improve a company's return on capital,  to  the

benefit of shareholders.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.42 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these advantages, the Government earlier made an

announcement, in response to the recommendation by  the  Finance

and  Banking  Subcommittee, that companies will  be  allowed  to

repurchase  their shares, subject to safeguards.  Various  forms

of  share  buy-back schemes are already allowed  in  the  United

States,  the  United  Kingdom,  Hong  Kong,  Australia  and  New

Zealand.   Government  agencies have studied  these  alternative

models  and  have  worked  closely with  the  Corporate  Finance

Committee,  the Stock Exchange of Singapore, the Association  of

Banks in Singapore, the Law Society and other interested parties

to  develop  the  proposal  in the  Bill  before  you.  In  this

proposal,  both  listed  and  unlisted  companies,  public   and

private,  can  conduct share buy-backs. Now I will briefly  walk

the House through the provisions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill seek to amend sections 73 and

76  to allow for the purchase or acquisition by a company of its

own  shares, without having to make an application to  the  High

Court  for  approval.   Clause  5 of  the  Bill  introduces  new

sections  76B  to  76G.  These sections set out the  appropriate

safeguards and disclosure requirements that have been formulated

to ensure that companies will not abuse the scheme of share buy-backs to the detriment of their creditors.  These safeguards are

as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Companies will only be able to buy back their ordinary

shares if their Articles of Association allow for it;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) All companies must obtain their shareholders'

approval by ordinary resolution to buy back their own shares via

an  off-market  acquisition on an "equal access"  scheme.   This

essentially  means a pro-rata buy back offer.  Listed  companies

must  also obtain a similar approval in order to carry  out  on-market share buy backs;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Listed companies will not be allowed to conduct

selective   off-market  purchases.   Unlisted   companies   may,

however,   obtain  their  shareholders'  approval   by   special

resolution  to  conduct  selective  off-market  buy  backs,  but

interested parties will not be able to vote in favour of such  a

resolution;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Companies must buy back their shares out of

distributable profits only;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Companies will be permitted to buy back shares up to a

maximum  of  10%  of their issued ordinary share capital  during

each  relevant  period.  The capital base to which  the  10%  is

pegged  is  to  be  ascertained at the date of the  last  annual

general  meeting or at the date of the resolution, whichever  is

higher,  unless  the Court through an order  had  confirmed  the

reduction  of  share capital.  In the latter  case,  the  issued

ordinary  share capital of the company would be  the  amount  as

altered by the Court order during the relevant period;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) There is also the introduction of an insolvency test.

The  company's directors may be personally liable as  it  is  an

offence  for a director to approve a share buy back when  he  is

aware that the company is insolvent or will become insolvent  as

a result of the buy back;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) All repurchased shares must be cancelled; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Companies must set up a capital redemption reserve

account.   The amount by which a company's issued share  capital

is  diminished  by  share buy backs must be transferred  to  its

capital redemption reserve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional safeguards for public listed companies will be

formulated  by the Stock Exchange of Singapore as  part  of  its

listing rules, and will be announced shortly.

<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go through the other amendments in the Bill.

These  amendments are designed to improve market efficiency  and

liberalise  regulations  to afford companies  more  flexibility.

They  also  seek to rationalise the provisions in the  Companies

Act with existing practice.

<br><br><i>Concept of "deemed interest"</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend the definition of

"deemed interest" in the shares of a company in section 7(4)  of

the  Act,  to increase the threshold interest from 15%  to  20%.

This  will  bring  the  concept  of  "deemed  interest"  in  the

Companies   Act  in  line  with  the  threshold  of  significant

influence   in  an  associated  company  under  the   accounting

convention and the Singapore Code on Take-Overs and Mergers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current concept of "deemed interest" under section 7(4)

is also capable of successive applications ad infinitum along  a

chain  of  companies.   This  has  given  rise  to  considerable

confusion  and practical difficulty.  Clause 2 therefore  amends

the  Act  to  restrict section 7(4) from applying to  successive

levels.   The  application of the "deemed interest"  concept  is

restricted to one level.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Lifespan of Employee Stock Options</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the law restricts all stock options, including

those  given  to  employees to take  up  unissued  shares  in  a

company, to a lifespan of 5 years.  Employee stock options are a

powerful  tool to reward employees, and the lifespan  should  be

extended to help retain and motivate employees.  Clause 6 amends

the  Act to provide that the maximum lifespan of employee  stock

options  be extended from 5 years to 10 years.  The lifespan  of

other forms of options remains at 5 years.

<br><br><i>Trade Franchises</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next amendment under clause 7 seeks to amend the

definition  of "interest" in section 107 of the Act  to  exclude

trade franchises.  This will clarify that franchises offered  to

the  public  are not subject to the onerous trust  arrangements,

and  trust  deed and prospectus requirements of the Act.   These

provisions will enable the promotion of franchises on  a  larger

scale,  as  a  strategy  for  small  retailers  to  upgrade  and

modernise  their business.  Only franchises as defined  will  be

excluded  from the definition.  Unit trust and other  collective

investment  schemes  will continue to  be  regulated  under  the

Companies Act.

<br><br><i>Unit Trust Legislation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit trusts are currently regulated under the Companies Act

as  they are a form of "interest" as defined under section  107.

The  provisions in section 111 and regulation 9 of the Companies

Regulations apply across the board to all forms of interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to effectively regulate the different forms of

interest  under  section  107, in particular  unit  trusts,  the

Minister  for Finance needs to be empowered to be able  to  make

specific regulations concerning each class of interest,  as  and

when  the  need arises.  Clauses 8 to10 of the Bill  enable  the

Minister for Finance to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clauses 10 and 14 of the Bill also seek to

extend the life of unit trust

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>

prospectuses from the current duration of 6 months to 12 months.

There  is no increased risk of inaccurate prospectuses being  in

circulation,  following  the extension  to  12  months,  as  the

managers  and  trustees are under legal obligation  to  re-lodge

their prospectuses whenever material changes take place and  are

made.

<br><br><i>Substantial Property Transactions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill seeks to repeal sections 160A and

160D  of  the  Act, thus removing the restrictions  relating  to

substantial property transactions.  The provisions have  created

practical  difficulties  and  are  somewhat  redundant,  as  all

related-party  transactions  of  listed  companies  are  already

subject  to  disclosure or shareholders' approval (depending  on

the amount) under the Stock Exchange of Singapore rules.

<br><br><i>Provisions indemnifying Directors or Officers of a Company</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, it has not been clear from a reading of section

172  whether  a  company can pay the premiums for  a  director's

indemnity policy.  However, it is now standard practice in  many

jurisdictions  for  companies to take  up  insurance  for  their

directors  and  pay the premium.  The amendment makes  it  clear

that  a  company may purchase insurance for any officer  of  the

company  against liability for negligence or breach of  duty  to

the  company,  which are not occasioned by  any  wilful  act  or

default  on  his  part.  The United Kingdom and  Australia  have

provisions that have equivalent effect.

<br><br><i>Registration of Foreign Companies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 amends section 366 by seeking to exempt foreign

companies  from  being registered in Singapore in  two  specific

instances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, global financial institutions transact in certain

financial  instruments  booked into  a  single  office  of  that

financial institution.  This "global book" will then be "passed"

from  one  financial  centre  to  another  and  traded  by  that

financial  institution's employees throughout the world.   Under

the current legal position, where

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>

trading  takes place through the Singapore office, this  foreign

institution  can  be  considered as "carrying  on  business"  in

Singapore  and  hence  should be registered  as  well.   Such  a

requirement is unduly onerous, if the foreign parent already has

a  registered  presence  in  Singapore.   As  increasingly  more

financial institutions adopt this practice, the gap between  the

law and commercial practice needs to be closed to keep pace with

other  jurisdictions  like Hong Kong, where  there  is  no  such

registration requirement.  With the amendment, foreign companies

need  not  register if they effect any transaction  through  its

related  corporation licensed or approved under any written  law

by  the  Monetary Authority of Singapore or under an arrangement

approved by the MAS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second instance, clause 13 seeks to free foreign

financial institutions from having to register if they establish

a  share transfer or share registration office in Singapore,  in

order to become a listed corporation.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments to the Companies Act form the first group

of  amendments proposed, as part of a wider exercise  to  update

and modernise company legislation in the coming months.  Most of

the  proposed amendments are still being reviewed and will  only

be  introduced  next  year.  The review is part  of  an  ongoing

effort by the Government to improve the business environment and

put  in  place  a more flexible legislative framework  that  can

respond  quickly  to  opportunities when the  economy  picks  up

again.   I  believe that the amendments I have proposed  take  a

step  in  this  direction, and set the stage for a more  vibrant

economic and financial climate in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the

introduction  of  this Bill.  I shall focus my comments  on  the

main

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>

feature of the Bill which is to allow the buy back of shares  by

Singapore  companies.   This buy back arrangement  is  currently

prohibited by the provisions of the Companies Act.  At  present,

companies can use their financial resources to invest in or  buy

shares  of  other  companies.   Such  investment  decisions  are

usually  made  based  on  limited  information  of  the   target

investments   of  companies.   In  some  cases,  the   companies

themselves  may  be  good  investments and  the  companies  know

themselves  best.  Hence, it may be worthwhile for companies  to

buy  back  their  own  shares rather than buy  shares  of  other

companies.   This provision of allowing companies  to  buy  back

their own shares is an enlightened approach.  It is permitted in

many  countries nowadays.  If companies can buy other companies'

shares,  why  not allow them to buy back their own shares  which

are  or  can  be better investments?  The share buy back  scheme

will also be in the  interest of the shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note the present Bill has a few restrictions on

share  buy  back.  First,  share buy back is only permitted  for

ordinary  shares and not allowed for preference shares or  other

classes  of  shares.   Second, a company  is  required  to  seek

shareholders' approval where the following information has to be

disclosed:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the total number of shares which may be acquired is limited

to 10%;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the maximum price to be paid for the shares; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the date by which the authority to purchase will expire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for some clarifications.

First,  why  restrict the buy back of shares  only  to  ordinary

shares  but not allow other classes of shares such as preference

shares,  convertible shares or even warrants?   Would  this  not

give the companies more flexibility and choices?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister on the disclosure of

certain   information  such  as  the  limit  of  10%  of   total

shareholding, the maximum price and the limitation of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>

the date to buy the shares.  First, on the limitation of 10%

total shareholding.  Companies may want to buy more shares when

they want to go out and buy their own shares.   So, would it not

be beneficial for companies to be able to buy more than 10%?

There may be sellers who want to sell more than 10% each time?

So why not have a higher limit?  Perhaps 15%, 25% or even 50% of

their own shares to buy back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the disclosure of maximum price can also create

difficulty  and  curtail  the  flexibility  of  actions  by  the

company.  The buying and selling process is a very dynamic  one.

The  parameters  and market forces change very fast.   Hence,  I

would  like to ask the Minister: would it not create   a  better

chance  for them to buy back their shares if certain information

is  not  disclosed to the public, such as the limitation on  the

date  as  well as the maximum price they want to pay?  Moreover,

the  fact  that  the company has to seek shareholders'  approval

prior to taking action is in itself a deterrent to the companies

concerned.   There is also the risk that the public announcement

of  the  company's intention to buy back their shares may  cause

the potential sellers to ask for higher prices.  In the end, the

company  actually is at a disadvantage when they buy back  their

shares  at a higher price than it originally intended.  The  end

result is that companies may actually choose to rather buy other

companies'  shares, which is subject to less restrictions,  than

to  actually  go through a more tedious process of  buying  back

their own shares, no matter how attractive their own shares  may

be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister may wish to clarify these issues.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

would like to begin by declaring my interest as a director of  a

securities  company.  I shall, however, be  making  my  comments

from  the  perspective  of  the  retail  investor  and  minority

shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to legislation, to allow for the

purchase or acquisition of their own shares by companies,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>

will  pave the way for companies, particularly the listed  ones,

to better manage the return on equity, or, in today's jargon, to

"create  more  value".  It will constitute another milestone  in

the development of the Singapore stock market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I raise two sets of issues regarding the buy-back

scheme, namely of safeguards and tax implications, I would  like

to make some general comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, companies embarking on such a scheme may send

mixed  signals  about business direction and  growth  potential.

Except for the inaugural exercise with the passage of this Bill,

we  would  implicitly be expecting the investor at large  to  be

able  to understand why a company is using its surplus funds  to

buy  back  its  own shares instead of deploying these  funds  to

further  business  expansion.  It is  entirely  possible  for  a

company to use surplus funds to buy back shares, only to go back

to  shareholders  later on for new capital for expansion.   This

has  been the experience of companies in the other markets.  How

will  the  Singaporean-based  investor  interpret  such  actions

which, when taken together, may appear somewhat ironical?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike reported earnings and the requisite announcements

for major corporate developments, share buy-backs can provide  a

very  strong  signal to "outside" investors of  what  management

thinks  of  the prevailing share values.  Given the significance

of  this  interpretation,  several questions  arise  as  to  the

provision  of  sufficient safeguards for  minority  shareholders

against  any abuse or manipulation by management and/or majority

shareholders.



<br><br><i>Need to provide enough safeguards</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Minister to ensure that enough

safeguards are provided against the following possibilities:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, manipulation by company insiders to manage

reported  earnings-related  benchmarks,  such  as  earnings  per

share,  so  as  to detract from or mask unsatisfactory  business

performance.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, possibility of management spending too much time

and  attention on managing share prices rather than  the  actual

business  itself,  particularly in  times  of  prolonged  market

volatility  and  depressed  share  prices  such  as  now.    The

temptation to buy back "undervalued" shares would be  too  great

to resist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the possibility of collusion between major

shareholders   and   company  at   the   expense   of   minority

shareholders.   Although  there is  a  provision  to  specify  a

maximum price, should there be a cap on the premium on the price

to  be  paid for shares to be bought back?  For example, the  5%

limit  in  the  UK?  Or do we want to employ a one-broker  rule,

similar to that in force in the US?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, any timing differences which will disadvantage

minority  shareholders - the obligation to cancel shares  bought

back   is   helpful  but  is  there  still  room  for   possible

manipulation?   Ultimately,  the  key  is  efficiency   in   the

dissemination of information and transparency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, utilisation of distributable profits earned in

earlier years.  Should there be a time bar or will the 10% limit

to shares to be purchased be sufficient?

<br><br><i>Tax implications</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, a retail investor who sells his shares on

the  market  for  a profit does not pay any capital  gains  tax.

Will this remain the same when he sells his shares as part of  a

buy-back scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a listed company, Singapore Press Holdings,

embarked on a capital reduction exercise, which sought to return

$1.22  per share held.  It then transpired that out of the $1.22

capital returned, 52 cents were deemed as capital, and hence tax

free,   while  the  remaining  70  cents  were  treated   as   a

distribution of dividend, and hence taxable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this exercise is different from a buy-back scheme,

it is nonetheless instructive for us to study the tax angles. If

part  or  all of the share buy-back proceeds are deemed taxable,

how will the retail

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>

investor  know the difference?  Even if it were so,  would  this

unwittingly  lead to a two-tier market?  Or will companies  have

to  bear  the tax burden, which implicitly raises their purchase

costs?  It would appear that the simpler and more tax-consistent

it  is  for  the retail investor, the more successful and  well-accepted the scheme will be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues raised above are more details to be ironed

out  than grounds against the scheme.  Apart from putting in the

necessary   safeguards,  investor  education  will  be   equally

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I believe that once minority shareholders

understand the rationale behind the scheme and are assured  that

there  are  enough safeguards, they would embrace  the  buy-back

scheme  readily, as it would add another exciting  dimension  to

their investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I wish to support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to express

my support for this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation permitting companies to buy back or redeem

their  shares  from  shareholders has been  enacted  in  various

jurisdictions.  In principle, it is desirable for  companies  to

have   the  flexibility  and  power  to  do  so,  provided  that

shareholders and creditors are adequately protected.  Indeed, as

the  experience of other jurisdictions indicates, this power  to

buy  back  shares  has proved very useful to companies  and  has

generally  given rise to few problems.  I expect the  amendments

will   be   warmly  welcomed  by  the  business  and  investment

communities here in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many companies, the proposed amendments contained in this

Bill  will  provide  the  option  of  a  more  flexible  capital

structure on which real economic and financial advantages  could

be  obtained  if  the  power to repurchase shares  is  exercised

judiciously.  However, I have the following five points to raise

with  regard  to  whether  the proposed  amendments  will  allow

Singapore companies to achieve the maximum benefits that could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>

be  derived  from  having  share buy-back  legislation  of  this

nature, as well as whether the regulatory framework provided  by

the  proposed legislation will be able to protect creditors  and

shareholders of the company adequately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue I would like to raise relates to market

purchases  by  public  listed  companies.   Under  the  proposed

section  76E,  market  purchases  are  permitted  on  the  Stock

Exchange if the listed company has been authorised in advance by

its shareholders.  To obtain the authorisation, the company,  in

its notice of general meeting, has to specify among other things

the  maximum  price  which  may be paid  for  the  shares.   The

objective  of  this  requirement  seems  to  be  protection   of

shareholders' interest by placing a cap on the maximum amount of

funds  which  may be used for the purchases.  However,  this  is

open  to abuse and manipulation.   To add to the concerns of  my

colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, the proposed maximum price,  being

price sensitive information, will have an impact on the movement

of  the share price because it reflects management's view of the

performance and prospects of the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prices of securities are largely influenced by investor

confidence which can be boosted or shaken by management's action

or  announcement.  Management must therefore exercise great care

in  arriving at a proposed maximum price before disseminating to

the  shareholders by way of the notice of resolution.  Once  the

notice is released and publicised, investors will scrutinise the

proposal  and  come  to their own judgment about  the  company's

performance  and  prospects  even  before  the  holding  of  the

shareholders'  meeting where the directors have the  opportunity

to explain their views on the proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister, therefore, reconsider the merits of

requiring such a specific information as the maximum share price

to  be made known and weigh them against its potential for abuse

and  manipulation?   If  the  maximum  share  price  has  to  be

specified, I believe there should be rules or guidelines on  the

steps and precautions to be taken in determining

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>

this maximum price so that companies would not arbitrarily set a

price which is without basis and proper justification.   As this

issue relates to listed companies, perhaps the Stock Exchange of

Singapore  could incorporate the appropriate safeguards  in  its

regulations on market purchases by companies listed on the SES.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this issue of market purchases by listed

companies,  I  would like to propose that there should  also  be

some  safeguards  in relation to the execution of  the  buy-back

trades.  Will  the Minister consider imposing restrictions,  for

example,  that  a company cannot purchase its own  shares  at  a

price  higher than 5% above the average of the last share  price

recorded  on the last five days on which the shares were  traded

on  the  Stock  Exchange?  This will prevent  the  company  from

chasing the share price up and paying unnecessarily high  prices

in a volatile market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to the necessity of restricting

permitted  purchases to ordinary shares in  the  company.   This

point  has also been raised by my colleague, Mr Leong Horn  Kee.

The   term  "ordinary  shares"  has  not  been  defined  in  the

amendments nor in the principal Act, but would presumably  refer

to  voting  shares  or equity shares as compared  to  preference

shares  which carry special rights with respect to, for example,

repayment of capital, dividends and voting.  There does not seem

to  be  a  clear  reason why other shares,  perhaps  other  than

redeemable  preference shares, could not be repurchased  by  the

company.   However, while I believe that it may not be necessary

to  restrict share buy-backs to ordinary shares, I do think that

it is necessary to provide that only fully paid up shares may be

repurchased,  which  has  not been  expressly  provided  in  the

amendments.  Otherwise, creditors may lose a valuable  asset  on

liquidation  of  the  company, ie, of uncalled  capital  if  the

shares  which  have  been repurchased and  cancelled  were  only

partially paid up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, again I share Mr Leong's concern, under the

proposed amendments, a company can only purchase up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>

to  10%  of the issued share capital during the relevant period.

It  seems  that a cap of 10% is an arbitrary limit.  Given  that

one  of  the  reasons for a company to want  to  repurchase  the

shares  is  to  make  efficient use of the  surplus  funds,  and

circumstances  differ  from  one  company  to  the   next,   the

application  of such a fixed cap uniformly on all companies  may

be too inflexible.  Although having a limit may be prudent for a

start, this issue should be reviewed from time to time to  allow

for  a gradual liberalisation of the rules over time. This limit

should  be raised or lifted when companies become more  familiar

with  the buy-back procedure and when shareholders become better

able  to  evaluate  how proposed buy-back schemes  affect  their

interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point is in regard to the adequacy of the

proposed  provisions in safeguarding the interest of  creditors.

I  observe  that  the main protection afforded to  creditors  is

found in new section 76F(3) where every director or manager of a

company  who  approves or authorises the purchase or acquisition

of  the  company's  own  shares  knowing  that  the  company  is

insolvent  or will become insolvent as a result of the  purchase

is made personally and criminally liable.  However, the purchase

is  not  void nor voidable, and creditors will have to  sue  the

directors and managers in their personal capacity to recover the

shortfall.   This  may be cold comfort to the creditors  if  the

directors and managers are of shallow means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as mentioned by my colleague, Mrs Lim Hwee

Hua, I hope the Minister will clarify a number of related issues

on  the  taxation implications.  On the part of the company,  as

the  consideration  will  be paid out of distributable  profits,

does the company have to deduct tax at source as in the case for

dividend payment, or are there any situations where the purchase

of  shares could be regarded as something akin to a distribution

made as a result of reduction of the company's share capital and

hence not accessible to tax?  Lastly, if tax is to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>

deducted at source, could the individual shareholder obtain a

tax credit in respect of the amount deducted?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will enlighten us on these issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I am in support of the Bill. I

shall confine myself to the buy-back scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have mentioned earlier, other jurisdictions such

as  the  United  States, Australia and New Zealand, have similar

provisions.  This is to be welcomed as Singapore is behind time.

However,  there  are certain concerns which  I  would  like  the

Minister to address.  Both Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Ong Kian Min

have  mentioned about the 10% limitation.  I am aware  that  the

Minister may, by Gazette notification, increase this limitation,

but I wonder why the 10% was picked up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue that has to be resolved - I think Mrs

Lim  Hwee  Hua has also raised this point - is this question  of

taxation, which is very important.  Whether there is going to be

tax  liability,  I  think both the public and the  companies  at

large  must  know  beforehand what is the  Minister's  stand  on

taxation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the price of shares is sensitive information, the

regulation  must be drafted in such a way that  members  of  the

public  are protected, especially now that there is a  depressed

market  in Singapore, any buy-back scheme must ensure  that  the

minority interests are protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another issue which I would like to raise.

Although  at  a  company's general meeting, notices  are  to  be

given, it would be prudent to have a proper advertisement in the

newspapers  to announce any scheme of this nature, so  that  the

public  as  well  as the members of the company  will  be  in  a

position  to  respond to this.  In this case,  I  refer  to  new

section 76C.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue which I would like to find out from

the  Minister is this.  The role which the Stock Exchange  would

be  playing  is very important.  So far, I think it  is  to  the

credit  of our Stock Exchange scheme that we have a fairly  open

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>

transparent market.  It is very important for the Stock Exchange

of  Singapore to see that this provision is regulated in such  a

way that there is no abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  allowing  me to join in the debate  on  the  Companies

(Amendment) Bill.  Before I proceed, I would like to declare  my

interest on the subject matter.  I am a practising solicitor and

would  have  in the course of my work to advise clients  on  the

Companies Act, including the amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, apart from taking the opportunity to clarify

certain provisions of the Act, is radical in nature as it  seeks

to   introduce   share  buy-back  schemes   into   our   company

legislation.  Up until now, a general rule in the company law is

that a company may not return any assets to its members while it

is  a  going  concern,  except in the  form  of  dividends  paid

generally out of profits.  As it is commonly understood, when  a

company  is  liquidated, the shareholders are the  last  to  get

their  money back.  The creditors will get their payments  first

before  the  shareholders  get anything.   Accordingly,  if  the

shareholders  are  allowed to get their monies  back  first,  it

would  reverse  the order of payment as it is understood  for  a

company  in  liquidation, and this would  not  be  fair  to  the

creditors.   When a creditor does business with the company,  he

does so on the faith that the capital shall be applied only  for

the purpose of business and he has therefore the right to say to

the  company  that  the company must keep the  capital  and  not

return it to the shareholders.  Otherwise, the creditor will not

have  faith  nor confidence to do business with the company  and

commerce,  as we know it, may not have taken off to  the  extent

that we see it today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that the Companies Act has a rather

strict  regimen  to  ensure  the maintenance  of  capital  in  a

company.   This  is seen, for instance, in general  prohibitions

against  providing  financial  assistance  in  the  purchase  or

acquisition of a company's shares without strictly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>

observing the proper procedures and reduction of capital without

getting  the court's sanction.  These restrictions are generally

meant to provide safeguard for the creditors of a company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, does the introduction of share buy-back schemes fly in

the  face of all that the company laws seek to do, that  is,  to

protect  the  interest  of  creditors through  the  doctrine  of

maintenance  of  capital?  Sir, I think  not.   Looking  at  the

overall  scheme of the proposed share buy-back provisions  under

the Bill, one gets the impression that the objective of the Bill

is  not  to  return capital at the expense of creditors  but  to

ensure  the  proper management of a company's capital.   At  the

moment,  a  company may pay off any paid-up capital by returning

that  which  is  in excess of the needs of the  company  or  the

company  may  reduce  the paid-up value of  the  shares  in  the

company  and  reflect what is left of the capital after  it  has

been  reduced  by  trading losses.  To  achieve  this  end,  the

company  would have to go through the relative inconvenience  of

having  to  petition to the court to get its  approval  and  the

process  is subject to the right of the creditors to  object  to

the reduction of capital.  Besides reduction of capital does not

necessarily  reduce the total number of members of the  company.

What  the reduction does is that it uses paid-up capital  across

the  board.   In  other  words, reduction of  capital  does  not

necessarily  achieve  the  objective of  reducing  the  absolute

number of shareholders in a company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as proposed, the share buy-back scheme allows a

company  to manage its capital more effectively.  A company  may

want  to  buy back its own shares for many reasons.  This  would

include,  for  instance,  a desire to  return  surplus  cash  to

shareholders  so  that  the capital may be  put  to  better  use

elsewhere  or to increase earnings per share or net  assets  per

share, or to increase the marketability of the company's shares,

or perhaps defend the company against possible takeovers.  Where

the  company intends to reduce the capital of the company or the

shareholder base of the company, the share buy-back

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>

scheme  allows the management the additional option  to  achieve

the   objective  without  the  necessary  inconvenience  of  the

existing arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, share buy-back schemes were introduced much earlier in

a  number  of countries. These countries include, for  instance,

the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong.  The

application  of share buy-back scheme in these jurisdictions  is

becoming   increasingly  widespread   these   days.    In   some

jurisdictions such as the United States, the shares  subject  to

re-purchase  are taken out of circulation but remain  in  issue.

In  others,  shares which have been re-purchased are  cancelled.

Whatever  the  approach, the economic  outcome  is  similar.   A

reduction  in the number of shares in circulation is  likely  to

increase  in the value of the remaining shares arising from  the

interplay  of supply and demand factors.  Additionally,  if  the

earning  potential remains relatively undiminished, the earnings

per share will increase and, in theory, that should increase the

share price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as existing creditors go, the Bill seeks to protect

their interest in a number of ways.  First, no more than 10%  of

the  shares  may  be  purchased by the  company  or  such  other

percentages  as are allowed by the Minister.  Its limitation  to

10%  of  share  capital serves to ensure limited reduction  each

time.  Secondly, there is a requirement that shares can only  be

bought  out  of  the  profits  of  the  company.   Thirdly,  the

directors and officers must be satisfied that the company is not

insolvent at the time of the purchase of the shares.   The  Bill

says a company is insolvent if  (i) it cannot pay its debt as it

falls due or (ii) the value of the company's assets is less than

the  value of its liabilities, including contingent liabilities.

If  the company fails either of the two tests, it is regarded as

insolvent  and cannot do a share buy-back scheme.  By  insisting

that  the purchase price may only be paid out of the profits  of

the  company, the creditors at least can have the assurance that

shareholders cannot simply declare a return of capital to  their

detriment.  Through this, the share

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>

buy-back scheme is able to achieve flexibility of capital

management with minimal risk of compromising any party's

interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I note that the Government has taken measures to

ensure  that  the shareholders and the creditors  are  protected

under  the  Bill, I do have a number of concerns which  I  would

like to point out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, by allowing the share buy-back, companies may be

encouraged to return surplus capital instead of using the  money

for  high-yielding  investment  opportunities.   The  return  of

surplus  capital  may  be  an  indication  of  weakness  in  the

corporation's strategic plan and the return of capital may  just

serve to exacerbate that weakness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, by reducing its working capital through the share

buy-back  programme,  the proportion of  debt  would  invariably

increase  in  the  company's  capital  structure.   This   would

increase the company's financial risk.  We should also note that

the   share   buy-back  results  in  an  indirect  transfer   of

bondholders'  wealth to the shareholders.   This  is  applicable

especially  to companies that use long-term debt as  a  form  of

financing.   By  buying back shares, the company  is,  in  fact,

increasing  its gearing ratio while reducing the  proportion  of

its  financing  through equity.  Because of the  increase  in  a

company's  financial  risk,  the bonds  are  now  riskier.   But

bondholders are not compensated for the higher risk with  higher

coupon  interest.  This would invariably make  bond  issuing  in

such an environment less attractive and in the long term, it may

impact on our Government's effort to develop the bond market  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, share buy-back schemes increase the risk of

triggering the provisions of Rule 33 of the Takeover Code  which

compels  the making of a takeover bid if the party concerned  is

left  with  holding  25% or more of the shares  and  unwittingly

acquires  shares which are in excess of the relevant  threshold.

In  such an event, the shareholders may not be prepared to mount

a takeover bid.  To avoid such a possibility, it may be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>

necessary  to  ask  for waiver in advance  from  the  Securities

Industry Council or the Minister.  Additionally, in the case  of

listed  companies,  a shareholder may not  by  choice  become  a

substantial shareholder in a company but become one as a  result

of  the  share  buy-back  scheme.  The consequence  of  being  a

substantial shareholder is that his identity would  have  to  be

disclosed to the public.  Now, Sir, not everyone would  like  to

have  their identity disclosed as substantial shareholders in  a

listed company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in most other jurisdictions, share buy-backs are

generally  regarded as positive information.  As a  result,  the

share   price   would  tend  to  rise  upon  a  share   buy-back

announcement.  Because of this, I am concerned, as was expressed

by  several  of  my colleagues earlier, that the  potential  for

insider  dealing may arise.  Quite obviously, those with  inside

information may be tempted to trade on the shares before the buy-back  scheme is announced.  A curious situation may  also  arise

where  the  company engaging in share buy-back may be  privy  to

price-sensitive information.  For instance, what if the  company

was working on a major invention which it knows would affect the

share  value  and  which  it  intends  to  announce  after   the

completion of the share buy-back scheme?  Would the Minister say

that  the company is engaging in insider dealing?  Additionally,

there  is always the possibility of manipulation by unscrupulous

managers  trying to prop up their share prices due to  a  market

downturn  or poor intrinsic value.  Alternatively, managers  and

directors  with share option schemes may prop up  the  value  of

their  options by initiating price buy-back schemes not for  the

benefit  of  the  company  but  for  their  own  benefit.    The

consequent rise in value of the shares will substantially profit

these managers.  I would like to ask of the Minister whether  he

would  consider  managers  initiating  share  buy-back  for  the

purpose  of enhancing the value of their stock options as  being

engaging in acts of market manipulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I have expressed some reservations, it is not to

be taken to mean that I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>

do  not  support the Bill.  On balance, I think the benefits  of

the share buy-back outweigh the risks.  At the moment, there are

adequate safeguards to deal with this concern.  So long  as  the

Government  continues to promote transparency within  the  legal

framework  of  our companies, both in the business dealings  and

the  shareholders'  structure,  the  integrity  of  our  company

legislation  should  not  be compromised  as  a  result  of  the

introduction of a share buy-back provision.  I would, therefore,

support the Companies (Amendment) Bill as a matter of policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having stated my general support for the Bill, there

are, however, a few minor drafting details that I would like  to

touch on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend the definition

of  "interest  in  the shares of a company" in section  7(4)  to

increase the threshold upon which a person is deemed to have  an

interest  in  a  body corporate from 15% to 20%  of  the  voting

power.  In the present form, section 7(4) has often caused  much

confusion.   The often asked question is whether in  a  circular

fashion, the section applies to shareholders of a company who is

deemed  to  have  an  interest in the  shares  by  virtue  of  a

potentially unlimited change of 15% interest.  In a way,  clause

2  of the Bill seeks to overcome that by making it clear in  the

notes  that the purpose was "to restrict its application to  not

more than one level".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am happy to learn that the Ministry has

recognised  the need to clarify the application of  the  present

section  7(4),  I  submit that the draftsman has  not  gone  far

enough.   In  fact, I would say that the proposed  provision  is

still unclear.  Rather than restricting the application to  just

one  tier, when read literally, there is a possibility that  the

clause  may  apply to more than one tier.  The  clause  provides

that  the person shall have an interest in the share in which  a

body  has  an interest in if, inter alia, the body corporate  is

accustomed,  whether  formally  or  informally,  to  acting   in

accordance with the directions of the person concerned.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In using the word "informal", one would have much

difficulty  in  applying the provision with precision.   In  its

ordinary   meaning,  it  is  conceivable  that  the   management

consultant  to  a company, which habitually acts  in  accordance

with  the  management consultant's direction, may also  have  an

interest in the shares of the company that the company is deemed

to  have  an interest in.  Will the Minister explain if this  is

the intention of the Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the words "controlling interest" are used to

determine  if the person has an interest in the body  corporate.

There  is, however, no definition of what the words "controlling

interest"  mean.   Would  the Minister clarify  what  the  words

"controlling  interest" mean, having regard to the  use  of  the

proportion  of  shares as being more than 20%  in  the  proposed

section   4A?    Does  "controlling  interest"  therefore   mean

something more than the percentage of voting rights attached  to

the  shares?   If it does, will the Minister please  explain  to

this House what these interests are?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 sets out the new sections 76B to 76G of the Act

which relate to the share buy-back scheme.  In the new sections,

the  words "ordinary shares" are used.  Ordinary shares  in  the

Act  are rather not defined words.  Presumably, ordinary  shares

are   used  to  exclude  redeemable  preference  shares  or  any

preference shares for that matter.  Does it therefore mean that,

apart  from preference shares, the provision of the new  section

76B  will  be  applicable  to all classes  of  ordinary  shares,

irrespective of whether or not there are further differentiation

within  those  classes  of  ordinary  shares?   How  would   the

definition of equal access scheme apply in cases where different

classes of ordinary shares have been created?

The  new  section 76C (2) provides, inter alia, that the  notice

specifying the intention to propose the resolution to  authorise

an  off-market  purchase referred to in the  earlier  subsection

must, among other things, determine the maximum

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>

price  which may be paid for the shares.  On a plain reading  of

the  Bill, one wonders how a notice can determine the  price  of

shares.  Does it mean that the notice must state how the maximum

price  of the shares is to be determined?  In its present  form,

the expression does seem a little odd.  Sir, I think it would be

more  accurate to describe the notice as specifying the  maximum

price  of  shares rather than determining the maximum  price  of

shares, as is presently stated in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same comments apply to new section 76E (2) (b) as well. New

section  76C  (4) also provides that the authority for  an  off-market  purchase referred to in the section may,  from  time  to

time,  be varied or revoked by the company in a general meeting.

Having  provided for such powers, the new provision is, however,

unclear  as  to  what  happens  after  those  powers  have  been

exercised  by  the company.  Does it mean that everything  which

has  already  been done prior to the revocation or variation  of

the powers is no longer valid to the extent of the variation  or

revocation?  The same comments apply to section 76E (5) as well.

Finally, new section 76C (6) defines an "equal access scheme" as

one which, inter alia, satisfies the requirements of all persons

having  a reasonable opportunity to accept offers made to  them.

The  use  of  the  term "reasonable opportunity"  may  introduce

uncertainty into the legislation. It may be better to  introduce

a  fixed minimum period during which the offer is open.  If left

as it is, it may be open to each individual shareholder to argue

that,   given  its  present  circumstance,  he  was  not   given

reasonable opportunity to accept the offer.  Additionally,  with

respect to new section 76C(6)(c), it may be neater if the  words

"that  there  shall  be disregarded" be deleted  and  substitute

therefor  with  the  word "for". This would  make  the  drafting

simpler and neater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have chosen to confine my comments principally to the

share  buy back scheme and I would like the Minister to  respond

to these comments.  But for the comments, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we are in search of

lighter  regulation to provide more freedom for  businesses  and

companies in Singapore to liberalise without creating an  unfair

market  or  a market which people can take advantage of,  to  do

unfair things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, we realise that we are letting go of

some  of  the  institutions  of  old.  We  are  letting  go   of

Government's close supervision, to some degree, and are deciding

to rely on some other institutions more. We are also letting go,

among the choice of institutions, of the Court's since the share

buy  back scheme will reduce the role of restructuring under the

Court's  supervision.  The institutions we  then  turn  to  will

increasingly  be  the  SES and, more than  that,  the  investing

public,  and  we have an increasing number of citizens  who  are

using their private funds, their CPF funds, for this purpose  to

create a citizenry who are also shareholders in our companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, with this background, turn to my concerns regarding

disclosure and transparency as regards the share buy back scheme

and  the deeming provision.  Let me try to avoid repeating  many

of the points my colleagues before me have made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern with the share buy back scheme is that it is

possible  that  it may be open to price manipulation.   This  is

primarily because the investing public often does not know  what

is  happening when a buy back starts to happen.  The  provisions

in  the  Act  provide that notice be given to  the  Registry  of

Companies  (ROC).  However, I think that in the climate  of  the

small investors in Singapore, this may be insufficient. The  SES

undoubtedly will also make the buy back decisions known  to  the

mass  net.  But again, this might not be enough since  the  mass

net goes to mainly people with seats in the Stock Exchange.   It

might not reach the smaller investor.  The smaller investor then

will  see the price go up or down and the volumes go up and down

and  there  might be some sort of psychological effect  on  them

which  they  may  not understand.  They might  therefore  follow

blindly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as regards the share buy back scheme, clearly the

Bill  is  on good ground in providing that for listed companies,

this  must be bought from the open market.  However, Sir,  there

are  two dangers.  The first is of a bail out.  Even though  you

buy  in  an open market, it depends on who has made, what shares

are  available.  There may therefore be a danger  of  collusions

whereby major shareholders in need of funding make their  shares

available at exactly the right time.  The Minister might respond

that  these  possible  collusions would  be  tackled  under  the

general  insider trading rules.  However, it seems  to  me  that

these   rules  may  not  be  themselves  sufficient  since   the

information of when a company buy back will happen may not in  a

sense  be price sensitive since the price is pretty much  fixed.

It  is  more a question of when the shares are available  rather

than what price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to make about the share buy back is the

opposite  effect.  Rather  than  having  a  bail-out  of   major

shareholders,  there is in fact the effect of consolidating  and

increasing  the  effective holdings of the bigger  shareholders.

And  here I share the concern of Mr Sin Boon Ann that this  will

effectively   increase   the   percentage   held   by    certain

shareholders.   And  the question is whether the  Takeover  Code

would be triggered.  This is not clear, since section 213(3)  of

the  Companies Act provides that the effect must be of acquiring

effective control, that  is, acquiring shares.  In the event  of

a  share  buy back, the shareholder does not acquire any  shares

but,  nevertheless,  may find himself put  above  the  statutory

limit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point relates to the deeming provision. As Mr Sin has

said, it is good for clarity in this issue that for too long, we

have   been  concerned  that  deeming  provision  upon   deeming

provision   will  lead  to endless tiers  of  deemed  interests.

However,  there  is some concern that we may be  moving  in  the

opposite direction of greater transparency.  This is because  we

will  be  using one tier only. It will be more possible to  have

shell  companies.   With  these comments,  I  leave  it  to  the

Minister.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all

speakers   have  expressed  some  similar  concerns  about   the

provisions  of  the  Bill.   I  will  deal  with  each   speaker

separately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee has asked whether we should not allow the

buy   back scheme to be extended to all shares rather than  just

ordinary shares.  The reason why ordinary shares were stipulated

is  because  they form the bulk of the shares issued.   Although

the  number of preference shares is not insignificant,  what  we

are  really  talking  about  are the  non-redeemable  preference

shares where such a provision of buy back might be extended  to.

For  the  time being, the proposal is to confine it to  ordinary

shares until we gain more experience in this particular process.

Generally,  I would say that the provisions are on  the  prudent

side  because  of our lack of experience in administrating  such

changes. We have perhaps over provided for the protection of the

small  shareholders  at the expense of flexibility.  Hence,  the

limitation  of the share buy back to 10%  for each instance  and

the  cap  on  the  price movement of 5% of the average  of  five

preceding  days'  share prices.  Also, there  is  the  need  for

shareholders'  approval on the maximum share  prices  allowable.

All this may sound restrictive, but they are designed to protect

smaller  investors who may not be familiar with  the  procedures

and,  therefore,  may  not comprehend the implications  if  more

flexibility is introduced into the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come next to Mrs Lim Hwee Hua. She is concerned that the buy

back  scheme itself may trigger a signal to outsiders that there

is  something basically wrong with the company for it to want to

buy back its own shares. Is that the concern?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> No. It is more a signal of how management

itself  feels  about the value of the prevailing  share  prices.

They may think it is undervalued.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> One of the main reasons for companies

deciding  to  buy  back its shares is that  it  has  accumulated

substantial excess capital which it finds

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>

difficult  to  place  into attractive  investments.   I  do  not

believe  - unless you are suggesting collusion - that an average

company  would rush around to buy back its shares  without  good

reasons.  It could be either because it has got more money  than

it  knows what to do with, and therefore it is better to  return

part of these to shareholders who may then wish to re-invest  in

other things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned as to whether there are

adequate safeguards to ensure that the company insiders  do  not

manipulate for personal advantage.  Unlike some countries  which

do  not  impose  limits on the number of  shares  which  can  be

repurchased  each  time,  we  have  imposed  a  rule  that  such

purchases  should be limited to 10% of share capital.   The  10%

limit for share repurchase will minimise the potential and scope

for  management  to manipulate benchmarks such as  earnings  per

share  and  the price earnings ratio.  If a company is  in  fact

making  losses,  repurchasing the shares will  not  improve  its

earnings  related  benchmarks.  And if a company is making  only

modest  profits,  a 10% share repurchase will  not  inflate  its

earnings related benchmarks noticeably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other safeguard which we have introduced is to allow

buy   backs  only  to  be  made  out  of  distributable  profits

accumulated  over  time.  It also requires  prior  shareholders'

approval, and there is an insolvency test. I believe that  under

the  present rules, there are sufficient safeguards  to  prevent

abuse.  Of  course,  in administering this particular  amendment

over time and as we acquire more experience, there may be a case

for reviewing some of these rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned that management may be

spending more time in managing share prices than in managing the

business itself.  I can only comment that you cannot stop  this.

Whether  you have a share buy back purchase scheme  or  not,  if

management is inclined to do this, they will do it anyway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked whether there should be a cap. We

have in fact imposed a cap of 5% as in the UK, rather

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>

than follow the one-broker rule which is prevalent in the United

States.  This was decided on after consultations with the  Stock

Exchange  of  Singapore, the Association of Banks  and  the  Law

Society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned whether timing differences

will  disadvantage minority shareholders.  One way to avoid this

is  to require that repurchased shares  be cancelled immediately

on purchase.  In addition, listed companies will  be required by

the  SES  listings  rules, which are yet to be  implemented,  to

disclose all details of these repurchases, including the  number

of  shares  bought  and  the prices paid  before  the  start  of

trading on the following business day. Also, section 103 of  the

Securities  Industry Act prohibits the company's  directors  and

other  insiders from dealing in the company's shares  when  they

are  in  possession of price sensitive information.   This  will

help  ensure  that insiders do not deal in the company's  shares

when  they  have  privileged information such as  the  time  and

number of shares to be purchased on any particular day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked whether there should not be a

time  bar  on  the distributable profits.  I think there  is  no

reason to impose a time bar.  All the distributable profits  are

in  fact  profits  which  the company  could  have  declared  as

dividends.   So,  to  put  a  time  bar  on  it  does  not  seem

reasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked whether there are tax implications. The

rule  is that companies will be allowed to buy back shares  only

out  of  distributable profits.  Therefore, consistent with  the

current practice of companies on the payment of dividends out of

distributable  profits, shares brought back out of distributable

profits  will  also  require franking under section  44  of  the

Income Tax Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern about the tax treatment of shares

sold  on the open market when the seller of such shares may  not

know  the  tax  implications.  The  tax  rules  here  are  quite

complicated.   But  the  basic principle  is  that  if  a  share

purchase  is  done in the open market, then the  seller  of  the

shares would have been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>

deemed  to  have  sold  the shares and it  is  a  capital  gain.

Whereas if the shares are bought under a special arrangement  on

an  equal  pro  rata  basis, it is deemed as equivalent  to  the

distribution of dividends and is therefore subject to tax.  IRAS

will be issuing tax rules on this shortly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min wanted to know why preference shares are

not  included  in  the share buy back scheme.   I  have  already

explained this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also wants to know whether the limit of 10% on each

share  buy back proposal can be reviewed from time to  time.   I

can  assure the House that this will be done.  What we  need  is

some working experience before we decide to make changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our proposed rules, companies must notify

shareholders  of  the authority given to the  directors  of  the

company for a share buy back exercise in which the maximum price

to  be  paid  will have to be specified, including  the  maximum

number  of  shares  which  can be  acquired.    The  reason  for

imposing such a condition is a safeguard to ensure that minority

shareholders' interests are protected.  It is not  possible  for

Government  itself to determine what the rules  for  determining

the  maximum  price  should be, and this must  be  left  to  the

shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards risk of manipulation by directors in a situation

where  the company runs the risk of becoming insolvent, I  think

the  penalties  imposed on such activity are sufficiently  penal

for  directors  not  to  want to engage in  such  practices.   A

director or manager who approves a buy back scheme knowing  that

the  company will become insolvent as a result of the  buy  back

will  be  guilty of a criminal offence liable on  conviction  to

imprisonment  not  exceeding 12 months  or  a  maximum  fine  of

$5,000.   In  addition, they will be personally  liable  to  the

creditors  of  the company to the extent by which  the  purchase

consideration exceeded the distributable profits.  I think these

are sufficient deterrents to discourage such activity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has asked an extensive number of questions

on  matters of detail.  I will try to answer as many of them  as

possible.  But before doing so, I would like to point  out  that

these amendments to the Companies Act are not comprehensive.  We

are  engaged  in a massive exercise in which the  Companies  Act

will  be  amended over a series of occasions.  And what is  left

undone on this occasion, we will have opportunity to review them

in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has suggested in a general way that the return

of  surplus capital to the shareholders may indicate a  weakness

on  the  part  of  management.  While  this  is,  of  course,  a

possibility,  I  think  the  general experience  has  been  that

companies  would  only buy back shares if they have  substantial

amounts  of  surplus  capital which they are  unable  to  deploy

effectively.   And  shareholders and purchasers  of  shares  can

quickly see through the intent of management if it is otherwise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned that the share buy back scheme

will increase the debt equity ratio of a company.  While this is

a  possibility, we have introduced a safeguard to allow only 10%

to  be  purchased on each occasion.  For the time being, I think

this is an adequate safeguard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned that the share buy back may

create problems, triggering off takeover provisions when the 25%

limit is inadvertently hit due to the share buy back process.  I

would  like  to  inform the Member that the Securities  Industry

Council  (SIC)  is  now  crafting some  rules  to  address  this

particular problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insider trading is also a question which has been raised.

The  prevention  of insider trading, we believe,  is  adequately

covered under section 103 of the Securities Industry Act  (SIA).

The  provision  prevents a company from trading in  shares  when

their   directors  and  officers  are  in  possession  of  price

sensitive  information  not yet disclosed  to  the  public.   By

buying back its shares prior to public disclosure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>

of such information, the company will obviously be in breach of

the SIA prevention of insider trading provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned over the possibility of

directors and managers buying back shares for their own purposes

and therefore engaging in market manipulation.  I should like to

point  out that unscrupulous management could manipulate  shares

in  other  ways without the buy back scheme.  However,  the  10%

rule  which  we  have imposed will minimise  the  potential  for

manipulation   because   a  10%  share   repurchase   will   not

significantly  affect  the share value of  the  company.   Also,

there  is  a  limit  on the amount of shares which  it  can  buy

because  it  is  limited  to the distributable  profits  of  the

company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to other provisions of the Act, the Member is

also  concerned that the provision of "deemed interest"  can  go

beyond one tier, in the case of a person having an interest in a

share  in which a body corporate has an interest in if the  body

corporate person is accustomed formally or informally to act  in

accordance with the direction of the person concerned.  He  also

wants to know whether the term "controlling interest" will spell

definitional problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the hon. Member is right. It is precisely the

intention  of  the provision to catch such situations.   In  the

case described by the Member, the application of deemed interest

can  go beyond one tier.  As for controlling interest, the  term

has long standing use in the Companies Act.  To my knowledge, it

has not encountered such problems in practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other matters of detail which the hon. Member has

raised.   I  will  not answer them in detail but,  generally,  I

would say that any items he has raised which are of significance

will be taken care of in future amendments to the Act.  Again, I

would  reiterate that the proposed amendments to  the  Act  have

been consulted extensively with the Corporate Finance Committee,

the  Association  of  Banks of Singapore,  the  Singapore  Stock

Exchange, the Law Society and other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>

interested  parties.   So  it covers  most  areas  of  interest.

However, there are bound to be gaps in detail which we will take

care of next time when we amend the Act again.

<div align="center"><h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a straightforward Bill. It makes two

amendments to the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers)

Act (Cap 217). Their objectives are to simplify procedures under

the  Act  and avoid duplication of effort and risk of  conflicts

between Parliament and the Courts.

The first amendment facilitates the recovery of fines imposed by

Parliament  in exercise of its penal jurisdiction.   The  second

amendment  improves procedures to allow Parliament to deal  more

expeditiously with contempt if one of its committees has already

investigated into the matter.

<br><br><i>Recovery of fines</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the first amendment on recovery of fines.

Currently, section 23(2) of the Act provides that fines  imposed

by  Parliament have to be sued for in a civil Court first before

they  could be recovered from the errant party.  This  procedure

is  not  satisfactory as it wastes the Court's time  and  incurs

unnecessary cost for the State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 23 of the Act does not define the role which the

Court  should play in presiding over a suit to recover the fines

as a civil debt.  If the Court's role is merely to formalise the

fine   imposed  by  Parliament  into  a  judgement,  it  is   an

unnecessary duplication of work.  If it enables the person fined

to contest the legality of the fine, it would amount to allowing

the  Court  to  overrule the decision of  Parliament.   The  law

should  avoid any possible conflict between Parliament  and  the

Courts.   For this reason, our Courts have held that  Parliament

has  the  right to control its own proceedings and regulate  its

own internal affairs without interference from the Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 23 of the Act to make

any  fine imposed by Parliament recoverable as though  it  is  a

judgement debt due to the Government, that is to say, a  sum  of

money ordered by a Court as payable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amendment, it would no longer be necessary to

first sue for the fine before recovering it.  Writs of execution

as  well as bankruptcy proceedings may immediately be instituted

if the offender

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>

fails  to pay up the fine imposed by Parliament by the due date.

The  amendment  would facilitate the recovery of  fines  by  the

Attorney-General on behalf of the State.

<br><br><i>Contempt</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the second amendment on contempt. Currently,

under  section  21(1)  and  (2) of the  Parliament  (Privileges,

Immunities  and Powers) Act, Parliament can deal with  incidents

of contempt in the following ways:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) deal summarily with the offender;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) refer the matter to a Select Committee for investigation and

report;  or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) refer the matter to the Attorney-General with a view to

instituting criminal proceedings against the person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the matter is referred to a Select Committee,

Parliament on receiving the Select Committee's report,  has  the

further  option  of either dealing with the offender  itself  or

referring  the  matter to the Attorney-General with  a  view  to

prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option to refer the matter to the Attorney-General with

a  view  to  prosecution in Court after a Select  Committee  has

dealt with it is unnecessary.  It has no discernible benefit and

only lengthens the process.  Parliament already has the power to

punish for contempt.  This is a proper exercise of parliamentary

authority.  The punishments are set out in the Act.  This option

is  also circuitous as Parliament could have in the first  place

referred  the  matter to the Attorney-General instead  of  to  a

Select   Committee.   It  is  better  for  Parliament  to   deal

expeditiously  with  the  matter  after  the  Select   Committee

produces its Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option could also result in uneasy relations between

Parliament  and the Judiciary.  This arises when the  matter  is

referred  to  the  Attorney-General with a view  to  prosecution

after a Select Committee has already investigated into

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>

the  matter. Police investigations would have to be carried  out

afresh.  There could be the possibility that, at the end of  the

day,  the  Courts may rule that no offence of contempt has  been

committed  despite Parliament's decision to send the  matter  to

the  Attorney-General with a view to prosecution.  The principle

that  any  possible conflict between the Courts  and  Parliament

should  be avoided is applicable here.  As I have said  earlier,

our  Courts  have held that Parliament has the right to  control

its  own  proceedings and regulate its internal affairs  without

interference from the Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the rationale for referring cases to the

Attorney-General  with  a  view  to  prosecution  is  no  longer

relevant.  This bifurcated procedure was introduced in 1962 when

Parliament  was  then  expressly  prohibited  by  the  Act  from

exercising  powers  of committal, ie, imprisonment.   Also,  the

penalties that the Courts could mete out for offences under  the

Act  were then much higher.  It was therefore necessary then  to

retain  an  avenue  to the Courts so that the  higher  penalties

could  be  handed down by the Courts in appropriately bad  cases

involving  contempt based on the Select Committee's Report.   In

1986,  the Act was amended to confer on Parliament the power  to

commit  persons  for contempt and to fine them  up  to  $50,000.

With  these  enhanced  powers to deal with contempt,  Parliament

would no longer need to refer such cases for prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 21 of the Act to remove

the option of referring a complaint of contempt to the Attorney-General  for prosecution if that complaint has already been  the

subject of investigation by a Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments would, however, not remove from Parliament

the  power  to  refer a matter directly to the  Attorney-General

with   a  view  to  prosecution  where  it  is  considered  more

appropriate for the offender to be dealt with by the Courts.

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, the privileges of debate in this House

against defamation and other proceedings in court are well known

and  enjoyed  by  Members here.  This is very important  because

this  Chamber should be open to all ideas, free of the  chilling

effect  of  possible legal suit.  Less well-known, Sir,  is  the

fact that these privileges are extended in a qualified manner to

members  of the public, ordinary citizens, who choose  to  speak

before our Select Committees.  This is confirmed by the case  of

Sivadas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present amendments now try to reconcile, as the

Minister has said, a possible clash between the courts,  on  the

one  hand,  and  this House, on the other.   I  think  that,  in

principle, this is correct.  As far as Members of Parliament go,

I  have  no  objections.  We, as Members of Parliament,  whether

elected,  nominated, NCMPs, should know the rules.   My  concern

relates more to non-MPs, non-Members of the House, who choose to

come  before  the  House  to provide  their  opinion  in  Select

Committee affairs.  In such cases, if the House should choose to

decide to cite such persons for contempt, Parliament would be in

effect  a  judge  in  its  own cause.  The  hearings  would  not

necessarily be public and this House, if I may say,  is  clearly

numerically dominated by one party.  For such people, members of

the  public, I think we have to ask ourselves whether they  know

the kind of possibilities that face them when they come before a

Select  Committee.  I do not, of course, mean that  they  should

shy  away  from  doing  their citizens'  duties.   But  I  would

encourage the Minister, in moving this amendment, to follow this

up  with  the  assistance  of  the  Speaker  in  providing  more

information to those who come before Select Committees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question then comes off: would these members

of the public be better off being judged by the courts?  I think

that  is  not necessarily the case because the court itself,  as

the Minister has said, has decided that this House should be the

judge  of its own proceedings, its own internal affairs.  But  I

would caution the House in reaching this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>

conclusion, the decision of the court related to a Member of

Parliament, and not a member of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards members of the public who come before this House

and  might  commit contempt and might therefore  be  subject  to

proceedings by this House, I would encourage this House  to  be,

first,  judicious and sparing in the use of its powers  when  we

close  off the possible avenue of using the courts and,  second,

liberal  in recognising the right of ordinary citizens to  speak

and  give  their  opinions  before  this  House  in  its  Select

Committee  meetings, even if it disagrees with  the  sentiments,

provided  of course that such sentiments do not amount to  gross

contempt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Tay is

concerned  about strangers coming before a Select Committee  and

not  knowing the rules on how to conduct themselves and  whether

the  freedom  to  speak before a Committee is being  conscribed,

just because they do not know the rules.  Let me assure him that

he need not have such worry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, when the Clerk of Parliament advertises

in the press asking for submissions, he has already warned would-be  representors  that they should not publish any  evidence  or

documents  they  have given to the Select Committee  before  the

Select  Committee finalises its report.  That is in one  of  the

paragraphs in the advertisement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person comes before a Select Committee, we treat him

very  gently, kindly and considerately.  We do not brow beat  or

shout  at  him.  We treat him like any member of the public  who

wants  to give his views to us and we welcome his views.  It  is

only  when  he has started to wander around and not  follow  the

rules  that  the Speaker would definitely try to put the  person

back  and say, "Look, that is not the way to do things.   Please

let  me  give you some advice.  Do not stray beyond  the  point.

Tell us the truth and be honest about it."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members remember the case of Dr Chee Soon Juan, in one

of  our  Select Committee hearings, he talked about health  care

costs  and presented papers and data.   Eventually, that  matter

led  to  a complaint to the Committee of Priviledges.   Even  at

that  Committee of Privileges, he was given a lot of  leeway  by

the  Chairman of the Committee.  But in the end, he  decided  to

carry  on  with  his  way and resulted  in  him  and  his  other

colleagues being fined by Parliament for committing perjury  and

fabrication of data, etc.  So anyone who comes before  a  Select

Committee, we will be very kind to him.  We will guide  him  and

the  Chairman  would give him a lot of leeway  before  he  makes

further mistakes. So we need not worry about strangers not being

able to speak freely before a Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, whatever evidence they give to a Select

Committee is also protected by the privileges of the Act, and in

the  case of Sivadas, as Mr Tay mentioned, he wrote a submission

to the Select Committee on the Companies (Amendment) Bill and he

made many comments.  As a result, some people took him to court.

He  finally petitioned to the Petitions Committee which  decided

to leave it to the Court.  The Court decided that his submission

is  protected under the privileges of the Act and therefore  the

plaintiff lost the case.  So the public can be rest assured that

if  they speak up, they should not fear that their views will be

conscribed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Bill before

the House today seeks to amend the Employment of Foreign Workers

Act   to   provide  for  the  taking  and  recording  of  finger

impressions of foreign workers working in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the onset of the current economic downturn, there has

been  increasing incidence of illegal employment.  For the first

eight  months  of  this  year, more than 2,000  foreigners  were

caught  working illegally without valid work permits.   This  is

more  than  twice the number of such cases for the corresponding

period  last year.  Furthermore, an increasing number of illegal

workers  were found to be immigration offenders.  In  fact,  for

the first eight months of this year, 50% of illegal workers were

also  immigration  offenders  compared  to  only  16%  for   the

corresponding period last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Permit Department has also detected an increasing

number  of  cases of forgeries of the work permit  card  itself.

Since  April  1998,  the  number of  forged  work  permit  cards

detected by the Department has averaged about 40 to 50 a  month.

This  is  significantly higher than in the past  when  very  few

cases  of forged work permit cards were detected.  Most  of  the

forged  work  permit  cards came from the  construction  sector.

They were work permit cards for foreign construction workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is not helped by the fact that many foreign

workers do not carry their original work permit cards with them.

Instead,  they carry with them photocopies of the  card  as  the

originals  are  very  often  kept  by  their  employers.   These

photocopies  of  the work permit cards are very  often  of  poor

quality and can also easily be forged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing number of illegal workers and rising

incidences  of  forged  work  permit  cards  has  made  it  more

difficult  for  enforcement officers  to  identify  the  foreign

workers.  The current system for identifying foreign workers has

two  shortcomings.  Firstly, existing security features  on  the

work  permit  cards themselves are outdated and make  the  cards

easier to forge.  Secondly, the finger

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>

impressions or fingerprints of the work permit holders  are  not

captured  on  the  card,  making it  difficult  for  enforcement

officers  to conclusively identify the person holding the  card.

Clearly, we need to make the present identification system  more

effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to deal with this problem, the Minister for Home Affairs

had  already  amended the Immigration Act on 4th September  this

year  to  provide  for  the  taking of  fingerprints  or  finger

impressions  from foreign workers in Singapore.   The  amendment

before the House today is to enable my Ministry, the Ministry of

Manpower, to work together with the Ministry of Home Affairs  to

jointly implement a new and more secure identification card  for

foreign workers.  This card will combine the current work permit

card,  the  Immigration  Disembarkation  and  Embarkation   card

together  with  the Visit pass into one single card  which  will

also  carry  the fingerprint record of the foreign worker.   The

new  card will incorporate more security features to reduce  the

likelihood of forgeries.  These security features will  also  be

more   up-to-date   and  more  effective.   The   inclusion   of

fingerprint  records  will  allow our  enforcement  agencies  to

conclusively identify the holder of the work permit as being the

person who is authorised to enter Singapore to work.  It is also

our  intention to make it mandatory for all foreign  workers  to

carry  the  new identification card with them at all  times,  so

that  if  they  are stopped for checking at the  worksite,  they

would  be  able to produce the original work permit card  rather

than a photocopy of the work permit card.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new identification card will be introduced from early next

year,  1999.   A phased approach will be adopted to capture  the

fingerprints or finger impressions of all foreign workers.   For

a  start,  all new foreign workers will be required  to  provide

their  finger  impressions  before they  are  issued  with  work

permits to work in Singapore.  Existing foreign workers who  are

already here, who are holding the old work permit cards, will be

asked to provide their finger impressions when they come up  for

renewal.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we will pay particular attention to the recording

of the finger impressions of foreign construction workers.  This

is because cases of illegal employment and work permit forgeries

are  most  rampant in the construction sector.  The construction

sector   is  also  the  largest  employer  of  foreign  workers,

particularly  those from the non-traditional sources.   Existing

foreign  construction  workers will be notified  to  have  their

finger  impressions taken within one year of  implementation  of

the  new  identification system, and it will take us  about  two

years  to  complete  the exercise.  But we  will  focus  on  the

foreign  construction workers first, so that  we  get  them  all

fingerprinted within the first year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new identification card for foreign workers will be issued

free-of-charge to the workers, in the first instance.  Employers

will  be advised on the procedures to obtain these new cards  in

due course.  However, if the foreign worker should lose the work

permit  card or damage it or deface it in some way  and  need  a

replacement card,  a replacement fee of $20 will be charged.

Foreign workers are currently given up to 14 days to report  the

loss  of  a work permit card to the Controller of Work  Permits.

With the introduction of the new identification card for foreign

workers, we intend to shorten this reporting period from 14 days

to  7 days.   This will narrow the window period during which  a

foreign worker cannot be conclusively identified because he  has

not got the card and there is difficulty identifying him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go through the key clauses of this Bill. Clause

2  of  the  Bill amends section 3 of the Employment  of  Foreign

Workers  Act to allow the Minister to appoint Deputy Controllers

of  Work  Permits and Assistant Controllers of Work  Permits  to

assist  the  Controller  to  carry  out  the  functions  of  the

Controller  under the Act.  This is necessary  to  expedite  the

management of a very large number of foreign workers present  in

Singapore  at  any one time.  Today, we have more  than  450,000

foreign  workers in Singapore.  So we need to have more officers

who are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>

empowered  to  deal  with all the management matters  concerning

foreign workers in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 14 to reduce the time within which a

foreign  worker must report the loss, destruction or  defacement

of a work permit from 14 days to 7 days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clause 4 of the Bill amends section 29 of the Act

to  extend  the  powers of the Minister to make  Regulations  to

provide  for  the taking and recording of finger impressions  of

persons who have applied for or who have been issued with a work

permit  and for the dissemination of such records to the  Police

and other law enforcement agencies.  These regulations will also

empower  law  enforcement agencies to demand finger  impressions

from  persons  holding  the work permit  cards  for  purpose  of

verification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise

in  support  of  the  proposed amendment in  the  Employment  of

Foreign   Workers  (Amendment)  Bill  aimed  at  improving   the

administration of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, beyond what the Minister for Manpower has just described,

the  primary purpose of the amendment Bill is to give the  power

to  effectively address the issue of fraud and forgeries of work

permit cards.  The proposed amendment to section 3 to also allow

the   Minister  for  Manpower  to  appoint  additional  manpower

resources  to  assist the Controller is timely to ensure,  among

others,  that  we screen, filter and subsequently admit  foreign

workers  with  the  necessary  skills  and  calibre  so  as   to

contribute to the enhancement of Singapore's competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of the current financial crisis, much concern

has  been  raised  about  the extent of jobs  being  assumed  by

foreign  workers.   With  rising  unemployment,  this  cry  will

inevitably get

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>

louder.   The fact is, with the limited pool of trained workers,

Singapore will still have to depend on foreign workers  to  meet

the needs of increasingly more sophisticated industries.  It  is

therefore imperative for the Ministry of Manpower to ensure  not

only  for  labour demand to be closely matched just in  numbers,

but,  more importantly, to make available trained manpower  with

the   requisite  knowledge  and  skills  demanded   by   today's

industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Manpower has recently announced in Parliament

that  the  National Plan for Manpower is being  drawn  up  by  a

Manpower  21  Committee  comprising captains  of  industry,  the

Government   and  the  trade  unions.   This  multi-agency   and

tripartite  approach  to manpower planning  and  development  is

laudable  to  ensure that the needs of different industries  are

appropriately  met.   In situations where  foreign  workers  are

needed to fill the gap, it is imperative to make sure that  only

foreigners with the requisite skills and talents are brought  in

to  fill  appropriate job vacancies.  This should be  done  only

after  exhaustively  checking  and  ensuring  that  no  suitable

unemployed  Singaporeans  could  take  on  the  jobs.   Such  an

approach will lend credibility and comfort to existing  and  new

companies  for  they are assured of being able  to  continue  to

recruit  workers  with the appropriate skills and  abilities  to

enable   them   to   operate  efficiently  and  increase   their

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporean workers will also look up to their foreign

counterparts to learn new skills from them rather than  shunning

them.   In  the current tough economic environment, new  foreign

workers  admitted  must be seen to add value  to  the  companies

recruiting   them  and  ultimately  contribute  to   Singapore's

economic competitiveness.  During these difficult times, it  can

be  expected that Singaporean workers will be more vigilant than

ever  of the quality of foreign workers brought in by companies.

They  must  be  able to demonstrate their special  abilities  in

order to earn the respect of their Singaporean counterparts  and

preferably should be in a position to impart their knowledge and

skills to our workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the amendment of sections 14 and 29, I think

these  amendments are essential to highlight to foreign  workers

that  the  work  permit issued to them is an important  document

which  must  be properly protected and also to deter  them  from

toying  with the idea of making a quick buck from selling  their

work  permit  card which undoubtedly is in demand  by  potential

imposters in the light of the current economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, generally I support the Bill as it aims to provide

for  better  administration of the Act.  However,  I  have  some

reservations regarding the amendment to provide for  the  taking

and recording of fingerprints of persons issued with work permit

and  for the records to be given to the Police.  I must say that

the  Minister has been persuasive and convincing of the need and

necessity for fingerprinting of work permit holders and that  it

is  not  made simply on the connotation or prejudice  that  work

permit  holders are more predisposed to crime and that they  are

harder to track down because of their sheer numbers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to bring up a point that there appears to

be  unequal treatment of employment pass holders and work permit

holders.   Yet one can argue that while we have not seen  crimes

committed by those with employment pass, some that we have  seen

have  caused serious financial consequences.  Arguably,  we  can

also say they are more mobile and more difficult to track.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is understandable that based on the explanation given

by the Minister that the employment pass holders have not caused

the kind of problems that we are faced with, with regard to work

permit holders, it is necessary that we demonstrate equality  of

treatment  in  the sense that I would think it is  necessary  at

this point perhaps to even consider fingerprinting all employees

who want to work in Singapore.  After all, Singaporeans are also

fingerprinted as far as their identity cards are  concerned.   I

am simply raising

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>

this  point  because  we  must  be careful  of  the  problematic

perception  that  they may cause and generate,  that  while  the

effect of such a regulation may be unequal for good reasons, the

objective is certainly not discriminatory.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I first want to

thank both Members for speaking in support of the amendment Bill

although they have some reservations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me take the point raised by Mr Ahmad Magad. His main

point  is  that  foreign workers who are allowed into  Singapore

should  be the ones who can do the job that is expected of  them

so  that  they  can make a contribution to the company  and  the

economy.  Let me assure Mr Magad that this is the case and  that

foreign  workers  come to Singapore, either the skilled  foreign

workers  who  hold employment pass, or the semi-skilled  workers

who hold work permits, or even the unskilled foreign workers who

hold a two-year work permit, because the employers require their

services  and  they  can  help  the  company  to  enhance  their

competitive  edge.   It must be so because  employers  will  not

bring in these foreign workers just to stack up the manpower  or

the  headcount in the company.  They need these foreign  workers

because, in many instances, Singaporeans are not prepared to  do

some  of  the  jobs  which  are available.   As  a  result,  the

employers have no option but to turn to foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members the example in the construction sector.

Today,  we  have a large number of foreign construction  workers

because  many  Singaporeans are not  prepared  to  work  in  the

construction sector, although there are many jobs going  begging

within the construction sector. Employers or contractors recruit

many  foreign workers.  In the construction sector, my  Ministry

is  introducing  new  regulations to  ensure  that  the  foreign

workers who come in have some basic construction skills. We have

started in August this year to require all recruitments of  non-traditional source construction workers to have at least 20%  of

them  tested  in  basic skills in their home country  before  we

grant  approval in Singapore.  In other words, if  you  want  to

bring in 100

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>

foreign  workers from Bangladesh, for instance, at least  20  of

them must have been skill tested in Bangladesh itself first  and

they   have  been  found  to  have  a  certain  level  of  basic

construction skill before we grant approval in principle for you

to  bring  in  100  of  these workers.   This  20%  figure  will

gradually  be adjusted upwards to 100%.  Our initial target  was

to  do this over a period of three years, but we are looking  at

whether  we can shorten this period and to speed up the  process

to force the contractors to recruit more skilled workers.  There

is likelihood that we can shorten the timeframe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said for many other sectors where, under the

present circumstances, employers in fact have an opportunity  to

recruit  more skilled workers because in the regional  countries

affected  by  the  Asian crisis, there is massive  unemployment.

There is opportunity for them now to go out to look for the more

skilled workers to come in to supplement the Singapore workforce

in areas where we are lacking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to refine and improve our foreign worker

policy  to  ensure that employers who bring in  foreign  workers

will need them and they have suitable skills qualification. This

will  take some time because we have a large pool of quite lowly

skilled  foreign  workers.   This has  got  to  be  turned  over

gradually  and,  in due course, we can replace  them  with  more

skilled foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now turn to Mr Zulkifli who also supported the

idea  in  the Bill to fingerprint the foreign workers.   But  he

asked  why  is  there this unequal treatment between  employment

pass  holders and work permit holders. The reason, as the Member

has  mentioned,  is that today the problems of  abuses  such  as

forgery  of work permit card or work passes or working illegally

exist  mainly in the unskilled and semi-skilled level, in  other

words,  work permit holder level. There are very few  employment

pass  holders,  who  are  in  the professional,  management  and

executive   level,  who  end  up  in  this  kind  of  situation.

Forgeries or infringements of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>

the employment pass regulation in the employment pass sector are

very  few,  because  these are the better qualified  and  higher

skilled  people.   We  do not have so many cases  of  abuses  or

illegal  workers or professionals coming into Singapore to  work

illegally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem is with the two-year work permit holders

who are mostly unskilled workers, and the bulk of the problem is

actually  in the construction sector.  We have lots  of  foreign

workers  in  the marine, manufacturing and service sectors.   We

have  very few problems with these people.  Most of the problems

that  we  are  encountering  such as illegal  workers,  wrongful

deployment and abandoning workers on the street, all  come  from

the construction sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this amendment, we will concentrate all our resources

to  ensure that fingerprinting of the construction workers takes

priority.  We will try to do it within one year because we  must

tackle  this most serious problem first.  If, at some  point  in

the  future, we find out that employment pass holders are up  to

no  good  and are also committing all kinds of breaches  of  the

employment pass regulations, we can also bring them in.  We only

do  things like fingerprinting if it is necessary.  If there  is

no need to do it, why do we want to go through the trouble?  Let

me  assure him that this is not a case of discrimination.   This

is  a case of doing what is necessary.  There is no need for  us

to overdo it.

<div align="center"><b>USE OF MALAYSIAN AIRSPACE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister for Defence how the Malaysian Government's decision  to

terminate  various arrangements governing the use  of  Malaysian

airspace  by  the  Republic of Singapore Air Force  (RSAF)  will

affect  RSAF training and operations and Search and Rescue,  and

what  measures  were  taken up by the RSAF  to  deal  with  this

development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Cyrille Tan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister for Defence, with the restrictions imposed on the usage

of Malaysian airspace, what measures are being considered by the

SAF  to  (i)  work around the restrictions; and (ii) improve  on

their search-and-rescue operations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th September, Malaysia informed the Ministry of Defence

that  it  was  terminating various agreements  and  arrangements

governing  the RSAF's use of Malaysian airspace. Their  decision

came  into effect on 18th September, effectively giving us  less

than  24  hours'  notice.   This was a  unilateral  decision  by

Malaysia. We were not given prior notification nor consulted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia's decision affected the agreements and arrangements

covering RSAF flights through South Johor to the South China Sea

Training Area; RSAF training within Malaysia's Low Flying  Area;

RSAF  navigational  training  flights  in  Peninsular  and  East

Malaysia;  RSAF aircraft taking off from Tengah Air  Base  using

South  Johor airspace; and combined Search and Rescue operations

and exercises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF and the SAF plan for all contingencies, and Malaysia's

decision  has not curtailed the RSAF's training and  operations.

When the decision was conveyed, the RSAF immediately implemented

alternative arrangements.  Today the RSAF conducts its  training

and  operational flights with the same frequency  and  tempo  as

before.   RSAF  aircraft proceeding to their training  areas  no

longer  transit through Malaysian airspace but take  alternative

routes.   In  doing so, we have not compromised on safety.   The

RSAF  has  been working closely with CAAS to ensure  the  proper

sequencing  of RSAF flights and civil air traffic  so  that  air

safety is not compromised. We have also minimised the number  of

RSAF  flights over built-up areas.  However, the adjustments  in

flight  paths could mean some inconvenience to those  living  on

both sides of the Johor Straits as more aircraft now have to fly

over  Singapore's territorial waters in the Straits.   In  fact,

several  of the arrangements which Malaysia terminated had  been

designed to reduce the aircraft noise level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RSAF does not depend on any one country for its training

needs.  The  RSAF  has established extensive  overseas  training

arrangements.  These have provided valuable training  areas  and

also  the  opportunity to train and exercise with  other  highly

professional  air  forces.  We will continue  to  look  for  new

training areas in other parts of the world. In addition, we have

invested  heavily  in  advanced training  simulators.   We  will

continue  to  conduct more sophisticated training and  exercises

and  make  more extensive use of simulators, to ensure that  the

RSAF's operational and training effectiveness continues to be of

the highest standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF would like to clarify some of the misconceptions about

the  agreements  and arrangements covered by Malaysia's  action.

Firstly, the arrangements did not allow RSAF aircraft a free run

of  Malaysian  airspace.   For safety  and  other  reasons,  the

arrangements set out minimum heights and demarcated areas, which

were strictly adhered to by the RSAF. The RSAF also ensured that

its  aircraft  did  not  fly at certain times  because  we  were

sensitive to noise concerns.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, many of these arrangements were established many

years ago, with some dating back to the 1960s. As these are long-established bilateral arrangements, mutually agreed upon, we had

expected  some consultation or discussion before any action  was

taken.  Especially as over the years the Ministries  of  Defence

and   air   forces  of  the  two  countries  have  had   regular

consultations, conducted professionally and for mutual  benefit,

to  make adjustments to the arrangements when necessary so as to

take  into account such things as aircraft noise and congestion.

Instead  the  decision was conveyed with  less  than  24  hours'

notice.  This is despite the fact that the terms of one  of  the

agreements  clearly  provide for six  months'  notification  for

termination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, these agreements and arrangements were established in

good  faith and for mutual benefit. They were drawn up within  a

spirit of cooperation and Malaysia also derived some benefits in

exchange for the RSAF's use of their airspace.  For example, the

RMAF  was  given access to RSAF Operational Flight Trainers  and

Air  Combat Simulator. The RMAF was also allowed to station  its

personnel at the RSAF's Joint Air Traffic Control Centre to help

coordination between the two air traffic control centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Malaysia's action has not affected the RSAF's training and

operations, there will be an adverse effect on Search and Rescue

(SAR)  operations, as we were unfortunately reminded of  only  a

week   after   Malaysia  cancelled  the  SAR  Agreement.    This

agreement, which is a common one between countries, was based on

humanitarian  considerations to facilitate SAR  operations.   In

such operations, time is of the essence.  How quickly distressed

personnel  can  be located and rescued can mean  the  difference

between  life  and death. Usually, SAR aircraft  will  take  the

shortest, most direct route to the search area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the agreement, the RSAF had in the past rescued both its

own  pilots as well as Malaysian pilots.  For instance, in 1988,

the  RSAF  rendered assistance to the RMAF twice for Search  and

Rescue  and  Search and Locate efforts. In the  first  case,  we

located the downed pilot at sea, picked him up and sent  him  to

an  RMAF  airfield. In the second, we located the  survivor  and

directed  Malaysian search aircraft to his location.  We  worked

hand-in-hand with the Malaysian authorities on both occasions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the British helicopter mishap, the Malaysian Defence

Minister asked Singapore to notify Malaysia of planned exercises

and  to  apply  for airspace clearance well beforehand  for  SAR

operations during these exercises. SAR operations are  by  their

very  nature  meant  to handle emergencies which  by  definition

cannot   be  anticipated.  And  emergencies  can  happen  during

training  and even routine flights. Furthermore our  Air  Force,

like  the  Malaysian Air Force and other air forces,  carry  out

flying  training  and  exercises  almost  daily.  That  is   why

countries have standing SAR arrangements, such as the one  which

the  RSAF  and RMAF had until 31/2 weeks ago. This is  the  most

practical  arrangement,  meant  to  expedite  and  smoothen  the

operations  and  procedures between both sides for  humanitarian

reasons  in  order  to save lives in an emergency  when  SAR  is

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the most basic principles of Search and Rescue, which

are  internationally accepted, are that there should be no delay

in  search  and  rescue efforts; that states should  extend  any

possible  assistance  to search and rescue  efforts;  and,  that

states  should  coordinate  their  search  and  rescue  efforts.

Singapore's   approach  to  SAR  has  always   been   based   on

internationally-accepted  practices and  universal  humanitarian

principles.   As  a  responsible  member  of  the  international

community,  we  will  continue to uphold  these  principles  and

practices.  This means that we have and will meet the obligation

to  provide  SAR  to  those in distress  in  the  quickest  time

possible.  It  also means that we must continue to maintain  the

highest  readiness  for our SAR operations.  This  is  something

which  we  cannot and will not compromise, for lives  -  whether

Singaporean or other nationalities - are at stake. And  this  is

why  the  RSAF's  SAR  assets will  continue  to  be  ready  for

deployment  at a moment's notice. However, while our SAR  assets

may  be  highly  trained and prepared for all contingencies,  we

must recognise that international cooperation is often necessary

in  SAR  operations.  We  will continue to  coordinate  our  SAR

efforts with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



neighbouring  states where necessary. We will also  continue  to

render  our utmost assistance to the SAR efforts of neighbouring

states, and we hope to get similar cooperation from them when we

have to conduct such humanitarian operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of the latest developments on the airspace issue,

there  have  also  been  various allegations  of  intrusions  by

Singapore  aircraft into Malaysian territory.  Such  allegations

are  not new. Only two weeks before the latest allegation on 1st

October  by  Malaysia's  Minister of  Defence,  there  had  been

reports  in  the  Malaysian press quoting allegations  by  Johor

residents of RSAF intrusions. Datuk Syed Hamid himself had  come

out to say that there was no intrusion. He also pointed out that

such  news  reports were provocative. We noted  and  we  welcome

Datuk  Syed Hamid's statement that Malaysia and its Ministry  of

Defence  would  not react on hearsay and allegations  but  would

investigate the complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response to all allegations of intrusions by our aircraft

and  vessels  has  always been a simple one. Inform  us  through

official channels and give us the details so that we can conduct

a  thorough  investigation. If we find that  our  personnel  did

intrude,  we  will  punish them for we regard  this  as  a  very

serious matter. But if all we get is an outcry in the media with

no  evidence provided, then we cannot be expected to pursue  the

matter further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our records show that over the past five years there have been

two  instances  (both  in  1996) when the  Malaysian  Government

officially  complained about RSAF intrusions. On the first  case

of   an   alleged  RSAF  intrusion,  MINDEF  conducted  thorough

investigations and found no evidence to support the claim of  an

intrusion. We sought more information from Malaysia to  help  us

with  our  investigations, and we even offered  an  exchange  of

information  but Malaysia did not respond. In the  second  case,

Malaysia  sent  a TPN which set out seven alleged  instances  of

intrusions. Our investigations showed that the claim was without

basis.  In two of the instances the aircraft concerned were  not

even RSAF aircraft. There was another instance, early this year,

when  the Malaysian Ministry of Defence made an informal request

to MINDEF to check whether some RSAF F-5s had strayed from their

flight  path  in  the  Low Flying Area.  They  provided  us  the

necessary  details.  We conducted a thorough  investigation  and

found  that  the  F-5s had unintentionally deviated  from  their

planned route due to weather and temporal disorientation of  the

lead  pilot.  MINDEF  conveyed this and  our  apologies  to  the

Malaysian Ministry of Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason whatsoever for the RSAF to intrude into

Malaysian airspace. In fact, the RSAF had every reason to adhere

strictly  to the terms and conditions of the various  agreements

we  had with Malaysia for the use of Malaysian airspace, for  to

do  otherwise would have brought an immediate response from  the

Malaysian Government. The Malaysian authorities would have  been

carefully  scrutinising RSAF flights in Malaysian  airspace  and

would  not  have  hesitated to produce  evidence  to  prove  any

deviation  from the agreements had any such deviation  occurred.

The  fact,  that  in  spite  of all the  allegations  and  close

scrutiny  the detailed information which Singapore requested  to

carry out investigations was not forthcoming, speaks for itself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs (a) whether recent misunderstandings and tension in  the

relations  of  Singapore,  Malaysia  and  Indonesia  call   into

question  the  fundamental objectives of  ASEAN  solidarity  and

economic cooperation; and (b) whether the Asian economic  crisis

will  impede the smooth implementation of the ASEAN  Free  Trade

Area by 2003.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It is true that there are bilateral differences among

some  ASEAN  member countries.  However, this is not unusual  as

ASEAN  countries  have  had  bilateral  problems  in  the  past.

Fortunately,  ASEAN  members have not  allowed  their  bilateral

disputes  to  impede their ongoing cooperation or  to  undermine

ASEAN unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, notwithstanding the current problems besetting the

region  and  certain bilateral issues, ASEAN  Foreign  Ministers

held  a successful annual Ministerial Meeting in Manila in July.

Recently,  on  23rd  September,  I  chaired  an  ASEAN   Foreign

Ministers'  Meeting held in New York on the fringes  of  the  UN

General  Assembly,  during which the Foreign  Ministers  reached

consensus  on  a number of issues, including on  Cambodia.   The

ASEAN  Finance  Ministers met on 4th October 1998 in  Washington

DC,  where they agreed to endorse the terms of understanding for

an  ASEAN  Surveillance  Process.  A few  days  ago,  the  ASEAN

Economic Ministers also met in Manila to discuss cooperation  in

economic  matters.  These ASEAN Ministerial meetings demonstrate

that  notwithstanding  ongoing bilateral differences  and  other

difficulties, ASEAN member countries continue to cooperate on  a

range of important issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the regional financial and economic

crisis  poses one of the biggest challenges for ASEAN.  All  the

ASEAN  countries  have been affected, to varying  degrees.   The

challenge now is for ASEAN, during this period of difficulty, to

continue  such cooperation at all levels to tackle the  problems

facing the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) On the second part of the Member's question, I wish to

inform him that despite the financial and economic crisis, ASEAN

countries  have been moving ahead on the ASEAN Free Trade  Area,

or  AFTA,  initiative.  At the recently-concluded  AFTA  Council

Meeting  held  in  Manila on 6th October 1998,  ASEAN  countries

reiterated their commitment to implement AFTA and further agreed

to  expand  the  number of tariff lines that can be  accelerated

ahead  of  schedule.  Indeed the AFTA  Council  recognised  that

further acceleration of AFTA was particularly important in light

of   the   current  financial  and  economic  crisis.    ASEAN's

commitment  to  economic cooperation is further demonstrated  by

the  endorsement  of  the  ASEAN Economic  Ministers,  at  their

meeting  in  Manila from 7th-8th October 1998, of the  Framework

Agreement on the ASEAN Investment Area to enhance the investment

climate in ASEAN.

offshore  ringgit deposits which GIC placed with banks based  in

Singapore, and on-shore ringgit deposits with Malaysian banks in

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the offshore ringgit deposits, the unexpected

imposition of currency controls caused the banks to prepay GIC's

<div align="center"><b>MEASURES TO HELP WORKERS AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CRISIS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr Cyrille Tan</b> asked the Prime Minister, with the

deepening economic crisis causing workers to face problems  such

as  shorter  workweek, no overtime work and lay-offs and  having

significant  impact  on their coping with the  cost  of  living,

whether  the Government will introduce further measures to  help

the affected workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan (for the Prime Minister):</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour market has indeed slackened as a result of the

slowing economic momentum. However, for a large number of  those

retrenched,  many have still been able to secure  re-employment.

According  to  MOM,  a healthy 63% of those  retrenched  in  1st

Quarter 1998 managed to find a new job by the 2nd Quarter  1998.

The average time to secure the new job was 1.4 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective assistance Government can extend to

Singaporeans during this difficult period is to help ensure that

workers stay employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help workers stay employed during this economic downturn,

Government has adopted a 3-pronged approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will help to keep businesses viable so as to

minimise  retrenchments.  In order to do this, we need  to  keep

our  costs competitive so that our companies can compete for the

reduced business demand during this period.  We will do this  by

reducing our business costs.  The $2 billion Off-Budget  package

announced in June 1998 was part of this cost-cutting exercise to

preserve  jobs.  Towards the end of this year, the Committee  on

Singapore's Competitiveness will recommend to Government further

measures to reduce business costs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently, the economic promotion agencies are stepping up

their  investment promotion efforts.  This will help create  new

jobs  to  replace those lost.  EDB has recently  announced  that

15,000  new  jobs  in electronic components, petrochemicals  and

aerospace  and  5,000  more  in  communications,  logistics  and

headquarter operations would need to be filled this year.  There

is  therefore  no  shortage  of jobs available  if  our  workers

possess the necessary skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will help to train our Singaporean workers to acquire

the necessary skills to match the needs of companies. The Skills

Redevelopment Programme (SRP), which was launched  earlier  this

year  to  complement  the existing Skills Development  Fund,  is

aimed precisely at this. The SRP provides training that not only

leads  to certifiable skills which employers recognise,  but  it

also  provides trained workers a job, either with their existing

employer  or new employer. As of September, about 2,200  workers

have   completed  training  and  another  2,400  are  undergoing

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will help retrenched workers secure alternative

employment through active job-matching. The Ministry of Manpower

(MOM)  has  implemented the Employment Assistance Programme  and

also  set  up a new Employment Facilitation Team to  source  and

pool job vacancies from companies so that retrenched workers can

secure employment expeditiously. These efforts have resulted  in

more  job  opportunities  being identified  for  the  retrenched

workers.  To date, MOM has been able to provide job referrals to

some 80% of all job seekers every month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that despite these measures, there

will  still be some affected workers who will be unable to  cope

with  the economic downturn. For breadwinners who are retrenched

and have no other resources to fall back on, they can turn to  a

variety of community assistance programmes available through the

Ministry  of  Community  Development (MCD).   For  example,  the

Interim  Financial Scheme, administered by MCD and the Community

Development   Councils  (CDC),  provides  short-term   financial

assistance  to  help individuals and families  facing  financial

hardship.   For those who are in need of longer-term assistance,

several  other  specialised  assistance  schemes  are  available

through MCD, CDCs, the National Council of Social Services,  and

the  various voluntary welfare organisations.  These include the

Public  Assistance Scheme, Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme,

and the Centre-Based Financial Assistance for Childcare Scheme.

<div align="center"><b>ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT OF GOODS AND SERVICES TAX</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance if

his  Ministry  will assess the impact and effectiveness  of  the

goods  and  services  tax  in terms of  achieving  its  original

objectives  and consider a downward revision in the tax  by  two

percentage points to stimulate demand and reduce business  costs

in the light of the changing circumstances.





<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST was introduced in 1994 to achieve a better balance

between direct and indirect taxes.  With its introduction,  both

corporate and personal income taxes were cut substantially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the 3% GST was intended to be revenue

neutral.   Last  year, GST collection totalled  $1,927  million.

Whereas  revenue forgone from the cut in income taxes and  other

offsets  was $2,273 million, so that the original objective  was

achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present economic downturn is due primarily to a fall in

external  demand. As domestic demand accounts for less than  30%

of  total demand, and the GST tax is only 3%, reducing  or  even

suspending   GST   altogether  will  not  raise   total   demand

significantly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 2% reduction in GST will mean a major loss to the

Government of an important source of revenue. The Government has

been  lowering  taxes and charges wherever  possible  to  reduce

business  costs,  and  will continue  to  do  so.  However,  the

Government will adjust other taxes rather than the GST, for  two

reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the incidence of the GST is widely and evenly

distributed across all types of economic activity.  So  for  the

same  amount of revenue collected, the burden of the GST is felt

less  heavily  than  taxes which levy a higher  tax  rate  on  a

narrower range of activities, such as property tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, any short term adjustments in taxes should be

broadly  consistent  with our long term taxation  policies.  The

Government had stated when the GST was introduced that  the  GST

rate  would remain unchanged for at least 5 years. Reducing  the

GST  rate  from  3%  to  1% may mislead the  public  as  to  the

Government's long term plans, and cause unnecessary anxiety  and

misunderstanding later when the GST rate has to be restored.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether,  in  line with its objective of reducing  the  cost  of

doing  business  in  Singapore,  the  Government  will  consider

reducing taxes on petrol and diesel and/or taking other measures

to reduce pump prices of petrol and diesel.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is closely monitoring business costs. In

June  this  year,  a  package of Off-Budget  Measures  aimed  at

reducing  business  costs was announced.   Further  cost-cutting

measures,  including all forms of Government taxes  and  levies,

are being reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of taxes on petroleum products, I should point

out  that  the  levying of excise duties is one of the  measures

used to curb excessive vehicle usage and minimise congestion  on

the roads. Any proposal to reduce duty on petrol would therefore

have  to  take into account its impact on road usage. Electronic

Road  Pricing (ERP) has just been introduced and Government will

need  some  time  to  monitor the new  road  usage  and  traffic

patterns.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Minister for Finance

what  is the outstanding number of cases where corporations  and

individuals apply for tax refund; and whether his Ministry  will

expedite  the  processing of the refund so as to ease  the  cash

flow of those who applied.





<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the end of September 1998, the number of tax refunds

to be processed by IRAS was about 14,500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,700 of these refunds are claimed by registered GST

traders  for  input tax paid on their business  purchases.   GST

traders filed their claims monthly, quarterly or yearly based on

the  filing  frequency they have chosen.  More than 90%  of  the

traders  get  their GST refunds within 2 to  3  weeks  of  their

claim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refund for the other taxes, namely, income and property

taxes  are  also expeditiously dealt with.  85%  of  income  tax

refunds  are made within 2 weeks after the claims are processed.

The  more complicated cases may take 4 to 6 weeks.  Refunds  for

property tax usually take about 1 month from the date the claims

are processed.

Development (a) whether lessees, whose flats are to be  upgraded

under  the  Housing and Development Board's upgrading programme,

should contribute less towards the cost of upgrading their flats

in  view  of the drop in property prices and building costs  and

(b)  whether there would be a slow down in the upgrading of  HDB

flats this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP), the amount

lessees  have to contribute depends on the cost of the upgrading

works  and  not  on  property  prices.  The  lessees  co-pay   a

percentage  of  the actual construction cost for  the  upgrading

works  carried  out  in their precinct. The actual  construction

cost  depends on the scope and extent of the improvement  works.

As  construction  cost  has come down for  precincts  that  were

tendered  recently,  the lessees for these  precincts  would  be

expected  to  pay  less  for the same package  of  improvements.

Lessees  are not required to contribute to the Interim Upgrading

Programme (IUP).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I informed the House early this year that for 1998, the MUP

has  been scaled down from 15 precincts to 10 precincts and  the

IUP from 24 precincts to between 16 and 20 precincts in view  of

the  economic conditions. HDB already announced 5 MUP  precincts

in  April 1998. It will announce another 5 precincts before  the

end  of  the year. HDB also announced 18 IUP precincts in  April

1998.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the upgrading programme in 1999, I informed the

House  in  the previous sitting that MND was preparing its  FY99

budget plan for submission to the Ministry of Finance. Given the

budgetary constraints that we will be facing, we have to  manage

our  limited  financial  resources carefully  according  to  the

country's  priorities. These priorities will take into  account,

amongst  other things, what are the most effective  measures  to

stimulate  the  economy,  and will be  co-ordinated  across  the

various  ministries  in a concerted effort  to  achieve  maximum

impact.  Whether there would be a slow down in the upgrading  of

HDB  flats  next year depends ultimately on the budget allocated

to MND.

Development  (a)  how many Housing and Development  Board  (HDB)

shop tenants terminated their leases in 1996, 1997 and 1998; and

(b) whether the HDB will consider further reducing the rental of

HDB  shops  so as to enable shop tenants to lower the prices  of

their goods and services, thus benefiting consumers.





<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 146,217 and 158 shop tenants terminated their

tenancies   in   1996,  1997  and  1998  (up  to  August   1998)

respectively.   These figures do not include those  affected  by

redevelopment/clearance programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With about two-thirds of the shops eligible for sale

already  sold,  the  market rentals for HDB  shops  are  largely

determined  by  the shop owners and their tenants.   HDB  is  no

longer  the main deciding factor for shop rentals.  In reviewing

market evidence of the going rent, HDB follows the market  trend

and does not lead it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help shopkeepers during this period of economic

slowdown,  HDB  has introduced a package of rent concessions  in

November   1996   and  December  1997,  eg,  moderating   rental

adjustments at 3rd renewal, granting up to 10% rental concession

for  those paying above market rent and staggering increases  in

rent  for  subletting  and  assignment  cases.   In  July  1998,

additional  concessions in the form of 10%  rental  rebates  and

passing on of the full savings of 55% property tax rebates, were

introduced for a period of one year, from 1st  July 1998 to 30th

June 1999.

to  avoid exacerbating the oversupply situation and to stabilise

the  property  market. It has stopped land sales  for  1998  and

1999,  suspended the premium for the extension  of  the  project

completion period, and allowed re-assignment of land sale sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without compromising financial prudence, the Government has

also  relaxed  or  suspended some of the curbs on  the  property

market  implemented  in May 1996. These include  suspending  the

sellers' stamp duty for sale of housing units within 3 years  of

sale,  and  deferring the stamp duty payment for  purchasers  of

uncompleted properties until Temporary Occupation Permit  stage.

The other measures have been retained for financial prudence and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence of an increase in the number of

established  an  arrangement to conduct coordinated  patrols  to

curb  the  menace. The joint effort has proven to be  effective.

Education  (a) what facilities are provided in schools (primary,

secondary and junior colleges) for handicapped students; (b) how

many  schools are equipped with such facilities; and (c) whether

all new schools are equipped to cater for such students.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic disabled-friendly facilities provided in schools

are:  a  car  parking lot for the disabled, a ramp at  the  main

entrance, ramps to all facilities located on the ground floor of

every  block, a toilet for the wheel-chair bound on  the  ground

floor and at least one ambulant disabled toilet cubicle at  each

of  the upper levels.  MOE's plan is to provide all existing and

new  schools  with such basic facilities by the year  2003.   In

addition,  10%  of  the schools will have additional  facilities

such as ramps or lifts to all levels and ramps for corridors  to

each  room  at  every  level.   These  schools  with  additional

facilities  are to be spread out over the island  to  facilitate

easy  access  for  the disabled who live in different  parts  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, 33 primary schools and 51 secondary schools have

the  basic  facilities,  while 8 primary  schools,  6  secondary

schools  and  1  JC  have  both the  basic  and  the  additional

facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is undertaking a review of the current norms

for  the  provision of disabled-friendly facilities in  schools,

with   a   view  to  ensuring  adequate  provision  and  greater

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br><i>(i) Number of construction workers (both local and foreign) trained, tested and certified as skilled by CITI</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of construction workers (both local and foreign)

trained  has gone up from about 4,300 in FY96 to about 8,900  in

FY97.  The  figure for the first quarter of this  FY  is  3,330.

Similarly,  the  number of workers tested and workers  certified

has  also gone up significantly.  In FY96, about 22,000  workers

were  tested  and out of which, about 11,000 were  certified  as

skilled  workers.  In  FY97, the number of  workers  tested  and

workers certified are about 28,000 and 17,000 respectively.  The

tested and 10,385 for workers certified.



<br><br><i>(ii) Incentives/schemes to attract Singaporeans to join the construction workforce</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign worker levy makes the employment of

Singaporeans  more  competitive  while  the  dependency  ceiling

requires employers to engage Singaporeans before they can employ

foreigners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently also incentives for Singaporeans to

receive training in construction trades.  Singaporeans pay lower

test  fees at CITI for most of the main trades. They also  enjoy

further SDF subsidies of between 50% and 80% on the fees of some

under the Skills Redevelopment Programme set up by the NTUC  and

MOM to aid the training of local workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has received numerous complaints from residents

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry, therefore, decided that generators should not

be used at locations where power supply can be obtained directly

from  the  grid  if  they  cause  noise  and  air  pollution  to

neighbouring residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of generator sets in construction sites was first

discussed  with the Singapore Contractors Association (SCAL)  in

July  1998.  In another dialogue session with SCAL in  September

this  year,  SCAL  was generally supportive of  the  policy  and

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent allegations of price fixing by oil companies

pointed  to  the  uniformity  of petrol  and  diesel  prices  as

evidence  of  collusion.  There were also  complaints  that  the

recent  two-cent  cut in petrol pump prices is not  commensurate

with  the  larger drop in fuel costs.  Between January 1998  and

August 1998, the posted price1 of RON 98 unleaded petrol of  the

major oil companies in Singapore dropped by between five and six

cents per litre.  During the same period, pump prices came  down

by four cents per litre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry met the oil companies last week to seek their

explanation  on  the  allegations of price fixing,  and  on  the

observation that pump prices have generally been unresponsive to

drops in fuel cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil companies gave my Ministry their assurance that

there  is  no collusion to fix prices.  They explained  that  in

Singapore,  where the market is small and with motorists  within

easy  reach  of  several  competing  petrol  stations,  a  price

variation  is unsustainable.  Any reduction in prices  would  be

quickly  matched by competitors.  The oil companies  pointed  to

the  large number of petrol products available2, and their focus

on product marketing, service levels, free gifts and development

of  convenience  facilities at petrol stations, as  evidence  of

competition within the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of sticky pump prices, the oil companies

explained  that  fuel cost is not the only determinant  of  pump

prices.    They   depend  also  on  the  land   lease,   capital

depreciation, operating costs, wages and others.  Hence, it does

not  necessarily follow that a drop in fuel cost would translate

into a reduction in pump prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has urged the oil companies to quickly pass on

cost  savings  to motorists.  We will continue  to  monitor  the

situation  and will not hesitate to take action if we  find  any

evidence of collusion to fix prices.

<div align="center"><b>DEREGULATION OF ELECTRICITY MARKET</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  if  he  will  brief  the  House  on  the  progress  in

deregulating  the  electricity  market,  and  whether,  in   the

interim,  tariffs for non-peak periods will be reduced,  thereby

allowing  manufacturers and large industry users to alter  their

consumption  pattern  to  take  advantage  of  non-peak   excess

generation capacity to reduce their electricity bills.





<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electricity and gas departments of PUB were

corporatised  on  1st  October 1995. A  Pooling  and  Settlement

System,  which  facilitates competition in  the  generation  and

supply sectors, has commenced operation on 1st April 1998. Power

Senoko  Ltd,  Power Seraya Ltd, the Ministry of the  Environment

(ENV),  which  generates electricity at its refuse  incineration

plants,  and Power Supply Ltd have begun trading electricity  at

the  Pool.  Tuas  Power  Ltd  will also  begin  trading  in  the

Singapore  Electricity Pool when its first power plant commences

operation  sometime in 1999. Another company,  SEMPEC  Utilities

and  Terminal  (SUT)  Cogen Pte Ltd has been given  in-principle

approval to construct a power plant on Pulau Sakra.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage private sector participation in the

electricity   industry,  the  Government   has   initiated   the

divestment of Tuas Power Ltd. The tender for prequalification of

interested  parties was called on 23rd September  1998.  Further

competition  in the generation sector will come from  additional

generation capacity from independent power producers (IPPs)  and

co-generators in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, large consumers whose maximum demand exceeds 5MW

may  negotiate  and enter into special supply arrangements  with

Power Supply Ltd on a commercial basis. Such consumers may  also

choose   their   electricity  suppliers  when  new   electricity

suppliers  are  licensed.  The supply  sector  will  be  further

liberalised  at  a  later  stage to  allow  private  electricity

suppliers to sell electricity to consumers whose demand is  less

than 5MW.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peak and off-peak tariffs for High Tension consumers

were  introduced on 1st August 1986 to encourage large  industry

users to shift their demand to the off-peak period

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



(11  pm  to  7  am).  Large  industry  users  can  adjust  their

consumption pattern to take advantage of the off-peak rate which

is  12%  lower than the peak rate. In particular, consumers  who

operate  three  shifts have benefited from  the  lower  off-peak

rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the operation of the Pooling and Settlement System,

the  setting  of electricity tariffs will take into account  the

cost of generation at different times of the day as indicated by

pool prices. The use-of-system charge, which is currently a flat

rate,  will  also  be  unbundled on 1st January  1999  into  Low

Tension,  High  Tension  and Extra High  Tension  categories  to

reflect the cost of transmitting and distributing electricity at

different  voltages. The use-of-system charges for High  Tension

and Extra High Tension categories will be further unbundled into

peak  and  off-peak  categories. As such,  electricity  tariffs,

including peak and off-peak tariffs, can be expected to be  more

cost-reflective.

<div align="center"><b>INCORPORATION OF LEGAL PROFESSION IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Law whether he

will consider allowing incorporation of the legal profession  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, the Law Reform Committee of the

Singapore  Academy  of Law submitted to the  Attorney-General  a

report recommending that law firms be allowed to corporatise  on

a  voluntary basis.  Amongst the reasons stated by the Committee

were  that,  with corporatisation, law firms can be  reorganised

into   larger  corporate  units  to  share  resources  and  take

advantage  of  economies  of scale.   This  will  enhance  their

ability  to  cope  with  the faster pace, heavier  workload  and

greater  range of work.  With growth, there would be  scope  for

concomitant specialisation.  The corporate structure  will  also

promote globalisation of Singapore law firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discussing with the Attorney-General the advantages

and  disadvantages  of  the proposal,  I  gave  my  in-principle

approval to the Law Reform Committee to work out the details.  I

emphasised  the importance of ensuring that there  are  adequate

safeguards  to  protect  the interests of  clients  against  the

negligence and incompetence of law corporations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law Reform Committee and Law Society are currently

working together to consider the details of the proposal.   When

they  submit their detailed proposal, my Ministry will study  it

with the Attorney-General's Chambers bearing in mind public  and

national interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporatisation of law firms will help Singapore law

firms to be more competitive.  Hong Kong has already amended its

legislation  to  allow corporatisation of law  firms.   Allowing

professionals  such as lawyers to corporatise is  not  something

new in Singapore.  Architects, engineers and land surveyors were

allowed to do so in 1991.

these  difficult times, if he will (i) review and  readjust  the

staff structure of doctors in public hospitals in order to solve

the shortage problem and reduce the excessive workload of junior

doctors;  and  (ii) step up the recruitment effort and  increase

the number of training posts for nurses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br><i>Readjusting the staff structure of doctors</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has taken a two-pronged approach in increasing the

supply  of  junior  doctors.  We have increased  the  university

medical  school intake to 200 per year.  As this is a  long-term

solution,  we  have  in the short term made efforts  to  recruit

overseas-trained Medical Officers.  We have appointed 59 foreign

trained medical officers since January this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



year,  in  addition  to  the 81 that were appointed  last  year.

Previously,  we  had  only been able to bring  in  about  50-odd

officers  per  year, including both House Officers  and  Medical

Officers.   This  has  greatly reduced the shortfall  of  junior

doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also moderated the number of night calls to six

per   month.    Night   calls  are  an  unavoidable   facet   of

institutional  practice.  My Ministry has  also  instructed  our

hospitals, where necessary, to pool its medical staff of related

disciplines  for night duty rostering.  In addition, departments

have also sought to alleviate the workload of junior doctors  by

practising "step-down" calls where more senior doctors (such  as

Registrars  and Consultants) assist their junior  colleagues  by

taking on some of their calls and workload.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a longer term measure, the MOH Nursing Task Force set up in

November  last year has recommended that nurses should  take  on

higher   level  clinical  duties  (eg  intravenous   injections,

hypocounts and venepunctures).  Whilst the main intent  of  this

recommendation was to enhance the jobs of nurses and enable them

to maximise their skills and abilities, this would also have the

secondary  effect  of  easing the workload  of  junior  doctors,

especially house officers.



<br><br><i>Nurses - recruitment efforts and increasing training posts</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the issue of stepping up efforts to recruit

nurses.  The Ministry of Health, Health Corporation of Singapore

and the Restructured Hospitals have been conducting a  sustained

campaign for many years to attract young people into the nursing

profession.   This campaign has included career exhibitions  and

career  talks at schools, participation in careers fairs, giving

out  of  nursing bursaries and scholarships, newspaper  features

and television commercials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst these efforts did produce results, it was only this year

that   we  have  seen  bumper  crops  beyond  our  targets   and

expectations.   The NYP Nursing Diploma programme's  intake  was

640,  above their targetted intake of 600.  Likewise, the School

of  Nursing's intake for the Pupil Assistant Nurse programme has

more than doubled over last year's intake, from about 70 to 160.

While  this is partly related to the current economic situation,

I  believe  this  can  also  be  attributed  to  the  increasing

awareness  of the nursing profession through the higher  profile

publicity   campaign.   We  will  continue  with  our   on-going

programmes to promote nursing as a career.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Singapore is already widely acknowledged as a

medical  treatment in Singapore, especially for more complicated

medical conditions.  Many international and regional conferences

are  also  held  in  Singapore,  attracting  doctors  and  other

participants  from  the  region.   With  the  current   economic

downturn,  the  number  of  regional patients  coming  here  for

treatment has declined. However, MOH will continue to facilitate

the   efforts   of  various  associations  to  attract   medical

conferences and exhibitions to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the current economic situation does

present us with some opportunities to strengthen our position as

the  regional medical hub.  The downturn has resulted  in  fewer

public sector doctors leaving to join the private sector.   More

senior  specialists from the private sector have also  indicated

their  interest  in  joining the Visiting Consultant  Scheme  in

public  hospitals.   Such developments will  enable  the  public

sector  hospitals  to  build up their  manpower  resources,  and

further   enhance  their  expertise,  capabilities  and  patient

services.

<div align="center"><b>LAND LEASE PAYMENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he

will allow land lease payments to be made tax deductible in  the

same  manner  as  for  rentals, as  such  payments  represent  a

substantial business cost and are in substance similar to rental

payments.





<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our existing tax laws, whether a payment is tax

deductible  will  depend on whether it is a revenue  or  capital

expenditure  in nature.  If it is the latter, it  would  not  be

allowed a deduction as conversely, we do not tax capital  gains.

Lease payments, if made for the purpose of acquiring an asset of

enduring  benefit, would be a capital expenditure and  thus  not

allowed a tax deduction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ee may be aware that to assist companies to weather the

tough  economic  conditions,  JTC has  introduced  a  number  of

changes  with  regard  to its land lease  policy.   One  of  the

measures is to offer industrial land tenants the option  to  pay

their  land  rents for a period of up to 30 years in an  upfront

lump-sum  payment,  with  effect from 1st  January  1998.   This

option  will  help  to  reduce the cost of land  for  industrial

users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement this measure, I have also decided to allow

tax deduction for amortisation of such upfront payments made  by

JTC  and  HDB lessees for industrial land leases with a duration

of  less than 30 years.  This is despite the fact that under our

normal tax laws, such payments are generally capital expenditure

and not allowed a tax deduction.  The deduction is applicable to

all  qualifying new leases entered into on or after 1st  January

98.

<div align="center"><b>MORTGAGE LOAN DEFAULTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if he will provide more information about the  rise  in

private  residential  mortgage  loan  defaults  from  April   to

September  1998  and whether this will become a worrying  trend;

and how the Government will tackle this problem, particularly in

view  of  the  fact  that  any  cut in  Central  Provident  Fund

contributions may exacerbate the problem.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been an increase in non-performing housing loans

over  the  year,  ie,  loans on which borrowers  have  not  been

servicing  their instalments for 3 months or more.   Such  loans

amounted to 1.7% of the banks' total number of housing loans  as

at end-August

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



1998  compared with 1.0% as at end December-19971.  The  default

rate  is  not as yet worrying, but the MAS is monitoring closely

the trend.



<br><hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>

<pre>

1      These  estimates  are  based  on  data  from  10  leading

commercial  banks,  accounting for  90%  of  all  housing  loans

extended by commercial banks.

</pre>

<br><hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed cut in CPF contribution rate would have some

impact on mortgage loan repayments.  However, the impact will be

mitigated by both the banks and the Government.  Just  like  the

HDB will reschedule the loans for those purchasing HDB flats and

shops,  banks can be expected to reschedule the private property

loans  as far as possible and recall the loans only as a measure

of  last  resort.   As announced by the Prime  Minister  in  his

recent  National Day Rally Speech, in the event  the  Government

decides  to cut CPF contribution rates, the Government  will  be

prepared  to help property owners in their monthly housing  loan

repayments  through a bridging loan scheme.   The  scheme  would

offer loans to make up for shortfalls in housing loan repayments

arising  directly from the CPF cut.  The Government is currently

studying the terms and conditions and the implementation details

of such a scheme, and will announce it at an appropriate time.

<div align="center"><b>HEALTHCARE FOR THE ELDERLY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Health, concerning healthcare for the elderly, (a) what kind  of

medical  subsidy is given to the aged sick who have  no  Central

Provident  Fund  savings  or medical security  funds;  (b)  what

schemes  his  Ministry can offer to lighten the  burden  of  the

"sandwiched generation" of young working adults who are stressed

by  having  to use their own Medisave to pay for the  increasing

medical  expenses of their aged parents; and (c) if his Ministry

will  consider  offering more substantial medical subsidies  for

the  aged  as  a  recognition of their  contribution  to  nation

building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elderly receive heavily subsidised primary health care

at  Government polyclinics, at 75% of the treatment  cost.   For

hospital care, all patients have a choice of wards.  For Class C

beds, patients pay only 20% of the cost; the Government pays the

remaining 80%.  For Class B2 beds, the patients pay 35% of cost,

Class B1 80%.  There is no subsidy for Class A wards.  Financial

counselling  is  provided at the point of  admission  to  enable

patients to choose their ward class according to their financial

means.   To ensure that everyone has equal access to the heavily

subsidised wards, Class B2 and C beds are kept at about  70%  of

the number of public acute hospital beds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to assure the member that the public sector

hospitals  will  not turn away patients who are unable  to  pay.

The necessary treatment is always given first.  In instances  of

financial hardship, Medifund acts as a safety net to ensure that

no  Singaporeans  will  be denied essential  medical  care  just

because of the inability to pay. Therefore, the existing systems

are  able  to  help the aged sick with no CPF savings  or  other

sources of medical funds.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained earlier, we would encourage Singaporeans to

choose  a  class  of  ward which they can  afford.   If  despite

Government  subsidies, Medisave and MediShield, they  are  still

unable  to pay for the essential medical care, they may approach

the  medical  social worker of the hospital or  their  Community

Development Council for Medifund assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the aged can opt for treatment at Government polyclinics and

acute  hospitals  which  are  already  heavily  subsidised,   my

Ministry  does not consider it necessary to revise  the  subsidy

level  to  them further.  However, the Member would be aware  of

the pre-Medisave top-up scheme introduced in 1996 in recognition

of the valuable contributions and services rendered by the older

citizens  to  Singapore.  It is aimed at helping them  build  up

their Medisave accounts since they would have accumulated little

or  no  Medisave savings, having retired before or shortly after

the  Medisave  scheme was introduced in 1984.  Therefore,  those

who are 64 and above on 1st April 1998 will receive between $100

and  $350  (depending on age) so long as they make a  small  co-payment.  The co-payment reinforces the partnership between  the

Government  and  the  people  in  looking  after  the   people's

healthcare  needs.  To date, 3 top-ups, costing  the  Government

$159  million,  have been given.  The elderly will  receive  the

fourth  and  final  instalment of  the  Pre-Medisave  top-up  in

January  1999 if they contribute another co-payment of $20  into

their  Medisave account during the period 1st July 1998 to  31st

December 1998.

<div align="center"><b>PROGRAMMES FOR THE RETRAINING OF WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

how  his  Ministry intends to measure the effectiveness  of  the

various  programmes set up by the National Trades Union Congress

and  other bodies to retrain workers, in terms of the impact  of

the  programmes on workers' earnings, job placements and  career

mobility.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government support for worker retraining is primarily

through  a  $50  million  grant to  the  National  Trades  Union

Congress  (NTUC)  for the Skills Redevelopment Programme  (SRP).

This  grant  is matched by another $50 million from  the  Skills

Development  Fund.  Another $20 million was  set  aside  by  the

Government as an off-budget measure in July this year to  expand

training facilities and other infrastructure in support  of  the

SRP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SRP was initiated to address the issue of long-term

employability  of  lower-skilled workers, especially  the  older

ones.   For  this reason, it is a requirement of training  under

the SRP that it should lead to skill certification.  At present,

this means certification conferred by the Institute of Technical

Education  and  the  Polytechnics.   Courses  leading  to  skill

certification  by these institutions have been  formulated  with

the inputs from industry.  Workers who are skills certified as a

result  of  training  under the SRP are in  better  position  to

benefit from the recognition in the market for such skills.  For

example,  the gross median monthly salary for an NTC-2  graduate

is  $1,250, while for an ITC graduate it is $1,500.  As  70%  of

SRP  trainees  have an educational level below `N'  levels,  the

ability  to  obtain such skill certification  is  in  itself  an

achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present difficult economic climate, when workers face

retrenchment,   the   Ministry  is  more  concerned   with   job

preservation as an indicator of effectiveness.  In this respect,

the  SRP  has  so  far given encouraging results.   As  at  end-September, over 2,800 workers have been sent by their  companies

for  training under the SRP.  Another 1,300 have been  sent  for

training by companies, which had adopted a shorter workweek;  in

other  words,  they were sent for training as an alternative  to

being  retrenched.   To date, none of these 4,100  workers  have

been   retrenched.   They  are  either  still  undergoing  their

training or have completed training and continue to be gainfully

employed by their current employers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further 400 workers were sent for training by companies prior

to  being  retrenched.  These were mainly  companies  that  were

winding down operations and had no choice but to let their staff

go.   They  agreed to send these workers for training under  the

SRP  in  order to enhance their chances of getting another  job.

All  the  workers have since been successfully placed  with  new

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC and the Singapore Hotel Association have just launched

the  sector-driven  SRP  for the hotel industry.   To  date,  55

hotels  have  signed  up to retrain a total  of  2,000  workers.

Because of the economic downturn, these workers would have  been

vulnerable  to retrenchment.  Instead, the SRP has  provided  an

opportunity  for the hotel industry to upgrade its  manpower  at

affordable cost during a lull period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will continue to monitor the success of SRP

training in enabling workers to retain their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the SRP is employer-based, the focus has been on persuading

companies to send their existing workers for training.  However,

as  the  numbers of unemployed have risen, we have also embarked

on  an initiative to match unemployed workers with employers who

are willing to take them on and support their training under the

SRP.   The  Ministry will monitor the number of such  unemployed

workers  who  are  successfully  placed  as  a  result  of  this

initiative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term, the Ministry intends to study the overall

effectiveness  of  the  SRP in terms of  the  employability  and

increase  in  the  earnings capacity of trainees.   However,  we

should  be  mindful that such analyses would be more  meaningful

when the economic situation has stabilised.

<div align="center"><b>FUNDS FOR RETRAINING OF WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Manpower,

in  view  of  the growing demand for social services during  the

economic  downturn,  whether  the  funds  set  aside   for   the

retraining  and  upgrading  of workers  will  be  used  (i)  for

individuals  who  are training for jobs in the social  services;

and (ii) for those who are now working in or retrenched from the

manufacturing  sector  and who wish  to  switch  to  the  social

services sector.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the economic downturn, social services remain one of few

sectors  still  in  need  of workers. Health  and  social  work,

community, social and personal services contribute to around  7%

of  total employment.  In the second quarter, this group saw  an

increase  of 800 workers against an overall reduction  of  5,800

jobs economy wide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, through the Skills Redevelopment Programme, funding for

training  has been provided mainly in the manufacturing  sector.

The  Ministry is also working closely with NTUC, SNEF and  other

agencies  to  identify training opportunities in other  services

sectors  such  as  hotels and restaurants and  IT.    Similarly,

funding  would be extended to the social services  sector  where

there is demand for workers with higher skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, we have, however, not seen a significant trend of

retrenched  workers  opting to go into social  services.   There

remain  vacancies  in manufacturing sector  and  other  services

sectors such as transport and communications, education and  IT.

The priority would be to train workers to fill these vacancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, social work has not been popular with our workers

due  to  the generally lower pay and uncertain career prospects.

However, if the downturn worsens, social services would  provide

a  good  avenue  to  absorb surplus workers.    More  unemployed

Singaporeans who lack skills for other jobs may have to consider

social services jobs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will evaluate the possibility of encouraging

workers  to take up jobs in social services.  We have started  a

process  of  identifying training providers in such  areas,  for

example,   in  professional  cleaning  services.    Courses   in

counselling services, community development and awareness,  etc,

are  other possibilities.  Proper training would help to enhance

the  image  and professionalism of social workers,  and  give  a

boost  to our people to take such jobs. Similar to manufacturing

and  services sectors, government funding could be provided  for

the  drawing  up of curriculum and certification programmes,  as

well as training under such courses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Community

Development whether his Ministry will set up a Special  Fund  to

provide financial assistance to families who have fallen on  bad

times, and whether such a Fund will be administered by CDCs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a wide range of schemes and services

administered   by   Ministries,  the  CDCs,  voluntary   welfare

organisations   and  self-help  groups  to  help   disadvantaged

families  or individuals in times of distress.  A list of  these

organisations and groups is available in MCD.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families or individuals who face financial hardship because

of the current economic downturn can approach MCD or the various

organisations  administering these schemes for assistance.   MCD

will  ensure  that there are sufficient funds  for  the  various

schemes and that genuine cases will receive financial assistance

to help them to tide over this difficult period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New funding schemes could be set up should there be a need.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN STUDENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) how many

foreign students are currently in our schools; (b) how many such

students  were registered this year for 1999; and  (c)  for  the

Primary  1 registration, whether foreign students get to  choose

the  schools  they want and therefore compete with  Singaporeans

for places in the popular schools, or whether they are posted to

schools  by  his Ministry after Singaporeans have completed  the

Phase 2C registration.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of foreign students in our schools is

19,025 of which 9,381 are in primary schools, 8,508 in secondary

schools and 1,136 in junior colleges and centralised institutes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of students who have applied to MOE for admission to

schools in 1999 is 2,533.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Primary 1 registration, foreign students are registered

for  schools  after  children  who are  Singapore  Citizens  and

Singapore  Permanent  Residents have been  registered.   Foreign

students  can  only be registered in schools  which  still  have

Primary  1  vacancies  and  therefore  will  not  compete   with

Singaporeans  for  places  in  the popular  schools  during  the

registration exercise.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOOL DROP-OUTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) how many

students dropped out of the education chain in the years 1995 to

1997;  (b)  whether there has been any study  to  determine  the

causes;  and  (c) what measures have been taken to  reduce  such

incidences.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1995 to 1997, about 1,880 students dropped out of the

education  system  yearly.  This represents about  0.4%  of  the

enrolment  each  year.  This figure does not include  those  who

left for overseas studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study to determine the causes for pupils dropping out of

the  education  system was completed in 1995  by  NIE  with  the

involvement  of  MOE officers. The study revealed  that  pupils'

negative  attitude towards school and problems at home were  the

main factors that caused them to drop out of the school system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, feedback from schools has enabled MOE to build

a profile of the premature school leaver.  This has also enabled

schools  to  identify  potential premature  school  leavers  for

preventive action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools actively identify and counsel potential dropouts.

They  work closely with parents of pupils concerned to keep them

in  schools.   Where necessary, cases are also referred  to  the

various  Self-Help  Groups for assistance.  Measures  to  reduce

dropout  rate  have shown some success.  Compared to  1990,  the

number  of  pupils  who  left school  prematurely  in  1997  has

decreased by 521, representing a drop from 0.6% in 1990  to  the

current 0.4%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that these premature school leavers wish to

return to school, schools are generally ready to re-admit  them,

provided they are not over aged.
