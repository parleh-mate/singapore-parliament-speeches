<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS ON DETENTION OF LOCAL JOURNALISTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affair's if he will give his comments on the story

reportedly carried in The Sunday Times of London that

the  detention of the local journalists  and  the

statement about the involvement of the Editor of the

Review have "seriously jeopardised its (Singapore's)

international reputation", and whether in his view

foreign correspondents resident in Singapore have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



any  role  to  play in the foreign relations  of  the

Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is referring

to an article by a Mr William Shawcross in the Sunday

Times of London of 13th March. In answering the  hon.

Member's question I am in danger of breaching  a  new

convention  which  certain sections  of  the  Western

Press  have  developed in regard to criticism.  If  a

pressman  attacks a politician, that is free  speech.

But if the politician concerned hits back, then a hue

and  cry  is raised that freedom of the press  is  in

utter  jeopardy. A point that has been lost sight  of

in   recent  press  criticisms  about  the  Singapore

Government is that though we have, as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>



Government,  often exercised our right  to  tell  off

certain   foreign  pressmen  when   we   think   them

misguided, we have never arrested or deported any  of

them or banned their publications merely for critical

and even ill-informed articles about Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done so only when, from being mere observers

and  reporters, pressmen have become active partisans

in  our domestic affairs or, as a number of them did,

got  involved with subversion and the espousal of its

cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to Mr William Shawcross'

observation  in the Sunday Times that the  arrest  of

Singaporeans  who have admitted to working  with  the

communists  has  blackened Singapore's  international

reputation,  it has about as much substance  as  that

paper's  efforts a few years ago to sell the  Slater-Walker  team  to the world as model of  21st  century

entrepreneurs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, Sir, the reputation of the Singapore

Government has sunk rapidly in the eyes of a  handful

of  British publications, like the Sunday Times,  The

Times,  the  Far  Eastern  Economic  Review  and  the

Economist.  But these publications do  not  represent

world  opinion  and our reputation  with  some  1  50

nations is as sound as ever before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No government or international

financiers  have  told us officially or  unofficially

that  they  have  lost confidence  in  the  Singapore

Government  as  a  result of the  recent  arrests  in

Singapore.  So  I  do not know what Mr  Shawcross  is

talking about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member's second half of the question,

I  am  not quite sure what the hon. Member means when

he  asks whether "foreign correspondents resident  in

Singapore  have  any  role to  play  in  the  foreign

relations  of the Republic." Perhaps what the  Member

has  in  mind is, to me, the astonishing  conduct  of

some  foreign newsmen in Singapore and the even  more

astonishing  reaction of certain British publications

to  the  arrest  and confessions of Mr  Arun  and  Mr

Raman, among others. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>



coverage in a number of British papers of the  public

statements  of Arun and Raman have not been  so  much

factual    reports   as   sceptical   and   selective

evaluations  of  what was said by them.  The  general

tenor  of  the  reports was such as to leave  in  the

minds  of  their  readers the  impressions  that  the

confessions were rigged and that the people  arrested

were  not  really communists or communist  supporters

but victims of PAP intolerance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, Mr Speaker, Sir, when the foreign press was

invited  to  question Arun and Raman over  TV,  their

silence  was  deafening. If Western  pressmen  really

believed that the whole show was stage-managed,  that

the  two gentlemen concerned had been either tortured

or  terrorised  into admitting things  they  had  not

done,  then one would have thought that here  was  an

opportunity  for the Western pressmen  to  expose  by

sharp  and in-depth questioning of the two  that  the

whole thing was rigged. Here was an opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can think of many occasions in Europe and

America  when newsmen were not averse to coming  into

TV  studios, were not deterred by studio  lights  and

batteries  of  TV cameras from grilling subjects  who

could  provide  them  with news and,  in  this  case,

indeed most startling news had the newsmen been  able

to expose these confessions as a fraud.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that we had put any kind of restraints on

the questions the newsmen could ask. There were none.

In  fact,  the Chairman. Mr James Fu, had  repeatedly

asked  the foreign pressmen to put questions and  all

this  was  greeted with what I can only  describe  as

"studied  silence". Clearly, the foreign newsmen  had

come determined and convinced that the cause of press

freedom  or some other cause could best be served  by

not being provoked into asking questions. This, in my

view,  is odd behaviour for men who earn their  bread

and  butter  and  their reputation by asking  awkward

questions.   I  can  only  make  a  guess   at   this

inexplicable lack of curiosity over confessions which

had already been portrayed by sections of the Western

press as manifestations of a police state.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My guess, Mr Speaker, is that the Western newsmen

sensed  from  the  evidence given  to  them  that  an

intense  grilling of Mr Arun and Mr Raman, far  from

weakening  the  Government's case,  would  only  have

strengthened it. It would have shattered the myth  so

elaborately built up in sections of the Western press

that the PAP Government was dedicated to stamping out

all  dissent,  crushing all political  opponents  and

building up a totalitarian state. Had there  been  an

intense cross-questioning by foreign pressmen of Arun

and  Raman, what would have in fact emerged was  that

we had detained a journalist who had knowingly played

along   with  the  communists,  and  a  lawyer   with

affiliations  with  British  Marxists,  not   averse,

according  to  Mr Raman, to using violence  to  bring

down  the  PAP  Government. Had the  Western  newsmen

actively  participated in the  interview,  then  they

would  have had to report it as such and report  what

actually  happened  and  that  would  have  left   an

impression  in  the minds of readers in  the  Western

world  that  the detention was justified.  So  better

keep  quiet and leave undisturbed the impression that

the  TV press conference was rigged. Hence The  Times

of   18th   March   could   with   apparent   honesty

editorialise as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The televised statements by Mr Raman and Mr

Senkuttuvan, both  of them hollow-sounding  recitals

with  a  dictated air - by whatever means  they  were

extracted ...",



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, "the whole thing is phoney. Do not

question.  Just  report  what  you  think  happened."

Incidentally,  Sir,  the  same  paper  dismissed  the

recent  Singapore general elections in  a  couple  of

obscure  paragraphs.  It would not  have  suited  The

Times'  carefully nurtured image of a tyrannical  PAP

Government to have given importance to the fact  that

it  had instead won all seats for the third time  and

with an increased majority of the votes cast. So tuck

it away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, thanks to the silence of the Western

pressmen, the Economist of 19th March, the next  day,

permitted itself this little bit of detached comment,

and I quote:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll up for yet another public showing of the

uglier face of Singapore's police state. On March 12.

the  Government persuaded two of the men arrested ...

to  confess  to the error of their ways  in  a  press

conference on live television."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of the two journals concerned mentioned the

pertinent  fact that the Western pressmen were  there

at  the  conference and that they had  not  made  the

slightest  attempt through interview to  get  at  the

facts,  to  get  at  the truth. Sir,  the  truth  had

already  been arrived at before the press  conference

in  the editorial offices in London and any fresh and

conflicting evidence would be most unwelcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the PAP Government and the voters of Singapore

appear to be adamant in doing what they think is good

for Singapore, the Sunday Times and Mr Shawcross have

now  carried  British  journalism  into  the  murkier

grounds  of blackmail. Since they cannot persuade  us

by  threats,  what  about  blackmail.  So  he  warned

Singapore that (and I quote):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"as Singapore depends on the international money

market  for  its prosperity (the arrests)  can  prove

counterproductive."



<br><br>Telling us if we do not do what they say we must  do,

no more investments. That is how I read it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shawcross wants us to believe that were Singapore

to  release known and self-confessed Communists, stop

broadcasting  revelations  by  Communists  and   pro-Communists  how they go about their furtive  business

of  subversion,  give immunity to  those  who,  under

cover  of  free speech, breach the laws of libel  and

slander  and  scrap the detention laws for  which  we

have popular mandate then, according to Mr Shawcross,

foreign  investors would be streaming into Singapore,

pockets full of money and with joy in their hearts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Mr Shawcross has a pretty low opinion of

Asian   intelligence  and  especially  of   Singapore

intelligence. On the contrary it is because  we  have

not  been following Mr Shawcross' advice that foreign

investors  have shown a growing interest in Singapore

and increasing nervousness about those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>



countries  where  the remedies Mr Shawcross  suggests

have been applied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have my own views as to why

certain  sections  of  the  Western  press,  and   in

particular  the British press, are going  beyond  the

bounds  of  journalism  to pressurise  the  Singapore

Government into adopting policies which the people of

Singapore  know  would  bring back  the  lawlessness,

violence, rioting, and economic stagnation which were

features when the Communists and pro-Communists  were

allowed  to  run  around. The  Western  press  knows,

including the Western pressmen here, that we are  not

crushing  opposition. In the recent  elections  there

were  any  number  of parties. We  are  not  crushing

opposition  which  is lawful and  constitutional  but

Communist opposition which is unlawful, and  for  the

suppression  of which we have full mandate  from  the

people.  And yet they go back, even now, and  say  we

are crushing opposition, never saying we are crushing

Communist opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, under the pretence of upholding

human rights and democracy in darkest Singapore, what

this  section of the press, of the British  press  in

particular,  is agitating for through distortion  and

even  blackmail  is  rights for Communists  and  pro-Communists  to  run  around once again  in  Singapore

knowing full well what the consequences would be  for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it that they want a revival of the old Singapore?

Why  is the press doing this? Well, Mr Speaker,  that

is  another story for some other time. Are  then  the

foreign correspondents resident in Singapore suspect?

In my view, and I know many of them, most of them are

just   being   straightforward  newsmen.   But   some

presumably  are specially selected by their  editors,

including  local  journalists,  for  more  than  mere

reporting.  For example, Mr Derek Davies of  the  Far

Eastern  Economic Review has a flair  (it  must  have

been a well developed one, a very unusual flair)  for

choosing local malcontents for correspondents. I must

assume  that  Mr Davies has carefully assessed  their

character



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>



before  appointing them. He must therefore know  that

he  will  get biased, blunted and false reports  from

them.  Mr Speaker, you may recollect a British  press

baron,  Lord Northcliffe, if I am right, who said  he

never  had  to tell his editor what to write  because

the  man  he  chose made this unnecessary.  Or  as  a

British poet put it more pungently (and I quote):



<pre>

 `You cannot, thank God

 Bribe or twist

 A British journalist

 But seeing what the fellow will do

 Unbribed

 There's no occasion to.'

<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I wish to ask a supplementary question. When  I

asked    the    Hon.    Minister   whether    foreign

correspondents in Singapore have any role to play  in

the  formation of our foreign policy, I implied  that

they  really  have no role at all, and  I  think  the

Minister's answer confirms that. However. I think  we

do welcome -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lau, what is your supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> It is coming up, Sir. We welcome

foreign correspondents but we expect them to play  a

proper  role,  as the Hon. Minister  has  mentioned;

they  should  be straightforward newspaper  men.  In

this connection, may I quote -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Where is your supplementary question, Dr

Lau?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> I would like the Minister's

comments  on a further remark on the part of  William

Shawcross, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is speculation in Singapore that he (Prime

Minister Lee Kuan Yew) has decided to rid himself  of

an  independent international press  in  the  way  he

disposed of domestic press criticism.'



<br><br>May  I ask the Hon. Minister what the proper role  of

the  foreign  correspondents should be and  would  he

advise the foreign correspondents here.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, we

have  not the slightest intention of getting  rid  of

the  foreign press. The foreign press may get rid  of

itself by itself. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>



interesting,  Sir, that Singapore  is  not  the  only

country  which  seems to get into  trouble  with  the

Western  press.  All  over Asia  and  Africa  Western

pressmen  have  been  either  arrested,  deported  or

suspended.  In fact, as I have said, in Singapore  we

have  done none of these things. So there is  a  role

for Western pressmen. I am not talking of all foreign

correspondents because apart from the  British  press

there   has  been  no  complaint  from  any   foreign

correspondent, neither from Izvestia nor from  Peking

nor from Hanoi. If he means by foreign correspondents

the  Western press, they have a role to play. "Please

report  as accurately as you can, even critically  as

you  can,  so  long  as you do not interfere  in  our

internal affairs."



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

supplementary  question. Why  should  the  Government

allow  the  specially selected foreign correspondents

to  be  resident in Singapore if the scope  of  their

activities is beyond the scope of journalism?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we would not know

when  they are specially selected until after we have

spotted them. And when we spot them we arrest them.

reply, in order to save time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 8101.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is noted that the sum appropriated for FY76

has  not been utilised, hence the revote. Perhaps the

Hon.  Minister would care to enlighten this House  as

to  the  reasons  why  the Centralised  Motor  Repair

Workshops   have   not  been  constructed, although

provision for this has already been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House was informed yesterday by the Senior

Minister of State that the Ministry is faced with the

problem  of  resettling workshops, especially  those

that are in the city areas. I fail to understand  how

the Ministry concerned would be able to resettle such

workshops   unless  the  Centralised   Motor   Repair

Workshops  are ready for them to move in.  Would  not

the  Hon.  Minister also enlighten this House  as  to

where  these workshops are to be located, when  would

construction commence and when would these  workshops

be completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  proposed  site for the  Centralised  Motor

and   cost  estimates  for  the  project  have   been

completed.  The  Ministry  will  proceed   with   the

implementation of the project as soon  as  funds  are

available.  Sir, the delay to implement  this  scheme

was  due to the fact that we had to get approval from

the  Development Planning Committee  of  the  Finance

Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 8104*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng

Kah Ting).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main function of the Urban and

Rural  Services  Committee  is  to  look  after   the

development of the rural areas in Singapore. Over the

past decade the URSC has been quite successful in the

development of the rural areas in Singapore. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>



achievement  has  helped to improve the  standard  of

living  of  the  rural  people by  the  provision  of

electricity,  better  roads, water  supply,  etc.  In

other words, the URSC has brought to the rural people

modern facilities in their environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding this achievement I

notice from the provision that there is a sum of only

$3.94 million for expenditure on so many rural areas.

This  is  obviously insufficient and it is less  than

the  provision for last year. We should increase this

provision  so  that  the  various  construction   and

development work in the rural areas can be  proceeded

with more expeditiously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I visit my constituents very often. In the

course  of  my  visits I notice  that  some  recently

constructed roads have a lot of potholes and  driving

becomes rather bumpy, so soon after the completion of

the road.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the reason for this? Sir, I think this is

because  supervision of the work has not been carried

out  thoroughly.  As  a  result  of  lack  of  proper

supervision, unethical and irresponsible  contractors

have  provided bad services at the expense of  public

money.  In  other words there have been malpractices.

They have failed to construct the roads according  to

proper   specifications.  As  a  result,  the   roads

deteriorate  more rapidly than expected.  This  is  a

waste of public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand. Sir,I have also noticed that

roads  built under the gotong royong scheme are  much

better  than  those  built by the  contractors.  Even

after  several  years of use, these roads  are  still

good.  So  I  would like to propose that, where  road

construction is concerned, whether the job is big  or

small, we should encourage more people to participate

in  gotong  royong rather than leaving this  work  of

road  construction  entirely to contractors.  By  the

spirit  of  gotong royong, we will be  able  to  save

costs  and  use the savings to construct still  more.

within the limited supply of funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, MPs representing the

rural areas welcome the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>



provision  of  $3.94  million  for  urban  and  rural

services. However. Sir, it should be noted that  item

(h)   of  this  subhead  amounting  to  $339,990   is

Expenditure  Carried  Forward. In  other  words,  the

total amount that will actually be utilised for urban

and  rural services for FY 77 is $3,600,010  to  be

exact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I must first give due credit to the Urban and

Rural  Services  Committee under the chairmanship  of

the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

National  Development in the last 14  years  for  the

various  amenities enumerated and have  already  been

provided  to the rural constituencies, I  would  like

the  Parliamentary Secretary to inform this House  as

to  the  total amount of monies spent up to date, in

respect of the items listed. I shall also be grateful

if  he will be kind enough to state the total amounts

spent on each item. Otherwise it may be construed, as

implied by one hon. Member, ah, yes I think it is the

hon.  Member  for Boon Lay who was reported  to  have

said  that the Chairman of URSC had nothing to inform

the  press  of  what  URSC  has  done  to  the  rural

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this, Sir, I would like to draw the

attention  of  the  House in  general  and  the  Hon.

Parliamentary   Secretary  in   particular   on   the

following observations:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Most of the kampong roads are now in dire need

of  repairs  as  they were metalled some  years  ago.

These  roads are full of potholes resulting  in  much

inconvenience to the residents. Would  not  the  URSC

consider resurfacing them? These roads, moreover, are

very  narrow and need to be widened, I hope the  URSC

will consider this also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Street lighting in the kampongs is poor and

brighter  Street  lamps should  replace  these  lamps

which in some cases are more than 10 years old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Public standpipes were removed to enable

households to connect piped-water into their homes. I

would  like to know how much has been spent on laying

of  water-mains to enable those affected  to  connect

piped-water to their houses. How many households have

benefitted as a result? and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Last year. I submitted a question for Oral

Answer  concerning  the  making  up  of  the  various

Farmways  in the Pig Farming areas. The Hon. Minister

for  National Development and Communications  replied

that  such  requests  would be favourably  considered

when submitted to the URSC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Senior Minister of State in reply to

questions  on this matter yesterday, stated  that  it

would take some time for the necessary infrastructure

and services to be provided in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this will entail high costs and it is

my  contention that the URSC should not  be  made  to

bear  such  costs  in  fairness to  the  other  rural

constituencies for the simple reason  that  the  sums

allocated  are definitely insufficient  to  meet  the

numerous requests of these constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I would like to reiterate that the

URSC   make  out  the  necessary  costing  for   such

provision  and that this matter be submitted  to  the

Finance Ministry for approval.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

first  of  all, I would like to thank the Member  for

Sembawang  and  the  Member  for  Punggol  for  their

remarks on the Urban and Rural Services Committee and

for  making suggestions to the Committee. The  Member

for   Sembawang  has  said  that  after   repair   of

construction  of  roads in the rural  areas,  further

repairs  often become necessary and he has  expressed

the  view  that  this was due to the lack  of  strict

supervision.  As  a  matter of fact,  Sir,  all  road

construction undertaken by contractors is  supervised

by  officers  of  the  Public Works  Department  very

strictly. There is no need for us to worry about this

aspect. Furthermore, Sir, it is also written in every

tender   contract  that  for  the  first  six  months

contractors are held responsible for any  defects  or

disrepair of the road after completion. The  crux  of

the matter is that the newly completed metalled roads

very  often attract a lot more vehicles. As a  result

of  excessive  use  of such roads,  the  neighbouring

rural roads are also affected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>



and  become  damaged. As soon as  the  URSC  has  got

information of such a state of affairs, the PWD  will

be  told  to  carry out immediate repairs to  prevent

further deterioration of the roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also suggested that we

should  encourage more people to participate in  road

construction  under the gotong royong  scheme.  As  a

matter  of fact, Sir, this has always been encouraged

by  the  URSC.  In  1976 alone,  in  Chua  Chu  Kang.

Punggol, Nee Soon, Jurong, Tampines and Kampong  Chai

Chee, we launched a gotong royong campaign for  road

construction in these areas. As a result, 18  rural

roads  were  repaired  or  improved  at  a  cost   of

$638,000.  All  these  road  construction  works  and

improvement  were  completed according  to  schedule.

Here,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I would like to  express  my

thanks  on behalf of the Government to all the  rural

people, the CCC, the MPs, national servicemen and the

undergraduates of higher institutions of learning for

their  participation in these gotong royong projects.

Sir, I can assure the Member for Sembawang that these

collective gotong royong projects will continue to be

encouraged by the Government and will receive all the

necessary support of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also asked for an

increase in the provision of funds for the URSC. As a

matter  of  fact, Sir, over the past few  years,  the

Urban  and  Rural Services Committee has  been  given

increasing  funds from year to year. For example,  in

FY  1974-75, the  provision for the  URSC  was  $3.3

million  whereas  in  FY  75-76  the  provision   was

increased  to $3.6 million. There was an increase  of

9.8%.  In  FY 76-77, the provision was $3.98 million,

an increase of 9.7%. For the new financial year of 77-78,  the provision is $3.94 million. This may  appear

to  be slightly less than the previous provision but,

in actual fact, it is not so. I say so because in the

previous provisions for the URSC there was included a

sum  of  $1  million  for the improvement  of  street

lighting in the urban areas, and this amount has  now

been  transferred  to  the PWD fund  from  the  total

allocation to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>



URSC.  So  if  we were to include the $1 million  for

street  lighting improvement in the city  area,  then

the total allocation can be said to have increased by

25% over the previous year's provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the view expressed by

the  hon.  Member for Punggol that the U  RSC  annual

allocation  of  funds  can  only  be  used  for   the

improvement  of public amenities within  the  various

constituencies.  As  regards the  work  for  the  new

resettlement areas, such as the resettlement area  in

Jalan Kayu and Punggol, the pig farms, etc., the URSC

will  very  soon make a careful study and  survey  of

these  two Constituencies to understand and  to  find

out  which public facilities need further improvement

or greater attention. At the same time, the URSC will

also make an estimate of the amount of money required

for  these facilities and action will be taken to ask

the  Ministry  of  Finance for the  appropriation  of

funds. So the hon. Member can rest assured about this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the matter raised by the Member for

Punggol  that  the street lights in the  rural  areas

provided by the URSC are not bright enough and should

be improved, my answer is that his criticism is quite

correct.  As  a  matter of fact, Sir, the  Urban  and

Rural  Services Committee as far back as three  years

ago,  looked  into this matter very  carefully.  But,

because  in certain rural areas there were  still  no

street  lights  available, so they  could  not  as  a

matter of priority improve on the lighting conditions

of the earlier existing lamps.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, because most of the roads in the rural areas

are  equipped  with street lights, the  URSC  is  now

ready  to  do something to improve the poor lighting.

In the past the street lights installed in some rural

areas  were 100 watt metal filament lamps.  That  was

one  type. The other type was the 40 watt flourescent

tubes.  The  common  feature of these  two  types  of

lighting  is  that they will only last two  to  three

months. The maintenance cost therefore is very  high.

Three   years  ago  the  Urban  and  Rural   Services

Committee on an experimental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>



basis  used the 125 watt high pressure mercury vapour

lamps and they found that this kind of light was much

better.  They find that the new type was eight  times

brighter than the old ones and they could last two to

three  years.  This  means a greater  consumption  of

electricity.  The  URSC has decided  to  improve  the

existing lamps gradually over the next few years.  In

the  more  densely populated areas or in areas  where

there  are community centres, priority will be  given

in the replacement of old lamps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the rural roads built earlier are found to be in

a  very serious state of disrepair, the URSC is  ever

ready  to consider taking immediate action to  repair

such  roads  as  soon  as possible.  The  Member  for

Punggol  wanted to know the work of the URSC  in  the

past  14  years from 1963 to 1976, in the improvement

of  public  facilities in the rural and urban  areas.

Over  the  14 years, the URSC has spent  a  total  of

$48,144  million for the improvement  of  the  living

environment of the rural people. This amount of money

had  been  spent on the provisions for the  following

separate   items:   First,  on   rural   roads,   the

expenditure  amounted to $15.691 million. Second, the

provision  of  street lighting which  took  up  $8.96

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the provision of water pipes $6.288 million,

under   this  scheme  11,542  households  have   been

provided with water supply. That is to say, more than

103,800   people  have  benefitted.   Fourth, rural

electrification  scheme which was completed  by  1972

accounted  for  $13.624 million, benefitting  about  1

62,000  people  involving  about  23,000  households.

Fifth,  improvement of jetties and other works $3.551

million. All these facts and figures show that of the

$48.144 million mentioned earlier, about 74%  of  the

money  was spent on rural constituencies. This  shows

that  the  Government  has  done  a  great  deal   in

improving the living conditions of the people in  the

rural  areas.  Nothwithstanding what  we  have  done.

there  is  still room in the rural areas which  merit

further consideration and attention from the URSC and

further efforts will be made to improve such areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 16th of this month when the House was

debating  the estimates for the Ministry of  Culture.

the Member for Boon Lay raised the question as to why

the  URSC  had not held press conferences as  in  the

past.  I would like to take this opportunity to  give

him a brief reply. In the past, because the Urban and

Rural Services Committee was just a newly established

Government  agency, the people in Singapore  did  not

quite  understand the objectives, plans and the  work

procedure  adopted by the URSC. There  was  therefore

the  necessity for frequent press conferences  to  be

held to keep the people informed of the detailed work-objectives,  the procedure and development  plans  of

the  URSC.  After  several years of  work  the  rural

people have improved in their living conditions.  The

living  environment  in  the  rural  areas  has  been

improving  all  the time. The people  not  only  have

better  roads,  brighter lights but they  also  enjoy

modern  living facilities. Subsequently, we have  the

Citizens'  Consultative Committees and the Management

Committees of Community Centres set up in  the  rural

areas.  The  URSC  has often come  into  contact  and

liaise  with such committees. The needs were  brought

to  the  attention of the Government and  the  people

also  know  what  the Government is doing  for  them.

Under  the circumstances there is no longer the  need

to hold press conferences which would be amounting to

drawing  a  snake  and adding legs to  it, which  is

unnecessary. The more important thing for the URSC is

to  keep  on  with its effort to improve  the  living

conditions of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary has given me a  satisfactory

answer, and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 8201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I am taking the opportunity

to enquire from the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>



as  to  when  the Housing and Development Board  will

develop Ah Hood Road vicinity. It was some years  ago

when  land was acquired by the HDB after fire  gutted

some  of the huts there. Since then no concrete steps

were  taken to expedite the development of the  area.

Residents  staying there are not allowed to  renovate

their   present  huts.  Some  of  them   want   early

resettlement but were told to wait. The question  is.

how  long  do  they have to wait? As  the  Member  of

Parliament for the area, it is natural that I  should

want  to see, despite some of the criticisms that  my

fellow  Members of Parliament have to say  about  the

designs and qualities of the HDB flats, a nice little

housing  estate,  with pleasant surroundings  in  the

area  rather than to see the present dilapidated  old

huts in such deplorable surroundings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be opportune for me at this time to suggest

that  in  the  development scheme for  the  area  the

Housing  and  Development  Board  should  take   into

account  two factors: (1) There is already  a  fairly

large  scale  development of  private  flats  in  the

adjoining   areas.  This  definitely  adds   to   the

population  density in and around  the  area.  It  is

therefore  important that sufficient open  space  and

recreational facilities be provided. (2)      Because

of the very large number of households in the area it

is very necessary to build a market there.

heavily  encumbered clearance is likely to take  some

years  to  complete. The HDB, on the other  hand,  is

unable  to  indicate  a  firm date  for  development.

However, construction  work  is  expected  to  begin

sometime  in  1979. The Member's suggestion  for  the

inclusion  of  a market, open space and  recreational

facilities will be included in the development plan.

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir,I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 8301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I pointed out earlier in this House that I have

resettlement  both ways. Many families have  to  move

out from Punggol to make way for the pig farmers from

Chua  Chu  Kang  and Kranji catchment  areas.  I  had

appealed  that  the  approach  to  this  resettlement

should  be  more  humane and  sympathetic  so  as  to

alleviate  the  bitterness  on  the  part  of   those

families  concerned. Those who had to move  out  were

not  given sufficient time to do so and were to  some

extent often harassed. They complained that they were

not  given the opportunity to purchase flats of their

choice  on  grounds that these flats are  not  ready.

Take,  for  example,  the Punggol  estate  which  was

developed  in two phases. Phase I has been  completed

and  Phase II is nearing completion. The result, they

have  to rent flats first in those offered for rental

in Punggol Estate Phase I and await completion of the

new flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reinforce my assertion, may I inform the House

and  the  Minister concerned that I  have  about  103

resettled  families (from Punggol) in Punggol  Estate

waiting  to purchase their flats in the said  Estate,

which  will be due for balloting at the end  of  this

month.  My  question  is  why  the  HDB  resettlement

department did not encourage these affected  families

to  accept  other estates where flats are  ready  for

occupation.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the relocation of farmers from the catchment

areas to the non-catchment areas. I have visited them

on  several occasions and held discussions with them.

They complained to me that they were told to move out

soonest  possible  because their  farms  are  causing

pollution  to  the Kranji Reservoir. They  agreed  to

cooperate  in  the national interest, but  when  they

came to see the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>



farming lots allocated, they noted that they  had  to

start life anew because they had to set up new farms.

They  accept  this and I am proud of them.  But  they

pointed  out  that  apart from the barest  facilities

provided, they need time to settle down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had to spend a lot of money to do so. Moreover,

they had to borrow money to set up their farm, as the

so-called enhanced compensation could not be paid  to

them  earlier. I mentioned that in some  cases,  they

have  been resettled as many as four times. Therefore

the  uprooting of these families has made the  ground

bitter. I must urge the Hon. Minister concerned  that

his  department should henceforth be more humane  and

sympathetic in its approach towards resettlement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the Government is

appreciative of the understanding of these  resettled

families in the importance of water and the  need  to

move  them out from the catchment area. The  Ministry

does  not  believe  that the Resettlement  Department

would  really harass the families concerned in  order

to achieve its objectives but, if it pleases the hon.

Member,   we  can  perhaps  advise  the  Resettlement

Department  to be more persuasive in its approach.  I

am  surprised  at  the  incidence  quoted  where  the

Resettlement  Department did not try to persuade  the

103  resettled  families to other areas.  The  likely

reason  would be that there are available flats,  for

example, in Bedok, Ang Mo Kio and even as far away as

Woodlands,  but  the families have been  so  used  to

Punggol and the good efforts done by the MP that they

choose  to  stay in Punggol. So they would prefer  to

rent  the  flats at Punggol Estate I and do not  mind

waiting to purchase the flats at Punggol Estate II. I

think that is more likely the reason and not the fact

that  the HDB's Resettlement Department had not given

them any alternative accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his query on the need to be more humane and

sympathetic  to  alleviate the  bitterness  of  these

people concerned, we share his sentiments and  I  can

only  reiterate  by saying that we could  advise  the

Resettlement Department to be more persuasive in  its

approach.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original time given for those to resettle from

the  Kranji  catchment area was much  shorter  and  I

think,  due  to the urgency of the project,  extended

time  was  given to allow them to move out  from  the

catchment area. Similarly. I suppose the same reasons

are  applicable  to Punggol where the  families  have

been  resettled  outside  so  as  to  make  the  land

available  to  resettle those pig  farmers  from  the

catchment area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In view of the assurance from the

Senior   Minister  of  State  that   his   department

concerned would be more humane and sympathetic, I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.

Ahmad Haleem and Dr Ong Leong Boon)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the subject I am speaking on

comes under the right subhead, because it seems  that

the  Senior  Minister  of  State  for  Communications

normally deals with the mass transit system. However,

since  this item appears in the Estimates  under  the

Ministry of National Development, I would like to ask

a  few  points. What progress has been  made  in  the

development of the Mass Rapid Transit System  in  our

Republic  so  far?  Are we still relying  on  foreign

experts,  or are we making progress on our own?  What

has  been the result of the various expensive studies

that  have been conducted during the past few  years?

Could the Minister comment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ahmad Haleem is not here. Dr Ong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, I

rise  in support of the sentiments expressed  by  the

hon.  Member  for  Anson  regarding  the  mass  rapid

transit system that we hear so much about but has yet

to see its realisation. I recall that the Hon. Senior

Minister of State for Communications was one  of  the

most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>



vocal advocates of the system years back when he  was

sitting on this side of the House. I hope, Sir,  that

he  would pursue the same matter with the same vigour

and persistence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also note that the Prime Minister and, of

course,  the  Hon. Minister for National  Development

and Communications, have just returned from Hong Kong

and  we  are  told  that they made  some  on-the-spot

studies.  I would have thought that this would  be  a

good  occasion  when  perhaps  they  might  like   to

enlighten  us as to what steps or progress there  are

in relation to the mass rapid transit system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last time we hear of this matter was in

connection  with the completion of Phase  II  of  the

feasibility  study. I would just  like  to  make  the

point  that  if  we must go ahead, I think  an  early

decision  should  be  made because  any  delay  means

further costs and this Government is, as we all know,

very cost-conscious.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the Singapore Mass Transit

Study  was  undertaken in two  phases.  In  Phase  I,

various mass transit systems including both the  all-bus  and the bus-rail systems were examined. Phase  I

was  completed  in early 1974 with the recommendation

to study in greater detail a bus-rail system and this

was  carried out in Phase II. Both phases of the  MTS

were undertaken by a firm of consultants appointed by

the  World Bank which acted as executing agencies for

the  UNDP. To assure the hon. Member for Anson, local

counterpart  staff  were attached  to  the  MTS  Unit

throughout the feasibility study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phase II study was completed by the consultants

in  March  1976 and the draft final report which  was

submitted  by the consultants is now under review  by

the  World  Bank. The consultants had concluded  that

the  rail-base  mass  transit system  is  technically

feasible.  The  World Bank, however, has  taken  some

time for their review because of the many factors  to

be considered, including a close scrutiny of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>



bases  and assumptions used in this study. The  World

Bank  has indicated that the review will be finalised

shortly.  My colleague, the Senior Minister of  State

for  Communications is still extremely interested  in

this  project and he has just told me that  they  are

pursuing the report of the World Bank very closely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Minister has just been to Hong Kong but it was on

an  unofficial  visit.  So do not  believe  what  the

newspapers have said.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, we should not spend too

much  money in engaging consultants. We must be  very

careful  about spending such money. We  are  spending

too  much money on consultants. We should engage  one

consultant right until he completes his work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir,I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead DAA 8101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I should explain to the House on the

problems  of  setting up pig farms  but  I  shall  be

brief. All the pig sties are in single-storeys and in

rows.  The  pigs have to drink water and also  to  be

watered. Therefore, several pig farmers encounter the

difficulty  of locating water through the digging  of

wells.  The costs for well-digging range from  $5,000

to  $40,000 depending on the size, capacity and depth

of the well. Sometimes, several places have to be dug

before  water  can be found. In this respect,  may  I

suggest  that the Department concerned look into  the

question  of carrying out hydrographical  surveys  of

these   farmlands  and  make  use  of  the  necessary

equipment to assist the farmers in locating water  so

as to cut down cost in well-digging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem, Sir, concerns those farmers who

have  been allowed to remain where they are. Most  of

them  are poultry farmers. I have received complaints

from  a  number  of  them stating  that  the  Primary

Production Department has asked them to indicate when

they  would convert to pig farming. (I have seen such

forms relating to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>



this).  These  farmers tell me that  they  have  been

carrying out poultry farming activity practically all

their  lives and that they do not know anything about

pig   farming.  I  believe  that  there  is  a  great

difference between pig and poultry farming. And  when

I  checked  up with the department concerned,  I  was

told  that  the  areas have been designated  for  pig

farming.  I therefore cannot understand the rationale

in allowing the retention of the poultry farms in the

first  instance.  It may well be  that  because  they

comply  with  certain requirements laid down  by  the

department  concerned  they were  allowed  to  remain

where  they  are.  I  think the department  concerned

should have considered the question of loss of income

to  these  poultry farmers in the first  place.  They

should also note the costs involved in the setting up

of pig farms, which are different from poultry farms,

whilst  not  forgetting the fact that  these  poultry

farmers may have to be retrained for pig farming.  As

such,   they  also  have  to  incur  extra  financial

resources.   In  this  light,  could  the  department

concerned   offer   them  financial   assistance?   I

sincerely hope that the Minister would enlighten  the

House on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I wish to touch on, Sir, concerns

those  farmlands which are situated on higher ground.

I am told that some farmers have rejected them on the

ground  that  there is no water in the area.  It  may

well  be  that if they should move there, they  would

have to dig deeper into the ground to reach the water

table.   In  this  case,  may  I  suggest  that   the

department  concerned should consider  allowing  such

lands to be used for poultry farming instead as  this

will  mean that there is optimal utilisation of lands

available for farming.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Primary

Production   Department   is   not   an   expert   in

hydrographical  surveys such  as  the  detection  and

digging of wells. If I remember correctly, there  are

firms  which specialise on this. In fact, some  firms

also give guarantee that if no water is detected  you

do not have to pay any money at all. I think it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>



best left to the private sector to do that type of

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Punggol area was extensively acquired by

Government  for  the sole purpose of  resettling  the

affected pig farmers from the Kranji catchment  area,

so that Punggol, being a non-catchment area, could be

made into the place for pig-rearing in Singapore. The

62  poultry  farmers were retained on  the  condition

that  they should be prepared to switch over to  pig-farming.  The criterion used was to allow any  farmer

with  more than 3,000 birds to stay. I am sympathetic

with those who have to switch from poultry farming to

pig farming as it involves some costs but the PPD has

really  no  money  to  help them  in  financing  this

transaction. But due to the representations  made  by

the Member for Punggol on the plight of these poultry

farmers, the Primary Production Department has  given

them a grace period to switch over. Instead of asking

them  to resettle elsewhere immediately, the PPD  has

indicated that farmers will be given three  years  to

switch from poultry farming to pig farming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that certain parts of Punggol are high

land where pig farming in the conventional sense  may

not  be  attractive. But we have figures to  indicate

that  even  in these high lands, where PUB  water  is

available,  and using modern commercial  methods  the

total  cost  of  water per pig after slaughtering  is

only $4. However, we are prepared to concede that  if

certain plots in these high lands are not taken up by

pig  farmers,  then  when the  time  comes,  we  will

consider converting it into poultry farming.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I thank the Senior Minister of

State for his kind remarks. I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Mr Ho Kah Leong and Mr Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(17) That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced by $10 in respect of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the provision to extend the Jurong

Fish  Market which will give the fish merchants  some

permanent  offices. In this respect I would  like  to

seek   clarification  and  enlightenment   from   the

Minister  as to whether there are plans  in  hand  to

resite the Kangkar fish market to another locality in

the  same  constituency.  In  reply  to  my  question

earlier, he has said that there are no plans.  But  I

hope   that  plans  can  be  drawn  up  now  so  that

construction  of a new market can be carried  out  as

soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

acknowledged  that  the Kangkar fish  market  handles

something   like  9,600  tons  of   fish   in   1976,

representing 15% of the fish consumed in Singapore. I

have indicated previously that the Primary Production

Department has actually drawn up a plan to expand and

develop  this  market but due to the  requirement  to

widen and lengthen Upper Serangoon Road this plan was

aborted. I assure the hon. Member that the department

has  now drawn up a new plan with the hope to  resite

this  market to another locality further up the coast

in the vicinity of Punggol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In that case I thank the Senior

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment I just wish to make a

few  observations  concerning the  creation  of  park

lands.  Under  this  subhead there  is  a  revote  of

$310,000  out  of  $460,000 to  be  allocated.  Under

subhead  EAA,  the  items  for  "West  Coast   Park",

"Extension of Labrador Park", "Sembawang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>



Park",  "Pasir  Panjang Hill  Park"  and  "Pasir  Ris Park",  are  all  under revotes. To my  mind.  Sir  - correct  me  if I am wrong - it appears that  nothing

has  been  done. May I suggest to the  Hon.  Minister

that  such projects should be farmed out so that  our

people, especially those who live in highrise  flats,

will  be  given the necessary recreational facilities

as soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Punggol  has  suggested that the authority  concerned

should  undertake  park  development  and  ensure   a

speedier  completion  of the  projects.  However,  in

order to speed up the development of such parks, the

Ministry   will   consider  asking  the   Parks   and

Recreation   Department,  which  has  the   requisite

expertise   in  the  form  of  landscape   designers.

horticulturists as well as the resources,  experience

and supporting facilities, to develop certain parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead EAA 8105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment. Sir, I am taking the

opportunity  to  inquire  from  the  Minister  as  to

whether  the  Parks and Recreation  Department  would

look  into  the  possibility of planting  shrubs  and

plants  along Balestier Road, not only to  break  the

harshness  of  the  area  but  also  to  enhance  the

pleasantness  of the surroundings. As  we  all  know,

Balestier Road is one of the main arterial  roads  in

Singapore  and situated in one of the most  important

areas   in  Singapore.  (Interruption]  Members   may

disagree.  But  if out-of-the way roads  are  planted

with trees and shrubs to enhance the pleasantness  of

the environment, I do not understand why an important

road  like  Balestier  Road  should  look  so  barren

without  any greenery to break the harshness  of  the

area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the portion of

Balestier Road from Serangoon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>



Road  junction  to  Moulmein Road  junction  is  well

planted with trees and is quite shady and green.  The

portion  from Moulmein Road junction to Thomson  Road

junction has no trees because no planting can be done

on  the  road divider which is only about 0.4  metres

wide. Furthermore, as this stretch of Balestier  Road

is  an  old  road,  there is no  provision  for  tree

planting  along the sides of the road.  However,  the

Public  Works Department will investigate to  see  if

the  centre  divider can be widened to provide  space

for tree planting without adversely affecting traffic

flow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my

amendment. I just want to say that although the reply

given  by  the Parliamentary Secretary  is  that  the

stretch of road from Moulmein Road to Serangoon  Road

is well planted with trees, that is no consolation to

me  because  that portion of the road  is  now  under

Farrer  Park constituency. But since he has given  an

assurance that the PWD will look into this matter,  I

am  satisfied.  I  am sure that if they  want  to  do

something, something  can  be  done.   Nothing   is

impossible  with  the Singapore Government  and  this

must  also apply to the PWD. I beg leave to  withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead EAA 8109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of $400,000 appropriated is for the

development  of  a seaside park in Sembawang  with  a

view  to  turning the area into a holiday resort  and

tourist  attraction. As the MP for this constituency,

I  appreciate  very  much  that  the  Government  has

attached  importance to the well-being of  the  rural

residents  in  Sembawang  by  providing  recreational

facilities. Now, I have a few questions  to  ask  the

Minister.  Firstly, when will work on  this  proposed

seaside  park  start and when will it  be  completed?

Secondly, what  recreational  facilities   will   be

provided  in  this park? Thirdly. I  suggest  that  a

jogging  track  along  the park  be  provided,  since

jogging  is  now popular with our people. Jogging  is

good for the health of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>



Fourthly,  I suggest that a fishing pond be  provided

in  the park to enable visitors to enjoy the pleasure

of fishing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A performing stage should also be provided for the

regular staging of musical and dance performances  by

the  people  of various races. Apart from plants  and

flowers, statues of personalities and animals  should

also be erected to create an aesthetic atmosphere  in

the park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as soon as the

what  kind  of  facilities  will  be  provided.   The

facilities that will be provided in the Park  include

picnic  areas,  beach  shelters, toilet  facilities,

benches,  footpaths  and car parks.  Of  course,  the

Member's  suggestion  for a  jogging  track,  fishing

pond,  and  a  stage for cultural  activities  to  be

included in the development plan will be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1004*. (*The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong

Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a remarkable improvement in our bus

service over the last few years. For one thing, rude

conductors,  smoky  buses, infrequent  services  are

things  of  the  past,  with  some  exceptions.   The

improvement  has been made possible  because  of  the

action taken by the Government Team of Officials



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>



which  has  been  seconded to the SBS.  However,  the

authorities  still  have to look after  some  of  the

minor  problems  which still exist. It  is  a  common

sight to see buses speeding, especially at night  and

also at rural areas throughout the day. Some even  go

against  the traffic lights and practically  bulldoze

their  way  through traffic. Obviously  most  of  the

drivers  hold the maxim that "might is right".  There

are  some  drivers who on the pretext  of  overtaking

other  vehicles do not care to halt at scheduled  bus

stops,  even  though  the  commuters  who  have  been

patiently waiting for that particular service, signal

the  bus  to stop. This normally happens outside  the

peak periods when there are fewer inspectors around.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has also been a remarkable improvement in

the  condition of buses. However, on rainy days  many

buses, both old and even some of the newer ones, seem

to  leak  from the top and also from the windscreens.

Thus,  seats are wet and commuters have to  stand  up

and  dodge  the  rain water that  splashes  into  the

buses.  I wonder whether the SBS carries out periodic

checks to see that the buses do not leak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the bus services from housing estates

do  not  cater  for services to places all  over  the

island.  For  instance, there is no  service  running

direct from Marine Parade to Telok Blangah via Keppel

Road.  In  fact, in Keppel, Telok Blangah  and  Pasir

Panjang Roads, there are many offices and yet no  bus

service  has  been considered. Even  before  the  bus

service  was reorganised there was a service  running

from  Cantonment Road turning to Keppel Road to Pasir

Panjang. But now there is no such service. It appears

commuters  have to change buses to go  through  these

routes. This would then cost them an extra fare.  Why

not  introduce direct services running through  these

routes, because  I have received complaints  from  a

number  of workers whose place of work is at  Keppel,

Telok  Blangah  and Pasir Panjang  Roads.  Could  the

Minister look into this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SBS also seems to have certain rules just to

suit its conductors. They refuse to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



accept  Malaysian coins. Yet they do not mind  giving

them for the return change and tell off the commuters

if they refuse to accept Malaysian coins. What is the

guideline on this matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city shuttle service is performing a very good

service  to  the public, though the reasons  for  the

introduction   of   this  service   have   completely

overlapped  their original functions. Why not  extend

the  hours  and  the terminal points of  the  shuttle

service?  This  will  in a way  improve  further  our

transport service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme B service is also providing a useful

supplementary service during the peak hours. When  it

was introduced it was praised as clean and efficient.

Yet  lately  the service seems to have  deteriorated,

like  running  the  service with  no  proper  timing,

changing directions at their discretion and buses not

as tidy as before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present there are about 7,000 taxis. Yet

this  number  seems to be insufficient  to  meet  the

needs of the public. At times, it is difficult to get

a  taxi  at many places in the city area and also  in

the outskirts of town. It is time the number of taxis

was  increased. We should also see that they are  run

efficiently so that more people will give up the idea

of  owning  cars. At present, some people  are  still

reluctant  to give up their cars simply  because  our

bus  service  has not improved sufficiently  and  the

difficulty of getting taxis for commuting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to the subject of telephones, though we

are  proud  that many new lines have been introduced,

yet  there seems to be too many complaints of getting

through   the   main   lines   of   most   Government

departments. At times, even the police 999  emergency

line  is difficult to get through. What would  happen

when  there  are  serious  crimes?  Because  of  poor

communication, they may not be solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, when we get through the line, we could

hear  the ringing but no one would answer for a  long

time. Sometimes we hear wonderful opera music on  the

phone when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>



we  are dialling. And also very often we get crossed-lines. Why is this so? The telephone exchanges of the

Government  departments must definitely  be  improved

for   the  benefit  of  the  public,  especially  the

businessmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Hon. Minister will reply to my

queries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some

years  ago  a  campaign on queuing-up for  buses  was

unsuccessfully  launched  in  Singapore.   I   wonder

whether the Ministry had analysed the failure of that

campaign  and whether or not another similar campaign

will be launched to instill in the minds of commuters

that  a sense of discipline must be developed in  bus

stops situated in heavy traffic routes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During peak hours, commuters comprising office

workers,  school children and other bus users  gather

in large numbers at bus stops. In such circumstances,

buses  packed  with  passengers are  frequently  seen

overshooting   such  bus  stops  to   allow   certain

commuters  to  disembark.  This  has  caused  waiting

commuters  to  run, rush and worst of  all,  scramble

their  way  into  these buses which have  hardly  any

standing  room left. Obviously, there is overcrowding

in  the  buses. Accidents can happen during this  mad

scramble.  I  can  imagine that these  commuters  are

losing their patience after a long wait for buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironical to see a big and bold display board

in  the  passenger  cabin of every  bus  stating  the

number of passengers it is licensed to carry (sitting

and  standing)  when practically every bus  overloads

passengers at peak hours. Perhaps, the situation  can

be  further  improved by increasing additional  buses

with similar service numbers on routes where the corn

muter  traffic  is very heavy. I wonder  whether  the

excess   passengers  over  and   above   the   figure

stipulated in the licence are covered by insurance. I

also   wonder   whether   the  drivers,   conductors,

conductresses  or for that matter the  bus  companies

have ever been prosecuted for such overloading, as it

undoubtedly flouts the law. Perhaps the Hon. Minister

can enlighten us on this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-decker buses will soon be introduced on our

congested roads. Overloading in these buses  may, be

disastrous particularly in the upper deck. I  foresee

this will happen when they are put on the roads,  for

they will become a novelty on our roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the stipulated passenger capacity for each

bus  is  strictly observed where commuters can travel

in  comfort  either standing or sitting,  buses  will

continue  to  be  over-crowded with commuters.  As  a

consequence,   accidents   will   happen   and   will

definitely raise the rate of traffic accidents on our

roads.  In fact, this morning I saw another  accident

at  Airport Road where an elderly lady was killed  on

the spot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you, Sir, for allowing me this opportunity

to speak although my name is not on the list.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to inform the hon. Member for Anson  that

action has been and will continue to be taken by  the

Traffic  Police and the Singapore Bus Service against

reckless and inconsiderate drivers. In fact, the  SBS

operates  five  radio-equipped patrol cars  for  this

purpose.  In  the  past  14  months,  it  has   taken

disciplinary action against 400 drivers for  speeding

or   for   dangerous  driving  or  for  inconsiderate

driving.  I am glad to inform the Member that  during

the  last  three months the number of such cases  has

dropped  because  of  this strict enforcement  action

taken by the SBS and the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, Sir, buses which have to stop at the

left  side of the road have to make a right turn  and

in  doing so they edge their way from the left to the

right  and  might give the impression that  they  are

bulldozing their way. Under such circumstances,  Sir,

the  drivers  and conductors have been  given  strict

instructions to give appropriate signals  to  provide

sufficient  warning to other road users.  It  is  the

intention  of  the  SBS  to continually  upgrade  the

skills of the drivers by training and retraining.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not feasible to provide direct bus services

from  the housing estates to every part of Singapore.

Resources are limited and to do so would be  a  waste

of  limited  resources. A direct service between  two

areas  can  only be justified when there  is  a  high

demand  for  such  service. In all other  cases,  bus

transfers  will  be inevitable. The Member  gave  the

example  that there is no direct bus service  between

Marine  Parade and Keppel/Telok Blangah/Pasir Panjang

Roads.  The  demand is not sufficient  to  justify  a

direct  route. But they only need to do one transfer.

Later  on if the demand should increase and there  is

justification, the  SBS  will  run  a  direct  route

between Marine Parade and the roads mentioned by  the

Member.  At the moment there are already 10  services

operating  70  buses along Keppel/Telok  Blangah  and

Pasir Panjang Roads. The SBS will continue to monitor

closely  the  demand  for such  services.  If  it  is

required, more buses will be put in service there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the rate between the Malaysian and

Singapore   currencies  fluctuates.   The   SBS   bus

conductors  have  been told not to  accept  Malaysian

currency  and  it is only fair that they  should  not

give Malaysian currency in return. The directive will

be further emphasised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present condition, the City Shuttle

Service  operates for quite an extended period,  that

is,  from 7.00 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. This covers both  the

morning  and  evening  peak  periods.  Extension   of

operational  hours will result in the need  for  more

buses,  more  workers  and  more  costs.  Since   the

commuting demand outside the CSS operational hours is

adequately met by the SBS, there is no need to extend

the CSS period of operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the extension of the routes, this

again depends on the demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned about deterioration of the

Scheme B services. The Registry of Vehicles has  been

taking enforcement action against Scheme B



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>



operators  who  have breached operational  conditions

stipulated in their licence. One of the conditions is

that  the  operator can only operate on  an  approved

route  and  he  cannot change his route  without  the

prior  approval of the authorities. Those who do  not

observe  this rule can have their licences  suspended

or  even  revoked. The ROV is also in constant  touch

with the Singapore School Bus Owners' Association and

the  Singapore  School Transport  Association,  whose

members  operate most of the Scheme B services.  From

time  to time these associations are asked to  remind

their  members  of  the rules and conditions  of  the

scheme  under  which they operate. Since  early  this

year  the  Scheme  B operators have introduced  time-keepers  at  four major terminals. This  has  brought

about some improvement in the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not have 7,000 taxis. The Member is

wrong.  There  are only 5,745 taxis. 400  taxis  have

been  added  to the fleet during the period  November

1976  to March 1977. We expect to add another 1,800

taxis to the fleet. To increase the efficiency of the

taxi  fleet, taxi operators are encouraged to operate

radiophone   taxis  and  set  up  taxi  kiosks   with

telephones.   When  radio  taxis  become   universal,

probably the service will improve greatly.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> What about buses leaking?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> There may be a few buses with

leaking roofs.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> They do not close the windows.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> So it is not due to defective buses.

Probably   it   is  the  fault  of  the   conductors.

Instructions  will  be given and probably  passengers

could  help by closing windows of the buses  whenever

it rains. They can and should help.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> The seats are already wet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> If there are no passengers, the bus

conductors will be asked to close the windows.  These

cases are few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>



and  far  between because the conductor himself  does

not  like  to get wet. But if his complaint is  about

leaks  from  the  roof, then my explanation  is  that

probably these cases are getting less and less.  From

the  figures given to me, in spite of an increase  of

400 buses to the fleet, the number of buses that have

been  laid  up has dropped from 750 to 110  per  day.

There has been an improvement in the servicing of the

buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards music through the telephone, this is due

to  interception of broadcasting wavelength, but more

often  than  not  it  is  due  to  the  proximity  of

Rediffusion wires. If the Member should pick  up  the

phone and hear music the next time, the TAS will make

the  necessary  adjustment if he will only  telephone

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to difficulties in getting through to

some  Government departments, perhaps everybody wants

to  get  through to the same department at  the  same

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adequacy or inadequacy of telephone lines for

any organisation, be it a Government department or  a

business concern, is something over which the TAS has

no control. The TAS can however advise the department

or  organisation concerned as to what should  be  the

appropriate number of lines, taking into account  the

usage,  but  the  decision whether  to  increase  the

number of lines or not lies upon the Minister or  the

Head of Department or the organisation concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.

Regarding the bus service, I had mentioned last  year

at  the  Budget debates that they must take down  the

statistics of passengers travelling from one place to

another.  If they had done that, they would now  know

whether or not the particular direct service  has  to

be  put on. And if they increase the number of  buses

there, it will be much easier for the passengers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir,I am greatly enlightened. We

take statistics. But if he wants to know what it  is,

let him write to me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



and find out. I will answer his questions with regard

to statistics or anything on the buses.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> To come to the Member for Changi, I

do not know whether he is aware that the Minister for

Home Affairs has already indicated that there will be

a  nation-wide campaign on road safety  in  order  to

instil  into the commuters and motorists a  sense  of

discipline for the good of all concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think either the SBS, the drivers or the

conductors would like to have an overloaded  bus,  if

they can help it. It is all very well to say that  we

have  certain limitations and that we must not  allow

more  passengers on the bus and that  the  bus  would

move off when there are enough passengers. But it  is

not  as  easy as that. I do not think it is practical

during the rush hours when every one, as he says,  is

rushing  helter skelter trying to get into an already

overloaded bus. To push them out would have caused  a

riot.  Probably  his  experience with  travelling  in

aeroplanes gives him a bias over the way in which the

running  of  the bus can be controlled. I would  like

him to get down to a bus stop during a rush hour, and

obviously  he must have done so, otherwise  he  would

not have been able to give such a good description of

the  scene  during the rush hours.  I  think  if  the

conductor or the driver were to start pushing  people

off the bus, there will be a riot and there will be a

terrific jam. Much as we like to, there has got to be

some  laxity.  The answer here would be  probably  to

supply  more buses. This we are doing. We are  adding

more  buses to the fleet. This is one of the ways  by

which   we  can  alleviate  overcrowding  in   buses.

Probably  the way to solve this problem would  be  to

increase  the number of buses and provide buses  with

larger capacity. We are doing that. As he said, there

will  be  double-deckers. We hope to deploy these  on

the  different  routes  so  that  congestion  can  be

gradually relieved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir,I would urge the Minister

to  take remedial action when the seats of buses  get

wet.  Every conductor must have a towel to  wipe  the

wet seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructions must be given to the bus drivers not to

over-take  another bus. They must confine  themselves

to the bus lanes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I do not know whether the Member for

Anson  has  ever  been  along  Shenton  Way  and  the

Esplanade when we first introduced bus lanes.  If  he

had  he  would  have  seen the long  queue  of  buses

stretching from Collyer Quay right down.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> This is probably because one bus

breaks down in a bus lane and all the other buses get

stuck.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> There is no bus breakdown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Somehow the bus is stopped.

Therefore,  bus  drivers have the right  to  use  the

other  traffic lanes, like other motorists.  The  bus

lanes  are reserved for buses in order that they  may

move  faster, but they also have the right, as  other

road users, to use other traffic lanes.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Can they use the they can use

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the efforts of the Government, the trade unions

and   the  bus  company,  the  common  objective   of

tripartitism has step by step been realised.  In  the

past  two years, our bus transport system has greatly

improved,  as  a  result  of  the  efforts   of   the

Government in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government side, there are a few ministries

and  agencies which are in close touch with  the  bus

transport   system,   that  is,   the   Ministry   of

Communications,  PWD, Housing and  Development  Board

and  the Ministry of the Environment. But because  of

red-tape  and  the  complicated  procedure  of  these

ministries or agencies plans or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>



measures on how to improve public transport were very

often delayed or could not be implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me touch on a few measures for the

improvement of bus services which have been  shelved,

delayed  or not yet been solved. Firstly, bus depots.

Because of the great number of buses, the bus company

should have some well-equipped bus depots in order to

repair at all times the buses that have broken  down.

However, this question of bus depots has' yet  to  be

solved.  Only the Braddell Road Main Depot has  shown

some progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, sanitary facilities at bus terminals. The

Government,  trade  unions and the  bus  company  all

fully  understand that there is an  urgent  need  for

good  sanitary facilities at bus terminals.  The  bus

company   has  therefore  applied  to  the  authority

concerned.  However, because  of  red-tape  and  the

complicated procedure of these ministries or agencies

there  has  been no reply although applications  were

sent in to the authorities concerned years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, bus lanes. During the peak hours many bus

lanes are obstructed by some buses which have no time

schedule  to  keep and that causes other buses  which

have  a time schedule to keep to move out of the  bus

lane,   otherwise  it  would  disrupt  all  the   bus

schedules badly. Yet, buses leaving the bus  lane  is

illegal  and  it  is also extremely  unsafe  for  the

commuters.  It  also directly affects the  safety  of

other  road  users.  Although  the  trade  union  has

complained to the authorities which then became  busy

for  a while, but there was no result and it was  the

end of the matter,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, bus bays. On the dividers in front of the

bus   bays  usually  some  plants  are  planted   for

decoration  and the branches of these often  obstruct

the  view  of the bus drivers. Moreover,  because  of

their length, when the buses move into or out of  the

bus bay, the buses inevitably run into some branches.

thus causing unnecessary danger to commuters and also

causing unnecessary wear and tear of the buses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, bus stops. Some bus stops are sited very

close to traffic lights. At present some buses do not

have  automatic  doors  and this  is  very  dangerous

because  some commuters would try to get up  or  down

the  bus  before the traffic lights. This  can  cause

unnecessary accidents. Therefore, I hope the Minister

concerned will try his best to cut down on  red  tape

and  simplify the procedures and would take  note  of

the above points in order to ensure that any plans or

measures  for  the  improvement of  public  transport

would not be hindered or delayed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Sir, the hon. Member for Paya Lebar

raised a number of points. The first one is about bus

depots and workshops. It is not true that no progress

has  been  made.  In  fact, the construction  of  the

Braddell Road Depot and Central Workshop has  already

commenced  and  is  expected to be completed  by  the

middle  or  before the middle of next year.  Besides,

the  new bus depot at Jurong which will be commencing

work  very soon is expected to be completed  sometime

next  year  too. As to the other depots and workshops

in  the other areas, various stages of progress  have

been made and they will be completed over a period of

time, within the next two to three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding toilet and canteen facilities in the

depots  and terminals. I wish to inform him that  all

the  existing  depots are presently already  provided

with  toilets  and  canteen facilities.  Of  the  bus

terminals, most of them, 56 out of 66 terminals,  are

provided with toilet facilities and canteens. Only 10

terminals are without these facilities, and eight  of

them  are  in the Jurong area but they will  soon  be

relocated to a proper terminal in Jurong when the new

terminal is completed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two bus terminals without toilet

facilities  and they will not be able to have  toilet

facilities  because of shortage of space  on  a  very

restricted land. This is the one at Yio Chu Kang Road

near the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>



Sembawang  Circus and the other one is at the  Mandai

area. In 1974 and 1975, SBS has spent $125,000 on the

building   of  toilets  at  the  various   terminals.

Terminals  with proper toilet and canteen  facilities

and  other  amenities  for the  bus  crew  are  being

developed  at Paya Lebar Airport and Boon Lay  Garden

at  a cost of $130,000 and $185,000 respectively.  So

it  is  not  true to say that nothing is being  done.

But,  of  course, all this takes time and all efforts

are   being  made  to  improve  the  facilities   and

amenities for the bus crew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about bus stops near traffic lights.

Sir,  bus stops are normally sited away from  traffic

lights. However, there are instances when the  siting

of  a  bus  stop near a traffic light is unavoidable,

especially   when  the  junctions   are   too   close

especially  in  the  City  area.  I  wish  to  assure

Members, however, that where a bus stop needs  to  be

sited  near  a  traffic  light,  whether  at  a  road

junction  or a pedestrian crossing, the PWD  and  the

ROV  would ensure that pedestrians and motorists  are

not being endangered.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has referred to tree planting near bus bays.

Trees   are   planted  to  provide  shade   for   the

pedestrians  and commuters waiting at bus  stops.  In

the  planting of trees in the vicinity of bus  stops,

care  is  usually  taken to  see  that  they  do  not

obstruct  visibility or constitute a potential  cause

for  accidents if the plants grow and reach  a  stage

where  they are likely to obstruct the view.  We  are

aware of that and the Parks and Recreation Department

do  go  around and trim these trees when they  become

obstructive. However, if the Member does come  across

any  bus bay obstructed by plants. I suggest that  he

writes   immediately  to  the  Parks  and  Recreation

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about bus lanes being obstructed by

school  buses, resulting in the buses having to  move

out of the bus lanes and saying that this is illegal.

As  my Minister has pointed out earlier, this is  not

so.  The  bus  lanes are meant to accord priority  to

high capacity public transport vehicles. During the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>



operative  hours  bus lanes are  reserved  for  buses

only.  But  this  does not mean that buses  can  only

travel in bus lanes. The buses continue to have equal

right  as  other  vehicles to use the  other  traffic

lanes.  This  is  in line with our policy  of  giving

priority  to high capacity public transport  wherever

the  road  space  is  limited,  particularly  in  the

Central area. Since the objective is to give priority

to  high  capacity  public  transport  vehicles, the

Scheme B school buses will continue to be allowed  to

use  these  bus  lanes. The ROV, however,  has  taken

action   against   school  buses  for   unnecessarily

obstructing  the  bus lanes as it would  against  any

other  vehicles.  For the last two  months  alone,  a

total  of 24 school bus drivers have been booked  for

this  offence.  Obstructions caused by  school  buses

have  already been reduced significantly. I  think  I

have replied to all his points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Senior

Minister  of  State has said that up to  the  present

time  there  are  10  bus  terminals  which  have  no

sanitary  facilities.  Will  the  Minister  concerned

provide   temporary  sanitary  facilities  at   these

places?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, this request has, in fact,

been  looked  into sometime ago. As I have  mentioned

earlier, at some of the depots, there is just  simply

no space for these facilities to be provided. The bus

crew  will have to go to the other terminals if  they

want   to   use  the  facilities.  This   is   rather

unfortunate.  Fortunately, the  number  of  terminals

without  facilities is small. As I have  said,  there

are  only 10 of them. Eight of them will be relocated

soon  to  proper terminals with facilities. Regarding

the  other two terminals without facilities, the  SBS

has  been  asked to look into this question seriously

and hopefully proper solutions will emerge soon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we

know   that  the  bus  routes  are  now  quite  long.

Travelling from one terminal to the other  will  take

about two hours. It is quite difficult for anyone  to

control for two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>



hours without answering the call of nature. I do hope

that  the  Minister for Communications will  consider

this  point. I hope the Minister of State will answer

this question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said,

the matter is being looked into.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am very sorry that

he has not given me a favourable answer. I would like

to  know  when  it can be done. This is  not  a  very

difficult question to answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, if there is no space at the

terminal,  how  can  one  provide  even  a  temporary

toilet?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,I do not think

we require a very big space. It can be just a latrine

like those provided at wayang sites.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the matter is being looked

into and I hope there will be a solution soon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr

Ahmad Haleem).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the departure lounge at the Paya

Lebar Airport is still unsatisfactory. There are  not

enough seats for people waiting to board their plane,

and  at  times they may have to wait for hours before

the plane actually departs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shops which have been put up sometime ago around

the  building  seem  to occupy  too  much  space  and

contribute to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>



congestion  felt  during the peak periods.  Sometimes

the  place seems to be like a fish market. The Member

for  Changi,  who is attached to the  Airport,  would

bear  me  out.  No  doubt over  the  years, we  have

improved  and expanded our international  airport  to

that  comparable to many western countries, but  then

further improvements can still be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to our Development Expenditure there

is  a revote of $8,300,000 for the construction of  a

new arrival block for Paya Lebar Airport. Why is this

huge  sum being allocated for this project when in  a

couple of years the new Changi Airport will be  ready

for use?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, taxi service at the Paya Lebar Airport seems to

be  a  perpetual problem. It is hopelessly inadequate

and there have been too many complaints from tourists

and  our local passengers about this. Even the recent

introduction of the mini-bus service where a commuter

is  charged  a  flat rate of $5 has  not  solved  the

problem.  Probably more mini-buses  are  required  to

solve this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  two very minor questions. When the new  arrival

hall is being built, will adequate car parks also  be

built  to  accommodate the extra number of  cars?  At

present  during peak hours on any day,  all  the  car

parks, even  those in the cargo complex,  are  fully

taken  up.  It  is almost impossible to find  parking

space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I want to ask is this. After 1982

when   Changi   Airport  undertakes   the   role   of

unscheduled  flights  and  cargo  flights,  will  the

present services provided by Seletar Airport also  be

transferred  to Changi Airport? If so, what  will  be

the future role of Seletar Airport?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Anson  has complained about the inadequate number  of

seats  in  the  departure lounge at  the  Paya  Lebar

Airport. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



wonder  whether he knows how many seats there are  in

the departure lounge at the Paya Lebar Airport. There

are  actually more than 1,400 seats now at  the  Paya

Lebar Airport departure transit lounge.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> It is congested.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> It is true that there are times

when  there are insufficient number of seats for  the

passengers  and  the well-wishers, especially  during

the  peak  hours. However, these waiting periods  are

normally of very short duration. There is only a high

turn-over of passengers and their well-wishers during

the  peak  periods. With the reopening of the  waving

gallery  in  September last year  the  situation  has

improved,  since many of the well-wishers  leave  the

departure lounge to go upstairs to the waving gallery

to view the planes landing and taking off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Airport shops provide essential services for the

convenience of air travellers. Banking, post  office.

insurance   and   money   changing   activities   and

operations  as  well as other Airport  shops  are  an

integral part of passenger terminals and are provided

at  all  the  international airports  throughout  the

world.  Our shops occupy only a small portion of  the

total  space in the departure lounge and they are  so

located  to  avoid  hindering  the  smooth  flow   of

passengers.  We do realise that there  is  inadequate

space  in  the present departure lounge at  the  Paya

Lebar Airport during the evening peak hours. However,

to  provide more seats for the passengers  and  well-wishers  would  cause  more  serious  congestion   as

circulation space would be reduced. That  is  why  we

are  now building a new arrival terminal, after which

we  will convert the existing passenger terminal into

a  departure  terminal. This is so  even  as  we  are

constructing the new Airport at Changi, which will be

ready  only  in  the middle of 1980, or  maybe  early

1981.  In  the meantime we must continue  to  provide

more  space  and  facilities to cope with  the  ever-increasing traffic. The new arrival building  at  the

Paya Lebar Airport will be ready by the end of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>



year.  When  the renovation of the existing  terminal

into  a  departure building is completed in mid-1978.

more  seats will be provided for passengers  and  the

well-wishers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also referred to the taxi situation at

the  Paya  Lebar Airport. The taxi situation  at  the

Paya Lebar Airport has improved considerably over the

last  few months. The current airport fleet  of  over

500  is  double that of May last year, that is,  nine

months  ago. Periodic surveys on the waiting time  of

passengers  for  taxis  by the  Department  of  Civil

Aviation have revealed a remarkable reduction in  the

waiting  time.  Generally, only 7% of the  passengers

need  to wait more than 15 minutes during the evening

peak hours, while during the non-peak hours there  is

no  taxi  waiting problem at all. There  are  special

airconditioned bus services from the airport  to  the

major hotels - these are airconditioned coaches -  at

$3  per  passenger.  In addition, the  Department  of

Civil Aviation has also introduced a mini-bus service

to hotels, leaving the airport at 15-minute intervals

during the evening peak hours and charging $2.50  and

not  $5 per passenger. These bus services have  taken

about  10%  off  the taxi passenger  load  and  have,

therefore, contributed to the reduction in  the  taxi

waiting time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the two points raised by the Member for

Telok  Blangah. The first question is about  the  car

parks  at  the  Paya Lebar Airport and whether  there

will  be  additional  car parks in  the  new  arrival

building.  The  answer is yes. For  the  new  arrival

building at the Paya Lebar Airport, an additional 303

private  parking lots. 102 permanent taxi stands  and

20 coach stands have been constructed. Although these

additional parking lots are to serve the new  arrival

building  which  is  expected  to  be  completed   by

November   or  December  this  year, the   PWD   has

constructed  the parking lots ahead  of  time.  These

additional parking lots have, in fact, been completed

and  are  open  to the public. With these  additional

parking  lots. Sir, the parking situation during  the

peak periods at Paya Lebar Airport has improved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Seletar Airport, Sir, the type of

traffic   which  uses  Seletar  Airport   are   light

aircraft,  helicopters and small jets.  The  type  of

aircraft that will be diverted to Paya Lebar  Airport

in  the later years when the Changi Airport is  ready

will  be  the larger aircraft. Therefore, Paya  Lebar

and Seletar Airports will serve different markets. It

is  unlikely  that  the general aviation  traffic  at

Seletar will be affected when Paya Lebar is used  for

charter and cargo flights.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

be  given permission to seek some clarification  from

the Senior Minister of State?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On what point, Mr Tan?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> On the seating capacity at the

Airport.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I thought the Minister has already

replied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, earlier on, in reply to the

Member  for Anson, he mentioned that he was going  to

give   figures  of  the  seating  capacity  for   the

departure  lounge.  When, quoting  the  figures, he

mentioned  more  than  1,000  seats  as  the  seating

capacity in the transit lounge. What I want  to  know

is  whether  this figure is for the whole airport  or

just  for  the transit lounge, because if  I  am  not

wrong,  the  Member for Anson is more concerned  with

the seating capacity for people who go to the airport

to await arrivals and departures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir,I have the figures here.

The  actual  figure  is  1,420 seats  for  passengers

coming  to the airport to depart. There are 80  seats

in  the  ticketting  wing;  320  seats  in  the  main

concourse  ground  floor and 270 seats  in  the  main

concourse  on the mezzanine floor; 450 seats  in  the

departure  hall itself; and 300 seats in the  transit

lounge. So they total 1,420 seats.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation

of  the  Senior  Minister of State. I  beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead DAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the moment, the meteorological service

provided  through our papers is inadequate and  I  am

aware of the joke that whatever is the forecast,  you

just think of the opposite and that is the truth. But

I  think our meteorological service in Singapore  can

provide  us  with  a  more reliable  forecast.  I  am

thinking  more in terms of a longer one-week forecast

of  possible weather fronts coming to Singapore. This

will  help our people to plan their activities during

the  weekend. Perhaps if inclement or hot weather  is

expected  during the weekend, they can plan ahead  of

time  and this will also be of service to our service

industries   like   the  lighterage   business,   the

transport  business  and  the  stevedoring  business.

Knowing  what kind of weather is coming up, they  can

plan for the situation and perhaps save some money in

the process and help to increase our productivity. So

I would like to ask the Minister if it is possible to

arrange  perhaps  through the  Culture  Ministry  the

release  of  a more detailed meteorological  forecast

for  publication in our papers and also  through  the RTS.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much as we

would  like to, it is extremely difficult to  provide

weather  forecast for a small and compact  area  like

Singapore with the required degree of accuracy to  be

useful to the public. Singapore's weather to a  large

extent  is  local in character and of short duration.

It  is  not  uncommon  to find parts  of  the  island

experiencing rain and showers while the rest  of  the

areas   are  dry.  Unlike  the  temperate  latitudes,

atmospheric  processes in the  tropical  regions  are

complex and not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>



clearly   defined,   making  long-range   forecasting

difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Meteorological Services Department is

making   every  effort  to  improve  its  forecasting

capability  through the upgrading of  equipment  used

and increasing its sources of weather data. This will

enable it to provide a higher standard of service not

only  to  members of the public but  also  to  ships,

aircraft and other specialised users. Therefore,  for

the time being, the suggestion made by the Member for

Telok Blangah is not practical.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, in view of the answer from the

Senior Minister of State. I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead EAA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P.

Govindaswamy).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this amendment. I would like to raise

three questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) According to the complaints I have received from

members  of  the public, the present postal  services

are  not as good as before. In the past, if a  letter

is  posted in the morning the addressee might be able

to  receive  it in the evening or at the  latest  the

following day. But in recent years, the situation  is

entirely different. Sometimes for ordinary local mail

the  addressee can receive it only after some two  or

three  days  after  posting. This  delay  will  cause

unnecessary  inconvenience to members of the  public.

particularly in the case of Government correspondence

such  as property tax bills. PUB bills, radio and  TV

licence renewal notices and certain urgent letters or

notices.  If delivery is delayed or missed, then  the

addressees can be inconvenienced by having to  pay  a

fine  or  put  in  a difficult position  for  delayed

payments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In Marsiling, in Sembawang Constituency, there

is  a  new  HDB housing estate with a temporary  post

office  in a HDB block for the needs of the residents

there.  There are altogether 37 blocks of  HDB  flats

comprising 5,604 units of flats with a population  of

30,000 people. So there is a lot of mail to be  dealt

with. I understand that there is a staff of only four

members in the post office, including the postmaster,

and  seven  postmen.  This number  of  staff  is  not

sufficient  to deal with the large parcels  of  mail.

Moreover,  there  are  19 blocks  of  factories  with

thousands of workers in Marsiling area.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of them have Post Office Savings Bank accounts

there.  Very  often on pay days they crowd  into  the

post  office and pack up all the space, and the small

number of staff would be kept very busy. According to

my  understanding, the small post office  there  will

soon  be  receiving payments for PUB  bills  for  the

benefit of the people there. Of course, this will  be

convenient to the residents there. But to tackle this

job  there  is  a  need for more staff  at  the  post

office.  So  I  would  like to ask  the  Minister  to

consider  increasing the number  of  staff  there.  I

would like to stress here that the working efficiency

of the staff at this post office is good. But in view

of  the  small  number of staff, it is  difficult  to

tackle the big amount of work to be dealt with. So it

is necessary to increase the number of staff there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) At the moment, this post office is a temporary

one.  I would like to ask the Minister whether  there

is  any plan to set up a permanent post office  on  a

larger  scale, because more and more people  will  be

living  in this new housing estate. There is  a  need

for a bigger post office to serve the people better.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, every

now  and  then we find new issues of stamps depicting

fishes,  birds, flowers, etc. I wonder why there  has

never been a stamp issue to commemorate our late



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>



First President of Singapore. Tun Yusof bin Ishak. In

many  countries  we  find  the  President's  portrait

appearing in stamps, money, etc. Here, we have missed

a  key  person who had been a historic figure in  the

struggle  for  self-government and independence,  and

yet nothing has been done in remembrance of the First

President of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the selection body which decides on the motif

of stamps to be issued would not overlook key figures

of  our Republic or even some of the historical sites

when new stamps are being considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea of opening new post offices at Housing

Board  estates  and  at  other locations  are  indeed

welcomed  by the public for convenience.  However.  I

wonder  whether due consideration has been  given  to

see that ample space is made available for the postal

staff to perform their duties comfortably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that in certain post offices, the space at

the  sorting  section  of mails  and  parcels  is  so

limited   that   the  postmen  find   difficulty   in

performing   their   duties  in   the   uncomfortable

atmosphere. Furthermore, there are no rest rooms  for

the  staff. Sometimes there is only one toilet.  When

the  postwomen  are  inside the toilet,  the  postmen

outside will say, "Siapa goreng ikan?" (Who's  frying

fish?)  We  can  see  this at the  newly-opened  post

office  at the Tanjong Pagar Plaza. It has  not  been

officially opened yet.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the Postal Department has

actually  set  up an internal monitoring  system  for

monitoring its mail delivery service performance, and

it   has  been  found  that  letters  posted  locally

normally  take  about one day to reach addressees  in

Singapore after the date of posting. Delay of one day

affecting  some  mails due to bad  weather  has  been

recorded  in the past, especially in the  more  rural

areas where the coverage is wide. But mail deliveries

to  the Sembawang Constituency has been found  to  be

quite  in order. Mail deliveries are undertaken there

by  nine postmen, and not seven postmen. All of  them

perform their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



delivery   beats  on  motor  scooters  for   speedier

delivery and more productive operations. The  present

staffing  is  adequate  for  maintaining  the  normal

standard  of service for the time being.  Should  the

need arise later on, that will be looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the plan to set up a bigger post office in

Woodlands  New Town, the answer is, yes, there  is  a

plan to set up a bigger post office in Woodlands  New

Town.  This  new  post  office  is  expected  to   be

completed  early next year. In fact, there  are  also

plans  to establish four more post offices eventually

in the entire Woodlands New Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also mentioned about the

Marsiling Post Office being a temporary post  office.

The  Marsiling  Post Office is not a  temporary  post

office.  The  Marsiling Post Office will continue  to

operate  even  after  the Woodlands  Post  Office  is

established in early 1978. The present Marsiling Post

Office  is  staffed  by a total of  11  members.  The

existing  staff strength is found to be  adequate  to

meet  the  present needs to serve the people  in  the

area.  The  staffing needs at all  post  offices  are

constantly under review by the Postal Department  and

increases will be made as and when necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Anson, it is

the responsibility of the Stamp Advisory Committee to

consider, select and recommend themes for the stamps.

As  a  matter  of general policy, the  Committee  has

refrained   from   considering   themes   to   depict

personalities.  This  same  policy  also  extends  to

Singapore  currency notes and coins as  well  as  new

street names and other public projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about the inadequate working space for

the  staff in the post office. Normally each  postman

involved in the sorting of mails is provided  with  a

working space of four to five square metres. (This is

roughly 40 to 50 sq, ft. We have now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



metricated.) This is considered to be sufficient.  It

is  within the current standards for working space of

3 1/2  to  5  square metres per head laid  down  by  the

Government Building Committee for Division IV  staff,

to  which  the grade of postman belong.  The  working

space  at Tanjong Pagar Plaza Post Office is about  4

square   metres   per  postman.  This   is   actually

considered to be adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he said is true - there is no rest room in

Tanjong  Pagar  Plaza Post Office,  because  for  one

reason  there is a shortage of space. Besides,  there

are  nearby  coffee  shops  and  canteens  where  the

postmen can go to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About toilets, I do not know whether the example

which  he  has quoted is in Tanjong Pagar Plaza  Post

Office or somewhere else. Perhaps if he would let  me

know I would look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am

satisfied  with the reply given, and I beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead FAA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Dr Ow Chin Hock, Messrs Teong Eng Siong, P. Govindaswamy, Ho Kah Leong and Dr Ong Leong Boon).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am moving this amendment because of the wrong

attitude adopted by the Registry of Vehicles  towards

taxis.  This wrong attitude has often given  rise  to

doubts  as  to  whether the ROV also takes  taxis  as

public service vehicles. As we all know and agree, in

this  developed society of Singapore taxis constitute

a very important link in the public transport system,

particularly at the present juncture when as a result

of Government restrictions the number of private cars

is  decreasing.  This gives rise to  a  corresponding

increase  in  the demand for taxis.  In  the  Central

Business  District, because car owners do  not  drive

their cars into the CBD there is an even greater need

for  them to use taxis for transport. In view of  all

this  and  the  importance given to public  transport

vehicles



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



by  the  ROV  I  would  expect  them  to  give  every

encouragement  to taxi operations, but  instead  the

attitude adopted is just the reverse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of taxes, one has to pay the same amount of

additional  registration fee for  a  taxi  as  for  a

private car. The original 25% ARF levied in 1972  has

been   increased   to   100%  today.   To   give   an

illustration:  if the original price  of  a  taxi  is

$10,000, then the taxi driver will now have  to  pay

another  $10,000  by  way of additional  registration

fee. If this vehicle is not locally assembled but .an

imported vehicle, the taxi driver will have to pay  a

further  45% in import duty. From this, you  can  see

that  a  car which orginally costs only $10,000  will

now  cost about $24,500 because of the imposition  of

additional registration fee and the import duty.  But

buses   are   not   affected   by   this   additional

registration fee because the Government regards buses

as  public transport vehicles. Does not this attitude

then  show that the Government does not regard  taxis

as public transport vehicles?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as entering the CBD is concerned, the ROV

is  also imposing on taxis the same rate of the  area

licensing  fee as for private cars, i.e, at  $4  per

entry. In the case of buses, they are not subject  to

this  imposition  on the ground that  the  Government

regards buses as public transport vehicles. But taxis

are  not  regarded  by  the same  measure  as  public

transport  vehicles. I would like to point  out  here

that   because  taxis  are  subject   to   the   same

restrictions  as for private cars entering  the  CBD.

taxi  drivers  try to avoid entering the  CBD  during

peak  hours  in  order to avoid paying  the  $4  area

licensing  fee.  As  a result, many  members  of  the

public    are   experiencing   a   great   deal    of

inconvenience. The ROV has naively suggested that  to

avoid  paying  the $4 area licensing fee,  taxis  can

also  resort to car-pooling. They could wait to  pick

three  passengers before entering  the  CBD.  Such  a

proposition from the ROV seems to fail to  take  into

account the reason why members of the public make use

of  taxis.  Members of the public use taxis  and  not

buses  simply  because they find the  taxi  to  be  a

faster and more convenient means of transport. If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



passenger  in a taxi has to wait for other passengers

to make up a car-pool what is the point of boarding a

taxi  and who wants to ride in a taxi? This  kind  of

proposition by the ROV is easier said than  done.  To

implement it will get just the reverse result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude of the ROV not to regard taxis as

public transport vehicles has been mentioned by me in

this  House, but  the authority  concerned  has  not

answered my point directly. In actual fact this  kind

of attitude is now adversely affecting members of the

public  and  the  taxi drivers. It also  affects  our

public  transport  services. The authority  concerned

should  not  bury its head and remain indifferent  to

this matter. I am awaiting for a concrete answer from

the relevant authority.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Lang Kee):</b> Sir, road transport

problems  are  part and parcel of the urban  problems

confronting most major cities in the world and, as an

urban   centre.  Singapore  could  not  avoid   these

problems.  Moreover, since Singapore is also  a  city

state,  road  transport problems have  received  much

attention  and ranked high in the priority  scale  of

national policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two or three years, the Government has

introduced  a number of policy measures to  curb  the

increase  in car population and to alleviate  traffic

congestion,  particularly  in  the  Central  Business

District. These measures range from increases in road

tax,   introduction  of  Area  Licensing  Scheme   to

imposition  of additional registration  fee.  Sir,  I

believe  many  people  understand  and  support   the

Government's good intention to reduce the  number  of

vehicles  on the roads. Given the constraint  of  our

land area, restriction on the increase of vehicles on

the   roads  is  absolutely  necessary.  Furthermore,

traffic  congestion  is counter-productive;  this  is

manifested   in   the  unnecessary   lengthening   of

travelling time to and from work, fuel wastage and so

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, a given objective normally could be

achieved  by  alternative  means.  In  selecting  the

measures,   their  effectiveness  in  achieving   the

objective and their by-effects must be evaluated  and

examined. In this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>



context,  I would like to make some observations  and

comments  on  the two policy measures implemented  by

the Registry of Vehicles. The first is the additional

registration  fee  and its related measures  such  as

preferential ARF and surcharge on old cars. According

to  the  Motor Vehicles (Registration and  Licensing)

(Amendment)  Rules,  1976,  Part  II  of  the   First

Schedule,  a  fee equal to 100% of the value  of  the

vehicle  will  be imposed on vehicles under  category

(b)  which  includes private motor  cars,  taxis  and

business  service  passenger vehicles.  At  the  same

time,  preferential rates (ranging from  35%  to  55%

depending  on  the cylinder capacity of the  vehicle)

are  granted on application by the car-owner provided

that  his old vehicle could satisfy certain specified

conditions. One of these conditions is that  the  old

vehicle  should  not be more than 10  years  old  or.

where the vehicle is a taxi, it be not more than five

years  old. For vehicles which are more than 10 years

old, a surcharge on an increasing scale according  to

the age of the vehicle will be imposed.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the full ARF, by increasing the purchase price

of  a vehicle and its annual depreciation expense, is

effective in discouraging car ownership. However,  it

is  both  inflationary and discriminating. It  raises

the cost of living and imposes hardship on people who

have to use vehicles to make a living. Naturally, car

owners would try to qualify for the preferential ARF.

The  conditions laid down for the PARF, together with

the   surcharge  on  old  cars,  however,   are   not

consistent  with the objective, i.e, restricting  the

increase  in  car  population  and  alleviating   the

traffic  congestion. Rather, these measures  seem  to

aim   at   reducing  the  average  age  of  our   car

population.  Moreover, Sir, these measures  encourage

wasteful consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One virtue of the Oriental societies is

"thriftiness."  It  is  well known  that  many  older

people   are  even  reluctant  to  throw  away   used

clothing, bottles or cans. Our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>



Government also encourages people to save voluntarily

with  the  Post  Office Savings  Bank  and  increases

forced savings by raising the CPF contribution rates.

Yet,  Sir, when it comes to the motor vehicle,  which

is   the  second  most  important  investment  of   a

household,  next  only  to the  house  or  flat,  the

Government  has taken a contradictory philosophy.  It

encourages  people to abandon their  cars  within  10

years  even  though  they  might  still  be  in  good

condition. Another consequence is that car owners may

choose  to  intensify  the usage  of  their  vehicles

without  proper maintenance within the  limited  life

span.  By  so  doing,  they  increase  the  risk   to

themselves  and  to  other  road  users  when   their

vehicles are on the roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing the objectives in mind, the following

modifications seem to be better:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the full ARF should be imposed on second and

subsequent  vehicles of a family  or  a  company  not

engaged in public transport activities;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) all first registered vehicles would be given a

preferential  ARF, based on their cylinder  capacity,

but lifting the condition concerning the old car;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) all cars which are more than 10 years old should

be  subjected to an annual roadworthiness test by the

Registry of Vehicles. The surcharge should be imposed

only if the cars fail the test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to another problem and I am glad to

note  that  the  Member for Aljunied  has  made  some

remarks  on this problem. I just want to add some  of

my personal observations. Sir, I submit that the Area

Licensing  Scheme has resulted in an excess  capacity

of  the  present taxi fleet, in the sense  that  many

taxis  remain idle during the peak hours. The  extent

of  excess  capacity could, in fact, be estimated  by

the  difference between the number of taxis  entering

into  the Central Business District before and  after

the  introduction of the ALS. The excess capacity  of

taxis would be further aggravated with an increase in

the number of taxis as time goes by. To eliminate the

existing excess capacity, I humbly suggest that taxis

should not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>



treated in the same manner as private passenger cars.

In  fact, the Road Action Committee has first treated

taxis  as  public transport vehicles.  Its  document,

entitled  A Plan For the Relief of Traffic Congestion

in the City (Page 7) stated that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The following categories of vehicles will be

specifically exempted and be allowed free access into

the restricted zone at all times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Public transport vehicles including regular

scheduled  buses, school buses, private  buses  with

seating capacity of 7 or more persons and taxis:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Emergency vehicles, e.g, ambulances, fire

engines, police and military vehicles."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while some may argue that taxis do not have the

same  passenger capacity as buses, we must also  bear

in  mind  that  at present taxis still represent  the

most  efficient and convenient alternative  means  of

transport  for  those who opt not to drive  into  the

city. While taxis may not be given full exemption  as

with  buses, they should be given some concessionary

rates  in view of the present role they play  in  our

transport   system.  Also,  some  taxi-drivers   have

complained that they are not allowed to park at  taxi

stops  to  wait for passengers. Sir, I hope that  the

Registry  of  Vehicles could relax  this  restriction

during the peak hours, thereby enabling taxis to wait

at  taxi stops within the CBD. This will also help to

eliminate the excess capacity mentioned above.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, after several

reorganisations  the bus services in  Singapore  have

made  some improvement but this improvement is  still

far from ideal, I think it will take some time before

it  can reach a higher degree of satisfaction because

I  can still find certain defects and shortcomings in

the  bus  service. I wish to bring a few examples  to

the attention of the Minister of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, many Members of the public complain that

some buses do not keep to the schedule regularly. For

example,  the  bus  service from Victoria  Street  to

Sembawang, the people have to wait as long as half an

hour and at times several buses come together at  the

same time with very few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>



passengers.  As a result of this irregular  schedule,

inconvenience is caused to the people living  in  the

Sembawang  area.  I  think this is  because  of  poor

allocation  and  scheduling  of  buses  and  remedial

action should be taken to improve the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly. I would like to ask the Minister of State

to  consider this. There should be more buses  plying

from  Naval Base to Marsiling. At the present moment,

there  is  only Service No. 1 69 running this  route.

This  is  inadequate. In the past, we had bus Service

No.  1  60 from Crawford Street to Sembawang  passing

through  Marsiling, but now it does not pass  through

Marsiling.  So  I would like to ask the  Minister  of

State to consider reinstating Service No. 160 to pass

through Marsiling and to increase the number of buses

on  this  route, so that people living in  this  area

will have a better bus service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I have received many complaints from the

public  that the buses are still very dirty nowadays.

This  was  also pointed out by the Member for  Anson.

The  seats  are also very dirty. They have  not  been

cleaned properly. Some of the bus windows are damaged

and  they Cannot close properly. Once they are pushed

up  they  will slide down again because there  is  no

catch.  As a result, whenever it rains the buses  get

wet,  and there is no cloth or rag in the bus to wipe

the  seats  dry. I have travelled in buses  on  rainy

days. So I would call for immediate attention to  the

cleanliness and repair of bus windows. If  necessary,

I  can  produce my bus tickets to prove that  I  have

travelled in buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly. Sir, on the emission of black smoke. I

still notice a lot of old buses emitting black smoke.

Very smoky buses on the road are still to be seen. We

have  often  asked public vehicles to be kept  clean.

Taxis have been summoned for smoky exhausts but I  do

not  know  whether  similar  action  has  been  taken

against  buses. I would like some report on  this  in

this  House.  Action should be taken  to  reduce  the

number  of smoky buses on the road so as to alleviate

air  pollution in Singapore so that the  people  here

can have fresher air for good health.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, bus lanes have been

introduced  to  speed  up  the  bus  service.   Other

vehicles cannot use these lanes during the restricted

hours,  but  it seems that buses are not confined  to

bus  lanes because they are allowed to use the  other

traffic   lanes  during  the  peak  periods, thereby

causing  obstruction to other vehicles. I  think  the

Minister  has replied on this point but I would  like

to bring up a few more points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What action is being considered to force lorries

carrying  sand and stones to cover their load?  These

lorry  drivers  drive recklessly on the  roads,  thus

posing  a threat to other motorists, particularly  to

motor-cyclists who are at times injured by the  loose

stones falling from the lorries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that nowadays there are too many

traffic  signs and restrictions in most of  the  City

limit  areas. In fact, most streets have  either  the

single  or  double white and yellow lines. Therefore,

vehicles cannot park along the roads. As a result, in

times   of  emergency, both  public  and  Government

vehicles cannot comply with these road traffic signs.

I  wonder whether in times of emergency these traffic

regulations  could be relaxed, especially  Government

vehicles on official duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the high price of oil has in a way compelled

motorists  to economise in the use of their vehicles.

However, since most of our roads are one-way streets.

motorists have to drive a little extra whenever  they

want  to  make  a U turn or to drive in  an  opposite

direction.  But  then some of the U turns  are  sited

some  miles away, especially along the highways,  and

the  motorists have to drive those extra miles before

he  makes  the  turn. This is, in fact,  a  waste  of

petrol  and  money.  Just  to  quote  an  example.  A

motorist,  especially, driving at night,  is  driving

from  Serangoon Road to Punggol. When  he  approaches

the  Woodsville junction and instead  of  turning  to

Upper  Serangoon Road he wrongly turns into Toa Payoh

Road,  he has to make the unnecessary trip of driving

about three to four miles ahead before he could  make

a U turn to come back to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



original  point. I wonder whether more U turns  could

be  provided  at  shorter intervals in  some  of  our

highways so that our motorists would not waste petrol

and money unnecessarily.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho Kah Leong and Dr Ong Leong Boon

are not here. Mr Ong Teng Cheong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, a number of Members have

touched upon the treatment that is given to taxis  in

as  far  as the Area Licensing Scheme and road  taxes

are concerned. I agree with Members' observation that

taxis  are not private cars and should not be treated

in  the  same  manner as private cars.  In  fact,  as

further   measures  are  taken  to   discourage   the

ownership  and  use of private cars,  more  commuters

will turn to taxis. The taxi is an inefficient use of

road  space, like private cars, against which various

measures  have been taken to relieve our  urban  road

network. Although taxis do not use the road space  as

efficiently  as  the buses, which are  high  capacity

public  transport vehicles, they nevertheless  are  a

personalised  mode of public transport to  provide  a

door-to-door service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our attempts to encourage the use of

public  transport,  my  Ministry  has  examined   the

Additional   Registration  Fees  and  import   duties

imposed on taxis. I am pleased to inform hon. Members

in  this  House  that Government has  agreed  to  the

following  after the persistent request made  by  the

hon. Member for Aljunied over the last three years: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Additional Registration Fee (ARF) for taxis

will be reduced from the present rate of 100% of  the

open  market value of the vehicle to a flat  rate  of

$5,000;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The import duty for taxis will be reduced from

the present 45% to 20% of the open market value;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The ARF will be further reduced to a flat rate

of  only $2,000 instead of $5,000 if the new taxi  to

be  registered is a replacement for a  taxi  that  is

between five and six years old;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The full exemption from ARF will be allowed if

the  new vehicle is a replacement for a taxi that  is

five years or less in age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of this reduction in the ARF and

import  duty  is to encourage the use of  larger  and

more   powerful  vehicles  as  taxis.  It  will  also

encourage taxi operators to replace their vehicles at

the  end of five or six years instead of seven years.

which  is the maximum life span of a taxi. This  will

result in a newer and better taxi fleet.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in line with the policy of treating taxis

as a form of public transport. Sir, I am also pleased

to inform Members of this House that the Area Licence

Fee  for taxis will be reduced by 50%, that is,  from

$4  to  $2 for a daily area licence, and from $80  to

$40  for a monthly area licence. The reduced ARF  and

area  licence  fee will be effective from  1st  April

1977. With the implementation of this reduction, Sir.

it  is expected that the grade of service provided by

taxis will gradually improve over the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to a few points raised by the Member for Leng

Kee  on the surcharge of cars over ten years old  and

parking  of taxis at taxi stops. Regarding the  first

point, as the Member has eloquently explained in  his

speech, Government's policy is to control the  growth

of  private car population. Amongst the many measures

taken was the increase of the ARF for new cars.  With

the  increased cost of new cars, owners of  old  cars

will  tend to keep their cars longer than they  would

otherwise  have  done.  Apart from  discouraging  the

purchase  of new cars it is, therefore, necessary  to

ensure that old cars are not kept for an inordinately

long time. Surcharges on road tax are imposed on cars

that  have  reached or are over ten years old.  Under

local conditions, cars of this age would have reached

the  limit of their physical and economic life  span.

Owners  would  have little reluctance to  dispose  of

them,  as  a  trade-off and an inducement  for  these

owners   to   scrap   or  export  their   cars,   the

preferential ARF scheme was introduced  at  the  same

time.  There may be some cars that are over 10  years

old but still in road-worthy condition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



The  scrapping  of  these cars may lead  to  economic

waste, as the hon. Member has said. This is, however.

minimal  and it is insignificant when weighed against

the   overall  environmental,  economic   and   other

benefits  derived. It is not a compulsory  scrapping,

Sir,  when  a  car  has reached  10  years  old.  For

example,  if  the  Member owns a Mercedes  200  which

would cost $35,000 or $40,000 to purchase now, and if

it  is still in a road-worthy condition, there is  no

need  for  him to scrap his old car for  a  new  one.

After all the 10% surcharge amounts to less than  $90

a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On taxis entering the restricted zone since the

revision  of  the area licence fee on  31st  December

1975, if the hon. Member would submit a Question  for

a  Written Answer. I will give him the details of the

statistics.   But  there  is  definitely   a   slight

reduction  in  the  number of  taxi  trips  into  the

Central Business District. I believe the reduction is

in   the   region  of  18%.  But  with   my   earlier

announcement  that  the  Government  has  decided  to

reduce  the  area licence fee for taxis by  50%, the

number of taxi trips into the restricted zone will no

doubt increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of parking of taxis at taxi stops in

the  Central Business District raised by  the  Member

for  Leng  Kee.  I wish to inform him that  the  taxi

stops   are   introduced  in  the  CBD   to   prevent

obstruction  caused by taxis stopping  at  random  to

pick  up or drop passengers. Since the traffic volume

in  the  CBD during the restricted hours of the  Area

Licensing  Scheme is now not as heavy as before,  the

ROV and the Traffic Police will be asked to look into

the Member's suggestion of allowing the taxis to wait

at taxi stops where adequate space is available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is concerned about the bus

services  in  Sembawang  and  at  Marsiling.  He  has

complained  about the irregular services, the  dirty

condition of the buses and windows not being able  to

shut properly and causing inconvenience to passengers

during rainy days. Generally, there is no doubt  that

the  bus services have improved. But it does not mean

that  they  are  perfect and there are  no  problems.

There are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



problems.  But  every effort is made to  improve  the

service  generally  and that  takes  time.  When  the

central  workshop  and  other workshops  at  the  bus

depots  are  completed in the next one or two  years,

the  improvement would be more rapid. At the  present

moment  the  facilities  to  provide  the  preventive

maintenance,  repair of buses and so  on  are  rather

limited  because of the inadequacy in the  facilities

provided. The bus services in both the Sembawang  and

Marsiling areas have also been improved over the last

two years in line with the general improvement of the

SBS  services. The SBS will continue to  improve  its

services by re-routing and adding more buses  if  the

demand justifies it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also complained about the bunching

of   buses  together  at  times  and  sometimes   the

passengers have to wait for a long time for a bus.  I

wish  to  inform him that there are many  buses  from

different  services running along  a  certain  common

route. For instance, Sembawang Road is served  by  31

buses  per  hour, that is one bus every  two  minutes

during  peak  hours. Since the buses plying  any  one

service  are scheduled independently from  the  buses

plying other services, it is possible for a few buses

from different services to arrive at the bus stop all

at  about  the same time, especially during the  peak

hours.  So we have this bunching-up problem of  buses

at  the bus stops. But, on the other hand, during the

off-peak periods the time interval between two  buses

of  a  certain service could be as long as 15 minutes

and  it  is  possible that because of a bus  breaking

down  the commuters would have to wait up to half  an

hour  for  the  next  bus.  However,  this  type   of

disruption  of service has been greatly reduced  with

the improved maintenance and better buses used by the

SBS.  As  my  Minister  has  mentioned  earlier,  the

breakdown of buses has been reduced from 750 a day in

1974  to 110 buses breaking down a day now. There  is

therefore a vast improvement in this respect. It is a

very  rare occasion when a commuter has to  wait  for

more  than  an hour for a bus. This sort of  occasion

happens only when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



there  is  a  massive  traffic  jam  due  to  traffic

accidents  or  other causes which in  turn  seriously

affect the bus services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised a few points. He

has complained about the counter staff showing a lack

of  courtesy and helpfulness when serving the public.

[Interruption]  No, he did not? All right.  Like  all

counter officers, they are asked, to be polite to the

public.  He mentioned about the buses moving  out  of

bus  lanes. I think the Minister has replied to  that

and  I have also mentioned that. But in practice  the

bus  drivers have been encouraged to drive within the

bus  lanes wherever possible. He has mentioned  about

the  spillage from lorries carrying sand and  stones.

The officers from the Ministry of the Environment and

the Traffic Police do take enforcement action against

spillage  from lorries, The lorry users  and  drivers

are  encouraged  not to overload  their  lorries  and

drive  carefully to avoid spillage. The  covering  of

lorries may help but does not prevent spillage if the

lorries  are not properly loaded and driven. We  have

no  intention  to  make it a general compulsion  that

loads  on  lorries have to be covered although  lorry

users   and   drivers  are  encouraged  to   do   so.

Enforcement officers will, however, see  to  it  that

where  loads  carried are light and  are  of  a  fine

nature and are likely to be blown off the lorries  by

wind, then such loads should be covered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also complained about too many

traffic signs at certain road junctions. There  is  a

committee on traffic signs. I do agree with him  that

at  certain  road junctions there are too many  signs

which  confuse the motorists. If the Member  and  all

the other Members in this House could help by writing

in  to the committee - I think the Member for Kampong

Chai Chee does write in to the committee now and then

to inform the committee of certain junctions with too

many  of these signs - I am sure they will look  into

the  matter. He also has mentioned whether Government

vehicles on official duties should be allowed to park

in  areas  prohibited  by road traffic  signs.  I  am

afraid  the  commission of offences is not encouraged

nor allowed, even if it is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



Government  vehicle on official duties. If  it  is  a

case  of emergency, it is for the offender to explain

the  nature  of  the emergency to the  Magistrate  in

court.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be pre-arranged, or the Traffic Police

could  be informed on the spot of the nature  of  the

emergency,  For  example, in  case  of  a  fire,  the

firemen  would be fighting the fire, and there  would

be  fire engines, ambulance, and so on. And if  there

are Traffic Police on the spot, they would understand

the  need  for parking of such vehicles against  road

traffic signs. I think that is all right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member complained about not enough U-turns along

certain  roads and quoted the example of  a  motorist

going  from Serangoon Road to Punggol had to  make  a

wrong turn at Woodsville Circus into Jalan Toa Payoh.

Well,  he has himself to blame. If he is alert, after

turning  into Jalan Toa Payoh, he should straightaway

turn  left  and  get back into Serangoon  Road  again

through Moonstone Lane.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Yes, I use that road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Yes. It is one-way. You can turn

back.  However. I do agree that certain stretches  of

road are without U-turns and this sometimes cause  an

unnecessary  detour  when  one  makes  a  mistake  of

direction. When he makes a mistake, as I said, he has

himself  to  blame.  Anyway, if the  Member  has  any

suggestions  on the provision of U-turns,  I  suggest

that  he writes to the Roads Branch of the PWD  which

have  all  the experts and traffic planners  to  look

into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the

Senior  Minister of State for his answer, but he  has

left  out  two points. One is about the  damaged  bus

windows or doors and I would like to know whether  he

will  take  steps  to  repair them  immediately.  The

second point is about buses emitting obnoxious  black

smoke.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the Traffic Police and the

Enforcement  Squad of the ROV do take action  against

buses  with smoky exhausts. If the hon. Member  would

submit  a Question for Written Answer or Oral Answer,

I will give him the full details of the statistics on

action taken, even on a month-to-month basis, for the

last few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding faulty windows and the dirty condition of

buses.  I  wish to inform him that the SBS, in  fact,

has   been  paying  great  attention  to  this.   But

unfortunately as I mentioned earlier, this takes time

to  overcome. There are too many buses. The  SBS  now

operates over 2,000 buses and sometimes after a rainy

night  the buses just have to go on to the road  with

the seats still wet. But they do give instructions to

the bus conductors to clean the buses. There are rags

provided for them to wipe the seats dry and  to  keep

them  clean.  If  the  Member  has  come  across  any

particular  bus  which is not  kept  clean.  I  would

appreciate it if he lets the SBS know by taking  down

the  bus  numbers,  the time of  the  incidents,  and

action will be taken against them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to save

time  I  will just raise my points in question  form.

The  Senior  Minister of State has  said  that  as  a

result  of this announced reduction in import  duties

and  ARF for taxis, he expected an improvement in the

taxi  service. My question is: does it therefore mean

that  the  imposition of such  a  fee  in  the  first

instance  was meant as a disincentive for an improved

service? In other words, was it meant to obstruct  an

improved service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is related. Does he mean that it

is  the deliberate policy of the Government to impose

a  higher  fee and thereafter reduce it to show  that

the Government is benevolent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question. The area licensing fee will be

reduced  from 1st April, from $4 to $2  for  a  daily

licence and from $80 to $40 for a monthly licence. He

expects an increase in the number of taxis after this

new  rate of fees. Does he mean, therefore,  that  he

wants more taxis to go to the City area now? Or  does

it  mean that he was quite satisfied that the initial

fee would not affect the taxi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



population in the City and that there were sufficient

taxis to serve the people there?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question. There is one junction near

Killiney  Road.  I think it is Somerset  Road,  where

roadside trees were planted. As a result, you  cannot

see  the traffic lights; so a letter was sent to  the

press  complaining  about  it.  The  answer  to  this

complaint in the press was that, instead of  removing

those  trees  planted wrongly, they  put  up  another

traffic  light  about one metre away from  the  first

one.  So  there are now two traffic lights  within  a

distance of one metre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, if I may be allowed to go

back  to the basic principles of the introduction  of

the  area licensing fees on taxis. As I have  briefly

mentioned earlier, taxis like private cars do not use

the road space efficiently, although it is a form  of

public  transport.  But it is  not  a  high  capacity

public  transport.  The whole  purpose  of  the  Area

Licensing  Scheme  is to give priority  to  the  high

capacity  public  transport vehicles converging  into

the  CBD.  Therefore, when the Area Licensing  Scheme

was introduced, the object was to screen off the non-efficient   road  user  from  contributing   to   the

congestion  in  the  urban  road  network.   It   was

difficult at that time to anticipate the response  of

taxis  coming  into the central area  when  the  area

licensing measure was extended to include taxis.  But

after  conducting surveys and taking down statistics,

it  was found necessary to reduce the licence fee for

taxis,  not  because the objective was wrong  or  the

principle was wrong but that this is a mechanism used

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks in the main to take into account

recent developments in the labour field as well as to

consolidate   the   existing   provisions   governing

industrial   actions  so  as  to  further  strengthen

industrial harmony and trade union democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, clause 2 of the Bill seeks

to  abolish  the  fee of $1 presently  prescribed  by

subsection (2) of section 9 of the principal Act  for

processing  an application to register a trade  union

and  to  provide that any such application  shall  be

accompanied by such fee as may be prescribed  by  the

Minister. The $1 fee was fixed in 1941. It has become

unrealistic  in the context of present circumstances.

The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



new  fee  will  be  spelt out  in  the  Trade  Unions

Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the industrial relations

scene  in  the Republic over the past few  years  has

been  stable and harmonious despite retrenchment  and

wage  restraints consequent upon world-wide recession

and   inflation,  This  happy  situation   could   be

attributed to the close tripartite cooperation of the

workers, the managements and the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong, patriotic, responsible and democratic

trade  union  movement was an important asset.  Union

leaders  as a whole were able to maintain a  rational

approach to the adverse effect of economic recession.

Notwithstanding the overall satisfactory situation, a

weakness   in   the  industrial  relations   practice

deserves  our attention. I refer to the frequency  of

illegal industrial actions. In 1975, six out  of  the

total 26 work stoppages were illegal. Last year,  two

strikes,  six  minor  work stoppages  and  a  go-slow

action were staged without conducting a secret ballot

to  obtain the majority consent of the union  members

affected as required by law. In many cases, the union

headquarters or branch officials claimed ignorance of

any  prior knowledge and invariably attributed  these

to  spontaneous actions on the part of the  rank  and

file  members.  Ironically, these  protestations  are

tantamount   to  an  admission  that  the  industrial

actions taken were not only contrary to the law,  but

also in contravention of union rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An illustration is the recent illegal industrial

action  in Metal Box Singapore Limited. The Company's

employees are organised in a house union known as the

Singapore  Metal  Box  Workers'  Union.  On   1   5th

February, 19 union members in the factory applied for

a  day's  leave  on  16th February, the  day  before

Chinese  New  Year eve. The applications were  turned

down by the Personnel Office. On 16th February, these

workers  reported for work as usual at 2.30 p.m. for

their  shift duties which were supposed to end at  11

p.m, that night. But at around 6.30 p.m, all of them

decided to walk



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



out  of the factory, although their request for early

release were earlier turned down by their supervisor.

The  walk-out  rendered  two production  lines  idle.

Union  officers could have stopped the illegal  walk-out.   They   failed   to  do   so   and   disclaimed

responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another incident, some 60 workers stopped work

for  1 1/2 hours on 23rd February over an issue created

by  the  Union.  The circumstances  leading  to  this

illegal work stoppage are briefly as follows. On 14th

February  at  around  4  p.m. the  Union's  secretary

requested  the  management  to  advance  the   normal

Wednesday  pay day, which fell on 16th  February,  to

15th  February. The request was turned  down  by  the

management  of Metal Box because the notice  was  too

short.  The  Union  then demanded  that  the  workers

should   be  paid  full  wages,  inclusive   of   all

allowances, due to them in respect of the week ending

20th February, on the following pay day which fell on

23rd  February.  The  Union  made  this  unreasonable

demand  knowing  full  well  that  it  would  not  be

possible for management to work out the full salaries

of  the  600-strong workforce in time, as the factory

would  be  closed for the Chinese New  Year  holidays

from  17th to 21st February. The management suggested

two  alternatives. The first was to pay  the  workers

their  basic  wages on 23rd February, and  the  other

allowances on the following Wednesday. The second was

to pay full wages to the workers on 24th February and

not  on 23rd February as demanded by the Union.  Both

alternatives  were not acceptable to the  Union.  The

management then tried but failed to persuade all  the

three  wage clerks who are also members of the Union.

to return for work on 21st February over the holiday,

so  that full wages of their comrades could be worked

out in time for payment on 23rd February. The Company

finally  decided  to  pay only basic  wages  on  23rd

February  and  the other allowances on the  following

Wednesday.   On  23rd  February, the  workers   were

accordingly paid their basic wages in respect of  the

preceding  week, Some 60 workers then  downed  tools.

The  Union  again  claimed  ignorance  of  any  prior

knowledge of the illegal industrial action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third incident occurred on 4th March when the

union  members in two production lines staged  a  go-slow  which cut the production of the affected  lines

for the day by about 30%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is Government's policy to promote the

development  of  a  healthy non-communist  democratic

trade union movement, as an essential element in  our

economic life. But industrial action in contravention

of  the  constitution and rules of the  trade  unions

will  not  in  any way foster trade union  democracy.

Wild-cat  industrial action would defeat the national

purpose  of  more  exports and  more  investments  to

generate more wealth. Non-observation of union  rules

in the conduct of any form of industrial action would

erode   trade  union  discipline.  Without  effective

exercise of union discipline it would be idle to talk

of increasing productivity and of creating employment

through   capital   investment.  It   is   desirable.

therefore,  to  ensure that any  form  of  industrial

action  initiated by a branch committee is  conducted

according  to  the constitutional provisions  of  the

trade union concerned and with prior sanction of  the

Union headquarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing subsection (1) of section 28 of

the Act any strike or industrial action is illegal if

it  is  taken without obtaining the consent by secret

ballot  of  the majority of the members so  affected.

Subsection  (2)  of  the same  section  makes  it  an

offence  for  a  trade union or the  members  of  its

executive committee to commence, promote, organise or

finance such illegal strike or industrial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions are inadequate. The Registrar of

Trade  Unions has no power to deal with persons  who,

though  fully acquainted with the illegal  strike  or

industrial  action,  refuse  to  cooperate   in   his

investigation.  The Registrar is  powerless  to  deal

with  ordinary members or paid employees of the trade

union who not only commence, promote or organise  but

also  participate  in illegal strikes  or  industrial

actions. He is also unable to take action when  union

branch  committees take illegal strike or  industrial

action in contravention of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



their  union rules or by-laws. Clause 4 of  the  Bill

therefore   seeks  to  remedy  these   defects.   The

Registrar is empowered to require any person  who  is

acquainted  with  the  illegal strike  or  industrial

action  to  fully  assist him in his  investigations.

Members  of  unions who are involved in such  illegal

action  are also brought within the ambit of  section

28  of  the Act. In addition, it makes it an  offence

for  any  person, including paid officials  and  non-union members, to instigate or incite others to  take

part in illegal strikes or industrial actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of the Trade Unions

Act,  a person who is under the age of 21, but  above

the  age of 18, may be a member of a trade union, but

he  is  not  allowed to hold office.  Representations

have  been made by the NTUC. SILO and PIEU, that this

stipulation has handicapped the efficient running  of

trade  unions in establishments which employ a  large

percentage  of young persons such as the  electronics

and   garment   factories.  An  analysis   of   union

membership reveals that there are at present about  1

5,000 unionised employees who are between the age  of

18  and 21. If the present law is rigidly adhered to.

the  unions  may  not  be  able  to  find  sufficient

eligible  members to stand for elections  as  office-bearers  in certain branches where there  is  a  high

concentration  of  young workers. This  would  create

difficulties in unionisation of establishments  which

employ  a  large  percentage of  young  persons.  The

Government  has therefore decided to  lower  the  age

qualification from 21 to 18 years for a union  member

to  be  eligible for holding office. Clause 5 of  the

Bill  adds  a  provision to section  29  of  the  Act

vesting  the Minister with the authority to  allow  a

union  member who is below 21 but above 1 8 years  of

age  to hold office in or to be a trustee of a  trade

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the amendments made to

the  Trade Unions Act in 1967, the democractic  trade

union   movement   has   gone   through   a   dynamic

modernisation  process. The number of  employees  who

carry union membership cards has now reached an  all-time  record high figure of 221,936 as at the end  of 1976.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



Ninety-three  per  cent of these unionised  employees

belong to 51 unions affiliated to the National Trades

Union    Congress    (NTUC).   Another    significant

development  is  that there has been  an  appreciable

improvement  in  trade  union finance  following  the

introduction of the check-off system in May 1970.  As

31st December, 1976

implemented  by  39  NTUC  affiliates  whose   assets

totalled  nearly  $17 million. A total  of  seven  of

these  unions have assets of $1 million or more.  The

assets of the richest of them exceed $4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fortunate in the Republic that there has

been, by and large, no abuse of union funds in recent

years.   It   is   an  eloquent  testimony   to   the

responsibility of our present trade union leadership.

However,  we  should  provide for  proper  safeguards

regarding   the  use  of  union  funds.  At   present

subsection (1) of section 16 of the Act only empowers

the  Minister to freeze the bank account of  a  trade

union  after  it  has been served with  a  notice  of

deregistration. In practice, notice of deregistration

is  normally served on unions involved in  activities

prejudicial to national security and public order. No

provision  was made to freeze a union's bank  account

when  only  the  funds  of a trade  union  are  under

investigation. When millions of dollars  are  passing

through the accounts of trade unions, there is a need

for  additional preventive measures to protect  union

funds. The Government would be failing in its duty if

adequate  measures  are not taken  to  safeguard  the

interest of the rank and file members in such funds,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill therefore empowers the Minister

to  freeze a trade union's bank account, for a period

not  exceeding  three months, if an investigation  is

made   by   the   Registrar  of  Trade  Unions,   the

Commissioner  of Police, the Commissioner  of  Inland

Revenue  or  the  Director of the  Corrupt  Practices

Investigation  Bureau regarding the improper  use  or

misapplication  of the funds of the trade  union.  In

order   to   ensure   that  union   officials   under

investigation do not tamper with union  funds  during

the period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



when  the union's bank account is frozen, appropriate

amendments will also be made to Regulations 25 of the

Trade   Unions  Regulations  to  deprive  the   union

officials concerned of the power of using union funds

until the investigation is completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the introduction of

the  Bill, the Member for Toa Payoh has expressed his

concern  to me that the freezing of the union banking

account   may  result  in  hardship  for  the   union

concerned  by making it impossible for the  union  to

meet its legitimate expenditure of a recurrent nature

such  as  staff  salaries, rent.  PUB  and  telephone

charges.  I  am  indeed grateful to  the  Member  for

drawing my attention to this possible difficulty  and

accordingly, I shall be moving an amendment to clause

3  to enable such legitimate recurrent expenditure to

be  expended subject to the approval of the Registrar

of Trade Unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Unions Act at present has no provisions to

control   the   investment  of  union  funds.   Every

registered trade union makes provisions in its  rules

empowering  its executive committee to  invest  union

funds  in  any manner as it deems fit.  Many  of  the

unions  invest  their  surplus  funds  in  the   NTUC

cooperatives.  A  few unions have bought  substantial

amounts  of  shares through the Stock  Exchange.  The

value  of these shares has since declined. With  most

unions  becoming  affluent, an increasing  number  of

them may yet invest their surplus funds in stocks and

shares.  As  stocks  and shares are  not  the  safest

securities  for investment, some form of  control  is

necessary to safeguard the use of union funds in this

respect.  Clause  6  of the Bill therefore  seeks  to

prohibit  trade  union funds from being  invested  in

securities except those approved by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>7.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of  the  Trade Unions (Amendment)  Bill.  In

doing  so. I am confident that I have the support  of

the trade union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



movement  in  Singapore as well as my  colleagues  in

this House. There are, of course, some provisions  in

the  Bill on which trade unionists may want  to  have

clarifications  or assurances from the  Minister  for

Labour.  Apart  from  that,  the  Bill  is  generally

acceptable  and  does in no way seek  to  hamper  the

operation of a responsible trade union movement, as I

intend to explain later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One particular provision, which I am most pleased to

note,  is  that  contained in clause 5  of  the  Bill

pertaining  to  the amendment of section  29  of  the

principal Act. This House may recall that in 1974 and

1975  I drew the attention of the Minister for Labour

to  the desirability of amending the Trade Unions Act

to   lower  the  statutory  minimum  age  for   union

membership and for holding office in trade unions. As

I  stated at that time, there was a compelling reason

for  lowering  the age requirement for union  members

and  union  officers. The compelling reason  is  that

persons are entering into the labour market under the

age  of  18 years in increasing numbers, It  was  not

unusual in the last few years, and more so today,  to

find  new  establishments staffed with a majority  of

workers   under   18  years.  Under  the   prevailing

provision,  young workers under the age of  18  years

are  not supposed to be members of a union and  young

workers  between the age of 21 and 18 years  are  not

permitted  to  hold  any  office  in  a  union.  Such

statutory  restriction is out  of  keeping  with  the

prevailing social situation in Singapore and, in that

sense,  has  become outdated. The proposed  amendment

rectifies  the  matter by, in a manner  of  speaking,

putting the clock forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are those who may quibble about the need

for young workers between the age of 21 years and  18

years  to  obtain  the approval of the  Minister  for

Labour  to hold office in a trade union, I, on behalf

of  the  National Trades Union Congress, welcome  the

proposed provisions as they stand in clause 5 of  the

Bill.  The  lowering  of the minimum  age  for  union

membership  and for holding office in  the  union  is

most   timely.   Otherwise,  there   would   be   the

paradoxical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



situation of selected young persons between  the  age

of 21 years and 18 years being considered matured and

fit   enough  to  be  commissioned  officers  in  the

Singapore  Armed  Forces,  while  no  young   persons

between  the  age  of 21 years and 18  years  can  be

considered  matured and fit enough to be officers  of

trade  unions. The proposed provisions put right  the

matter by permitting young persons between the age of

21  years and 1 8 years, who have shown themselves to

be  responsible,  to hold office in their  respective

trade  unions.  I do not think there  should  be  any

confusion  between  the  eligibility  of  all   young

persons  between the age of 21 years and 18 years  to

be   officers  of  a  trade  union, and  the  actual

selection of a smaller number of young persons to  be

the  officers of the respective trade union. With the

lowering  of  the statutory minimum age  for  holding

office  in a union, it is now possible for  the  NTUC

and its affiliated trade unions to groom and train at

an  earlier  stage such young persons to  become  the

future leaders of the trade union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the leadership of the trade union

movement must be judged by its ability to secure  and

promote the welfare and interest of the rank and file

membership, without unduly prejudicing  the  general

welfare  and  interest  of the larger  community, in

which the members live and work. I am confident  that

the  National Trades Union Congress and my colleagues

in  this  House  share  my view  on  the  responsible

leadership of a constructive trade union movement and

welcome  the  provisions of  clause  4  of  the  Bill

pertaining to section 28 of the principal Act.  There

are,  of course, those who, again, will quibble about

the  supposedly  restrictive effect of  the  proposed

provision which, among other things, seek to penalise

members  of a trade union participating in an illegal

strike or industrial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House may recall, the prevailing

provisions  of  the principal Act, regarding  illegal

strike  or industrial action in contravention of  the

secret ballot requirement or in contravention of  the

rules  of  the respective trade union, have  been  in

force for the past 11 years or so. But the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>



prevailing provisions, while penalising an  offending

trade union or the officers of such trade union,  are

silent  on  the  part played by  the  rank  and  file

members  in  an illegal strike or industrial  action.

The  result  is  that it can be a rather  intolerable

situation  for  officers  being  confronted  by   the

members, who are pressing for an illegal  strike  or

industrial  action  and who are too  aware  of  their

being  not  subject to any sanction  of  the  law  in

participating  in  an  illegal strike  or  industrial

action  under  the prevailing legislation.  I  should

think  it  is  a logical matter, if not for  anything

else, that if a strike or industrial action is deemed

to  be  illegal  for any failure to comply  with  the

secret  ballot  requirements  or  the  rules  of  the

respective   trade  union, then  all   persons   who

participate  in any manner or to any extent  in  such

illegal strike or industrial action should be subject

to the same sanction, irrespective of whatever office

they   hold  or  their  status  in  the  trade  union

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in welcoming the proposed provisions under

clause  4  of the Bill, I must, however,  express  my

strong misgiving in that the proposed provisions  are

not  as  comprehensive as they should be. I am  parti

cularly  concerned that the proposed  provisions  are

directed   against   members   of   a   trade   union

participating  in  an  illegal strike  or  industrial

action,   but   are   strangely  silent   about   the

application of a sanction of the law on persons,  who

are   not   members  of  any  trade  union  and   who

participate  in  an  illegal  strike  or   industrial

action.  It is true in the principal Act,  the  trade

union  is  defined to include a temporary combination

of  workers  with the object of promoting, organising

or  financing strikes. But knowing how the  officials

of  the Labour Ministry react to something out of the

ordinary,  I  do  not  expect  there  would  be   any

prosecution of un-organised workers participating  in

an  illegal  strike or industrial action.  An  excuse

that  might  be  advanced by the Ministry  of  Labour

officials  would probably be that, since such  groups

of  workers are not formally organised, it  would  be

difficult  for them to comply with the secret  ballot

requirement. I personally do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



hope  that  the  scenario I have just sketched  would

never  take  place.  But the probability  of  such  a

situation  arising is not all that  insignificant.  I

have  in mind two particular situations. One  is  the

minority  of  non-members in  an  establishment,  the

majority  of  whose employees are  represented  by  a

registered trade union, The other is the entire group

of  workers  employed  by  a  contractor  or  a  sub-contractor,   as  contract  workers  are  notoriously

impossible  to  be organised into a registered  trade

union.   If  such  workers  can  commence, promote,

organise, participate or otherwise act in furtherance

of  any  illegal strike or industrial action and  get

away with it, it would be extremely demoralising  for

other  workers  who are members of  registered  trade

unions. I hope the Minister for Labour will make  the

necessary  amendments to the proposed  provisions  to

prevent such a situation arising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must express my puzzlement over clause 6

of  the  Bill relating to section 50 of the principal

Act. In addition to the prevailing prohibition on the

use  of trade union funds for political purposes, the

proposed  provisions seek to restrict the  investment

of  union funds in securities, The principal Act  has

been  in  force for some thirty years  and  all  that

time,  it  has  not  been  considered  necessary   to

introduce any restriction on the investment of  union

funds  in  securities. Though the principal  Act  has

been  silent  on this point, the Registrar  of  Trade

Unions, in  the  course  of  exercising  his   wide

administrative  function, has  more  or  less  guided

trade  unions  in  their investment  of  trade  union

funds.  I  am  sure the NTUC and all  its  affiliated

trade  unions have not, in their investment of  their

respective  funds in securities, given any  cause  to

the  Minister to prompt him to introduce the proposed

restriction.  Apart from that, I also hope  that  the

Minister  would not be unduly restrictive  in  giving

his approval to securities in which unions may invest

their   funds.   I  have  in  mind  the   cooperative

enterprises and projects, with which the NTUC and its

affiliated   trade   unions  are   associated.   Such

enterprises may not be satisfactory from the point of

view of yield from or return on investment but they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>



greatly  benefit the members of the trade unions  and

their families in a way which cannot be evaluated  in

the statement of accounts or the balance sheet of the

trade union concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,   I   wish  to  comment  on  the  Trade   Unions

(Amendment) Bill. As a trade unionist I must say that

the  Bill seems at first sight to be more restrictive

than  beneficial to the trade unions. But  if  it  is

accepted  that  trade unions and their  members  have

their  obligations  to  society, then  the  proposed

amendments have to be viewed in the light of  whether

they  are compatible with the social responsibilities

of trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My comment, however, is directed to the proposed

section  1 6(2) of the principal Act, as set  out  in

clause  3  of  the Bill. A superficial impression  is

that  section  16(2) is mainly an  extension  of  the

existing  section  16(1), whereby  the  Minister  for

Labour  may,  if  he is satisfied  that  there  is  a

likelihood  of  a  misuse of union funds,  order  the

banking  account of the union concerned to be frozen.

But  on further scrutiny, the proposed section 1 6(2)

is radically different from section 16(1) both in its

effect on and in its implication to trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, the existing section 16(1) deals with

the  situation of a union under notice, in accordance

with  section  1  5(2), of  deregistration  by   the

Registrar of Trade Unions. In such a context there is

every  likelihood for the funds of  the  trade  union

concerned  to be misused and every justification  for

the  Minister to intervene to prevent the  misuse  of

trade  union  funds. But in relation to the  proposed

section 16(2), the situation likely to be encountered

is  entirely  different from that  encountered  under

section 16(1). It is not necessary that a trade union

under  investigation is likely to be deregistered  on

completion of the investigation. Moreover, it  is  by

no  means  certain  that the investigation  will  not

vindicate   the   reputation  of  the   trade   union

concerned. I am aware that the power to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>



conduct  such  investigation  is  confined   to   the

Registrar  of  Trade  Unions,  the  Commissioner   of

Police,  the Commissioner of Inland Revenue  and  the

Director of the CPIB, and the period for the freezing

of  the  banking  account of the union  concerned  is

restricted to a maximum of three months.  What  I  am

concerned about is that there is no safeguard in  the

proposed provision to ensure that an investigation is

not  commenced  unless the relevant public  authority

has  good  reasons  to believe the  investigation  is

necessary.  As  it  is, any  of  the  stated  public

authority  has the absolute discretion to  launch  an

investigation into the improper use or misapplication

of  union  funds. Thus on the basis of  a  frivolous.

vexatious  or  malicious complaint, an  investigation

can  be  launched under the proposed  section  16(2).

much  to the demoralisation and inconvenience of  the

trade union concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will, therefore, be grateful if the Minister can

give an assurance that an investigation, as envisaged

in  the proposed section 16(2), will not be commenced

except in accordance with an administrative procedure

to   be   devised   by  the  Ministry,   to   prevent

investigation for frivolous, vexatious  or  malicious

reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly. I have a slight misgiving about the

proposed section 9(2) as contained in clause 2 of the

Bill.  Ostensibly,  the proposed provision  seeks  to

abolish  the  practice  of requiring  applicants  for

registration  of  trade unions to  affix  a  dollar's

worth  of stamp to their applications and to  empower

the Minister to fix the fee for registration. In that

way, the Ministry of Labour will be credited with the

registration  fee  which, at  present,  go  into  the

coffers  of the Ministry of Finance by way of revenue

stamps.  But I am more concerned with the fact  that,

under  the proposed amendment, the Minister is  given

the   absolute  discretion  to  fix  the  amount   of

registration fee for application for registration  of

trade  unions.  I  hope  the Minister  will  give  an

assurance  that  whatever fees are  to  be  fixed  in

future   will  be  reasonable  in  relation  to   the

prevailing  rate  of one dollar per  application  and

will not be so unreasonably increased in future as to

defeat the provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>



of  section 17 of the Employment Act entrenching  the

right  of workers to be members and officers of trade

unions.



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member  for Boon Teck has suggested that the proposed

amendments  to, section  28  should  also  make   it

mandatory for non-unionised workers to take a  secret

ballot before embarking on any industrial action. The

primary objective of enacting the present section  28

in  1966  was to prevent union officers from  abusing

their powers by calling industrial action without the

prior consent of the rank and file members. Hence the

requirement for a secret ballot to be conducted among

the affected members. This will help avoid the bitter

experience  of  other countries where strike  actions

are  often imposed from the top. In this instance the

secret   ballot  serves  as  a  significant  aid   in

fostering  trade union democracy. It is not  intended

to  curtail  the  right  of a  trade  union  to  take

industrial  action. The proposed amendments  to  this

section   are  aimed  at  furthering  the  democratic

process  in  the  conduct of trade union  affairs  by

making  it mandatory for the union members and branch

officials  to observe the rules and bylaws  of  their

own union when they decide to take industrial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an important social organisation such as a trade

union,  it is only right that the member's  right  to

vote  for  industrial  action  should  go  with   the

obligation  to  be bound by the union's  rule.  Since

these  provisions  are aimed at  fostering  at  trade

union  democracy  and  trade union  discipline,  they

could   not   be  made  applicable  to  non-unionised

workers.  Until  they are in possession  of  a  trade

union  membership card, the unorganised workers  who,

by  and  large, are less well off than the  unionised

workers will remain, whether as a individual or as  a

group,  outside  the  industrial relation  system  as

regulated by the Industrial Relations Act. Lacking in

organisational strength, they will not  be  protected

by the bargaining power of a trade union. At the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>



same  time, they could not be expected to be  subject

to  the  exercise of trade union discipline. In  this

context,  it will go against the spirit and intention

of the law to extend the secret ballot requirement to

the  unorganised  workers. The concern  of  the  hon.

Member  over  wild-cat  industrial  action  by   non-unionised  workers is well taken. As I have mentioned

earlier, a  total of four strikes and 10 minor  work

stoppages occurred in 1976. Of this number, only  two

minor  work  stoppages were staged  by  non-unionised

workers,  despite the fact that 69% of the  total  of

713,200 employees in Singapore were still unorganised

last  year.  This compared with two strikes  and  six

minor  work stoppages staged by union members without

a  secret ballot in contravention of the law as  well

as their own union rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the unorganised contract workers who were

singled out for mention by the hon. Member, they seem

to  have  little  inclination for industrial  action.

This  is  borne out by the fact that during the  past

five years, out of a total of 36 strikes and 78 minor

work  stoppages recorded by my Ministry, none involve

unorganised  contract workers. There is therefore  no

compelling  reason for any legislative action  to  be

taken to deal with wild-cat industrial action by non-unionised workers. However, the hon. Member for  Boon

Teck  can  be assured that the Government will  watch

the   situation  closely  and  if  the  need  arises,

consideration  will  be  given  to  amend  the  Trade

Disputes Act whose provisions apply to both unionised

and  non-unionised workers to ensure that  industrial

harmony continues to prevail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also expressed concern that the proposed

provisions of section 50 might impede the  growth  of

the  NTUC  cooperative enterprises.  It  is  not  the

intention  of  the proposed amendment to  impose  any

restrictions on sound investments. To do so would run

counter  to the Government's policy of assisting  the

democratic  trade union movement to attain  financial

self-sufficiency. The proposed provisions in clause 6

will   not   affect   the   cooperative   enterprises

established by the NTUC because approval has  already

been given under the present paragraph (g)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



of  section  48 of the principal Act for trade  union

funds  to be expended on the promotion, organisation.

operation   and   financing   of   such   cooperative

enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Toa Payoh expressed concern

that  the  proposed  section  16(2)  might  lead   to

frivolous,  vexatious or malicious  investigation  of

expenditure  of  trade  union  funds.  There  is   no

disagreement  over  the object of the  new  provision

which is to safeguard the union funds in the interest

of the rank and file members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points raised by the Member concern

administrative   procedures   in   connection    with

implementation. Under the existing relevant laws, the

Registrar   of   Trade  Unions,   the   Police,   the

Commissioner  of  Inland Revenue and  the  CPIB  have

powers  to  investigate into the use of  trade  union

funds.  The purpose of the proposed section 16(2)  is

to  confer  the additional power to freeze  the  bank

account  of the trade union while such investigations

are   in   progress.  Even  if  there  is   such   an

investigation, the  freezing  of  the  union's  bank

account will not follow automatically. Each case will

be  considered  on its own merit. No action  will  be

taken  to freeze the bank account unless it is  found

absolutely necessary. This guideline has been adopted

in  implementing the existing section  16(1)  of  the

Act. This is borne out by the fact that hitherto  not

all  the  unions  which were served with  notices  of

deregistration  by  the  Registrar  had  their   bank

accounts  frozen.  The hon. Member can  therefore  be

assured that the new provision in section 16(2)  will

not    give   rise   to   frivolous   and   vexatious

investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also expressed concern that the

freezing  of  the union funds may be extended  beyond

the  initial period of three months. I wish to  point

Out that three months will be a long enough period to

establish whether prima facie there is a case against

the union for improper use or misapplication of union

funds.  Hence, legally clause 3 provides for a freeze

of three months only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question on new registration fee, the

hon. Member knows that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>



the  fixing of fees will be a joint decision  by  the

Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Finance. Where

the Ministry is concerned. I would like to assure the

Member  for Toa Payoh that we are proposing to impose

a reasonable fee,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is to allow the Registrar to
