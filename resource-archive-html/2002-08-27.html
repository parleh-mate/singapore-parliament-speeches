<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING SHARES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Heng Chee How</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and Minister for Finance, since Budget 2002  (a) how many

Singaporeans  have  become  eligible  for  the   Economic

Restructuring Shares (ERS) allocation in January 2003  by

(i) inactive Central Provident Fund (CPF) account-holders

making  contributions  to their accounts  and  (ii)  non-salaried Singaporeans opening CPF accounts, and (b)  what

additional  measures  will the Government  be  taking  to

remind   Singaporeans  to  make  necessary  contributions

before the deadline of 30th November 2002.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 31st July

2002,  around  1.3  million Singaporeans  have  made  the

requisite $50 CPF contribution to qualify for  ERS.   Out

of  this  1.3 million Singaporeans, 100,398 are  inactive

CPF  account  holders  and another 221  are  non-salaried

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will take steps to remind

Singaporeans about the ERS.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



September 2002, CPF Board will send letters to all  adult

Singaporeans  highlighting the key features  of  the  ERS

scheme.    Those who have not made the requisite $50  CPF

contribution  will  be reminded  to  do  so  as  soon  as

possible  before  the deadline.  After the  letters  have

been sent out, pamphlets covering the ERS and the rest of

the  GST Assistance Package, such as the rebates and  the

CCC Assistance Scheme, will be distributed to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to reach out to all Singaporeans is not

just through the Government's publicity efforts, but  the

active  involvement of everyone in the community.   Thus,

Singaporeans should help to remind their family  members,

relatives  and  friends  to make the  requisite  $50  CPF

contribution.    Grassroots leaders will  also  be  doing

their part to remind their residents about the ERS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eligible Singaporeans who have made the $50

contribution  by 30th November 2002 will receive  an  ERS

notification  letter with details on the  number  of  the

shares  that  will be allocated to them  on  1st  January

2003.   Those who have not made the contribution at  that

time  can  still do so by 31st December 2002.  They  will

then receive the shares on 1st February 2003.

<div align="center"><b>DEPOSIT INSURANCE SCHEME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister  for Finance, with regard to  the  Monetary

Authority   of  Singapore's  proposed  deposit  insurance

scheme,  (a) who will be appointed to manage the  scheme;

and   (b)  how  have  other  countries  operated  similar

schemes, especially with regard to best practices  needed

to  avoid possible conflict of interest among bankers and

banking supervisors who may be represented on the  boards

of such appointed agencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, MAS has not

decided who will manage the deposit insurance scheme. The

first phase of the deposit insurance study by MAS focused

on issues related to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



membership, coverage limit, the size of the fund and  how

participating institutions will be assessed  for  premium

contributions.  Who  will  manage  the  scheme  will   be

considered in the second phase of the study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two broad options for managing deposit

insurance.  One  option  is to  have  the  responsibility

reside  within MAS. There is substantial overlap  in  the

interests and responsibilities of a bank supervisor and a

deposit  insurer. MAS supervises banks  to  assess  their

safety  and  soundness  and  to  minimise  incidences  of

failure.   A  major  part  of this  supervision  involves

evaluating  the risk profile of institutions -  both  the

health of their balance sheets as well as the strength of

their  risk management systems and processes. The deposit

insurer  similarly needs to assess the  risk  profile  of

institutions so that it can price the insurance  premiums

appropriately and take supervisory action to minimise the

risk posed by a weak institution to the deposit insurance

fund. If MAS administers the deposit insurance scheme, it

can leverage on its existing supervisory resources, avoid

the duplication of supervisory functions and minimise the

burden on institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another option is to set up a separate organisation

with   its   own  governance  structure.   This  approach

emphasises  the concern that the interests of  a  deposit

insurer and a bank supervisor may not always coincide.  A

deposit  insurer  may want to close  a  weak  bank  early

instead of risking further deterioration in the bank  and

a  larger  loss to the deposit insurance fund.  The  bank

supervisor  may disagree if there is a good  chance  that

the  bank can be returned to health after cleaning up its

balance  sheet  and  improving its management.  But  even

under  this option where the deposit insurer is  separate

from  the  bank  supervisor, the two will still  need  to

consult closely and share information with each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second phase of the study, the MAS will

assess   the   relative  merits  of  the   two   opposing

considerations,   and  study  the  practices   in   other

countries, before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



making  a  firm  proposal on an organisational  structure

most suitable for the Singapore deposit insurance scheme.

The   MAS  will  consult  with  the  industry  and  other

interested parties when the study is completed.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, in the

estimation  of  the Finance Minister, how  much  does  he

envisage  that  these small depositors  need  to  pay  as

premium to be covered under such a scheme?  What  is  the

prevailing market rate in other countries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the details

were  contained in the consultation paper which  we  sent

out recently.  Speaking from memory, our intention is  to

build up a deposit insurance fund which will amount to 30

basis points, which means, 0.3% of the amount of deposits

insured.  But we are not building this up overnight.   We

are  planning to build this up over a period of 10 years,

which  means  a very small levy, 3 basis points  a  year,

over  a period of 10 years.  But the exact levy will vary

depending  on  the state of the bank and the  supervisory

assessment of the bank on how risky it is.  So  the  levy

will vary from bank to bank, but it will be a small levy.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, does MAS have any scheme to

protect  the  deposits of large depositors  and  what  do

these other countries do for their large depositors?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, generally

speaking,  deposit insurance schemes have a  cap.   Their

purpose is to protect small depositors because they  will

find  it  difficult to get enough information  about  the

banks and to make a considered assessment as to which  is

a  safe  bank  to  put their money.  Big  depositors  are

expected  to make their own judgment and decide where  it

is  safe to put their money and not to vest their savings

to  banks which are unsafe.  This is not just a necessary

evil  but  it  is  the way the system  works.   If  every

depositor  can  put money, regardless  of  amounts,  into

banks,  however unsafe and be confident that it  will  be

insured by some deposit insurance scheme, then you have a

moral hazard.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



This  means  that  the depositor does  not  have  to  pay

attention  to whether the bank is safe and  the  bank  is

under  no pressure to perform and to become a sound  bank

in order to attract deposits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, nearly all deposit insurance schemes got

caps.   The  caps vary.  We have set our cap  at  $20,000

which covers 85% of deposits in Singapore.  We think that

is  sufficient.  Some countries have higher caps.   Where

they do, it is sometimes the result of political pressure

rather  than because it is prudentially a sound thing  to

do  or  because  there is a need for it.  In  fact,  Alan

Greenspan, advising against raising the deposit insurance

cap  in the US recently, said, "This is the solution, but

what is the problem?"  But, nevertheless, the problem was

that this was election year and the Bill was passed.   We

are  setting it at $20,000 which we think is the  correct

level.  If you look at Japan, of course, they have no cap

whatsoever, but there banks are in quite an extraordinary

situation.

<div align="center"><b>REBATES IN LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Miss Penny Low</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister  for Finance (a) what is the  rationale  or

objective behind the reversal of the policy on rebates in

the  life  insurance industry; and (b)  in  view  of  the

Financial   Advisers  Act,  how  will  this  affect   the

development  of  a professional group of people  such  as

financial advisers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

prohibition   on  rebates  under  MAS  Notice   304   was

introduced in the 1990s to prevent life insurance  agents

or brokers from rebating, or offering to rebate, any part

of  their  commissions as an "inducement" to  clients  to

purchase   life  insurance  policies,  without  assessing

whether the policies were appropriate for the clients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS discourages the use of rebates by any life

insurance adviser as the basis for his recommendation  to

any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



policyholder.   It  still  discourages  this   with   the

Financial Advisers Act, which requires financial advisers

and  their representatives to have a reasonable basis for

their recommendation. Recommendations are expected to  be

reasonable   and   appropriate,  having  considered   the

investment objectives, financial situation and  financial

needs  of  the  clients.  Financial  advisers  and  their

representatives  should  focus  on  the  value  of  their

services  to their clients and should not resort  to  the

offering of rebates as a basis for their recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life insurance companies have effectively

implemented  the  best  practice recommendations  of  the

Committee  on  Efficient Distribution of  Life  Insurance

(CEDLI),   including  a  Needs-based  sales  process,   a

comprehensive  Training  and Competency  regime  for  its

advisers   and  Enhanced  Disclosure  of  life  insurance

products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has therefore lifted the outright prohibition on

rebates contained in MAS Notice 304. This is in line with

the  Authority's shift from a regulatory to a supervisory

approach.  We  are  progressively replacing  prescriptive

regulations  with  principle-based  regulations,  as  the

market   demonstrates  the  maturity   to   follow   best

practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance companies can decide for themselves how to

package  and market their products without the ban.  This

relaxation should not lower professional standards of the

life  insurance advisers, because unprofessional  conduct

will not be viewed any less seriously under the Financial

Advisers Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I should clarify that the CPF Board has

decided   that  where  rebates  are  given  for  products

purchased  using  CPF  savings,  the  rebates  should  be

refunded to the CPF accounts so that members' savings can

be safeguarded.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, how would

MAS  then  regulate  and monitor the policy  of  what  is

considered an "inducement"?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is one of

those  questions  which is impossible to  answer  in  the

abstract.  We know it when we see it.

Home  Affairs  (a) if he will provide an  update  on  the

fled  Singapore  following the  arrest  of  15  of  their

members  in December; (b) whether those who have  escaped

to  Indonesia  will  be arrested;  and  (c)  whether  the

foreign suicide bombers whom "Sammy" planned to bring  to

Singapore have been identified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, ISD's investigations show that some

Jemaah  Islamiyah  (JI) members fled Singapore  following

the   ISD  arrests  in  December  last  year.   They  are

dispersed  and are believed to be in hiding in  Malaysia,

Indonesia,   Thailand  and  possibly   the   Philippines.

Efforts  are being made to bring them back to  assist  in

investigations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign suicide bombers whom `Sammy' planned to

bring to Singapore are not identified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently finalising a White Paper on

the JI arrests and the threat of terrorism.  More details

bring them back?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> We have discussed this with the

Indonesians  and they understood what we  have  on  them.

But  Indonesian  law apparently does not currently  allow

them to take action.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Are the regional

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> All the security agencies in our

region  are very cooperative.  We have been working  very

closely with them, even before the Jemaah Islamiyah case.

As  a  result  of  information that we  shared  with  the

Malaysians, for example, they have also mounted their own

operation  and found their own group of Jemaah Islamiyah.

As  a  result  of  information that we  shared  with  the

Philippines, they have arrested the Indonesian bomb maker

and  one of the key men of Jemaah Islamiyah.  He had been

arrested by the Filipino authorities early this year.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Would the Minister agree

that  as  long  as these terrorists are  out  there,  our

security is still at risk?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> We are always vulnerable to

threats of this nature and the most manifested symbol  of

terrorist  act  was  seen in New York on  11th  September

2001.   Terrorist threats have always been a risk  to  us

and  we  have always been vigilant.  We have  stepped  up

security measures on our borders and checkpoints  and  at

our  own  key installations and various places,  we  have

also  enhanced  our security measures to  deal  with  the

problem.  At the same time, foreign intelligence agencies

share  information which they have with us  and  we  also

share  with  them.   We have to deal  with  this  problem

together.

<div align="center"><b>ELDERSHIELD SCHEME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Health

(a)  how  many  people have opted out of the  ElderShield

Scheme;  (b)  what measures have been taken  to  dissuade

them  from  opting out; and (c) whether he will  consider

giving  those  without  Central Provident  Fund  accounts

another  chance  to open one so as to  benefit  from  the

Scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  since the implementation of  ElderShield,

the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



Health, together with the two ElderShield insurers - NTUC

Income and Great Eastern - have been actively publicising

the  scheme  through  the various  mass  media  and  have

conducted  numerous grassroots briefings.    Through  the

publicity efforts, we hope to create awareness  and  help

Singaporeans understand the benefits of ElderShield.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, 21% of Singaporeans aged 40 to 69 who are

eligible  for  auto-cover have opted out of  ElderShield.

Some  of  them  may already have adequate  coverage  from

private insurance plans, while others in the lower income

group  may  feel that they may not be able to afford  the

premiums.   For  those  in  the  low  income  group,  the

Government   will  continue  to  help  them  meet   their

healthcare  expenses  through  other  avenues,  such   as

Medifund and subsidies at the nursing homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent weeks, 1,780 Singaporeans who opted out have

changed  their mind and opted back in again.  For  others

who wish to do so, both ElderShield insurers have devised

a  simple process for these people to withdraw their Opt-out  Forms,  and still accord them auto-cover  status  so

long  as  they inform the insurers of their new decisions

before 30th September this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the time limit of 15th August 2002 to open a CPF

account   so   as   to   qualify  for  auto-cover   under

ElderShield, I believe Singaporeans have been given ample

time  to do so since the publicity on ElderShield started

in  end  June  2002.   As at 15th August  2002,  only  11

Singaporeans  in  the age group of 40  to  69  have  come

forward to open an account.  There was therefore no  need

to  extend the deadline beyond 15th August 2002.  The key

priority  now  is  to ensure that Singaporeans  who  have

received  the  auto-cover  understand  the  benefits   of

ElderShield  and  make an informed  choice  to  join  the

scheme.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  whether the fact that about 270,000  people  or

about  23%  of  those eligible have rejected  ElderShield

means that this scheme may not have been well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



designed, therefore requiring further review urgently?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are quite

realistic.    The  scheme  cannot  meet  the   needs   of

everybody.  We try to start off with a basic scheme,  and

it  is quite understandable that a certain percentage  of

Singaporeans may assess that this scheme does  not  quite

meet  their needs.  For example, those in the high income

groups  may feel that $300 pay-out is too low  for  them,

and they will find their own means to seek other covers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the low income groups, as I said earlier, the

Government will continue to look after them if they  meet

the means test through our step-down care facilities.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, the name

"ElderShield" is actually very misleading because,  as  I

see,  it  is  actually  a disability  scheme.   Will  the

Ministry  consider changing the name, so as  to  be  more

reflective of the objective and purpose of the scheme?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, severe disability insurance

comes  under different terms.  In the private sector,  it

is  called long-term care insurance.  In other countries,

it  is  called severe disability insurance.  In our case,

we  coin the word "ElderShield" so that it is easier  for

people  to  identify  the  scheme.   Essentially,  severe

disability  sets in primarily  when a person is  elderly.

So it is meant primarily for the elderly people.  But, of

course, severe disability can set in any time.  A  person

can  have  a stroke when he is 45, and he will  still  be

covered.   But  I  think we want to reflect  the  primary

purpose of this scheme, which is for the elderly.  Hence,

we call it ElderShield.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether it

is  correct  to say that the insured can only claim  $300

per  month  should  he  or she  be  unable  to  do  three

activities of daily living of washing, dressing, feeding,

toileting, mobility and transferring?  Even with the  aid

of  special  equipment and always requiring the  physical

assistance  of  another  person  throughout  the   entire

activity, may I ask the Minister how would the $300  help

such a person, as employing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



a maid would probably cost twice that amount with levy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I said, we have to make

sensible  trade-offs in designing this scheme.  We  start

off  with a very basic scheme of $300, so as to keep  the

premiums as affordable as possible.  If we raise the pay-out  to $600, then the premiums will be double, and  even

more Singaporeans will opt out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of introducing this scheme, we want a

simple scheme and as affordable as possible.  And  as  we

gain  more experience, we will allow the insurers to have

top-ups to the scheme.  So it is quite conceivable that 3-5  years  from now, the insurers will offer  higher  pay-outs,  and  correspondingly  higher  premiums.   But  the

primary objective in launching this scheme is to  get  as

many  Singaporeans sign up as possible.   So  we  want  a

basic scheme with low premiums.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether it

is  correct to say that the majority of Singaporeans take

up  insurance  for peace of mind and for any eventuality?

Therefore,  if  ElderShield does not  adequately  address

this  basic issue, then it is deficient.  The purpose  of

this  national insurance scheme as ElderShield  can  only

lessen  the  load  of the people and not  help  in  their

needs.   Therefore, the rich, as the Minister  has  said,

probably do not need this scheme, and those who are  poor

and  the ones that are most in need will find this scheme

inadequate to ease their difficulty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, that is not true, because if

you are from the low income group and you are admitted to

a  nursing home and you meet the means test, the  nursing

home  will probably  charge about $1,000 per month.   The

Government  will subsidise 75%, which is $750,  and  your

pay-out  is $250.  So I think the $300 goes some  way  in

meeting  the expenses.  We are not saying that  the  $300

will  pay  for  everything  that  you  need  if  you  are

disabled.   We want to keep the scheme as simple  and  as

affordable  as possible.  We set it at $300 because  that

makes  some sense in relation to somebody who is  in  the

low income and will enjoy subsidies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



from the Government if he is admitted to a nursing home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, if people think that this scheme does not

quite meet their needs, they can opt out.  And five years

later  when the insurers offer a higher pay-out of $1,000

and if they think that it meets their needs, they can opt

in  again.  But at that time when they opt in, they  will

have to pass a medical test.  It will not be auto cover.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister just mentioned top-up

or  enhanced scheme.  May I ask the Minister whether  the

enhanced  scheme  will  be  accompanied  by  a  hike   in

premiums?  Will Singaporeans feel the burden if  premiums

rose?   And will people feel short-changed having to  pay

more  and more for ElderShield coverage after some  time,

despite   paying  for  many  years,  as  the  ElderShield

premiums  will  only remain unchanged for the  next  five

years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> ElderShield is a scheme based on

actuarial calculations.  So, the more people we have, the

bigger  the  risk pool.  Then, of course, those  who  are

lower risk will subsidise those who are higher risk.  The

idea  is  to  go  out with at least a  minimum  cover  of

250,000  people.  That is what the actuarial  consultants

tell  us  is  needed as the minimum risk pool.   Anything

beyond  250,000 participants, we have a sound  basis  for

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put in the contract with the insurers

certain safeguards.  As I said, we start off with a  very

simple  scheme  -  $300 pay-out and we keep the  premiums

as affordable as possible.  We understand that this is  a

very new scheme.  The insurers do not have very much data

to  go  by.   They use our own data.  We  have  done  two

longitudinal  studies.   We  have  taken  the   data   of

developed  countries.   Here, you  are  calculating  your

obligations  for the next 40-50 years.   Because  if  you

take  somebody in at age 40, he may live till 85-90.   So

you  are going to do all these actuarial calculations  to

calculate your obligations 40-50 years down the road.   I

think  the  consultants and the actuaries have been  very

conservative.   And  that  is  the  reason  why  in   the

contract, we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



built  in  provisions that if the claim history  is  less

than  what they projected, then they will offer a  rebate

to  the  holders.  If the claim history turns out  to  be

higher  than  the  projection, then, of course,  we  will

allow them to raise the premium.  Because this scheme  is

actuarial based and it must be self funding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the basis of the insurance is that you

are paying a premium and the pay out ratio is between 1:4

or  1:5.  And if Singaporeans want peace of mind and they

are  prepared  to  set aside this small  sum  from  their

Medisave, then they participate.  If they think they  can

look after themselves, then they opt out.  The choice  is

theirs.   What  we try to do is to provide this  facility

which  is open to Singaporeans and encourage as  many  as

possible to join in.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he

agrees that a person who is unable to do three activities

of  daily living is unlikely to get better and, in  fact,

most  likely to get worse with time?   Therefore,  is  it

not  inhumane to cut off payment after five  years?   The

Minister  will  probably reply that the majority  of  the

disabled will not need aid for more than five years.   My

question to the Minister is: what about those who survive

more than five years, by which time their financial needs

will even become more critical?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I said, we are starting a

very  new scheme.  When we call the tender, we could have

said $300 and pay out until death, in which case there is

no  prescribed cap. Or we could call the tender  and  say

$300  up to a maximum of 60 months.  Then there is a cap.

And  the  insurers will tender accordingly.   We  decided

that, as a start, we put a cap so that the insurers  have

as  much certainty as possible to bid for the tender.  If

we  have put $300 and pay out until the person dies, then

there is additional uncertainty and the risk is that  the

insurer  may tender at a higher price or ask  for  higher

premiums to cover the risk.  So we want to start off with

a scheme which is as simple as possible.  And as we build

up experience and knowledge, then we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



have  enhancements.  It is also conceivable  that  as  we

develop our claims history  we can allow the claims to go

beyond  five years.  Then the insurers will  be  able  to

calculate  and say what additional premium you will  have

to  pay  to  have  that enhancement.  So we  are  keeping

things as simple as possible in the start-up, and then we

can have enhancements as we develop experience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, since the

insurance  scheme is tendered out to insurance  companies

which  are  private  companies,  how  much  say  has  the

Government   in  the  modification  of  the   terms   and

conditions of the insurance scheme?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, we will have some say in the

key  parameters  in  the contract, eg,  we  ask  them  to

stipulate  the expected claim calculations on which  they

based  their tender, so that sets the baseline.   And  if

the  claim  history  is higher than that,  then  we  have

certain  provisions.  If the claim history is  less  than

that,  we  also have certain provisions.  The  provisions

are  in  the premium adjustments, whether we get a rebate

or  whether we have an increase.  In the contract itself,

the  Government, meaning the Ministry of Health and  MAS,

gave  ourselves  certain parameters that we  can  change,

depending on how the claim history works out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, will the Minister tell us

what   are  the  parameters?   And  in  terms  of  rebate

adjustment  in  the  future based on the  claim  pattern,

actual  claim data or whatever is in the terms,  will  he

tell  us what is the maximum adjustment allowed in  terms

of  increase  in  premium and how much  rebate  could  be

expected?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, at the end of five years, we

will  allow the insurers to have an increase if the claim

history turns out to be worse than they expected, but the

increase will not be more than 20%.  At the same time, if

the  claim history turns out to be more benign than  they

expected, we will look at the claim history and  we  will

ask  them to rebate 50% back to the holders.  NTUC Income

has come out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



publicly to say that if the claim history is more benign,

in  fact, they will look towards giving back higher  than

50% rebate.  But the contract calls for a 50% rebate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Dr Neo. I will allow one last

supplementary  question because we  have  so  many  other

Questions to deal with.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since we are

discussing  an  important national issue  involving  many

Singaporeans, in fact 1.2 million people,  could  I  seek

your indulgence to allow at least two more questions  and

one more clarification, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> One more question. You can always come

up  with  a  motion, if you want to.  One  more  question

after this.  We have more than 20 other Questions to deal

with, Dr Neo.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Okay. I am just trying to figure out

which  questions  that I want to ask.   Could  I  seek  a

clarification after my question to the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We will wait till it comes up. Dr Neo,

ask your question first.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you. Could I ask the Minister

whether  it is correct to say that the specified  medical

assessors  appointed by the insurers have to  place  very

strict  criteria on the other cases and all policyholders

of ElderShield claims during their physical examinations?

Is  this not unfavourable to policyholders and working to

the  advantage of the insurers?  May I ask  the  Minister

what kind of percentage out of the present 8% of severely

disabled people that can qualify for these claims?  Based

on the strict criteria by the medical assessors, I should

think  that  this percentage must be very  small  indeed.

Therefore, is this not a very profitable scheme  for  the

insurers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister whether the criteria set

for  ElderShield  claims on the aid of special  equipment

will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



increasingly   disadvantageous   to   policyholders    as

technology   becomes  progressively  more  advanced   and

efficient?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister on the repeated

publications  by the Ministry of Health and the  insurers

citing that based on the British experience, men have 35%

risk,  and women 45% of being disabled some time in their

lives.  May I ask the Minister whether we should be  more

explicit  and less misleading by adding that the majority

of  this  disability will be either temporary or mild  to

moderately  severe; therefore, they will not be  eligible

for  ElderShield  claims.  But, more  importantly,  on  a

bigger  picture, should the Ministry of Health and people

not  be  alarmed by such possible high disability figure;

therefore, more proactive actions on preventive  measures

should  be  embarked on urgently to prevent getting  such

incidents?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all insurance

claims need to go through an assessment process.  For the

ElderShield, we have set up a group of assessors who  are

GPs  to make this assessment.  If the policyholder is not

happy with the assessment done by the assessors, there is

a  channel  for appeal to the Ministry.  But it  is  very

early  days.   The  scheme will not kick  in  until  30th

September.   The assessors are not out yet.  So,  let  us

wait  and  see what the claim histories are like.   Right

now,  we still do not have enough cases to determine  one

way  or  the other whether the assessors have been overly

strict or overly lenient.  I think we need at least  two,

three,  maybe  five, years to build up  some  kind  of  a

pattern.  At the end of that period, we will do a review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, Singaporeans must look at the scheme and

determine  for themselves whether the scheme meets  their

requirements or not.  And if they do not, they  opt  out.

If they do, they stay in.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I disagree with the

Minister because the medical assessors have already  done

physical examinations on many IDAPE cases, and they  were

really  strict  on  these  cases.   May  I  seek  a  last

clarification from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



Minister?   On the report in the Straits Times  published

on 7th August, it was stated that the Minister for Health

said  that he felt like a koyok seller when he chaired  a

press  conference  on ElderShield.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  my

understanding of a koyok seller, and I am  sure  of  many

others, is a medicine man selling products that are  less

worthy  and  often  fake  medicines  that  do  not  work!

Therefore,  could the Minister explain what he  meant  by

referring  himself  as  a koyok  seller  with  regard  to

ElderShield?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

explaining ElderShield based on its merits for many, many

months, if not years.  And we have to clarify and clarify

and sell it so many times that I feel like I am selling a

koyok.   Why don't we just look at the merits and  decide

for ourselves whether we are in or out?

<div align="center"><b>SAFETY MECHANISM AGAINST MAJOR BLACKOUT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Warren Lee</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry,  in  view  of  the  recent  major  blackout  in

Singapore   resulting  from  the  sudden  and  accidental

reduction  in  gas supply to our power stations,  whether

any  safety  mechanism exists to protect  Singapore  from

suffering a repeat of such incident.



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Sir, a disruption in the natural gas supply

from  West Natuna, Indonesia led to the tripping of seven

gas  fired  generation plants at 10.00 am on  5th  August

2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 1,550 MW of generation capacity was suddenly

lost  from  the system which was drawing about 4,650  MW.

Load  amounting to 380 MW had to be shed to bring  demand

down  to  a  level that will not overload  the  remaining

generation capacity still operating in the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity supply was fully restored by 11.28 am.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What caused the natural gas supply disruption?

Natural  gas from West Natuna is conveyed by  a  pipeline

that  terminates  at Conoco's Onshore Receiving  Facility

(ORF) in Sakra on Jurong Island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a routine maintenance carried out by Conoco

at  the  ORF,  an  emergency  shutdown  (ESD)  valve  was

automatically activated.  This disrupted the natural  gas

supply  to  SembCorp  Gas  and its  gas  customers.   The

activation  of  the  emergency  valve  is  part  of   the

protection design to prevent unsafe conditions in the gas

network such as over-pressure.  Conoco has reported  that

a  false  alarm  from  one of the monitoring  instruments

activated the emergency valve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas-fired plants, although designed to also run

on  diesel, could not switch over from gas to  diesel  in

time  as  gas  pressure was lost very rapidly.   Instead,

four standby diesel-fired turbine generators were pressed

into  service.  It took about half an hour to  bring  all

these  units  into  operation from a  cold  start.   This

stabilised the system, and thereafter electricity  supply

was restored to the affected areas progressively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the emergency shutdown valve was accidentally

tripped, Conoco has stopped all non-essential maintenance

work at the ORF until investigations are completed.  They

have  also  changed  the computer  logic  by  temporarily

disabling  tripping by this instrument in  the  automated

safety system.  Any tripping will be done manually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Task Force comprising members from the industry

and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has been set up  to

identify all likely factors that could activate  the  ESD

valve  and  cause  gas disruption.  The Task  Force  will

review   operating  procedures  and  identify  additional

preventive measures to be taken to minimise, if not avoid

altogether, future disruptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Task Force will take a month to complete its

review.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMA is separately studying with the power companies

if  it is possible for the gas-fired generation plants to

switch  quickly  over  to diesel before  the  gas  supply

depletes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The likelihood of such sudden supply disruptions

will  be  reduced  when  we have more  sources  of  piped

natural  gas.   As  Members know, we  will  have  another

pipeline carrying gas from Sumatra next year.  We  intend

to   connect   these  separate  pipelines  and   networks

together.   Interconnection will enable us  to  have  gas

from  one  source  backing up supply from  another,  thus

giving  our system greater resilience.  This can be  done

within five years.  In the longer term, liquefied natural

gas  could be yet another fuel source.  Presently, we use

piped  natural gas which cannot be stored.  If we  decide

to  use  LNG  as well, we will have a store  of  gas  for

emergency purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public was understandably concerned that a

disruption in gas supply could have caused such blackouts

over parts of Singapore.  We are not taking this incident

lightly.  It will be thoroughly investigated, and lessons

will  be  learnt.  The EMA and the power  companies  will

spare  no  efforts in making our electricity system  more

resilient against fuel supply disruptions even as we move

towards greater use of natural gas in the future.

<div align="center"><b>SENIORITY-BASED WAGE SYSTEM</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

(a) what efforts have been made by his Ministry since the

mid  1980s  to move Singapore away from a seniority-based

wage  system; and (b) what strategies and specific  plans

his  Ministry  has in the coming years to move  Singapore

away from such a system.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the 1986 Economic Committee identified  the

seniority-based wage system as one of the  weaknesses  in

our  labour market.  This system rewards workers more  on

the  basis of their seniority in service and less on  the

value of the job.  Subsequently a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



tripartite  committee  under the National  Wages  Council

studied  ways  to make our wage system more flexible  and

linked to the value of the job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council Tripartite Committee on

Wage  Reform recommended that a flexible wage system with

a variable component be implemented.  It also recommended

that  wages should reflect the value of the job and  that

salary  ranges  should  not be too  wide.   A  reasonable

maximum to minimum salary ratio could be 1.5: 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the implementation of the above

recommendations, we have made progress.  Today more  than

80%  of the companies have implemented the flexible  wage

system  with  a year-end variable component and  the  one

month  Annual Wage Supplement or otherwise known  as  the

13th  month pay, amounting to about 15% to 16%  of  total

wages.   The  variable  component  enables  companies  to

reward   workers   based   on  company   and   individual

performance.   On  the seniority-based  wage  system  the

ratio  between the maximum and minimum salary points  for

many  jobs has been brought down from more than 2.5 times

to between 1.5 and 2 times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While progress has been made in building up the

variable  component, which is often paid at  the  end  of

each  year, our wage system is still not flexible  enough

to  respond  to the rapidly changing business conditions.

Hence,  in  1999  the National Wages Council  recommended

that  a  monthly  variable  component  be  introduced  to

enhance the flexibility of our wage system.  With  regard

to  the seniority-based wage system, more efforts have to

be  made to further narrow the maximum to minimum  salary

ratio  and  to  actively promote a system  which  rewards

workers  based  on  the  value  of  the  job  and   their

contribution.  This will enhance the cost-competitiveness

and employability of older workers who face a higher risk

of losing their job and greater difficulty of seeking re-employment due to our seniority wage system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Economic Review Committee Sub-committee on Taxation, CPF, Wages and Land has been

tasked  to review the wage system in Singapore. The  Sub-committee's   initial  recommendation   to   reduce   CPF

contribution by employer for employees aged 50 to 55  has

already  been  accepted  by the Government.   Apart  from

this,  the  NWC will continue to encourage companies  and

unions  to  accelerate the building  up  of  the  monthly

variable  component and to further evolve a  wage  system

based on the value of the job as well as the productivity

and performance of individual employee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Clarification,

Sir.  Obviously, as the Minister has said, the system  is

not  there  yet.  But at what point, in terms  of  salary

scales  and  variable components, will the Minister  feel

that we would have arrived at a stage where we are not on

a  seniority-wage based system, so that we no longer have

to  be  anxious in future about other ways of approaching

it, such as further CPF cuts for the older age group?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

situation  is dynamic and it is constantly evolving.   In

the  mid-80s,  as  I  mentioned in  my  main  reply,  the

Tripartite  Committee  considered that  if  the  variable

component comprised something like 18-20%, we would  have

more  or less achieved significant progress and we  would

have  succeeded to make our wage system flexible  enough.

We  are  almost  there.  As I said, 80% of our  companies

have  adopted  the  variable wage system.   The  variable

component  is  around 16-18%.  But in recent  years,  the

pace  of  change has been so fast.  Competition has  been

heating  up  so  rapidly.   We may  not  be  sufficiently

flexible with what we have achieved so far.  So  we  have

to push the envelope up a little bit more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to determine, at this point in

time, what percentage of the wages should be variable for

us  to be truly flexible, adaptable and responsive to the

market changes.  I think that can only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



be  determined in the actual labour or employment  market

situation and also in the context of economic performance

of  the  day.   It  is  rather difficult  to  predict  in

advance.   But  what we want is to evolve a  system,  for

instance, the monthly variable component, where  you  set

aside  10%,  or  maybe 12% of your  monthly  wages  as  a

variable component which companies may be able to adjust,

if  there  is a sudden downturn in demand, or  businesses

drop  sharply.   The  company  can  then  use  this  MVC,

comprising  about 10% of the monthly wages,  to  make  an

adjustment  which  helps  the  company  to  weather   the

downturn  and  also reduce the burden on the  company  so

that  they  do not have to instantly resort to redundancy

or retrenching workers.  These are just ballpark targets.

But  whether  10% is enough will have to  depend  on  the

state of the economy and the kind of competitive pressure

that  we  have to face.  It may well be that the  10%  is

sufficient.   But  it may also be that, as  the  scenario

unfolds,  we may need to build up more of our wages  into

the  monthly variable component.  So let us take an open-minded approach to this.  Let us continue to progress  on

our development of a flexible wage system and then assess

our  competitiveness  and ability  to  resist  all  these

sudden changes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> There are two parts to this. One

is the flexible system that allows companies to cut costs

down  quickly.   The  other is the  seniority-based  wage

system, and my focus is actually on seniority-based  wage

system.  I would just like to clarify if my understanding

is  correct.  What we are talking about here, in terms of

monthly variable component, is actually a variable system

but  within  a  seniority-based wage  system.   In  other

words,  the  older workers are still getting more,  which

means  that  this  particular emphasis on  MVC  will  not

actually address the seniority-based wage system.   Would

that be the correct understanding?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> With regard to the seniority-based wage system, as I said earlier on, we started out

in  the mid-80s with a maximum to minimum ratio of 2.5 to

as  high  as 3.3.  Over the years, this has been  trimmed

down.  Today, we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



around  2 to 1.5.  I think maybe 1.5 is about reasonable,

that means, between the starting point and the last point

in  the salary scale, it is a difference of 1.5.  That is

what the NWC Tripartite Committee recommended in the mid-80s to be a reasonable maximum to minimum ratio.  We have

not  quite arrived at it.  Some companies have, but there

are still many other companies operating at a ratio of 2.

So   they  will  have  to  individually  start  to   make

adjustment  to  try  to  bring this seniority-based  wage

scale  to  the figure of about 1.5:1.  And if we  get  to

1.5:1, we should have a more manageable system.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> If I may again ask the Minister:

is  he  actually saying that when we reach 1.5,  then  in

fact  we  can  be quite comfortable that  there  will  no

longer  be  any  need to have differential  treatment  of

older workers versus younger workers. The other point  is

in  fact how much longer will it take us to get that 1.5,

if  we  have a real confidence level that this will  take

care  of  the  problem.  And I am asking this  because  I

think  they are all anxious that in the future we do  not

have to resort to CPF cuts for older workers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, 1.5

was  set as a target by the NWC in the mid-80s.  We  have

not  quite  reached  this target.   When  we  reach  this

target,  we  will  have to assess whether,  in  fact,  as

expected  by NWC in making the recommendation, 1.5  would

be  a  reasonable  figure.   Of course,  the  competitive

environment changes all the time, the nature of jobs  and

competition  in  the employment market  changes  all  the

time.   So we cannot tie ourselves down to say that  this

shall  be the ratio forever and ever.  We have to realise

that   the  labour  market  is  in  a  state  of  dynamic

equilibrium.  It changes all the time, depending  on  who

are  our  competitors, what is the business that  we  are

doing  in  Singapore,  what kind of value-added  that  we

bring to the companies and to the economy as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should take this, as I said earlier on,

with  an  open-minded progressive approach.  If we  reach

1.5, if we are able to sustain employment of all our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



older workers, then 1.5 is a good target.  But even if at

1.5, we find that older workers are continually suffering

a  disadvantage,  in  the sense that  they  have  greater

difficulty retaining their jobs, they are retrenched,  or

they  have even greater difficulty seeking re-employment,

then we have to address this issue whether in fact 1.5 is

reasonable, or in fact it should be even less than that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> I would like to ask the Minister

how  we  can have comfort in knowing where we are  going.

Just trying to determine that we do not see a repetition,

how  would  we know that we are actually making progress?

Because  it  would be a sad situation 10 years  down  the

road  to be looking at the same picture again.  How would

the  Minister be able to give comfort, if all that we can

say  is simply we do not really know what we are shooting

for?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the hon.

Member  will take comfort from the fact that we have  not

rushed  into this matter of making adjustment  to  salary

scales,  nor have we done in a reckless manner.  We  took

careful  consideration in the mid-80s with the Tripartite

Committee  and we have been promoting this concept  of  a

flexible wage scheme and shrinking the difference between

the maximum and minimum ratio in our seniority-based wage

scale  progressively and carefully.  So  it  is  not  the

intention  of  the Government to force changes  upon  the

people  unnecessarily.   And if, in fact, as I said,  the

economic situation takes a turn for the worse and we  are

seeing  a  dramatic  increase in unemployment  among  the

older workers, then it would be foolish of us to say that

we  had  adopted a certain target years ago, this  target

should remain in place and we should not make any further

changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we wish to impose changes on our

workers  unnecessarily.  But changes are forced upon  us.

Many  of  these changes are beyond our control.   We  are

competing in a global market.  And if, in fact,  we  have

to  make adjustments to our salary structures, we have to

do it, just as in 1999, we had to adjust our CPF.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



So  these  are drawn upon us by external factors  and  we

must  be  prepared to respond and adapt to these changes.

If  we  blindly stick to the target and refuse to change,

we  are  going  to  put  ourselves in  a  very  difficult

position.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I would just like to ask

the  Minister  to confirm whether there  was  actually  a

tripartite  agreement which provides  for  this  minimum-maximum  ratio  of 1.5 to be reached over two  collective

agreements,  and  that  if unions  and  management  could

agree, they could of course take a shorter period, and if

they cannot, they could take a longer period.  Could  the

Minister confirm whether there is such an agreement?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Tripartite Committee in 1986 made this recommendation  to

reduce  the salary range, it did suggest that unions  try

to achieve this maximum to minimum ratio within a certain

timeframe.   I  cannot  remember  exactly  what  was  the

timeframe.  The hon. Member may be correct in saying that

it  was  over  two collective agreements  which,  in  our

context,  would mean about six years maximum,  because  a

collective  agreement runs for up to a maximum  of  three

years.    I   think   many  unions  have   pursued   this

recommendation.  That is why we have seen  a  significant

improvement in this salary ratio, and we have  come  down

from  2.5 to 3.3, down to 1.5 to 2.  So improvements will

be   continuing   in  this  fashion  as  the   collective

agreements are renewed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> May I ask whether the civil

service timescales are, in fact, now at 1.5?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have

the  civil service timescale figures with me.  So I would

not be able to comment on that directly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Would the Minister give us the

assurance that at least the civil service would take  the

lead  in  this regard, and if they are not at  1.5,  that

would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



the direction in which the civil service would be moving?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Yes, Sir, the civil service has

been taking the lead in this matter, in terms of having a

flexible  wage  system and also reducing the  maximum  to

minimum  salary ratio.  The civil service, in  fact,  has

been  one of the earliest to implement a monthly variable

component.   And  it  has  also  introduced  the   annual

variable  component  and  mid-year  bonuses.   All  these

components  of  a variable and flexible  wage  system,  a

performance-based  wage system, has been  spearheaded  by

the  civil  service.  I believe the civil  service  would

continue with the approach to achieve a more flexible and

realistic wage system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Let me first declare unequivocally

to  this House that the Government deplores ill-treatment

of  foreign domestic workers.  We have and will  continue

to  deal  with  abusive employers  firmly.   My  Ministry

reiterates  its  call  for employers  to  treat   foreign

workers  with  dignity  and respect.   Indeed,  the  vast

majority  of  foreign domestic workers in  Singapore  are

well  treated  and  have found work in  Singapore  to  be

rewarding.  Regrettably, there remains a very small group

of  employers who treat their foreign workers shamefully.

To this group, let me remind them that we are resolute in

punishing  errant  employers  who  abuse  their   foreign

domestic  workers.  As a strong deterrent against  abuse,

the  Penal  Code was amended in 1998 to enhance penalties

committed  against a domestic worker by one  and  a  half

times.   Since  then,  the  number  of  abuse  cases  has

declined  significantly.  According to  the  Police,  the

number of substantiated abuse cases has dropped from  157

cases  in  1997 to 41 cases in 2001 and 8 cases  up  till

June  this  year.   This  shows  that  firm  action   and

deterrent  penalties are effective measures against  such

abuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now respond to Ms Irene Ng and Mr Chiam See

Tong's  queries more specifically.  My Ministry  had,  in

May, this year announced a mandatory accreditation scheme

for  employment  agencies dealing with  foreign  domestic

workers to help upgrade their professional standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accredited employment agents who put in greater

effort  to  recruit, train and prepare  foreign  domestic

workers  for work in Singapore households will  ensure  a

better  match  between the employer and foreign  domestic

worker.  This will foster a more healthy employer-foreign

domestic  worker relationship and  reduce  the  potential

for conflict, complaints and abuses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion to make it compulsory for doctors

to  ascertain  if  a  foreign domestic  worker  has  been

physically abused, the Member of Parliament may  wish  to

know  that  under  the Criminal Procedure  Code,  anyone,

including the doctor who is aware of physical abuse,  has

a  legal  obligation to report the matter to the  Police.

The  Ministry  of  Health and my Ministry  are  currently

working  on  a  set of guidelines to help doctors  better

identify cases of physical abuse.  Doctors will  also  be

reminded to report cases of abuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it would be prudent to focus more on

preventing   abuse   of    foreign   domestic    workers.

Accordingly,  we  will  require first-time  employers  of

foreign   domestic   workers  to  undergo   a   mandatory

orientation  programme.  This measure  will  enhance  the

Ministry's  ongoing educational efforts to  promote  good

employment  practices,  harmonious working  relationships

and  mutual respect.  The orientation programme will also

highlight to employers the severe consequences they  face

if they abuse their foreign domestic workers.  Details of

the  orientation  programme  will  be  announced  in  due

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present debate on maid abuse has also led to

calls  for the Government to impose minimum standards  of

employment,  as  suggested by  Mdm  Halimah,  to  protect

foreign  domestic workers.  Unlike other workers, foreign

domestic workers work and stay in their employer's  house

throughout  the  day.   The nature of  work,  the  duties

performed and the standard of performance also vary  from

household  to household.  It is, therefore, not practical

to  lay down in law standard rules regarding the specific

employment conditions for foreign domestic workers.   For

example, it is difficult to determine the actual hours of

work  for  foreign  domestic workers since  they  perform

active work interspersed with some free time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having prescribed rules would make it difficult for

employers  and  foreign domestic workers to  comply,  and

also for the authorities to enforce them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the difficulty of defining standard

conditions   of  employment,  my  Ministry   has   always

encouraged employers and their domestic workers  to  work

out  defined terms, based on mutual agreement and on  the

specific   needs  of  the  two  parties,  to  avoid   any

misunderstanding.   Many foreign  domestic  workers  have

signed  written contracts with their employers  with  the

help  of  their employment agents and, in some instances,

with  the  help  of their Embassies.  I  agree  with  Mdm

Halimah that this practice should be further encouraged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard the welfare of foreign workers, my

Ministry  has  set up a Foreign Workers Unit  to  provide

free  conciliation services for those who encounter work-related  problems with their employers.  The  Unit  works

closely   with  the  Embassies  of  the  foreign  workers

concerned,  and has been able to resolve practically  all

disputes amicably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to remind employers of foreign

domestic workers that they are ultimately responsible for

the  welfare of the foreign domestic worker.   It  is  an

employer's  duty to take good care of the  workers  under

their  employ.   The penalties for abusing these  workers

are severe.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Minister of State  talked  generally

about  physical abuse of domestic maids.   My  work  with

victims of domestic violence suggests that, often  times,

other  forms of abuse are precursors to physical violence

or abuse.  In order to prevent physical abuse of domestic

maids,  what  are the measures that have  been  taken  to

detect  other  forms  of  abuse  that  may  happen  in  a

household, rather than wait until physical abuse actually

takes place?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> The Ministry's approach is two-pronged. One is specific, the other general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, we would like to allow the maids to

have  avenues  for  complaint.   That  is  why  we  issue

advisories.  They are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



written  in  about  17  languages,  because  our  foreign

domestic workers come from 17 language-based regions.  We

also  give  hotline numbers so that they have avenues  or

recourse to reporting such abuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, and more general approach, is to raise

the  threshold of reasonableness for employers.  This  is

more difficult, because we have more than 140,000 foreign

domestic  workers  and,  therefore,  more  than   140,000

employers and their household members.  The threshold for

reasonableness  and, therefore, the potential  for  other

forms  of abuse can vary from household to household.   A

household  may  declare  it does not  quite  consider  it

abuse, but it may indeed be abuse.  How do we raise  this

threshold of reasonableness?   One, as we said,  is  that

we  encourage written contracts to stipulate mutual terms

of   employment.   The  other,  which  I   have   already

mentioned, is the maid accreditation scheme.   There  are

currently  about 800 employment agencies that  deal  with

placement of foreign domestic workers.  We would like  to

raise this level so that the employment agencies can help

better train and orientate these foreign domestic workers

before they join the households.  The other aspect is the

mandatory  orientation  programmes  which  I  have   also

mentioned, where both the employer and employee come  for

a course and we can explain the terms and conditions, and

what  to  expect from one another.  This will  raise  the

general  level of threshold to what would  be  a  healthy

relationship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, the majority of foreign domestic

workers who work in Singapore, do find it rewarding.  The

number  of abuses has come down, but we will continue  to

add on to the efforts that have been successful.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my

understanding that maid agencies themselves are sometimes

guilty of abuse of maids.  I wonder how the accreditation

system will be able to weed out such maid agencies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member

knows  of  any  specific instances  where  an  employment

agency has abused a maid, please let us know and we  will

take the employment agency to task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we ensure that the maid accreditation system

weeds out employment agencies which are not performing up

to  par?   As  I  said, accreditation is not  a  specific

programme  but more a general one.  We think that  if  we

raise  the  level  of performance of the maid  employment

agencies and have minimum standards and programmes  which

will  raise their level of professionalism, a  number  of

leaders  will  emerge who will give  value-add  to  those

employers who want foreign domestic workers and who  will

also   be  more  responsible  for  the  foreign  domestic

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the answer is that it does not quite prevent

specific abuses.  If there are specific abuses,  we  will

deal  with  them legally.  If we wait until they  happen,

then it is really too late.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand,

from  what  the Minister of State says, that  it  is  not

possible  to  describe all the terms and conditions,  one

example  being working hours.  But I still  think  it  is

possible to consider prescribing some minimum terms,  eg,

number  of  rest  hours a day, rest days a  week,  annual

leave, sick leave, etc.  Will the Minister consider that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the question of inspectors, is it

possible   for   the  Ministry  to  consider   appointing

inspectors to do random checks?  I understand it  is  not

possible.  If there are 140,000 maids, there are probably

140,000 households but, at least, the random checks  done

on  such  households will act as a deterrent to employers

who  employ  maids to behave in a humane and fair  manner

towards their maids.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mdm Halimah has touched on a number

of points.  We need to deal with them separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, encouraging employers and their maids to have

prescribed  working conditions, and I  have  said  we  do

encourage it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



Two, trying to craft it in legislation.  This is an issue

of enforcement.  Even if we had these minimum conditions,

can  we  enforce  them?  She therefore suggests  that  we

employ inspectors.  There is a balance to this.  How much

do  we  want to intrude into households versus protecting

the maids?  We have moved somewhat along those lines,  in

terms   of   the  accreditation  scheme  for   employment

agencies, where we require them to check on the maids who

are  placed  with the employers twice within  six  months

from commencement of work.  So, that is moving somewhere.

To  have  a full force of inspectors going from house  to

house  periodically  asking  how  the  maids  have   been

treated,  how they are, and seeing whether the  terms  of

the  employment conditions have been met,  is  a  radical

jump.  I am not sure whether that is the way to move.  It

is  an intrusion.  We do not think that the situation  of

maid  abuse quite warrants that drastic measure  because,

as  I have mentioned, eight cases were reported and there

has  been a drop.  So, our measures seem to have  worked.

We  will move on the more encouraging measures before  we

move more into enforcement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I am glad to

hear  that the Government is introducing this orientation

programme  for maids.  I am certain that this will  be  a

very useful programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that some of the maids employed in our

households   are  rather  young.   Will  the   Government

consider  a  minimum  age  below  which  they  cannot  be

employed?   As  regards training, I understand  that  the

training  given  by the agencies to the  maids  comprises

only  one day.  I am certain that it is not enough.  Will

the  Minister  consider asking the agencies  to  probably

double the period of training?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I need to check on Mr Chiam's point

on  minimum age.  I think it exists, but I am not sure at

what point it is prescribed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of training, the hon. Member is quite right

that  we need a holistic solution.  I do not want  to  be

prescriptive  and say it has to be 'x' number  of  hours.

What we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



do  want is a minimum standard to be achieved.  The  only

way  we  can  do  that is, one, to have an  accreditation

system   first;  two,  a  training  facility;  three,   a

prescribed   programme;  and,  four,  a  carrot-and-stick

approach.   Case  Trust  has come  forward  to  offer  to

implement  this accreditation system for us and  we  have

accepted, but my Ministry has also said that we are  open

to  any  employment agency or association  that  can  put

forth  a programme that satisfies our requirements.   But

the  overall aim and the final goal are that we  want  to

raise  the  level, to make sure that employment agencies,

as  the  hon. Member said, train and also put  some  care

into  the  placement,  ie, match  the  employer  and  his

worker.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Clarification, Sir.

While  the number of reports of physical abuse  of  maids

has  come  down  -  and  the Minister  of  State  earlier

mentioned  about the different options and  avenues  that

maids  can actually lodge complaints should there be  any

forms  of  other abuse - I wonder what is the  extent  of

such  complaints  of  other forms of  abuse  of  domestic

helpers at this time, or even within the last few months,

in  relation to ascertaining the extent of problems  with

regard to maid abuse.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> The hon. Member is an expert on

social  matters,  and I am sure he is aware  that  mental

abuse  or  non-physical abuse varies from one  person  to

another.   I  am  sure if we took a poll on  the  Members

sitting  in this House, some or even many of  us  may  be

mentally abused today!  The percentage will vary from day

to   day.   So,  it  is  difficult  to  quantify.    More

importantly, we want to create access and avenues for any

foreign  domestic  worker who thinks that  she  has  been

abused,  to  be  able  to contact  a  particular  agency,

whether  it  is MOM or the police, for us to be  able  to

investigate  that.  And that has been made available.   I

do  not  have the specific numbers.  I am not quite  sure

whether  we  capture  it in terms of mental  or  physical

abuse,   but  we  have  captured  all  cases   of   abuse

generically, and the numbers I have mentioned stand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

based  on the number the Minister of State has mentioned,

would he not say that the percentage of households having

maids  in Singapore is rather high and, in my view, maybe

among  the highest in all communities in the world?   Has

the   Ministry   studied  what  is  the   propensity   of

Singaporean  households having maids, and  what  measures

have been considered to reduce this dependency?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the hon.

Member's  point.   He  is quite  right.   The  number  of

foreign  domestic  workers  has  increased  despite   the

recession.   There are really two ways, or a  combination

of  the  two, to reduce the number.  One, the levy;  two,

the  quota.  The quota is difficult because it means that

the  Ministry has to decide a priori who is fit or  whose

need  is  greater  for a foreign domestic  worker,  which

leads  us  to  the second recourse, and the  Ministry  is

studying ways to implement that.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> It

is  heartening  to  note  that the mandatory  orientation

programme  for first-time employers is being  considered.

Maybe,  just  to get an idea of the shape  of  things  to

come,  would the Minister just give some idea as  to  who

will be organising it and what would it cover, so that we

can see the usefulness and value for those who have to go

through  it, because the usual psychological block  again

is:  why another enforced mandatory scheme for first-time

employers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will announce

the  details in due course, but let me just give  Members

the  schematics.   The reason for this  scheme  which  we

thought would help is that - Mr Chiam said for the  maid,

but  it is not quite for the maid - it is really for  the

employer and the employee both to be put in the same room

before  she starts work, and for a third party to explain

the  conditions and what it means to work in a household.

Whether  we  do it through a third party or  MOM  engages

professional  bodies for it to be done, we have  to  work

out the details.  But that very act sends a number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



of signals to both the employer and employee.  It sends a

signal  to  the employer that, yes, the foreign  domestic

worker  is  under his employ but he has to be responsible

because  there  are  bodies  within  the  Government  and

professional organisations who are also looking after the

welfare  of this lady, and this worker can have  recourse

to  MOM or other agencies.  It also sends a signal to the

maid  that there are rights and that she can be protected

and this is where she can turn to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think over and above that, it also helps set out a

tone  before  a  foreign domestic  worker  works  in  the

household that this is an employer-employee relationship.

I  think that will be the more useful signal that we  are

going to send.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will allow another two more questions

and then move on to the next Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> I would just like to

ask  the  Minister  of State why he  is  confining  these

orientation   courses   to  just  first-time   employers.

Certainly those who have employed maids before  ought  to

be reminded from time to time of their obligations to and

of  the  maid's rights as an employee in their household.

Therefore,  I  would  like to know  whether  or  not  the

Ministry  would consider encouraging subsequent employers

to   refresh  themselves  on  the  obligations  and   the

treatment of maids in the future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

majority of households who employ maids treat their maids

well.  The numbers reflect that.  We do not want to  make

it  onerous  so that every time you change a maid  -  and

there  are  many  reasons  why  a  maid  who  joins   one

particular household needs to go back or she finds it not

suitable  -  you have to attend an orientation programme.

I  think that would be creating difficulties where it  is

not  necessary.  But we will monitor.  If this particular

programme  for first-time employers does not seem  to  do

the trick, we will decide on whether we should extend it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister  of  State, in an  earlier  response,

mentioned   that  the  threshold  of  reasonableness   in

households  varies  tremendously.   In  fact,  there  are

140,000  households  with maids in  Singapore.   He  also

mentioned that his Ministry intends to raise this minimum

threshold of reasonableness.  Would it then not be timely

that  his Ministry publish what it thinks is the  minimum

level of threshold of reasonableness?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you had to

publish, for example, that you should not abuse  a  maid,

that  is  not something that we need to publish, that  is

something  we  already  know and something  you  can  act

against.  You do not need a contract to say that you will

not  abuse her physically.  That is understood.   Whether

we  should move the other way and say she should  work  X

number  of  hours  a day, she should only  do  prescribed

activities  within  the  house,  I  think  it   will   be

difficult.  It varies from household to household and  we

need  to be realistic.  I think the acid test at the  end

of  the  day  is for the employer to ask if  perchance  a

relative of his goes to a different country and works  as

a  foreign domestic maid, would he have that employer  in

another country treat his relative the way he treats  his

maid?



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Point of clarification, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Minister of

State said just now that they are looking into the second

option  of  reducing  the number of maids  in  Singapore,

which  is  fees.   I  hope the Minister  of  State  would

clarify  that he is not thinking of increasing  the  maid

levy in this aspect.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me congratulate

Mr Chia on his quickness.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am not wanting to put too much mental  abuse  on

anybody,   particularly  on  the   Minister   of   State.

Obviously, younger maids will be more vulnerable and  may

be  more vulnerable to abuse and so on.  The Minister  of

State did not know what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



minimum  age is.  May I ask him to undertake, if the  age

is below 21 years, to consider seriously that the minimum

age  should be set at 21 years which is, after  all,  the

age  of  adulthood  and  the age  where  a  contract  can

probably be made.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Yes, we will undertake that but as I

understand  it, our minimum age prescribed is  consistent

with international standards.  But I take his point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I can

understand  the difficulties of legislating standards  as

regards  the treatment of maids, surely, it will  not  be

asking too much of the Government to set standards  which

are  not  necessarily enforceable but are  guidelines  by

which  we  expect maids to be treated.  These  guidelines

can  then  set  the  benchmark as to what  is  reasonable

conduct on the part of the employer and employee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do have a

peculiar  characteristic, that is, we do like to  enforce

what  we  set out as guidelines, and that is  not  a  bad

thing.    We  do  have  guidelines  that  encourage   the

employers  and  employees to go into a written  contract.

But  whether you want to enforce it in law or whether you

can do it, I think it is a different matter.  But let  us

have  a  bit  of  perspective. The  number  of  cases  of

reported abuse is 8 for the first half of this year.   It

has  come  down.   It  shows  that  our  enhancement   of

penalties   has   worked.   Whether   we   should   craft

legislation  to be more restrictive and more  onerous,  I

think  the  numbers  will help us  to  move  towards  any

particular direction.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

during  the  two  checks that are made to the  employer's

home  in the six months, if the employer does not  adhere

to the contract, how would the Ministry then know what to

do   with   this  agency  and  what  happens   to   their

accreditation?   My  second question  is:   is  there  an

"1800" number available to all maids who come in?   Sorry

for  my ignorance.  If not, can we see that something  be

done, if possible, about it?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Yes, there is a "1800" number. With

regard  to her first question that during the two  checks

carried  out by the employment agency and they find  that

there  is unhappiness on either party, I think they would

usually see whether they can make a second placement.   I

am not sure whether that was her question.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> What I was saying is what

happens  to their status if the contract is made  between

the  employer  and employee, the agency comes  in  to  do

their  checks and the employer is flouting the  contract.

How  would  the  Ministry know that  the  agency  is  not

reporting  or mediating in this case?   What  happens  to

their status after that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> As I have said, under the Criminal

Procedure  Code, anyone who knows of abuse  is  bound  to

report  it  legally.   So if we find  that  a  particular

employment  agency  was aware of the abuse  and  did  not

report it, we have a recourse to prosecution.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> A point of clarification, Sir.

The  Minister of State said that there are guidelines.  I

would like to find out from the Minister of State whether

these  guidelines  are effective  and  if  there  is  any

employer that flouts the guidelines, what are the  powers

available to the Ministry to enforce these guidelines.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I clarify from

Mdm Halimah what guidelines she is referring to?



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of

State  mentioned  about  the presence  of  guidelines  in

response to a question raised by Mr Sin Boon Ann when  he

was asking whether, short of legislating those standards,

there are guidelines. The Minister of State responded  by

saying  yes, there are guidelines.  My question is:   are

those guidelines effective?  And if those guidelines  are

not  complied with, what are the powers available to  the

Ministry to enforce them?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was under the

impression   that  the  guidelines  refer  to  employment

conditions.  This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



would   be  a  similar  response  to  what  Mdm   Halimah

previously asked, that is, it is quite one thing  to  say

that  there  should  be  suggested guidelines  which  the

employer  expects  of  the  working  conditions  for  the

employee  in order to craft it in law.  I said  that  the

situation  suggests  that we do not quite  need  to  move

towards  that because the number of abuses has  not  been

that  great.  We are not satisfied, but it tells us  that

we  do  not  have to make it that onerous for  employers.

But  as  I  have mentioned, there are also other  aspects

that  need not be written in any guidelines which we will

prosecute, for example, maid abuse, which is what we  are

discussing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one hand, it is the general aspect of raising the

threshold of how you treat your foreign domestic  worker.

I  think that would take time, that would evolve.  It  is

not  something  that you can prescribe at this  point  of

time because it would change.  What is normal or what  is

expected  for  one household is not quite  the  same  for

another.   How  do  you raise the overall  standards?   I

think  our measures have worked in most instances and  we

will  continue  to  see  how this  mandatory  orientation

programme  works, what improvements it  brings  and  what

improvements  it  needs  before  we  decide  on   further

avenues.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Sin, this is the last question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not understand

because,  on the one hand, the Government is saying  that

we  want  to  raise  the  general  standards  by  way  of

determining  what  is  a  reasonable  threshold  for  the

public.   On  the other hand, I sense that the Government

is fighting shy of setting standards and guidelines which

need  not  necessarily  be  founded  in  contracts.   The

Government  can  unilaterally set certain standards  that

the Government expects employers to follow and whether or

not these employers follow these guidelines is really  up

to  the  employers and for the general public to  take  a

different  view  of  it  if they  fail  to  follow  these

standards.  But it need not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



necessarily be enforced as suggested by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it would be

wrong  to  say that the Government fights shy of  setting

guidelines.   I think the Government wants to  make  sure

that  we can effect the change, rather than grandstanding

and  posture.   It  is  the exact  reason  for  the  maid

accreditation system because you can come up with a sheet

and  say  that  is what you do.  But would people  follow

you?    Which  is  why  we  have  the  employment  agency

accreditation scheme so that we can make sure that  there

is  an intermediary.  We have 140,000 employers.  We have

these  maid  agencies which are in closest  contact  with

these  employers placing these maids.  How do you  effect

the  change that you want?  It is quite one thing to  say

what  you  want and it is quite another thing  to  effect

that  change.  This is the direction that we are  moving.

We  are  not  only  stating how we want these  guidelines

prescribed  but we are also trying to see that  they  are

regulated and implemented.

<div align="center"><b>UNSOLD HDB FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a)  how many Housing and Development  Board

(HDB) flats are unsold to date; (b) what are the measures

taken  to sell these flats; and (c) whether HDB  will  be

building any new flats from 2002 to 2004.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, at the beginning of this year, HDB

had  about 17,500 unsold flats in the non-mature  estates

available  for sale to the public.  In the first  quarter

of  this year, HDB offered these unsold flats to all  the

Registration  for  Flat Scheme (RFS)  applicants  on  the

queue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After RFS applicants had selected their flats, the

remaining unsold flats were then offered to the public on

a monthly basis under the Walk-In Selection (WIS) process



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



from  April  this year onwards.  For the  convenience  of

buyers,  HDB  organised roadshows, conducted  bus  tours,

opened  up showflats and sample units and set up  on-site

sales offices to facilitate their flat purchase.  So far,

WIS  exercises  in  five  towns  have  been  launched   - Sengkang,   Choa   Chu  Kang,  Sembawang,   Punggol   and

Woodlands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these measures, HDB has sold more than 7,000

flats  in the non-mature estates from January to the  end

of  July, leaving about 10,000 flats still available  for

sale.   These  flats will continue to be  made  available

through the WIS on a monthly basis.  HDB will assess  the

unsold  flats supply when all the unsold RFS  flats  have

been   released  under  the  WIS,  before   deciding   if

additional measures are necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, HDB has sold more than 1,300 of the

1,900  flats that were offered in the first of the twice-yearly  Balloting Exercises for flats in mature  estates.

This  was  held in January this year.  These  flats  were

built to re-house lessees affected by HDB's redevelopment

programmes  such  as the Selective En-Bloc  Redevelopment

Scheme  (SERS).   HDB intentionally built  these  surplus

units  so  as  to optimise the land use in these  popular

estates and is now able to release them to the public  in

batches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had announced in Parliament in May, HDB will

offer  1,300  new flats for sale in Punggol and  Sengkang

under  the Build-To-Order (BTO) System in the 4th quarter

of this year.  As nearly all the unsold flats in the non-mature  estates are 5-room and Executive Flats,  only  4-room  flats will be offered under this exercise.  If  the

take-up  rate for the flats in these sites is  good,  HDB

will proceed with the construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will study the response to its ongoing sales

measures  and  the BTO offer in the 4th quarter  of  this

year, as well as the economic conditions next year before

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association Act was enacted in May 1960

and, over the last 40 years, it has been amended on a few

occasions.  This Bill now seeks to amend the  PA  Act  to

facilitate  the  introduction  of  the  new  PA   symbol,

commonly  called the PA logo, and to update the  mode  of

operation of bank accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original PA logo was introduced in 1963. This

was  the first logo which was on the paper that the Clerk

has  distributed  earlier to all hon.  Members.   It  was

incorporated  into  the PA Act as  the  Second  Schedule.

After 40 years, it is timely to refresh the logo in order

to keep up with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



the time.  And the new logo, which is the second logo  at

the  bottom  of  the  page, has  retained  the  essential

characteristics of the previous logo, but now instead  of

our  four circles, we see one continuous element  running

through  the  four  circles.  This  represents  the  PA's

mission  of  connecting  Singaporeans  from  all   ethnic

backgrounds  to promote active citizenry and multi-racial

harmony.   The  vision is one of all communities  bonding

closely   together,  increasing  the  common  space   and

strengthening the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes to delete the Second Schedule

to  the  PA Act and to make the necessary amendments,  so

that  there  is  no  need to amend the Act  whenever  the

symbol  is  changed in future.  In order to  protect  the

integrity of the new logo so that it will not be misused,

the penalty for infringement has been increased from $500

to  $10,000.  This proposed penalty is in line with  that

of symbols of other Government statutory authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 13(3) of the PA Act governs the operation of

the  bank accounts of the People's Association.   Cheques

have  to  be  signed  by  two members  of  the  Board  of

Management.   This provision was enacted  40  years  ago.

Over  the  years, the PA has grown in size with increased

volumes  of financial transactions.  Like other statutory

boards, the task of signing cheques and the operation  of

bank accounts can be delegated to authorised officers  of

the People's Association by the Board of Management.  The

Bill, therefore, seeks to amend the existing provision to

give effect to this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Science and Technology Board (NSTB) was

established  in  1991  to  help  upgrade  the  level   of

technology  in  industry and promote R&D in  the  private

sector.    Its   core  activities  were   promoting   and

supporting   private  sector  R&D  through  grants,   and

establishing research institutes and centres  to  support

technology development in industry.  The emphasis was  on

downstream technology development, aligned to  the  needs

of the manufacturing sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy has advanced rapidly over the past four

decades, bringing fresh challenges and priorities at each

stage  of  development.    In  the  1990s,  an  important

priority  was to raise levels of technology  in  industry

and  move  to  higher value added productive  activities.

NSTB's  focus  was in supporting industry  upgrading  and

promoting the development of technopreneurship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move up the economic ladder and into the

knowledge-based  arena,  Singapore  faces  new  and  more

complex challenges.  Science and technology are advancing

relentlessly.   Established centres  of  R&D  are  moving

ahead,  and new players are emerging.  Singapore  has  to

step  up  the pace in building a knowledge-based economy,

or   be  left  behind.   Our  window  of  opportunity  is

narrowing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of human and intellectual capital is

the  key to our future economic growth.  We have to  move

beyond   the  adoption  of  new  technologies   developed

elsewhere.    We   have  to  create,  own   and   exploit

intellectual  capital.  To do so,  we  must  broaden  and

deepen  our  scientific capabilities.  Only then  can  we

nurture    and   attract   high   value   knowledge-based

activities, anchor them in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



Singapore and provide rewarding jobs for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSTB has been restructured to support this objective

by  moving from downstream technology development towards

the  promotion and encouragement of science,  engineering

and   biomedical  research.   Its  roles  in   co-funding

industry R&D and technopreneurship development have  been

transferred to EDB.  NSTB will place greater emphasis  on

nurturing  research talent, that can create  intellectual

property  to develop and attract higher value, knowledge-based industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSTB has therefore refined its mission to that of

fostering  world-class scientific research and talent  so

as  to create a vibrant knowledge-based economy. It  will

pay particular attention to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) integrating public sector R&D with the

development of industry clusters;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) nurturing local R&D talent (with particular

emphasis on our youth), in addition to recruiting foreign

talent; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) promoting the exploitation of intellectual

property created by our research institutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reflect this new mission, NSTB has been renamed

the  Agency  for  Science,  Technology  and  Research  or

A*STAR,  since 1st January of this year.   The  new  name

symbolises the organisation's role as an agent of change,

and  in providing the guiding direction for upgrading  in

science,  technology and research for the development  of

Singapore's economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the NSTB Act thus reflect the

refinement  or  re-focusing of the  mandate,  powers  and

functions of A*STAR, and also the new name.  Let  me  now

touch on the key aspects of the Bill.



<br><br><i>Change of Name</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 effects the change of name to the "Agency

for  Science,  Technology  and Research"  or  such  other

business   name  as  the  Minister  may  by  notification

specify.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



The  agency may carry out its functions and duties  under

the  new name and the acronym A*STAR.  This will give the

A*STAR the flexibility to change its business name as and

when  the circumstances require, without having to change

its  legal  name   -  Agency for Science, Technology  and

Research.



<br><br><i>Changes in Functions and Powers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 widens the mission and direction of A*STAR

to include the following objectives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to spearhead the creation of a knowledge-based

economy  by  encouraging  research  and  development  and

nurturing talent in research and development in the areas

of science, engineering and biomedical sciences;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to promote the creation and management of

intellectual  property through research  by  the  various

research    institutes   under   A*STAR    and    through

collaboration    with    other    research    institutes,

universities or industry partners; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to provide and facilitate the commercial

application of the intellectual property created by these

research and development activities.



<br><br><i>Powers of the Agency</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 empowers A*STAR to carry out its expanded

functions,  including  a  power  to  establish   research

institutes and councils.  It also includes the  power  to

provide  grants  and  financial assistance  for  R&D  and

commercial applications in areas defined by the agency.



<br><br><i>Deletion of the Third Schedule</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the lapse of 11 years since the Science

Council  was taken over by the agency, all references  to

that  transfer provided for by the Third Schedule are  no

longer  relevant  or  applicable.  Therefore,  clause  10

repeals the Third Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the NSTB

Act will allow A*STAR



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



to  focus  its  energies on building a critical  mass  of

research manpower and developing core capabilities in the

fields  of  science, engineering and biomedical sciences.

This  nurturing of scientific talent and R&D capabilities

will  be  crucial to Singapore's drive  to  move  up  the

economic  ladder and establish itself as  a  hub  in  the

global knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the last Parliament sitting, the Second

Minister for Finance, Mr Lim Hng Kiang, moved the  Second

Reading  of the Currency (Amendment) Bill.  The  Currency

(Amendment) Bill essentially made legislative  amendments

to  the Currency Act to effect the merger of the Monetary

Authority of Singapore and the Board of Commissioners  of

Currency, Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Lim mentioned in his speech, the merger of

BCCS  with  MAS  would  also require  amendments  to  the

Constitution  of  the Republic of Singapore.   This  Bill

effects the necessary constitutional amendments to enable

past  reserves of BCCS to be transferred to MAS  as  past

reserves,  and to delete BCCS from the Fifth Schedule  of

the  Constitution.   The  Bill also  includes  two  other

amendments,   one  concerning  the  disqualification   of

Members  of  Parliament under certain circumstances,  and

the  other  to  extend the term of Nominated  Members  of

Parliament from two to two-and-a-half years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now explain the main amendments in the

Bill.



<br><br><i>Transfer of Reserves</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends Article 22B of the Constitution to

enable  a  Fifth  Schedule statutory  board,  whose  past

reserves are subject to the constitutional safeguards, to

transfer  any  of  its  past  reserves  either   to   the

Government's  past reserves or to another Fifth  Schedule

statutory  board's past reserves, without the transaction

being  regarded as a draw on past reserves.  As BCCS  and

MAS  are both Fifth Schedule statutory boards, this  will

enable  BCCS  to transfer all its past reserves  to  MAS.

The  transfer  will not affect the total amount  of  past

reserves   that   are   subject  to  the   constitutional

safeguards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as BCCS would no longer exist as a separate

entity  after the merger with MAS, clause 5 proposes  the

deletion  of  BCCS  from  the  Fifth  Schedule   of   the

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has been consulted on clause 3 and

clause 5 of the Bill, as these two amendments affect  the

custodial  powers  of the President.  The  President  has

agreed  that  I  should inform the House that  these  two

clauses have his concurrence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now describe the amendments pertaining to the

Members   of   Parliament  and   Nominated   Members   of

Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Disqualification of Members of Parliament</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a Member of Parliament is subject to

disqualification  under  certain  circumstances.    These

include  becoming  bankrupt, declared to  be  of  unsound

mind, being convicted of an offence that leads to a  jail

term of more than one year or a fine of more than $2,000,

or  being  convicted  of an offence  in  connection  with

elections  to Parliament.  When this happens, Article  48

of  the  Constitution gives Parliament a choice of either

immediately  vacating  the MP's  seat,  or  delaying  the

vacation  of  the seat to allow the MP to appeal  against

the Court's ruling.  If Parliament chooses the former, it

would  not  be fair to the MP, who ought to  be  given  a

reasonable  opportunity  to appeal  against  the  Court's

decision  to  retain  his seat in  Parliament.   So  far,

Parliament's practice has always been to give the MP  the

chance  to  appeal.   But  this has  given  rise  to  the

anomalous  situation of a disqualified MP being  able  to

continue  sitting  and  voting in  Parliament  while  his

appeal  is pending.  There is no disincentive for the  MP

not to drag his feet with the appeal process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 rectifies this, by giving the MP two

incentives to expeditiously pursue his avenues of appeal.

The  first  is  to  disallow him  from  participating  in

parliamentary  proceedings while his appeal  is  pending.

The  second  is to give him a reasonable time to  exhaust

his avenues of appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends Article 46 of the Constitution to

provide that an MP who becomes disqualified by reason  of

bankruptcy,  unsound mind or criminal  conviction,  shall

immediately  cease  to be entitled  to  sit  or  vote  in

Parliament  until the outcome of any appeal  against  the

Court's  decision.   The  MP's seat  will,  at  the  very

latest,  be vacated after 180 days even if the appeal  is

still  pending.  An MP who succeeds in his appeal  before

the  expiry  of the 180 days will be entitled  to  resume

sitting or voting in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have set the period at 180 days because in vast

majority of cases, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



appeal process takes less than six months.  This is  also

in  line with the UK practice.  In the UK, a bankrupt  MP

is  immediately  disqualified from participating  in  the

proceedings  of Parliament, but he is allowed  to  retain

his  seat  for six months.  If at the end of six  months,

his  appeals to the Court do not result in his bankruptcy

being  annulled or rescinded, he must vacate his seat  in

Parliament.



<br><br><i>Extension of the Term of Nominated MPs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill amends the Fourth Schedule of

the  Constitution  to extend the term of  NMPs  from  two

years   to   two-and-a-half  years  from  the   date   of

appointment.  In April, the House debated the  motion  by

the  Leader of the House to have Nominated MPs during the

term  of this Parliament.  During this debate, the Leader

informed Members that the present two-year term  of  NMPs

was  not ideal.  If Parliament lasts the full five years,

then  we have to go through the process of selecting NMPs

three   times.   Furthermore,  the  third   time,   after

Parliament has gone through the whole process  of  public

advertisements, inviting members of the public to send in

nominations, interviewing them, and so on, the NMP  would

serve only for at most one year, before General Elections

have to be called.  In the last term of Parliament, these

NMPs,  in  fact,  served only 17 days and attended  three

sittings  of Parliament.  The Leader stated  that  at  an

appropriate  time, the Government intended to  propose  a

change to this two-year term to stretch it out to two-and-a-half  or  three years, so that within one parliamentary

term  of  five years, we only need to select NMPs  twice.

Hence,  this amendment to extend the NMPs' term from  two

to two-and-a-half years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I rise in support

of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill.  I should just like

to  ask the Deputy Prime Minister some questions relating

to the proposed changes to Article 46 contained in clause

3 of the Bill.  First, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



amendment provides for a situation where an MP  may,  for

example,  be  disqualified  due  to  his  being  adjudged

bankrupt or convicted of an offence for which he is fined

more  than $2,000 or jailed for more than a year.  He  is

then suspended from parliamentary proceedings even if  he

appeals.   There is nothing wrong with this,  and  it  is

practised   in   many  jurisdictions,  notably   England.

However, I would like to ask a question relating  to  the

180-day limit concerning the appeal, after which a Member

of  Parliament must vacate his or her seat.  What if  the

appeal  had not been heard by then?  What if subsequently

the  appeal is allowed?  He would have vacated  his  seat

already   and   there   would  be  no   opportunity   for

reinstatement.  Is this really intended?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is still a reference, I find, to

Malaysian  courts in the proposed Article 46(4)(c)  where

an MP may be disqualified if convicted of an offence by a

Malaysian court.  This is a historical issue.   Why  have

we  not taken the opportunity to take away this reference

to Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Article 45(2) refers to the removal of

disqualification  after, for instance,  an  MP  has  been

sentenced  and served his custodial sentence, and  he  is

released.  He is no longer disqualified five years  after

his  release.   He can stand for re-election.   Sir,  the

question  is,  if an MP has been convicted of  a  serious

offence  or,  for that matter, successfully sued  in  the

civil  court,  for example, for breach of trust  or  such

conduct which was manifestly dishonest and dishonourable,

should he not be disqualified for a longer period or,  in

some really serious offences, permanently disqualified?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the amendment may be seen by some in

this House as well as outside that this was motivated  by

the  treatment of the Non-Constituency MP in the previous

Parliament,  Mr  J  B Jeyaretnam, during  his  bankruptcy

proceedings  when  he  was  allowed  to  participate   in

Parliament during the appeal.  I am sure that this is not

so  and  that,  on  the  whole,  the  amendments  to  the

Constitution are important in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



preserving the honour and integrity of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give it fullest support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to touch on clause 3 of the proposed amendment which

concerns  Members of the House.  A Member  of  the  House

adjudged   or  otherwise  declared  a  bankrupt  (Article

46(4)(a)) should have the same opportunities as any other

citizens  and be able to pursue avenues of compromise  or

settlement  without any additional added pressure.   This

is  particularly  so  in view of the  high  incidence  of

politicians being sued for defamation in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Courts in Singapore are reasonably efficient,

and  there  are procedures in our legal system to  ensure

that  matters  are  dealt  with  expeditiously.   In  the

circumstances,  the proposed amendment to  force  a  said

Member to vacate his seat after 180 days, despite pending

appeals open to the Member, makes a mockery of the  legal

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, when all attempts to appeal have

failed,  and the said Member is so disqualified from  his

seat, then the said vacant seat should immediately be put

up  for  contest in a by-election.  This should  be  done

irregardless of whether the vacant seat is  in  a  single

constituency  or  GRC.  After all, the  constituents  are

citizens and taxpayers and they should be fairly  treated

and not stayed on as orphaned electorates, and especially

not  with step-MPs from other constituencies assigned  to

look  after them.  The choice of the constituents  should

be  respected and every opportunity given to elect a  new

representative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not support the Bill in

its current state.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no

objection  to the amendment relating to the  transfer  of

past  reserves  between the statutory  boards  concerned.

Concerning the disqualification of Members of Parliament,

I  believe the immediate suspension of a Member's rights,

following the courts disqualifying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



the  Member,  is  in  line with  the  practice  of  other

countries.   I  also have no objection to this.   But  my

concern,  like  Prof. Chin, is about the 180-day  cut-off

where  a Member is appealing against a conviction or  his

bankruptcy.  If 180 days have passed without  the  appeal

being decided, the Member will lose his seat.  This  will

be   irreversible  even  if  his  appeal  is   eventually

successful and he is acquitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a cut-off point for appeal may be necessary in

countries where the court processes take a long time, and

there may be a worry that the MP may be out of action for

too  long.   However,  do we have  the  same  problem  in

Singapore?   According  to  the  Supreme  Court's  Annual

Report 2001, the average waiting time for appeals against

bankruptcy is 1.8 weeks whereas the average waiting  time

for   appeals  against  a  criminal  conviction  in   the

Subordinate Courts is about 6.1 weeks.  We also know that

the  courts  are nowadays very strict on postponement  of

cases.   As  what DPM has mentioned, we are efficient  in

our  court system.  So, if any case is postponed for more

than 180 days, there must be a very good reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, in Singapore, it appears that the

Chief  Justice is the only Judge hearing criminal appeals

from  the Subordinate Courts.  I understand that sometime

in  1998,  the Chief Justice was on medical leave  as  he

went abroad for treatment.  This resulted in Magistrates'

appeals  not  being  heard for several  weeks.   If  this

happens  again,  would it be fair to the  Member  if  the

period  of 180 days has expired because the Chief Justice

is on medical leave?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that the practice in Australia is

to  wait  for the outcome of the appeal, as it  would  be

jumping  the gun to make the seat vacant if there  is  an

appeal   pending   conviction.   Furthermore,   such   an

amendment is tantamount to presuming the Member is guilty

if the appeal to the Court is being delayed for more than

180 days.  Sir, I am not convinced that this amendment is

necessary.   It can also lead to unjust results,  if  the

delay is due to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



circumstances beyond the Member's control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I address

the   points,   first,  on  amendments  to  Article   46,

particularly the 180-day rule which Prof. Chin, Mr  Steve

Chia  and  also  Mr  Low Thia Khiang have  raised.    The

situation  which  they have described is  not  likely  to

happen because six months should be enough time for an MP

to  complete  his  appeal.  According to the  statistics,

more than 80% of appeal cases are disposed of within  six

months.   If an MP in question expeditiously pursues  his

appeal, there is no reason why it should not be completed

within that period.  Knowing that the MP has got this six-month deadline, the courts will no doubt accommodate  the

MP's  schedule and fix an appeal for hearing as early  as

possible.   It is only when the MP drags out  his  appeal

that  there  is  any chance of the process exceeding  six

months,  in which case he only has himself to blame.   We

have to set a hard time limit because we have to avoid an

MP deliberately dragging his case out and then repeatedly

asking  for  an  extension of time at  the  last  minute,

prolonging the entire process indefinitely.  However, the

six   months   is  not  an  absolute  limit.    If,   for

extraordinary  reasons, the appeal has not been  resolved

at  the  end  of 180 days, the MP could raise a  question

under Article 48 on whether he has vacated his seat,  and

it is still possible for Parliament to invoke the proviso

to  Article 48 to postpone a decision on the vacation  of

the MP's seat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point of this amendment is to suspend the

right  of  an MP to sit and vote while the appeal  is  in

progress and to set a structured timeline for the  MP  to

follow.  And this is to put him on notice that, should he

fail  to meet the 180-day grace period, he should  expect

very   little  sympathy  from  Parliament,  except  under

exceptional  circumstances.  In other words, the  proviso

to  Article 48 will really be invoked for cases where the

180-day timeline applies.  But if there is merit,  it  is

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Prof. Chin asked about decisions in Malaysian

courts.   Why  do  we  still need this?   Prof.  Chin  is

actually referring to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



Article 45(1)(e) of the present Constitution which is not

the  subject of any direct amendment in the  Bill.   But,

nevertheless,  the  reason  the  Article  exists  is   as

follows.    Given  the  close  ties  and  links   between

Singapore  and Malaysia, it is not realistic  for  us  to

ignore criminal convictions sustained in Malaysia.   Many

Singaporeans  travel  up  to Malaysia  for  business  and

recreation  frequently.  Many of our citizens are  either

former  Malaysians who have lived or worked for a  period

in   Malaysia.   And  this  uniquely  close  relationship

between   Singapore  and  Malaysia  is  not  matched   by

Singapore's ties with any other country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penal laws of Singapore and Malaysia are very

similar.   What is a crime is most likely a crime  there,

and  this similarity is again unique.  There is a similar

situation,  in  fact,  in the United  Kingdom  where  the

Representation   of   the   People   Act   provides   for

disqualification for imprisonment in either the UK or the

Republic  of Ireland.  So there is reason for  this.   Of

course, I should add that the conviction which is outside

of   Singapore  and  Malaysia  is  not  entirely  without

consequence because Parliament can still suspend  the  MP

for   dishonourable  conduct  under  section  20  of  the

Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by Prof. Chin is why

disqualification after a custodial sentence is  only  for

five  years.  This is Article 45(2).  Again, this is  not

subject  to any amendment in this Bill.  But the  purpose

of  the  five-year disqualification is not  to  impose  a

further punishment on the MP beyond that period.   It  is

de-linked  from  the  severity of the offence  committed.

The five years starts after the release from prison.  So,

in  fact,  it  is the period in prison plus  five  years.

This  is  to  impose  a reasonable rehabilitative  period

between the release from prison and the resumption of his

qualification to run for Parliament, so as to protect the

integrity   and  image  of  the  parliamentary   election

process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there was one last point from Mr

Steve  Chia  on  holding by-election for a  seat  vacated

immediately should a Member be disqualified.   Seats  can

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



vacated  for any number of reasons - disqualification  is

one of them, the Member may resign or pass away.  I think

that  is  a  completely separate question  which  is  not

addressed in this Constitutional Amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Division will be taken to ascertain that the

Second  Reading of the Bill is supported by the votes  of

not  less than two-thirds of the total number of  elected

Members  of Parliament, which is 56 Members, pursuant  to

Article  5(2)  of  the Constitution.  Ring  the  Division

Bells.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three minutes -



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I proceed to start the

electronic voting, Members are reminded that they are  to

press  "Present" on their electronic voting unit  located

at  the left armrest before indicating their vote.  Those

who  fail  to  press "Present" will not have  their  vote

recorded.   Voting will be open for 45 seconds  from  the

time  "Voting  in  Progress" is flashed  on  the  display

board.   Members  are reminded to check their  names  and

close of the voting.  If a Member is of the opinion  that

his  vote  has  been taken in error or has been  recorded

wrongly,  he may rise and request the Chair to  have  his

vote  taken correctly provided that such request is  made

before the Chair declares the result of the Division.

<div align="center"><b>NEW CHARTER OF GOVERNMENT-LINKED COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br>3.20 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move*,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, taking into account the Report of

the   Entrepreneurship   and  Internationalisation   Sub-Committee (EISC) of the Economic Review Committee and the

press  release by Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd on  the  new

charter of the Government-linked companies (GLCs) and  in

view  of  the  concerns of the private  sector  regarding

GLCs,    urges   the   Government   to   implement    the

recommendations of the EISC which define  the  new  roles

and  positioning of the Government and GLCs  in  business

and,   in   so  doing,  support  the  growth  of  private

enterprise and entrepreneurship in Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><i>Dialogues with industry</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this topic of the role of GLCs has been raised

and  debated  in Parliament numerous times in  the  past.

The  reason that my parliamentary colleague, Mr  Inderjit

Singh,  and  I wish to table this Motion is  because  the

EISC  has  presented  a report on its recommendations  on

Government  in business.  Temasek Holdings has  responded

with  a  press release on its new charter.  Therefore,  I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feel that it is a good time to take stock, and have a

full debate in this House on the new roles of GLCs.   The

members  of  my  GPC  for  Finance,  Trade  and  Industry

generally agreed to have this Motion tabled.  They  shall

speak  on  this  Motion airing their views.   A  thorough

airing of the



<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>

*This motion also stood in the name of Mr Inderjit Singh



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



views  will enable the Government to present its position

on the important issue of Government in business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to gather views on GLCs, the GPC for Finance,

Trade  and Industry conducted two dialogue sessions  with

our   Resource  Panel  members,  representatives  of  the

Chambers of Commerce, the Association of Small and Medium

Enterprises   (ASME),  the  Singapore  Confederation   of

Industries  (SCI)  and  other  invited  businessmen   and

professionals.  They have given their valuable input  and

suggestions.  I wish to thank them.

<br><br><i>GLCs' divestment history</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first major review of GLCs was completed on

21st  February 1987 by a committee chaired by Mr  Michael

Fam, called the Public Sector Divestment Committee.  This

was  15 years ago.  The committee identified 15 GLCs  for

listing,   nine   GLCs   for  reduction   of   Government

shareholding, and 17 GLCs for total privatisation, making

a  total of 41 GLCs recommended to be divested over a 10-year period.  I regret to note that the actual divestment

rate of GLCs has been painfully slow.  A quick check will

reveal that only about two-thirds of the GLCs recommended

for  listing  have been done.  In fact, on the  contrary,

several  GLCs  have continued to expand and  became  very

sizeable companies.  Contrary to shrinking and divesting,

the GLCs had gone forth and multiply.  There are now more

GLCs in terms of size, number and coverage of the economy

than  before  1987.   Has Mr Michael  Fam's  Report  been

totally forgotten?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, over these years, the cries of the

private sector against GLCs got louder and louder.   Most

of  the  complaints were reflected by MPs in this  House.

This is a perennial topic raised during the annual Budget

debate and the Committee of Supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC report and Temasek's new charter for GLCs

are therefore timely.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



They  put  in perspective the current stage of  GLCs  and

what  should  be done in setting the policy  forward  for

Government   in   business.   Though  not   comprehensive

documents by themselves, they serve as useful guide-posts

to  review  and plan ahead.  I shall delve  further  into

these reports later in my speech.



<br><br><i>Definition of GLCs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I go on to set out the

gripes  of  the  private sector against GLCs,  we  should

first  define  what  we mean by a  GLC.   Generally,  the

public loosely considers a company to be a GLC if it  has

close  ties  to  the Government, either in  the  form  of

direct  or  indirect shareholdings or  having  Government

representation or control on the Board or management.   A

more  precise definition has been commonly used nowadays.

A GLC is defined as a company with more than 20% owned by

the  Government through Temasek Holdings of the  Ministry

of  Finance, or by other Government Ministries, statutory

boards and agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek Holdings now wants to call them TLCs, to

differentiate   TLCs  which  are  Temasek's   stable   of

companies, against Government-linked companies which  are

owned  by  other  Government agencies.  However,  I  feel

that,  to make the picture more complete, when we  should

refer  to Government in business, we should also  include

GLCs  owned by Temasek and other Government agencies.   I

would  like to include companies under the ambit of  NTUC

and  the  Singapore Labour Foundation as well.   I  shall

explain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me coin a new acronym for NTUC and SLF-linked

companies   to  be  called  NLCs.   A  Minister   without

Portfolio  is head of the NTUC.  The companies under  the

SLF  are  another  NLC group headed by another  Minister.

Although  NTUC  and SLF-linked companies are  technically

not  under  Government shareholding influence,  they  are

exerting  the  same nature of Government connections  and

clout like GLCs.  Therefore, any policy rules



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



or  decisions  on GLCs which are applicable to  Temasek's

TLCs,  corporatised Government agencies, and subsidiaries

of statutory boards, should also be applicable as well in

form and spirit to the NTUC/SLF-affiliated companies, ie,

the NLCs.



<br><br><i>Concerns regarding GLCs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the concerns regarding GLCs? The

concerns  stem from the fundamental issue that GLCs  have

parentage   that  is  linked  to  the  Government.    The

Government, being a market regulator, is also the player,

therefore,  the  Government is both referee  and  player.

Therein  lies  the fundamental conflict of Government  in

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most countries, in the US especially, the

government's role is to assist businesses to grow.  It is

a firm belief that a businessman, with his personal money

at  stake,  will  make  better  business  decisions  than

government  officials.   The Government's  share  of  the

fruits  of success is in the corporate taxes levied.   In

fact, from the private businessmen's point of view, it is

rather  ironical that the Government collects taxes  from

their profits, which could then be used by the Government

to invest in businesses which compete against them.  This

is a dichotomy of Government in business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the concerns regarding GLCs are three

main aspects:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Unlevel playing field;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Crowding out of the private sector; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Transparency and trust.



<br><br><i>Unlevel playing field</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private-sector companies are very concerned about

the  unlevel playing field.  Their concerns are that  the

GLCs   have  strong  connections.   They  have  chairmen,

directors  and CEOs who are former Ministers,  top  civil

servants, generals and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



admirals.  Besides these clout and connections, GLCs have

strong  finances.  Hence, because of their muscles,  they

can  edge out any SMEs.  A common mistaken perception  is

that  "all  things being equal, the award of  a  contract

will invariably go to a GLC".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recall that when I raised this perception of

unlevel playing field to Deputy Prime Minister Lee  Hsien

Loong,  in a debate in this House several years ago,  his

response was that the Government's policy was to lay  out

a  level  playing  field.   He suggested  that  we  could

measure  it with a theodolite.  The Government will  make

any playing field level for all players.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that there exist rules that

deliberately  favour  GLCs.  Nor  are  there  any  hidden

subsidies for GLCs.  Since the Government is always above-board,  this is not permitted.  But compared to a private

company,  a  GLC enjoys certain advantages.  Firstly,  in

terms  of  finance, a GLC is usually stable and  stronger

financially,   with   Government  as   the   shareholder.

Secondly,  GLCs have connections and old-boys network  of

the  civil  service,  which  are  a  distinct  advantage.

Thirdly,  GLCs are favoured just purely because they  are

GLCs,  being of the right pedigree and parentage.  Others

want to do business with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said so

himself in this House on 21st May 1996 during the  debate

on  purchase of properties.  Senior Minister,  as  usual,

gave  a  long and commanding speech that day,  six  years

ago.  On a matter of perceived unlevel playing field,  he

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So let us be a little realistic and do not expect

that the Government can force private sector to give  the

professionals a level playing field.  No.   It  is  their

business.   They want to get the best customer that  will

help them to sell the product and add value."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SM went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, MPs, you go

to  a  hawker  centre.  If they give other customers  one

egg,  they  will  give you two."  He  quipped:   "I  know

because when in the 1950s, I used to go to Koek Road, the

best char kway teow there, other people for 50 cents  got

one egg.  I got two."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was what SM said. SM also went on to cite

examples  of his shoemaker and tailor giving him  special

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to be realistic, even if there is a level playing

field  in  terms  of  the  open  rules,  certain  better,

stronger and well-connected customers like GLCs will  get

favoured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote my personal experience from the

receiving  end  of  it.  In 1995, I  was  involved  in  a

private  sector company that entered into a joint venture

with  three GLCs to develop a piece of land in  Shanghai.

The  joint  venture partners agreed to  borrow  from  the

banks  using  the  land  as collateral  and  each  giving

corporate  guarantees  for  their  share  of  the   loan.

Compared to the GLCs, we were informed by the banks  that

our private sector company will have to be charged higher

interest  rates for our portion of the loan.  The  reason

is  that though the collateral is the same, the value  of

our corporate guarantee is not the same.



<br><br><i>Crowding out of Private Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this second gripe concerning the

crowding  out  is even more serious.  The  Department  of

Statistics  (DOS)  did  a study  in  March  2001  on  the

"Contribution  of  GLCs  to  GDP".   It  sets   a   clear

definition  of  GLCs as those wherein the Government  and

all  its  agencies own directly or indirectly effectively

20% or more.  DOS concluded that GLCs accounted for 12.9%

of  the  total  GDP in 1998.  This is a very  interesting

study that is not well-publicised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Leong, can you pause for a while so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>NEW CHARTER OF GOVERNMENT-LINKED COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Leong, you can proceed with your

speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, with your permission, may I

ask  the  Clerk to circulate a table prepared by  DOS  on

this study.  [Table circulated to hon. Members.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this table shows the share of GDP in 1998. Let

us  take  a look at this table.  What I found significant

is  that, of the 100% share, the Public Sector, which  is

Government,  in terms of providing schools,  defence  and

various  Government  regulatory  functions  and  services

accounted  for  8.9%.  Of the remaining 87.5%,  which  is

under the Corporate Sector, 41.5% was taken up by foreign-owned   companies,   with   46%   by   locally-controlled

companies.  And of this 46% locally-controlled companies,

12.9%  were  owned  by GLCs and 33.1% owned  by  "others"

which is, I presume, the private sector companies.   What

is  shown  here  is that the total pie  of  the  locally-controlled companies of 46%, one third was already  owned

by  GLCs, leaving only two-thirds for the private sector.

This percentage is indeed significant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look further into this table, add the 8.9% for

public  sector to the 12.9% of GLCs, we get  a  total  of

21.8%.   Compare  21.8% to the 33.1% which  is  owned  by

private  sector,  the comparison is  about  40:60,  which

means  Government  in  commercial  business  as  well  as

Government in government business accounts for 40% versus

60% for local companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this is clear evidence that the public

sector and the GLCs combined have invaded into 40% of our

daily  life, compared to the private firms,  if  we  take

away  the  portion  owned by MNCs and  the  foreign-owned

companies.  No wonder the presence of the Government  and

GLCs  is  felt so strongly in Singapore.  Many  may  feel

very stifling, others may develop a dependency syndrome.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is assessed that the GLCs accounted for 12.9% of

the  GDP in 1998.  However, now in year 2002, four  years

later,  I expect the figure to be higher if we include  a

few large Government agencies that have been corporatised

such  as the PSA Corporation and PWD Corporation (renamed

as  the CPG group, I think).  Then, if we include  a  few

new   subsidiaries  of  PSB,  JTC  and  other  Government

agencies  and statutory boards and several existing  GLCs

and  NLCs that have expanded, the GLCs' share of the  GDP

will  be  larger.   The Temasek Holdings'  press  release

stated  that  seven listed GLCs account for  21%  of  the

total  market capitalisation of the Stock Exchange today.

They  have a total value of S$72 billion. This growth  of

the  GLCs  could have been at the expense of the  private

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at one-third share of the local business pie,

the  GLCs  definitely  are a very visible  and  pervasive

group.  Once I read an annual report of Temasek Holdings.

What  struck  me  most was that it was like  reading  the

Economic  Survey  of Singapore.  GLCs  were  in  banking,

shipping,  electronics,  semi-conductors,  transport  and

logistics, food, property, hotels, retail, media  and  so

on.   Practically you name it, they are in  it.   I  have

said before in this House that if you throw a stone,  you

will very likely hit a GLC.



<br><br><i>Transparency and Trust</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a lesser extent, the third refrain against GLCs

is  that  some of them operate under a special  cloak  of

secrecy  or  different rules because they are Government-owned  to  serve  special national, defence  or  security

purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the manner whereby the Singapore

Technologies  group first started.  They were  formed  to

undertake   production  and  services  for  defence   and

ordnance requirements of Mindef.  The public's perception

is   that   these   companies   operated   under   strict

confidentiality for defence and security reasons.  In the

early  years,  many  were  awarded  Government  contracts

because of their special nature.  Over time, they grew



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



and  grew,  and finally became sizeable businesses.   But

for  the  purpose  of  growth and  survival,  these  GLCs

ventured into businesses that could well be undertaken by

the  private  sector.  The concern  is  that  some  GLCs,

especially  those  which are not listed,  operated  under

rules  that  may  not  be  too  transparent.  There   are

perceptions,  misconstrued  perhaps,  that  they  may  be

favoured for Government contracts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of trust, I recall that when I was a

junior  Administrative Officer in the Ministry of Finance

in  the mid-70s, my senior used to tell me that we cannot

trust the local businessmen.  Anything they asked for  is

for their own benefit.  Therefore, we must say no to them

three times.  Only if they come back after the third  no,

then they may truly have a grievance and needed help.  Of

course, things have changed.  The mistrust now may not be

as  pronounced.  Nevertheless, it is good that Government

can work hand in glove with the private sector to develop

more mutual trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, some SMEs fear and mistrust the

GLCs.   They are afraid that GLCs could steal their ideas

or  swallow  them  up  if they get  too  close  to  them.

Therefore,  there is a need to foster closer  and  better

mutual trust between GLCs and private companies. This may

be  achieved by greater transparency.  One method,  if  I

could  suggest,  is  for Temasek and  the  Government  to

publish an annual report.



<br><br><i>Comparison of Singapore and Hong Kong</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was explained that the genesis of GLCs in the

early  years was to spur economic development. GLCs  were

formed to enter areas which the private sector was unable

to do because of size, finance, risk or know-how.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For contrast, Hong Kong operated differently from

Singapore  because of our different history.   In  each's

own  way,  both Singapore and Hong Kong have found  their

own  path to economic success in the last 50 years.  They

have no major GLCs in Hong Kong (at least not as many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



as in Singapore).  Business is managed on a more laissez-faire  manner.  Currently, Singapore has a population  of

4.1  million, whereas Hong Kong has a population  of  6.8

million, that is, 66% more.  Singapore's GDP in year 2001

was  US$92  billion, whereas Hong Kong's GDP  was  US$163

billion,  which  is  77%  higher.   Hence,  in   a   very

simplistic  contrast between Hong Kong and Singapore,  it

seems  that  Hong Kong's model without GLCs is marginally

more  productive and efficient than Singapore.   However,

the  bigger contrast is that Hong Kong has a larger  pool

of  successful entrepreneurs and business people.  In the

list of billionaires in Asia, Hong Kong has a total of 11

names  whereas Singapore has only five names.  Hong  Kong

has   a   long  list  of  successful  industrialists   in

diversified  businesses,  such as  Li  Ka-Shing,  Michael

Kadoorie, Patrick Wang, Peter Woo and others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypothetically, if the Government did not create

GLCs  in the early years in Singapore, I believe we would

have   a   stronger   and  deeper   spread   of   private

entrepreneurs and businessmen now.  In the early  pioneer

days, we had notable successful businessmen like Lee Kong

Chian, Tan Lark Sye, Aw Boon Haw, Loke Wan Tho and  Runme

Shaw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I lament to note that there is a paucity of

successful private sector entrepreneurs who could rise to

prominence  in  the 70s, 80s and 90s.  I  call  this  the

vacuum  period. The most notable businessmen  in  current

days  are  Lien Ying Chow and Wee Cho Yaw in the  banking

sector and Kwek Hong Png, Khoo Teck Puat and Ng Teng Fong

in  the property sector.  There are no industrialists  of

eminence in Singapore.  The only person constantly quoted

is Sim Wong Hoo of Creative Technology.

<br><br><i>Reason for Dearth of Entrepreneurs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would attribute the dearth of entrepreneurs during

the  last  30 years to two reasons.  One is the  rise  of

GLCs  in  the  1960s  till to-date.  The  second  is  the

monopoly  of  the  public service  over  the  top  brains

arising from the successful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



Government  scholarship programme.  The  top  brains  are

given  prestigious scholarships.  Upon their return  from

overseas, they are channelled into public service and the

SAF.  Many  are  later  released to  run  GLCs.   Without

scholarships  and  left to their  own  devices,  I  would

contend  that  some of our Ministers, top civil  servants

and  generals could have become successful entrepreneurs,

businessmen and professionals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine that, if not for taking up scholarship

and  recruited  into Government, for  example,  from  the

Ministerial rank, we could have a top IT business leader,

a Singapore equivalent of Bill Gates in the person of DPM

Lee  Hsien  Loong; a successful banker in the  person  of

RAdm Teo Chee Hean; a successful MNC top executive in  Mr

Wong Kan Seng; and a prominent industrialist in BG George

Yeo  or  Mr  Lim  Hng  Kiang  and  many  others.   If  we

conjecture  further, perhaps our Prime Minister  himself,

Mr Goh, could have become a top shipping magnate.  Senior

Minister, Mr Lee himself, no doubt would have been a top-notch lawyer in private practice.  We never know.  And we

can  muse about it.  What if all these Ministers had  not

taken  up  scholarships  and  not  gone  into  Government

service?   Perhaps, we would have more world-class  local

companies led by capable world-class entrepreneurs.



<br><br><i>EISC Report</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now move on to make some

specific comments on the EISC Report and the new  Temasek

Charter.   I  am in the fortunate position of  not  being

involved in the preparation of these documents.  I can be

more  critical.  Unfortunately,  my  other  parliamentary

colleagues, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee  Hua,  who

are  speaking after me, do not have such liberty, as they

would have a hand in the preparation of these reports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the EISC report, I must first say that it

is  a  very well-prepared and meaningful report.   May  I

commend Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



Raymond Lim and his Committee for the excellent work.  It

points  correctly to the future directions of  Government

in business and the new roles of GLCs.  Unfortunately,  I

have  to  say that the EISC report has not gone  far  and

bold enough.  The suggestion on urging the Government not

to  enter into any more new businesses if they appear  in

the  Yellow  Book, is well-meaning, but  too  late.   The

Government and the NTUC are already in most businesses in

the  Yellow Book. What is there left that they should not

get into in the future, may I ask?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for its recommendations, I agree with all of

them.   In  fact, I think the EISC should ask  for  more.

For  a start, I feel that the EISC should have explicitly

asked for a curb on the proliferation of GLCs.  How about

the  issue  of crowding out and urging the Government  to

make more room and playing space for private sector?  How

about  urging the Government to divest out  of  its  non-strategic companies as soon as possible?  Why not suggest

a timeframe for divestment?  I would prefer that the EISC

recommendations be more specific and forceful.



<br><br><i>New Temasek Charter for TLCs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my unhappiness with the new Temasek

Charter  is that it did not adequately address the  basic

issue,  which is when and how should Temasek  divest  its

TLCs.    The  press  release  contained  many  motherhood

statements in its preamble on the Temasek Charter and new

Mission.   Instead of a clear divestment plan,  it  looks

more like a Business Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this Temasek Charter is prepared in response

to  the  EISC  Report, I feel that there  is  not  enough

connect   between   the  two  documents.    Whilst   EISC

recommends  that Temasek Holdings should explore  various

ways of divestment, the Temasek Charter sets out to be an

updated raison d'etre for TLCs, which is to champion  the

march  overseas.  Temasek Holdings has recruited  a  very

capable person, Mdm Ho Ching, to be Executive Director to

oversee the group.  Instead of slowly divesting off the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



companies,  we  now see a new Charter  that  defines  the

expanded  role  of  TLCs.  Read from the  private  sector

perspective,  Mdm Ho Ching is a powerful and  influential

new  figure to help mould and transform the stronger  and

larger   TLCs  to  become  substantial  players  in   the

international  arena.  Some may have  secretly  harboured

the  hope that Mdm Ho Ching would have worked herself out

of  a job, with the gradual divesting off of GLCs.  Alas,

she  is  putting her capable hands and talented  mind  to

grow TLCs instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to express my worry over one particular

statement in the Temasek Charter.  In its last paragraph,

it states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temasek may also, from time to time, invest in new

business,  in order to nurture new industry  clusters  in

Singapore."



Many local businessmen are concerned with this statement.

This   signals   that   TLCs  may  enter   new   business

opportunities  in Singapore in competition against  them.

Their  old  worries  about  the  unlevel  playing  field,

formidable financial might, strong network and  influence

of  top  officers of TLCs will surface again.  Now,  with

Mdm  Ho  leading  the charge, they are afraid  that  they

could be eaten for lunch.



<br><br><i>Private Sector to be the future Engine for Growth</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask any businessman, bliss to him is a business

world  in Singapore without GLCs.  If there were no GLCs,

they  would have less competition, and more room to build

up their businesses.  I urge the Government to be serious

on  redefining  the new roles of GLCs and  government  in

business.  Does the Government need to be involved in  so

many  types  and  number  of businesses?   This  question

should be asked of NTUC and statutory boards as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even internationally renowned consultants and

thinkers agree on the need to review the role of GLCs  in

the remaking of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking at a seminar in Singapore on 25th July this

year, Professor John



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



Doggett of the University of Texas pointed out that  with

the  rapid  economic changes facing the world,  countries

have  to  become  more entrepreneurial if  growth  is  to

continue.   He  thought that it is urgent that  Singapore

starts  moving  towards  being an entrepreneurial  nation

now,  as  other  countries  in  the  region  are  already

powering ahead.  In addition, he also mentioned:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Singapore doesn't start producing more

entrepreneurs soon, it will still be able to live an okay

life  for a while, but it will lose a lot of its vibrancy

and  its economy will be a flat line ..  It will be a big

challenge to remake Singapore in three to five years,  or

it will become irrelevant."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has mentioned this point during

the previous Sunday's National Day Rally speech.  He said

that  we have to nurture a more enterprising environment.

He  said,  tongue in cheek, that we should perhaps  allow

"bar top dancing".  Well, I say if "bar top dancing"  can

squeeze out creative juices from our normally straitlaced

Singaporeans, I am all for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a Singapore Institute of Management seminar

on  30th  July  this  year, a renowned  Harvard  Business

School don, Professor Michael Porter, said that thanks to

the  Government's  strong  support  and  a  strategy   of

economic   development  driven  by  foreign  investments,

Singapore   has  attained  an  extraordinary   level   of

prosperity today.  But as the country seeks to remake the

economy,  the  challenge is to jump  to  the  innovation-driven advanced economy stage.  The private sector  needs

to  spread its wings and develop itself to take a leading

role  in  the  Singapore economy.   I  repeat,  Professor

Porter  said, "The private sector has to take  a  leading

role in the Singapore economy."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Professor Michael Porter felt that the

Government  must now move on to reduce its  role  in  the

economy  in the next stage of development and  grow  more

local  world-class companies.  He said, "We have  to  get

the  Government out of the way; it is moving but the pace

is too slow."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common call is for Singapore to foster a

stronger and larger pool of local



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



businessmen to take on the likes of Li Ka Shing  of  Hong

Kong; and nearer home, compete against the likes of  Quek

Leng Chan, Ananda Krishnan and Francis Yeoh of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having said the above, I wish to

bring  this House back to the Motion of this debate.  The

wordings  are  crafted to reflect  the  concerns  of  the

private sector.  As elaborated earlier, the concerns  are

with  regard to unlevel playing field, crowding  out  and

transparency.  The Motion goes on to urge the  Government

to  implement  the  recommendations of  the  EISC,  which

define  the  new roles and positioning of the  Government

and GLCs in business.  In so doing, it therefore supports

the growth of private enterprise and entrepreneurship  in

Singapore.   The final operative words in the Motion  are

therefore   -  supports the growth of private  enterprise

and entrepreneurship in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our GPC's dialogue sessions with the Resource

Panel members and industry representatives, the consensus

was  that  it is acknowledged that GLCs have  made  great

contributions in the past.  Looking ahead, the Government

should critically review the roles of the GLCs.  As shown

in  the Department of Statistics study, GLCs already  own

one-third  of  the  total  GDP contribution  of  locally-controlled companies in 1998.  Surely this cannot go  on.

There  must  be a point in time when the Government  must

stop  encroaching into the private sector.   GLCs  should

scale down and give more room for private enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can concede that some GLCs are here to

stay.  They have become an integral part of the Singapore

business  landscape.  The question now is how  to  define

their future roles, so that they can continue to play  an

effective part in Singapore's  prosperity.  Since certain

GLCs  are  of such a large size and scale, they obviously

can  play  pivotal  roles in venturing overseas  together

with  other Singapore companies.  This is the new Temasek

Charter.  But as for lesser GLCs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



involved  in  businesses which can be undertaken  by  the

private sector, I strongly urge the Government to  divest

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I move on to 10 recommendations

that I have on how to shape the future roles of GLCs.

<br><br><i>1.   To curb the proliferation of GLCs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Government should make a bold and

outright  decision that henceforth, no new GLC should  be

formed  unless  it is for strategic or security  reasons.

No  new GLC should be formed without the explicit consent

of  the  Ministry of Finance.  And the Government  should

not   venture  into  commercial  businesses  where  local

businessmen  can undertake.  This applies  even  if  such

business ventures are not yet available in Singapore.  To

spur  the  establishment  of  such  new  businesses,  the

Government,  through an existing GLC,  can  only  take  a

minority  role and a minority stake.  There should  be  a

stated  objective that once the new project is  on-track,

the  Government  will sell its minority  share  to  other

interested buyers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As suggested earlier, the Ministry of Finance and

Temasek  Holdings should publish Annual Reports  for  the

purpose of more transparency.



<br><br><i>2.   Government   to  set  a  specific  timeframe   for divestment</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the companies that Temasek Holdings has deemed

to  be  non-strategic, I urge the  Government  to  set  a

definitive  timeframe  for divestment.   This  divestment

plan should be reviewed yearly and reported by Temasek to

the  Ministry of Finance.  In addition, during the yearly

review,  Temasek should also review those GLCs which  are

classified  as  strategic.  Times may have  changed  such

that these strategic companies may no longer be necessary

to be held by the Government.  As internal reviews by its

staff  may  be  inward looking and biased  towards  self-preservation, an external consultant or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



review  group  could  be  appointed  to  study  and  make

recommendations.



<br><br><i>3.   Government to outsource any commercial requirements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth, the Government should set a clear policy

that  it  would outsource any work or projects  that  the

private  sector can undertake.  There has been a tendency

in  the  past  for  Ministries, Government  agencies  and

statutory  boards to form subsidiaries to undertake  work

which  could  be easily performed by the private  sector.

This  is  introducing competition and obviously  crowding

out  of  the limited business space.  If we look  around,

there  are  many examples.  I wish to quote one  example,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 39 years, the Singapore Confederation of

Industries (SCI) used to be the most prominent  publisher

of   trade  directories.   Tradelink  is  their  flagship

publication.  About 10 years ago, IE Singapore  (formerly

TDB)  put  out  a  competing product to Tradelink  called

Singapore Exporter.   Because of IE Singapore's reach and

capability,  the  Singapore Exporter  has  grown  faster.

Today, IE Singapore's publication unit has expanded to 50

staff  issuing 12 publications.  This is not to say  that

IE  Singapore has done anything wrong.  In fact,  it  has

provided  excellent services. The point is that SCI  felt

that IE Singapore could have cooperated with SCI, instead

of competing against it.



<br><br><i>4.   Review  of  subsidiaries under the statutory  boards and Government agencies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the TLCs under Temasek, I note that there

are  several  statutory  boards and  Government  agencies

which  have formed many subsidiaries and joint  ventures.

Similar  to  the  review by Temasek, I suggest  that  the

Ministry of Finance do a comprehensive review of all such

companies  and  joint  ventures with  a  view  to  assess

whether  these  GLCs should continue.  All  non-strategic

companies    should   be   earmarked   for    divestment.

Thereafter, any new formation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



companies  and joint ventures by statutory boards  should

seek  the consent of the Ministry of Finance.  I strongly

urge that there should be a curb on the proliferation  of

GLC  formation,  not  just  by  Ministries,  but  by  the

statutory  boards, Government agencies and existing  GLCs

as well.



<br><br><i>5.   NTUC/SLF to Review its Stable of Companies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although NTUC-linked companies

(NLCs)  are technically not defined as GLCs,  as  I  said

earlier,  the public views NTUC-linked companies  in  the

same  vein  as  GLCs.  I would urge that a review  should

also be done on the need to continue to divest NLCs;  and

the   same   rule  to  avoid  proliferation   should   be

applicable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can appreciate that the NLCs are formed with

different objectives from GLCs.  NLCs are formed with the

social  objectives to help union members,  to  help  curb

profiteering   and  keep  prices  low,  or   to   provide

recreational outlets for workers at low cost.  These  are

very  noble and laudable aims.  I would suggest that  for

NLCs  that  have  achieved a strong  market  presence  to

perform these social objectives effectively, such as  the

NTUC Fairprice, NTUC Income and the Pasir Ris Resort,  it

is worthwhile to retain such NLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are some NLCs that are smaller and

have limited market impact to curb prices or lower costs.

I  would urge the NTUC and SLF to do a critical review on

whether to keep them.  Some examples I can quote are  the

NTUC Denticare and NTUC Foodfare.  I must confess that  I

do  not know enough about these smaller NLCs, but I would

suggest that nevertheless a comprehensive review of  NLCs

should be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To service its union members, the NTUC can consider

out-sourcing  their  needs.   The  NTUC  could  use   its

enormous  experience  in collective  bargaining  and  the

pooling  of  its  demand from the huge  number  of  union

members to negotiate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



for  lower prices from private sector operators.  If  the

NTUC  takes  the route of creating NLCs,  then  they  are

competing  instead of offering business  to  the  private

sector.



<br><br><i>6.   Give Priority to enacting a Competition Law</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the recommendation of the

EISC to enact a Competition Law.   This law will help  to

set   the   ground  rules  on  competition  between   all

companies,  ie,  the GLCs, TLCs, NLCs, MNCs  and  private

companies.   It  will ensure that the  playing  field  is

expressly  level.   It  will also  have  the  benefit  of

ensuring  transparency  of operations  of  all  companies

operating in Singapore.



<br><br><i>7.   GLCs  to  enlist  more Private Sector  persons  into Boards and Management</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose to the Government to appoint

more  private  sector representatives on the  Boards  and

Committees of GLCs.  As for the appointment of  CEOs  and

top  management, Temasek should get the best  person  for

the  job,  whether from the public service  or  from  the

market.   From the public's point of view, we often  have

the impression that GLCs are the retirement resting place

for ex-Ministers, top civil servants and MINDEF generals.

I  know this is not the intention.  I recall that DPM Lee

has said so in this House.  But it does not help to clear

this misconception each time we read about another ex-top

civil servant or retired general being appointed to  head

a GLC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More private sector representation means that there

will be closer mutual understanding and trust between the

public  sector  and the private sector.   Fostering  this

mutual trust is important.



<br><br><i>8.   Encourage more MBOs and divestments to locals</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very heartened to read about the progress of Mr

Ang Kong Hua in leading



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



an MBO to buy out NatSteel Limited from the shareholders.

This  is an excellent example of divestment of a  GLC  to

good,  safe  and capable local hands.  I would  urge  the

Government  to  encourage  more  of  such  MBOs.    Where

appropriate,  local  Management Buy-Ins  should  also  be

considered.   This  is  the  reverse  of  MBOs  where  an

external  management group is allowed to buy in  to  take

over a GLC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, since one of the objectives of the GLCs

divestment  is to create and jumpstart a larger  pool  of

local  entrepreneurs,  I  would recommend  that  wherever

possible,  divestment should be into  the  ownership  and

hands  of  local managers or local companies.  We  should

avoid  divestment of GLCs into the hands of foreign  fund

managers  or foreign companies, since they have different

business objectives compared to the locals.



<br><br><i>9.   More GLCs and Private Sector Co-operation as Cluster or Consortium</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my ninth recommendation is to ask the GLCs and

local companies to form clusters or consortia to bid  for

contracts and projects overseas.  They can also co-invest

as well.  This is a very common practice in Taiwan, Japan

and Korea.  When a large Taiwanese company enters into  a

business  overseas,  such as into China,  it  will  bring

along  a  cluster  of supporting Taiwanese  companies  to

cover various aspects of the investment.  This way,  they

operate  as a very closely-knit business group.  Japanese

and Korean companies do the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the new Temasek Charter has earmarked certain

strategic  GLCs  that can spearhead Singapore's  external

expansion drive, I suggest that each of these GLCs form a

cluster of local companies that it can cooperate with  to

compete  for foreign contracts.  When a large GLC invests

overseas,  they can offer co-investment, partnerships  or

supporting  business  to the members  in  their  cluster.

Such  clusters  of companies can be formed  around  large

GLCs such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



as    SingTel,   SembCorp,   Keppel   Corporation,    PSA

Corporation, and others.



<br><br><i>10.   Regular Study by Department of Statistics on  GLCs' share of GDP</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my final recommendation is that since the study

by  the  DOS  was done on GLCs' share of GDP in  1998,  I

would  like  to  propose that the DOS  be  tasked  to  do

regular  study to update its report.  It is important  to

continuously  monitor  the  encroachment  of  GLCs   into

private enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have made a long speech and covered much

ground.   At last, I have released off my chest  a  whole

host  of issues and concerns I have regarding GLCs,  TLCs

and NLCs.  These concerns I have expressed are to reflect

the concerns of the local businessmen and the man-in-the-street.  Members of this House will have more to  say  on

this subject as I note that there are over 20 MPs wishing

to speak on the Motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I conclude by expressing the

hope  that the Government leaders will heed our  worries.

I  have spoken honestly and forthrightly of the fears  of

the  private  sector.  I have also spoken sincerely  with

the  interest  of the nation at heart.  I hope  that  the

Government  leaders will listen, take stock  of  what  we

have said, and give us satisfactory replies on the future

roles  of GLCs and Government in business.  What we  want

is  to  do  what is best for our national interests.   We

want to create world-class local companies led by capable

world-class business leaders, who can compete against the

best in the world.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, unfortunately,

I  too  have a long speech because I have got many issues

to  get off my chest, having spent a lot of time studying

this  issue as part of the Committee that Mr Raymond  Lim

heads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to share with Members the

reason why I decided to move this Motion together with Mr

Leong Horn Kee.  As I mentioned, since last year,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



I  have  been  involved in one of the ERC  Sub-committees

and,  specifically, I was asked to chair a  sub-group  to

study recommendations regarding the role of Government in

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My committee, comprising key people from the private

sector,  GLC captains, SME businessmen and entrepreneurs,

spent considerable time studying the many complaints  and

issues  related  to  the  Government's  direct  role   in

business and how GLCs have influenced the development  of

the Singapore economy.  We concluded that while the route

Singapore  took  for  its economic  development  depended

heavily on the Government's direct role in business,  the

results  were  not necessarily all that bad.   While  the

brute  force approach taken by the Government  did  yield

the  desired  results, the question is, did the  approach

taken  result  in  structural damages in  the  spirit  of

private  enterprise and entrepreneurship?  The answer  we

all  felt in our committee was, to a certain extent, this

damage was created.  The next important question we asked

was whether the same formula would work in the future and

this round, the answer from all the committee members was

a  unanimous `no'.  We felt that if we wanted  to  ensure

good growth and economic development, we needed to change

and  the Government needed to reposition itself and there

needs  to be a different strategy from what we have  been

used  to in the past, particularly by the Government  and

also  how the GLCs operate.  We then defined the new role

and  strategy  and about 12 or so key recommendations  to

achieve success in this New Economy.



<br><br><i>New Charter of Government-linked Companies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come back to why I moved this Motion. Having

released  our  report, we waited for  the  Government  to

respond.  The greatly anticipated Temasek Charter was one

key response we wanted to see and it came promptly.  What

I would like to see is a more comprehensive response from

the  Government to all our recommendations and  therefore

the purpose of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



this Motion.  Because, if the Government does not give us

convincing response to the serious recommendations put up

by  serious  and concerned people of all backgrounds  and

which took us many months to develop, then I feel that we

will  lose  our battle in ensuring the future growth  and

prosperity of Singapore, and the Government will lose its

credibility   in  trying  to  remake  the   economy   for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why I moved this Motion is because

I  feel  that the Temasek Charter, while addressing  many

key  recommendations of our committee, did however  leave

out  a  few  very important issues which have yet  to  be

addressed  satisfactorily by anyone.  Also,  the  Temasek

Charter lacked in specifics, so no one knows whether  the

changes will come fast.



<br><br><i>Were GLCs Really Necessary for Singapore?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first question we asked is: were GLCs

really  necessary for Singapore?  I have said  it  before

and  will  say it again that GLCs did have a  significant

and  positive  impact on Singapore's  economy.   But  the

question  is,  was it the only formula for  success?   Mr

Leong  touched on this too.  My contention is that it  is

not  necessarily  so.  When I heard  the  key  people  in

Temasek  and  some  Government leaders say  that  without

GLCs,  there would be no major industries coming  out  of

Singapore, I cannot help but to disagree.  Perhaps,  yes,

but it is also arguable that had Government been a little

more  patient,  many more private sector companies  could

have  moved  in  and  become champions  of  some  of  our

industries.   It  is  also possible that  the  Government

moved in too early.  Is it also not possible that had the

Government  given the same opportunities and  almost  the

same protectionist measures to private local companies as

it  gave to the GLCs, many private sector companies could

have  survived, succeeded and even made it  big?   Is  it

also not possible that if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



the  Government had played a developmental role,  instead

of a direct role in business, they could have helped many

more local companies develop into global champions?   Why

did the Government have to favour only GLCs?  Why did  it

not also favour private companies in the same way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore disagree to a certain extent with the

argument that had the Government not moved in as a result

of  market  failure, private sector companies  would  not

have  moved in.  And Mr Leong gave very good examples  of

Hong  Kong versus Singapore to suggest that this view  is

not  totally wrong.  However, all this is history and  is

an argument not worth pursuing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now having developed an economy so crowded with GLCs

today, do we still need a domestic economy fuelled by the

Government  through its companies?  I  am  sure  everyone

will  agree  with me that we can no longer  live  with  a

formula  which  depends on GLCs playing  in  a  protected

domestic  environment and not allowing private enterprise

to  bloom  and  having local companies, particularly  the

GLCs,   which  cannot  effectively  compete  with  global

companies outside our shores.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue seems to be that we are being misled by

our  seemingly successful model in the past, and  by  the

comfort  of  our domestic market and the fact  that  many

GLCs have basically overstayed to the point that they are

no  longer  capable in competing with foreign  companies,

either on our shores as our domestic market opens  up  or

in  foreign lands where true market forces rule and where

the  domestic protection no longer exists.  Our GLCs  are

late  in  going global and they are facing the  brunt  of

failing  to  compete successfully globally and  by  being

`taken  for  a ride' in certain high profile  acquisition

transactions, in my opinion.  If the Government fails  to

realise  the  negative impact of our GLCs overstaying  in

their  old roles, we will see many more such sad  stories

of   Singapore-based   companies  doing   badly   outside

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Michael Porter from Harvard Business

School was in Singapore, and Mr Leong talked a bit  about

it  and  I will not go through it.  I would just like  to

add  that  he  also  mentioned, and  I  quote  him,  "The

historical  strategy  has played itself  out  and  is  no

longer robust", in addition to saying that the Government

should  get  out  of  the way.  His point  was  that  the

Singapore economy now has to be management driven  rather

than state driven, as has been the case for Singapore for

a very long time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This very well sums up the feeling of most people

from  the  private  sector  and  is  the  basis  of  many

recommendations that my committee developed.  We are  not

saying  that  the  Government should suddenly  back  off.

Neither  are  we  saying  that they  should  get  out  of

everything  that  they  have been  doing.   What  we  are

saying, however, is that the Government needs to re-think

and  re-position itself with a brand new mindset so  that

Singapore  can transform itself from a mainly  `corporate

driven  economy'  to  one  of  an  `entrepreneurial   and

innovation  led economy'.  If the Government succeeds  in

doing  this,  we  will  have  a  great  future.   If  the

Government  fails to realise the need  and  fails  to  do

something about this need to change, we will surely  fail

and  collapse as did many economies and companies in  all

of history.



<br><br><i>What are the issues with GLCs?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does Professor Michael Porter feel that the

Government  should  reduce its involvement  in  business?

Why  are  so  many  people from the private  sector  very

concerned  about  the  out-of-proportion  role   of   the

Government  and Government-linked companies in Singapore?

And  what  are the reasons for the failure of state-owned

enterprises in other parts of the world?  I would like to

touch  on  some of the issues which arise as a result  of

the Government's involvement in business and which led us

to  the  current  state  of  affairs  of  having  so  few

successful  private companies.  These  issues  will  give

Members  a good feel of the type of discussions  that  my

committee had when we looked at this issue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>(a)   Early Stages of GLCs Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is how GLCs developed in the early

stages.   While I agree that many of our GLCs  which  are

publicly  listed  are doing well and operate  very  well,

particularly  in the domestic economy, and one  of  them,

Singapore  Airlines,  has also done  well  globally,  the

issue was really in the early stages of the establishment

and  growth  of  GLCs.   The general  view  is  that  the

Government made very heavy investments and allowed  these

companies an easy access of money at less than acceptable

commercial  terms.   Such investments by  the  Government

gave  the  GLCs  so  much of strength  that  the  private

companies  could  not even think of  competing  with  the

GLCs.   By sheer brute force, we created large companies,

further  over-shadowing any local private company  trying

to  compete with the GLCs.  So the issue is that we  have

developed many of our GLCs using a lot of muscles  rather

than brain power or entrepreneurial thinking.  After many

years of such a funding practice and facilitation by  the

Government,  we created giant companies  -  again,  as  I

mentioned  -  with  a  lot  of muscles  but  without  the

necessary entrepreneurial management necessary to  create

world-class companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have personally made assessments of a few

companies that I know of and came up the way I described.

I  noted  that  when they have to compete and  when  they

start  competing where real market forces rule,  and  the

companies that have been developing entrepreneurial  type

of  path, they perform much worse than their competitors.

Why  is  this  so?   Well, it is because  of  their  well

cushioned start-up and growth, and they never had to face

the  realities  of life and they never learned  to  fight

where a level playing field existed.  In many cases, GLCs

used  the  excuse  of doing "national  service"  for  the

easier  than  commercial practices they took  in  running

their  businesses.   Had the Government  used  commercial

principles for such companies, this would not  have  been

an  issue today.  But having been listed, I believe, they

came  on  to market practices.  But the issue was  before

these companies were listed, how did they come about?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is one of incestuous

relationship  among GLCs and Government agencies  and  an

unlevel playing field, which Mr Leong talked about.   One

of  the problems which develops when the Government  also

gets  into  business, especially when the regulator  also

competes  with  companies  it regulates,  is  the  unfair

advantage   the   regulator's  related   companies   get.

Similarly,  the  Government agencies seem  to  give  many

contracts to GLCs and some examples include the Singapore

Food  Industries  supplying  food  to  MINDEF,  Singapore

Technologies supplying equipment to MINDEF too  and  most

of  the  Government agencies getting its computer and  IT

services  from  GLCs.   The issue, whether  perceived  or

true, is a big issue when viewed by everyone outside  the

Government  and  its agencies.  The way tender  documents

are written could also be a reason why such contracts get

issued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue related to the unlevel playing field

is  how banks rate subsidiaries of GLCs when deciding  on

financing  them, and Mr Leong talked about  his  personal

example  in the joint venture.  While it is not a  direct

problem  created  by the Government, it  does  exist  and

private  sector  companies which may have better  balance

sheets  than the GLC subsidiaries may not be able to  get

the   financing  while  the  GLC  subsidiaries  get  such

financing easily.  The only suggestion I can make here is

that Temasek and the Government must come out and make  a

very  clear  statement  that none of  its  companies  and

subsidiaries  will be rescued by them should  they  fail,

and  that  banks must credit rate all the  companies  and

subsidiaries on their own merit and not on the backing of

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this issue needs to be resolved by the

Government  and  it  is about time that  we  got  a  good

explanation as to why many such relationships exist today

and find a way to inject fairer practice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Statutory Boards Owning Companies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is one of statutory boards

owning companies, and this has been building up over  the

years.   There are many examples of such companies  under

statutory   boards,  like  JTC,  IE   Singapore,   Spring

Singapore, HDB, and a few more.  And then there are  also

all  the  NTUC  owned companies, which  Mr  Leong  talked

about.   The issue is how is the accountability  of  such

companies  handled.  No one gets a look at the practices,

corporate  governance  issues and  performances  of  such

companies,  except  for the parent  Government  agencies.

While  we  can accept that Temasek is trying to  practise

high standards of corporate governance and will insist on

high  standards  for  all  its  companies,  how  can  the

Government  assure  us  that there  is  also  a  standard

practice  for  all the companies owned by  its  agencies?

For  example,  Temasek  is now very  closely  watched  by

everyone, inside and outside the Government, and  Temasek

has  also  revealed its latest Charter and, in doing  so,

has promised a certain standard of performance.  But what

about  all the other companies not reporting to  Temasek?

None  of  the  statutory  boards  has  issued  a  similar

charter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should be very concerned about this

and get serious about either closing such companies under

statutory boards, or to immediately transfer all existing

companies to Temasek, so that Temasek can inject a higher

standard  of  corporate governance into  such  companies.

Currently,  all such companies are flying, what  I  call,

below  the  "radar detectors" and there  is  very  little

visibility and a lack of transparency and this is  not  a

healthy thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should go one step further to

disallow  any statutory board from forming companies  and

if it becomes totally unavoidable but to set up a company

under  the statutory board, it should include a timetable

for  an  exit, or a timetable for moving the  company  to

Temasek for ongoing management at the point of time  they

decide  to set up the company.  This approach will inject

some  discipline into statutory boards when they  try  to

set up their companies.

<br><br><i>People Running GLCs and Organisational Culture in GLCs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is one of people running GLCs

and  the  organisational culture in  GLCs.   This  issue,

while  a  sensitive one, needs to be discussed.  I  asked

the  question  of  whether  we  have  an  entrepreneurial

management  and a culture of innovation and  risk  taking

among  the  people in the boards and management  of  GLCs

earlier.   The answer probably is that we have  some  who

have  the entrepreneurial approach and take the necessary

risks  as  entrepreneurs would and these are  people  who

have  managed to change and make the switch from a  civil

service mentality to one of a private sector manager.  It

is  difficult to believe that a majority of those running

GLCs  have  the  necessary  mindset  and  skills  to  run

companies,  like private sector players,  simply  because

for  them,  the GLC role is just another job posting  for

their career.  Many have been handed the jobs on a silver

platter  and with all the necessary muscles to help  them

manage the business.  There is very little incentive  for

them  to  make tough decisions and to take the  necessary

risks  as entrepreneurs would.  Why should they risk  it,

when their career path is being ultimately planned by the

Government  and  its agencies?  I feel that  it  is  this

culture and the lack of the entrepreneurial management  I

mentioned earlier which caused PSA to lose its   business

to  a much more entrepreneurial Tanjung Pelepas and which

caused  SingTel some years ago to lose its deal on  Cable

and  Wireless to Pacific Century of Hong Kong.  Both took

too  long to react to the changing markets because of the

strong mindset of a state driven culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, along with the goal of making GLCs look

more  like  private companies, Temasek and the Government

should  also  make the changes in the way management  and

board  members are selected for GLCs, and Mr Leong talked

about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few months, we are starting to see

many changes at the board and the top management level of

GLCs as a result of the board level changes in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



Temasek.  I welcome this move, but would like to question

Temasek  why it took them so long to do this.  Obviously,

we  have  lived with the problems for so many  years  and

along with it, perhaps left the management weaknesses and

inefficiency in place for too long.  Can we afford to let

Temasek  do  such housekeeping only once in 10-20  years?

Surely, the answer is no, as Temasek should constantly be

reviewing these things.  It is critical that Temasek  has

a  proper process in place to ensure it selects the right

people  to  run  its companies and has a good  system  to

audit and review leadership in its companies.



<br><br><i>Crowding Out Effect</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fifth issue is one of the crowding out

effect that Mr Leong also talked about.  The issue of the

GLCs   crowding  out  the  private  sector  and  stifling

entrepreneurship   and  the  private   enterprise   among

Singaporeans  is  a  big and real  issue  and  should  be

addressed  quickly.  That is why Prof.  Michael  Porter's

exact  words  were,  and I quote, "we  have  to  get  the

Government out of the way".  Before the Government  tries

to   convince  Singaporeans  that  it  is  interested  in

promoting  an  entrepreneurial economy as  opposed  to  a

corporate economy driven by GLCs and MNCs alone, it  must

first  settle the issue of whether it is willing to leave

the  battle field.  My reading is that the Government has

a  half-hearted  view  on this and  when  key  people  in

Temasek  say  that  they will get even stronger  and  not

weaker in the domestic market, it confirms my view of the

half-heartedness.  If this is so, we have almost lost the

battle of promoting entrepreneurship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we accept the argument that, in the past,

the Government had to move into certain industries due to

market  failure and play a developmental role, is it  not

about  time  for  them  to be exiting  these  industries,

especially when there are enough private sector companies

which  can  do  a better job?  How many can  really  play

effectively  in  our small market?  How many  are  indeed

thinking  of going global?  Who are the best to lead  the

globalisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



challenge?  Obviously, the GLCs are the ones as they have

the muscles in place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, if Temasek, or any one of the

companies, wants to start a new business, the onus should

be  on Temasek to articulate and convince the public  why

it  is in line with Temasek Charter and why there are  no

private  sector companies capable of doing the same  job.

In  this  way,  instead  of GLCs  using  their  time  and

resources  to find ways to do more business  locally  and

therefore  getting into businesses like the  roast  ducks

and  the  Delifrances, they should see how they can  more

effectively go global with the same resources.   We  know

that, because of the sheer size and their resources, GLCs

can  beat  many  local companies in the  same  area  they

compete in, but is this really a useful exercise for  the

country  because,  at  the end of the  day,  we  are  all

playing  for the same result?  And how long can the  GLCs

continue to milk the domestic markets?



<br><br><i>New Role for Government in Business</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have listed many issues which are a result of

the  Government's  direct role in business.   As  I  have

stated earlier in my speech, we need to define a new role

for the Government if we want to successfully restructure

our  economy.  I am not saying that we should destroy the

role  or destroy GLCs, but acknowledge that GLCs do still

have  a  role  to  play  in  the  future.   To  be  fair,

therefore, we should not ask the Government to completely

exit, nor destroy value which has been created over  many

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instead of going into the specifics of the

recommendations  which  are  in  the  Report   that   was

published, I would like to talk about some statements  on

how  the  Government should be positioning  itself.   The

first and the most important commitment we need from  the

Government  is that it is willing to change  its  mindset

and  to get out of the way where private enterprises  can

do  an  equal or better job and if they can do a job  not

better than GLCs,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



then  help the private companies improve, rather than  to

continue   to  let  GLCs  grow.   As  I  mentioned,   the

Government  cannot be half hearted about this.   A  clear

statement needs to be made.  From a national perspective,

effort put in to groom local companies has the same value

as  in  trying to groom GLCs.  With this mindset  change,

many  more  things can be done and these are  the  things

that  we have recommended in the report of the EISC under

the chairmanship of Mr Raymond Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, instead of considering each other as

competitors  all the time, we should build a  culture  of

trust  and  partnership  among  GLCs  and  local  private

companies.   Until  today, there has  been  too  much  of

suspicion and distrust.  If we could change this  culture

to one of partnership and cooperation, then together head

towards  global market as a team, our chances of  success

will  be greatly enhanced.  All companies, big and small,

should  focus  on how they can leverage on  each  other's

strengths as competitive threat to foreign companies in a

global  market.  The Government could play a very  useful

role in facilitating this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Government should be focusing more on

playing a developmental role rather than a direct role in

business.   In  creating  a  conducive  environment   and

allowing private companies to test-bed their products and

services,  it  will  go a long way in helping  to  create

stronger  local companies.  Similarly, instead of  taking

the  easy way out of creating a new division under a GLC,

or to form new companies within the statutory boards, the

Government  should encourage the outsourcing of  products

and services as much as possible as is being done in many

countries, including US and the UK.  The current practice

of  GLCs creating subsidiaries after subsidiaries  is  no

longer acceptable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, there is a great lack of risk capital

available  for private companies.  The many VC  funds  we

have  in  Singapore are focused on later stage financing.

The  Government could move in and play a role of  a  risk

capital provider, either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



directly or indirectly through the GLCs.  Instead of just

focusing  on creating companies, the Government  and  its

agencies,  including  Temasek,  should  make  more   risk

capital  available  to the private sector  and  focus  on

facilitating  the  development  of  new  private   sector

companies.



<br><br><i>Temasek's Response and its Charter</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final topic I would like to cover is my

response to the Temasek Charter and on areas which I feel

are  not  adequately addressed.  The first  one  is  that

there  is no statement of greater transparency in Temasek

Charter.   I  was a little disappointed that nothing  has

been said about how Temasek will be much more transparent

than it has been all this time.  If the public is to have

confidence  that Temasek will be professional in  running

its companies and if we want everyone to feel comfortable

that  once Temasek is in charge of any Government created

businesses,   decisions  will  be  made  on  commercially

acceptable  terms, then we must take the necessary  steps

to  build  the  trust first.  I therefore hope  that  the

Minister   for  Finance  will  put  in  place  sufficient

mechanics   to  ensure  that  Temasek  will   remain   as

transparent as possible.  If Temasek is indeed doing  the

right  things, then there is no reason to fear and resist

greater  transparency.  While I have  the  confidence  in

many  of the people in Temasek, I also feel that it is  a

little too reckless for us to just depend on a few people

for   things  which  have  a  tremendous  impact  on  the

Singapore  economy.   I  therefore  again  ask  for  more

transparency  and, along with it, greater  accountability

from  the  people  in charge.  Similarly,  we  must  have

greater   transparency  from  GIC  and  other  Government

agencies managing public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Temasek should release, as Mr Leong

mentioned,  an  annual  "state of  the  GLC"  report  for

Singaporeans to understand what goes on in Temasek.   The

real question is, while Temasek audits its companies, who

audits Temasek?  Is it good enough to leave it to  a  few

people in Government to audit itself?  And I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



this  traditional  practice is no  longer  convincing  to

people.



<br><br><i>Divestment - Form and Timing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second thing that was not adequately

covered in Temasek Charter was its policy on divestment - the  form  and timing of it.  While Temasek has mentioned

its  desire  to divest businesses which are non-core  and

which  are  non-strategic, it has not spelt  out  how  it

plans to do it and what the timetable is.  I recall, when

the  EISC  released  its report suggesting  a  divestment

strategy for GLCs, the first reaction from the members of

the  press was - so, what is new, and they were referring

to  a  report, which Mr Leong also mentioned, which  they

called  the Michael Fam report about divestment of  GLCs.

Their  point  was  that there have  been  no  significant

divestments,  some  but  not  fast  enough  and,  on  the

contrary,  as Mr Leong pointed out, there are  many  more

GLCs  that  have  been created after that.   I  therefore

would  like  to see a clearer statement from Temasek  and

the   Government  on  its  divestment  plans,   including

divesting by non-traditional ways like MBOs and JVs.  The

NatSteel  way  was one example of such a  non-traditional

approach.



<br><br><i>Being fair to SMEs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is one of being fair to SMEs.

One  complaint which has been brought up to my  attention

is   the  business  practice  of  bigger  companies,   in

particular  the GLCs.  The issue, among others,  includes

one  of  payment terms and paying on time.  It is  almost

described as a "bullying tactic" by a number of people  I

spoke to, and this was brought up in some of the Feedback

sessions that I chaired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I studied this issue, I learned of two examples

which  should be role models for Temasek to  follow,  and

for  the  Government too.  The first,  I  realise,  there

existed  a directive from the Prime Minister's office  in

Malaysia,  instructing all its agencies  to  be  fair  to

local companies and to pay promptly, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



should  local companies feel that they have been unfairly

treated,  the  Prime Minister's office  will  investigate

into  the  matter.  The second practice,  which  is  more

widely  known,  is the practice of the oil giant,  Shell,

which  has  a special audit committee which ensures  that

all its suppliers are paid on time and fairly treated.  I

was  told that in Shell, business units find it so  tough

dealing with this audit committee that they rather  spend

their  time treating their suppliers fairly than to  face

the brunt of this committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not suggesting that the "bullying

phenomenon"  is rampant in Singapore and is being  widely

practised  by the Government agencies, but  it  would  be

prudent  to set up a similar committee in Government  and

one  in Temasek, so that we send a strong signal that the

interests of private companies are well taken care of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to urge the

Government  to  give  a  concrete response  to  the  EISC

recommendations and to address the missing gaps  which  I

have  mentioned.   I feel that if we are  indeed  serious

about  making the transformation from a corporate  to  an

entrepreneurial    economy,   the    Government    should

immediately  resolve  all  the  issues  which  have  been

raised,  and  to  operationalise the many recommendations

the EISC has made.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.  I would

like  to  declare my interest as an employee  of  Temasek

Holdings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Motion is, in essence, a discussion of the

role of Government in business, whether the Government is

a regulator, promoter or a participant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important discussion, but it derives

meaning  only  when  it is made in  the  context  of  the

realities of the marketplace that Singapore competes  in.

I would like now to offer my take on two harsh realities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reality is of increasing globalisation.

Increasing  globalisation of the marketplace  is  not  an

option  nor a passing fad, but is a reality that we  have

to    address   head-on   as   an   on-going   challenge.

Globalisation has real significance for us  in  Singapore

as  we  do  not  have  our own hinterland,  unlike  major

markets  like the US or Europe.  The lack of a hinterland

is  most  keenly  felt by Singaporean  entrepreneurs  and

companies who have already ventured abroad.  We  have  no

critical mass of our own and cannot pretend that  we  can

sustain businesses purely domestically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans have asked if we can pump prime

our  economy  or consume our way out of a recession,  and

the  answer  is  no.   Our economy depends  too  much  on

external demand for us to be able to prop the economy  up

by   merely  raising  expenditure.   Hence,  to   sustain

economic growth, not only do we have to ensure there  are

enough  inbound investments, but we have also  to  source

growth potential from outside Singapore as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine if Singapore Airlines were to just fly

mainly Singaporeans from Singapore to other destinations,

and  no  one else, nor from anywhere else, then it  would

not  have half the chance of Ansett and would have folded

up  long ago.  Or that if Singapore Telecom were to  just

cater  to  the  domestic  market,  growth  would  require

organic  expansion  domestically and increased  usage  of

telecommunication services or, in simple  terms,  we  all

need  to  talk a little more over the phone.  Or that  if

Yeo  Hiap  Seng had remained in Singapore, with  our  low

population  growth rates, how many more tins  of  chicken

curry and packet drinks can Singaporeans consume?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, expanding outside Singapore is no longer a

wish but an imperative for most businesses, regardless of

ownership.  We have to get out of our comfort  zone.   We

must  now think GNP (Gross National Product) and not  GDP

(Gross Domestic Product).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second reality is one of intensifying

competition.   Increasing globalisation  brings  with  it

pressure to break



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



down   protectionist  barriers,  and   hence   heightened

competition.   In  a  free market such  as  ours,  fierce

competition  from  all players, big or  small,  local  or

foreign, has already been felt.  This is most evident  in

the  retail sector.  Take the supermarkets, for  example.

I  recall,  when I was young, going to the  NTUC  Welcome

Supermarket at Beo Crescent was a real treat.   Nowadays,

it  is  almost  a must for most working couples.   It  is

therefore  almost  inevitable that the smaller  provision

shops  will find it tougher to compete unless they  offer

that   something  special.   We  may  think   that   NTUC

Fairprice, as it is called now, has it easier.  But  they

too  have  to compete against foreign-owned players  like

Cold Storage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is our response? In the face of these

externally-driven  challenges,  we  need   not   despair.

However,  we  need  to  examine  our  position  from  the

following two perspectives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What are our skills and strengths that we can

leverage on to get out of our comfort zone; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) How do we position Singapore? Who are the

players here and how can they relate to each other?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on skills and strengths. Over the years,

we  have built up substantial expertise as a services hub

in airport and seaport management, telecommunications and

financial services.  Hence, we should be actively seeking

ways   of  exporting  these  capabilities  abroad.    For

example,  we  should  not centre our  airport  management

services around yet more terminals at Changi but at other

regional  or Asian airports.  Likewise, whatever  seaport

management expertise we have built up over the years, eg,

in  vessel  connectivity,  should  be  actively  promoted

elsewhere as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our human capital should not be ignored too. As a

people,  we  have  been respected for our  integrity  and

diligence.   These are useful values to build  management

and  the labour force at large upon.  We should certainly

not  be  arrogant  but  be prepared  to  explore  foreign

postings as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



part and parcel of our working lives.  Getting out of our

comfort zone is not easy, but if we accept that it is not

only   inevitable  but  that  it  can  also  be  a   rich

experience,   I   believe  we  can  all   become   better

contributors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the flip side to identifying our strengths is

the   need  to  validate  the  tried-and-tested   success

formula.  Industry and market conditions are now changing

with a vengeance.  Hence, we need to constantly check our

assumptions.   What has worked well before  in  terms  of

achieving  pure  efficiency may now be a  value-for-money

proposition.   This  is  well  illustrated   within   the

logistics  area  where  value  is  sometimes  defined  as

"getting  goods  off  the  balance  sheet"  rather   than

shipping to the destination in the fastest possible time.

In a nutshell, we must test every assumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, identifying roles of players. Sir, the

Motion  revolves around the role that each sector  should

play   in   building  GDP.   According  to  the  official

statistics, the table of which was circulated by the hon.

Member, Mr Leong Horn Kee, the MNCs accounted for  a  42%

share,  followed by an implied 36% share by  the  non-GLC

private  sector, 13% by the GLCs, and 9%  by  the  public

sector.   However, unlike Mr Leong Horn  Kee,  I  do  not

think  it  is complete to discuss the relative shares  of

GDP on a locally-owned basis, as it ignores the role that

MNCs  play.   We should not limit ourselves to  the  many

possibilities  that the MNCs can interact  with  our  own

enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the significant role that MNCs play, the

EDB's efforts in promoting investments must continue full

steam  ahead.  Last year, the EDB managed to secure  some

$9  billion worth of investment commitments.  This is  no

small  feat  and demonstrates that Singapore  has  indeed

been  nimble-footed.   We  must  continue  to  have  this

mindset,  both the Government as promoter and the  people

as human capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst investments by MNCs have helped spur and will

continue to spur the development of supporting cluster



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



services,  we need to build up our own capabilities,  our

own  enterprise,  for both GLCs and the non-GLCs  in  the

private  sector.  Some of the GLCs, as we all know,  have

evolved with Singapore's history.  They nonetheless still

need  to hold their own in the global marketplace.   They

must  do  this  by building on their core  competence  to

continue to expand outside Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the imperative is equally applicable to the non-GLCs, as the marketplace does not differentiate between

ownership,  whether it is Government, private,  local  or

foreign, but only the level of competitiveness.   Pooling

of   interests  can  therefore  be  mutually  beneficial.

Towards   this   end,   given  our   limited   resources,

collaboration must surely be the name of the game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But collaboration can only exist and be meaningful

if  mutual  benefits can truly be derived.  I would  urge

both  GLCs and non-GLCs, especially the small and  medium

enterprises,  to  identify common areas  of  focus,  say,

within   a  cluster,  where  collaboration  is  possible.

Similar  collaborations between MNCs and local  companies

should also be actively structured and pursued.  I  would

also  urge  the relevant Government agencies to  be  more

focused  in  their promotional efforts and  to  emphasise

substance  over  form.   For  example,  do  not  be   too

preoccupied  with  the degree of participation  in  trade

delegations  but  with  the number of  concrete  business

ventures  or  relationships  that  result  from  a  trade

delegation's visit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the principle of

promoting  private  enterprise  and  entrepreneurship  in

Singapore.   However,  Sir, whilst  we  should  certainly

spend time and effort to address specific concerns of the

private  sector,  we  should take  extreme  care  not  to

quibble excessively over domestic space, as the world may

just pass us by.



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

listened with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



great  interest  to  the speakers  before  me.   I  guess

nothing  more wonderfully concentrates the mind  than  to

have  a Motion that debates the recommendations of a sub-committee  in  which the paternity ultimately  lies  with

oneself.  I would however like to thank but not implicate

Mr Inderjit Singh for the work that he did as Chairman of

the Focus Group on Government in Business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC released the part of its report dealing

with  Government in Business on 30th May this year.   The

Temasek Charter took this into account.  The full  report

of the EISC recommending ways to strengthen the spirit of

entrepreneurship  and  innovation  in  Singapore  and  to

foster  the growth and internationalisation of Singapore-based companies will be released in September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought it would be useful to give Members

some  perspectives  on the thinking that  went  into  the

EISC's recommendations.  But, first, let me deal with one

recommendation  that  was  strongly  urged  on  the  sub-committee  but  which  we did not  adopt.   This  was  to

recommend  a  huge sell-off of the GLCs  to  the  private

sector, or what the press has dubbed a "Great GLC  Sale".

If  we  had done that, then we would have gone far enough

and bold enough, I think, in their view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal case for rapid privatisation is that

it  will  significantly improve the  performance  of  the

GLCs.   To support this contention, its proponents  often

cite    anecdotes    of   under-performing    state-owned

enterprises,  rather than systematic studies.   Anecdotes

are,  of  course, better than nothing, but they are  weak

foundations  to base economic policy prescriptions.   The

problem  with  anecdotes is that the  contrary  case  can

always be cited.  For instance, the argument here is that

there is something inherent in Government ownership which

causes    state-owned   enterprises   to   under-perform.

Singapore   Airlines  is  a  company   with   substantial

Government ownership but, as we all know, it  is  one  of

the  best  airlines in the world.  Then, there is  Changi

Airport,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



which is wholly owned by the Government, but that has not

stopped  it  from  being consistently voted  by  business

travellers as the best of the breed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotes often reflect the fashion of the times.

When  I  was  a  student  in the  1970s  and  1980s,  the

prevailing  school  of thought then was  that  the  state

should  play a leading role in the market.  It was called

"governing the market", and Japan and Korea were cited as

stellar  examples of this.  Lester Thurow  wrote  a  book

"Head  to Head" in which he predicted that unless America

took a leaf out of Japan Inc's strategy book, it would be

cleaned  out  by the Japanese in the global  marketplace.

That  book  topped  the  best-seller  list  and,  for  an

economics  book,  that was really quite  an  achievement.

Today,  if we were to suggest this, we would be dismissed

by derisive laughter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fashion of the 1990s had been privatisation and

market liberalisation.  This Washington Consensus has led

the  IMF  and the World Bank to urge developing countries

to   privatise  rapidly,  privatise  even  when  critical

complementary  conditions are not present -  competition,

hard budgets and commitment.  The result is not pretty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, before we rush off and join the chorus that

"Government  ownership invariably leads to  inefficiency,

and private ownership is the way to raise the performance

of  the  GLCs",  we  better ask  ourselves  what  is  the

empirical evidence to support this policy recommendation.

I  have plowed through the literature and the bottom-line

is  that  there  is no conclusive finding  that  this  is

indeed  the  case.  The World Bank commissioned  a  study

which was released in 1995, "Bureaucrats in Business" and

it said that in competitive markets, there was an edge to

private ownership.  "An edge", not a mountain of evidence

that private ownership would indeed enhance efficiency in

state-owned enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it not more decisive? The reason lies with

the  basis  of  the argument for privatisation.   At  its

heart,  the  privatisation argument posits  that  private

owners,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



unlike   Government  owners,  have  a  greater   economic

incentive  to maximise shareholder value, as  they  would

benefit more directly from such actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is not necessarily the case with

large  enterprises.   Large  enterprises  -  private   or

Government-owned  -  suffer  from  the   same   incentive

problems.  In a large private company, the separation  of

owners   and  control  leads  to  substantial  management

autonomy  that allows managers the discretion to  act  in

their own rather than shareholders' interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, there is a significant information

asymmetry  between  the  owners  and  the  managers.  The

managers   will  be  able  to  run  circles   round   the

shareholders as they have the information advantage.  The

acquisition of the requisite information incurs  economic

costs.  This problem is then compounded by the fact  that

good  management  is a public good.  If  one  shareholder

acts,  then  all benefit.  And in the nature  of  such  a

good,  this free rider problem would negate the incentive

for a small shareholder to monitor the firm's executives.

To   ignore   information  costs  in   an   analysis   of

organisational  behaviour is like having  Hamlet  without

the Prince.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need look no further for evidence of this than in

the  corporate scandals that are now rocking Wall Street.

Has  there been, in recent times, any destruction of  the

public   interest  greater  than  that  by   the   senior

executives of Enron of their shareholders?  Yet Enron was

a company that was owned by private shareholders, not the

US government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were tomorrow to divest completely the

Government's  stakes by issuing shares  in  GLCs  to  all

Singaporeans, this will not lead to enhanced  performance

of these companies.  People's capitalism, as some Eastern

European countries had practised since the wall came down

in  Berlin,  suffers  from the fact that  there  are  few

shareholders  with  sufficient amounts  invested  in  the

companies  so  that  they have a strong  enough  economic

interest to ensure that the firm is well-managed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was why the EISC did not recommend a "Great GLC

Sale" as some had hoped.  Privatisation may have the edge

in raising efficiency but it is not a given and it raises

the question as to who the GLCs should be sold to, so  as

to ensure direction and control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, as Mr Inderjit Singh has said, the way

we  saw  it,  the  central issue was the proper  role  of

Government  in business in this innovation-driven  world.

In  the early post-independence years, the Government was

the  entrepreneur  as  it  took entrepreneurial  risk  by

investing   in  companies  such  as  Singapore  Airlines,

Neptune Orient Lines and the shipyards. There was then  a

dearth  of  private capital to embark on these  kinds  of

project.  As both Mr Leong and Mr Singh have said, today,

with   well-developed  markets,  the  case   for   direct

Government   involvement  in  business   is   much   less

compelling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the basis on which we recommended that

statutory  boards should adopt a Yellow Pages rule.  This

means that statutory boards should not set up enterprises

when  there are private sector players that are providing

or  able  to  provide  the service.  In  fact,  statutory

boards   should  seize  such  opportunities  to   provide

business to the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be that companies owned by statutory

boards,  with proper incentive structures, could  provide

the  service as efficiently as the private sector but the

issue  is  what should be the role of these boards.   Our

view  is  that if the market can provide it,  then  these

Government  bodies should concentrate on  regulation  and

promotion  of  business  activities  rather  than  be  in

business themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have criticised this Yellow Pages rule on the

ground that some of these statutory board-owned companies

fulfill  social  goals.  Like all  rules,  there  can  be

exceptions to it but I would be slow to make them as even

when  there  are social objectives, this can  be  written

into  the  contract for the provision of these  goods  or

services by the private producer.  For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



example,  take  broadcasting.  If it is deemed  desirable

that  all  television stations must have a news  segment,

this  can  be written as a condition of the licence.   If

additional public service broadcast programmes are deemed

desirable,   then   rather   than   for   the   Singapore

Broadcasting  Authority to produce them, it  can  provide

for  them  by paying the broadcasters to do these.   This

is,  in  fact, what the SBA is doing, rather  than  going

into the business of public broadcasting itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the GLCs, it does not make sense for

the EISC to recommend that they abide by the Yellow Pages

rule.  As Mr Leong has said, the horse has already bolted

from the stable.  It is in this context that we recommend

that Temasek divests its non-strategic assets so that  it

can  concentrate its resources in areas where it can make

the most difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the key, we believe, to pressure GLCs to

perform  is  competition.  It is  telling  that  our  two

Government-owned world-beaters - SIA and CAAS  -  operate

in   a   globally  competitive  environment  since  their

inception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we started our report by recommending a

competition law. Competition provides the incentives  for

individuals  and  companies  to  perform.   It  allows  a

benchmark  to  assess performance so that proper  rewards

and penalties can be instituted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But competition will only pressure GLCs if they face

a  hard  budget constraint.  This was why we  argue  that

there  should not be subsidies, privileges or other forms

of  soft capital that will enable them to compete without

improving  efficiency.  A hard budget will  also  address

the oft-repeated concerns of private firms that they face

unfair competition from the GLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, competition and hard budgets will only work if

there is a Government commitment that the GLCs are to  be

run strictly as commercial entities.  This means that the

Government must not interfere with the operations of  the

GLCs such as hiring and firing managers and workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



and stopping money-losing services.  Social and political

goals  that the Government might have should not be  part

of the objectives of the GLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the enabling conditions that the EISC felt

would  help enhance the performance of our GLCs.   Though

the  evidence  may  be slight when it  comes  to  whether

privatisation   alone   makes  a  difference   to   GLCs'

performance,  it  is  unambiguous  that  a  comprehensive

strategy  of  divestiture, competition, hard budgets  and

commitment,  pursued  as a whole, will  help  create  the

conditions necessary for growth and performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, to those who argue single-mindedly for a

"Great  GLC Sale", they may wish to note that "there  are

more  things  in heaven and earth than are dreamt  of  in

their philosophy."



<br>4.52 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government's  involvement  in  private  sector   business

started   way  back,  almost  about  the  same  time   as

Singapore's  industralisation  effort,  soon  after   the

British  withdrawal  in  1968.   To  handle  the  growing

Government's  involvement in business,  Temasek  Holdings

was   established  in  1974.   Presumably,  flushed  with

success,  Government's involvement in the private  sector

continued to proliferate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the public concern, the rationale for

Government's involvement in private sector was laid  down

by Dr Goh Keng Swee, DPM and Minister for Defence, at the

Income's  AGM on 20th June 1977.  Typical of Dr  Goh,  he

gave the reason in very simple terms and to the point.  I

would like to state them to refresh our understanding  of

the basic rationale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, he stated that Government's involvement was

to  encourage  the  private sector  to  take  the  plunge

through  joint ventures.  He gave the example of National

Iron   and   Steel,  Jurong  Shipyard,   National   Green

Elevators, Sugar Industry of Singapore and so on.  And as

the economy grew, the Development Bank of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



Singapore and Intraco were established to fulfill what Dr

Goh referred to as new needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to meet specific needs, Primary Industries

Enterprises  was set up to process agricultural  products

by  local  farmers - a pretty old industry, I  must  say.

Falling into this category of specific needs, we find the

Mindef  companies established to meet the  needs  of  the

SAF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to handle the odd case here and there. Dr

Goh gave the example of Singapore Food Industry to tackle

the problem of corrupt practices among cooks employed  by

Mindef  leading  to the failure of the tender  system  in

sourcing  for  meat and vegetables.  Presumably,  Dr  Goh

raised  this  matter  in public to address  some  of  the

public  concerns.   It is interesting to  note  that  the

principles  laid down by Dr Goh are ingrained in  Temasek

Holdings'  latest Charter as well where it has classified

its  companies into Group A and Group B.  In Group A,  we

find  companies  where Government would  like  to  retain

control and ownership for strategic reasons and in  Group

B,  we  find  companies with regional  and  international

potentials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite Dr Goh's assurance in 1977, Government-linked companies continued its expansion into the private

sector.  In August 1983, in this House, Dr Toh Chin  Chye

put the question to the then Minister for Finance, Mr Hon

Sui   Sen,  during  Question  Time  as  to  whether   the

Government companies should be allowed to crowd  out  the

private  sector.  Of course, Dr Toh did it  in  his  very

colourful  language, referring to the case of PIE  flying

in 1,500 breeding pigs by jumbo jets.  Apparently, Dr Toh

must  be  referring to the fact that PIE was engaging  in

some  activities  that the private sector  could  perform

which  contravened the principle laid  down  by  Dr  Goh.

Unfortunately,  there  was  no definitive  response  from

Government  in  that  particular  exchange.   Clearly,  I

think,  by then, the tentacles of the GLCs have grown  so

numerous and so pervasive that no one single agency has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



total control or oversight on the reach of the GLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, public complaints about Government's

involvement  continued through the years with  the  pitch

rising  during times of economic slowdown and  adding  in

times  of  economic booms.  After the  formation  of  the

Feedback Unit in 1985 under my good friend, Dr Tan  Cheng

Bock  as  Chairman, there exists now, in its archives,  a

collection  of public comments on this particular  topic.

I  would  like  to  give a sample of  these  comments  to

indicate  the gist of public complaints over a period  of

the past 20 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1985, Dr Dixie Tan, then MP for Ulu Pandan,

in  a  note to Matthias Yao, Head of Feedback Unit  then,

wrote,  "Government  companies are competing  with  local

companies in every area and with unfair advantage.   Even

abroad,   private  companies  have  to  compete   against

Singapore  Government companies."  In the same  year,  Mr

Tan  Tuan  Seng  wrote  a letter  to  the  Feedback  Unit

regarding  the  uphill task of budding  entrepreneurs  in

Singapore facing stiff competition from GLCs.  Under  the

heading,  "Better  Entrepreneur", he  lamented  that  the

playing  field  was  uneven  with  GLCs  having  all  the

resources and all the work references.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I would like to share with you some of the

more  recent comments received by the Feedback Unit.   In

July  2001, a contributor commented that the SME and  the

coffeeshop  network is filled with complaints about  GLCs

and  Government statutory board corporations.  Is there a

need  for  Government to compete with  the  citizens  for

jobs?   If  GLCs and these corporatised statutory  boards

exist  to  complement the economy, they should take  this

time  to  outsource more of their jobs  to  locals.   Why

corporatise statutory boards like Civil Service  College,

PSB,  IPT  and many others?  The complaints are  greatest

now if the Government is the regulator and the player  in

the market.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in August 2001, on the feedback on PWD

Consultants,  a commentator said so, "The  Government  is

releasing  public  jobs  that  account  for  70%  of  the

construction work now to ease the slowdown but these jobs

are  headed  for GLCs that have a moratorium  in  a  way.

Such  public  works should be distributed to the  private

sector  to  ensure that the private sector stays  afloat.

In  recent years, the moratorium has increased  from  two

years  to five years and now more and more GLCs are being

privatised to compete in the private industry."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I took time to bring up this

example  to  highlight that over a  20-year  period,  the

views expressed were basically the same.  In other words,

nothing  very much has changed despite all this feedback.

It  is also disturbing to me that it took the more severe

recession  in our history to make the Government  sit  up

and  set  up  the  EISC, and then pay attention  to  this

complaint.   It  is pertinent to note that  many  of  the

recent  comments received by the Feedback Unit were  made

before the formation of the Economic Review Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the work of the Feedback Unit, I

would like to point out that there is a group within  the

Feedback  Unit  known as the Economic Development  Group.

It  was set up under the leadership of Dr John Chen,  the

former  Chairman of the Feedback Unit.   It  is  a  loose

association  of  feedback contributors who  gather  about

once a month to discuss topics of interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Group formed a sub-committee on developing a pro-enterprise environment in

the  new economy.  It submitted a recommendation in April

2001.   That  report  talked  about  how  to  create   an

environment that is pro-entrepreneurial and pro-business.

And  in the 2002 annual conference of the feedback  group

in July this year, Mr George Abraham presented a paper on

the  remaking of the Singapore economy incorporating  the

work  of  the  Economic Development  Group  and  the  SME

Feedback  Group.  It is interesting to me  that  many  of

these views were reflected in the recommendations of  the

EISC Report.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



It is heartening that the views expressed by the feedback

contributors have found  sympathetic ears in the EISC.  I

believe  that  the Feedback Unit has contributed  to  the

review  of  Government's stand on this matter.   I  would

like  to  thank the many contributors who have  played  a

part in moulding public opinion on this topic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, next, I would like to explore

whether the EISC Report, the new Temasek Charter as  well

as  this  debate  on  the Motion  will  be  effective  in

curtailing  Government's involvement in business.   Based

on  the behaviour of the Government in establishing  GLCs

over  the  past  20  years, I must  say  that  I  am  not

optimistic.   I am not saying so because I think  we  are

not serious about doing what is best for Singapore.  I am

saying so because there are factors involved.  Firstly, I

believe  that when good times come back, this issue  will

also  recede  from  the  public  consciousness,  and  the

pressure will not be that great.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I think we have to go to the

fundamentals  and  perhaps try to understand  the  forces

that  have  been  driving the ever increasing  Government

involvement  in  business.  Unless  we  understand  these

factors and take the appropriate steps to mitigate  them,

I  think  Government will continue to spin off companies.

Just by observing the outcomes, it seems to me that there

are   powerful  forces  pushing  the  various  Government

departments, agencies and statutory boards  to  spin  off

companies.  I am not saying that there is a directive  of

the Government to do so.  But it is just that doing so is

a well beaten and tested path.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these forces? Firstly, spin-off allows the

various  Government departments to shed excess  manpower.

It seems to me that Government departments, like everyone

else, need to stay young and relevant, and they do so  by

recruiting   younger   staff  and  inducting   Government

scholars.  Therefore, spinning off groups to form private

companies  helps to keep the total number of staff  small

which  is,  as  we all know, an objective  of  the  civil

service guidelines.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, hiving off assets helps to reduce the

asset  base  of  these organisations.   Of  course,  such

assets  were  assessed  at  the  proper  values  and  the

Government did not suffer in privatisation.  However,  in

the  books  of  the parent departments and organisations,

that base is reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two recent examples come to mind. Firstly, Acasia

of    JTC   and,   secondly,   PWD   Consultants.    Both

organisations were granted moratorium from competition to

entice  staff  to  leave the comfort zone  of  the  civil

service, and to take the plunge into the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also, on a previous occasion

in   this  House,  touched  upon  the  public  perception

regarding  the  existence of corporatised entity  helping

the rejuvenation of the civil service and the SAF through

parachuting senior officers into such GLCs.  I understand

from  the  DPM that the employment of all these staff  by

the  GLCs  is  through the market force.   However,  this

perception remains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think these factors driving the formation of

GLCs  are powerful ones, and they are unlikely to go away

just  because  of  this  debate  in  Parliament  and  the

adoption of the EISC Report.  I believe it will require a

strong  commitment  from  the  Government  to  stop   the

continuous encroachment into the private sector.  Whether

the  Government would do so will depend on the answer  to

the next question I have in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: is the existence of GLCs

contributing to the dearth of entrepreneurs in Singapore?

We do not have definitive answers but I believe there are

sufficient  indications that this is so.   For  instance,

many  young  and capable people will be asking themselves

why  should  they  take  the  risk  to  start  their  own

companies  if  they could become  CEOs of  GLCs  just  by

going  through  the academic route  -  be  Government  or

SAF scholars, perform well in the public sector and serve

their  term.  My friend, Mr Inderjit Singh, has mentioned

that the career path will be taken care of and the system

will take care of them, and they will become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



corporate  captains of  large corporations sometime  down

the  road.   At  least, that is what many young  men  and

women  will conclude by observing the career path of  the

many CEOs of GLCs today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is this perception good for Singapore? In my

mind,  it is doubtful whether men and women who are  used

to  a  command and control environment would  necessarily

make good entrepreneurs.  Some of them would make it, but

perhaps after some very painful experience at the expense

of  public  money.  I believe many of us could  think  of

examples  that illustrate my point.  On the  other  hand,

several  of the really successful companies that continue

to  do  well  in  this recession in Singapore  are  small

companies  started by entrepreneurs, and I could  name  a

few   -  Hyflux started by Olivia Lum who is now an  NMP,

Osim  started  by Ron Sim and Accord Express,  a  company

mentioned by PM in his National Day Rally speech.   These

are  true  entrepreneurs and Singapore would do  well  to

have  more of them.  Thus, while creating more GLCs might

be  the  expedient thing for the Government to do in  the

short term, it might actually be detrimental to the long-term  viability  of Singapore in a fast  changing  world.

Only  when  we are convinced that this is the case  would

the  tendency and propensity to create more GLCs  in  the

future be curtailed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am supportive of the new Temasek

Charter  and  the  recommendations of  the  EISC,  it  is

important  for us to address the fundamental questions  I

raised.   Only  when we accept the answers  honestly  and

with  a clear mind would we be able to avoid the pitfalls

of  Singapore  evolving into an outwardly private  sector

economy  but actually dominated by the GLCs,  an  economy

which  we affectionately refer to Singapore Incorporated,

an  economy that will perform well but will flounder  and

look  for  guidance in bad times.  To me,  Sir,  how  the

Government   decides  on  this  particular  matter   will

determine  whether  Singapore will  evolve  into  a  high

performance entrepreneurial economy or will always remain

an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



economy  that  is  tied  to the  umbilical  cord  of  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Leong Horn Kee

spoke  about  the  differences  between  Hong  Kong   and

Singapore,  how  Hong  Kong  has  become  a  nursery   of

entrepreneurs  while Singapore is  really  a  desert.   I

would like to continue this analogy between Singapore and

Hong  Kong  and  set the substance of my debate  in  this

context.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and Hong Kong are successful city states.

We are the envy of countries big and small.  Every time a

country like East Timor gets independence, they say  they

want to be like Singapore.  We have arrived today at  our

positions   by  very  different  routes.   I   need   not

elaborate.  Hong Kong grew with minimal governance  -   a

bottom-up  approach  -  while Singapore largely prospered

because of Government's top-down approach.  Hong Kong  is

trying  to be a bit like Singapore.  Singapore is  trying

to be a bit like Hong Kong.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>5.10 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, after 30 years of relentless economic growth

in  both city states, we have reached a crossroad.   Hong

Kong and Singapore are pausing, taking stock and both are

scratching  their heads, but I think these  questions  of

how  to  go  forward from here focus the  minds  of  both

governments.   But in the case of Singapore, fortunately,

because  of  our industrial policies, much criticised  no

doubt, I think we have more levers to pull than Hong Kong

-   more levers to pull for entrepreneurs, more levers to

pull  for  all  Singaporeans.  Our decisive advantage  is

really the GLCs, and here I confine myself to the Temasek

Holdings  companies  and not the  NTUC  companies,  which

really  serve  the  domestic  market.   I  want  to  talk

something  about the NTUC-linked companies  a  bit  later

on.  Because only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



Temasek  has the clout to anchor Singapore to  the  world

beyond  our  shores.   We  have  many  entrepreneurs   in

Singapore.  Some of them are sitting in this House.   But

for  them  to reach out beyond our shores is  really  one

leap  too far.  Only Temasek can give us what I call  the

GNP  effect   -  the GDP plus net foreign earnings.  What

for?   To  compensate for a slowing GDP which  is  almost

inevitable,  because  of  an  aging  population   and   a

declining birth rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, back to Hong Kong. The laissez-faire economy

in  Hong  Kong has always been paraded as the  utopia  of

entrepreneurs.  Mr Leong proudly said that Hong Kong  has

12  billionaires.  Singapore has five billionaires.   The

fact  is that they are richer than us.  They have  double

our  population  notwithstanding.  But whether  they  are

entrepreneurs  of the breed that inspire  confidence  and

envy  is  quite  different.  I will  quote  an  Economist

article  entitled "Face Value  -  Asia's superman  swoops

again".   Basically, it is about Mr Li, but  the  opening

paragraph is instructive. It is worth reading.  It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In all honesty [in typical Economist style] most of

Asia's  tycoons no matter how illustrious they appear  at

home  are really keepers of glorified mom and pop  shops.

The exception is Mr Li Ka Shing."



I will talk about Mr Li a bit later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how did they become billionaires? There are

many reasons.  The Economist went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Among many reasons, they were developers who simply

rode with land prices."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality in Hong Kong today is a noisy market

place,  crowded with thousands of entrepreneurs who  are,

in the final analysis, owners of SMEs and glorified sweat

shops.  They perform useful roles.  Please do not get  me

wrong.   They  provide employment for the  masses.   They

provide hope.  But the world has changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the economic food chain of the WTO, the new

regime,  it is a big fish eat small fish scenario.   Hong

Kong's cousins, their brethrens, from mainland China, are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



beginning to eat Hong Kong SMEs and sweat shop owners  as

fish feed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is this. In Hong Kong, a

few  tycoons and their gargantuan holding companies, like

Cheung  Kong  and Hutchinson Whampoa, dominate  the  Hong

Kong  economy.  People do not see that.  Together,  these

companies and the tycoons employ hundreds of thousands of

workers,  and  their decisions influence the  destiny  of

Hong Kong and HongKongers.  These tycoons own an eclectic

group  of businesses, sometimes totally unrelated.   They

are  like the mini-government of Hong Kong.  Some say the

only  government of Hong Kong.  These tycoons  own  what?

They    own    banks,   the   ports,   power    stations,

telecommunications, the media, retail, yes,  supermarkets

and,  of  course,  real estate.  They  are  the  economic

equivalents  of  our Temasek-linked companies.   But  the

similarities  end  here.  They are  powerful.   They  are

rich.  GLCs are rich, but GLCs are not powerful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hong Kong tycoons and their companies are

answerable  to no one, but themselves, their shareholders

and their boards of directors.  But usually they have the

biggest chunks of shares in their own companies.  So they

are  basically answerable to shareholders of  which  they

form   a  large  part.   And  they  are  very  profitable

companies.   The profits only accrue to the shareholders.

In contrast, GLCs are not powerful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are debating the role of Government-linked

companies, Temasek-linked companies in this House.   TLCs

are answerable not only to shareholders, because some are

listed, and their boards of directors but, of course,  to

Temasek  Holdings,  which has to  answer  to  Government.

That  is  why we are here today.  And Government  has  to

account   to   MPs   who  have  to   account   to   their

constituencies.  So, talk about transparency, talk  about

accountability,  our GLCs, our TLCs  in  particular,  are

extremely accountable.  Anybody can move a motion or file

a  Question.   In my 10 years here, I have heard  several

questions  and answers on why these TLCs went  into  this

business, why this business failed, and the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



for  Finance dutifully stood up and gave an answer which,

I   think,   most  of  us  accept,  while  some  disagree

altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am using this example to drive home the first of

many messages in the New World, in the new regime of WTO.

And  this  first message I want to drive home is  this  - that  TLCs are not villains.  In a global economy, a  few

companies  dominate.   This  happens  in  Singapore.   It

happens to be GLCs because of our history.  It happens in

Hong Kong.  A few tycoon-dominated companies control  and

run  Hong  Kong.   And the rest of us, SMEs,  sweat  shop

owners,   have  to  feed  off  these  TLCs,  tycoon-owned

businesses.   It  is the same everywhere.  Unfortunately,

too  many  Singaporeans love to hate  our  Temasek-linked

companies  and now that has been extended to  NTUC-linked

companies.   They  blame  TLCs for  the  death  of  local

entrepreneurs.   They say, dismantle the TLCs,  and  then

everything   will   be  fine.   All  entrepreneurs   will

mushroom.  They will grow, they will flourish,  and  then

they will be big.  But I wish it were true and life is so

simple.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh, please take

a  look  at  Hong Kong and tell me, where  are  the  Bill

Gates?  Tell me, where are the Jeff Bezos, where are  the

Dells,  where are the Intels, where are the HPs?  You  do

not   find  them.   None.   They  are  not  there.    The

gatekeepers  of Hong Kong are really small entrepreneurs.

They are the unsung heroes of the economy, but the people

underpinning  them  are just a few  big  tycoon-dominated

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will not find a Bill Gates in Hong Kong, but you

will  find a Mr Li Ka Shing.  Hongkongers love  him,  and

they  call him "Superman", chiu yan (in Cantonese).  Chiu

yan  means  Superman.  Mr Li's hold  on  the  economy  is

formidable.   His two companies - Hutchinson Whampoa  and

Cheung  Kong  - dominate the economy of Hong  Kong.   But

unlike  some  of  our CEOs of GLCs,  Mr  Li  is  revered,

respected and worshipped.  Here, Singaporeans blame  TLCs

for being too big and crowding out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



businesses.   But, think again, Mr Li is  held  up  as  a

model  entrepreneur  in Hong Kong even  as  his  eclectic

empire  grows.  Some people are saying in Hong Kong  that

he  is  also  crowding out entrepreneurs.   But,  by  and

large, this is a voice from the minority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Li is a hero in Hong Kong and not a villain. He

provides  jobs, thousands of jobs, for Hongkongers.   And

Hongkongers  believe in Mr Li.  In  fact,  Hong  Kong  is

worried  every now and then that he might just  move  his

Hutchinson Whampoa and Cheung Kong offshore.   Each  time

Hongkongers feel that he might be doing so, he  came  out

to reassure them.  But our TLCs have never said they want

to  move  overseas.  Our TLCs have said they want  to  go

overseas  to do business and bring the money  back.   The

question  of  TLCs rooting themselves with the  Singapore

economy  and providing jobs for Singapore has never  been

an  issue here, which I am glad.  The issue of Hutchinson

Whampoa  moving  overseas has always  been  rumoured  and

always dispelled by Mr Li himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Li, although he is a superman, is not

infallible.   His company has made some  less  than  good

investments.   Or even today, Hutchinson Whampoa's  share

has  been hammered from the high.  Before the year  2000,

it  was  something like HK$120 per share.  Today,  it  is

something  like  HK$60.  I do not know  the  rate  today.

But, last week, I saw it was hovering below HK$60.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, Mr Li's investment in a Canadian oil

company did not live up to market expectations.  It under-performed for many years.  Mr Li's investment in  Rabbit,

if  you  remember, a telephony company  in  Britain,  was

another  flop,  a failure.  But few remember  his  failed

investments.  We all remember his successes,  and  so  it

should be, because he is a very successful businessman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This example brings me to a second message which I

want to bring home - that Singaporeans should be a little

bit  more  forgiving, if some of our TLCs have made  some

bad  investments  in  the  short  term.   Even  a  highly

successful company,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>

like   Hutchinson  Whampoa,  has  made  bad  investments.

Singaporeans, in fact, should be worried if our TLCs make

no investments and think short term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a third point in my comparison, and this is

not  a major point I want to make, but I thought this  is

the  mood  of  the day, and I would say it.  Singaporeans

are having so much angst over foreign talent policy.   If

TLCs  were  dismantled, for example, who do we  sell  to?

Well, possibly sell them to some foreign investors maybe,

who  have the money and the interest.  If so, there  will

be a lot more foreign talents in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Hong Kong and China regard Mr Li as a patriot,

but  Mr  Li  did  not  grow his stable  of  companies  by

employing  Chinese and Hongkongers for a long time.   For

as  long as I can remember, Mr Li has always had a policy

of  hiring  the best, and his most senior management  are

foreign  talents, and foreign talents I mean  Caucasians.

In  Hong Kong, they say kwai lao.  Here, in Singapore, we

have  a  few  foreign talents in GLCs, TLCs, and  already

Singaporeans are feeling the heat.  Actually,  we  should

have  more.   Because  if  you want  TLCs  to  be  global

companies  of distinction, we really need to harvest  the

best from around the world.  So I asked those people  who

are  lobbying for the dismantling of TLCs, are  you  sure

you want to dismantle TLCs?  Because, you know, what they

say, be careful of what you wish, you might just get it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have put into perspective a world without

TLCs.   Still, I think it is right that Temasek  Holdings

is  determined to sell some TLCs even if it wants to grow

others,  find partners for others and merge others.   But

we  are  reassured, through the Temasek Charter, and  the

statements in the press, that there will be no fire sale.

We  are  not going to sell.  We should not sell the  TLCs

for a song.  Our national assets are not for lelong.  And

this brings me to my last point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of Temasek Holdings has come up with

a  Temasek Charter.  At the top of its Charter, it  says,

"Temasek Holdings holds and manages the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



Singapore Government's investments in companies  for  the

long  term  benefit  of Singapore."   I  find  this  most

reassuring.  How many companies can put up that  kind  of

mission  statement?  The Temasek Charter makes  it  clear

from  the very outset that every Singaporean has a  stake

in  Temasek even if we do not hold a single share in  any

of  the  Temasek-linked companies.  I think we should  be

proud  of  Temasek.  Temasek really is our  future.   Our

SMEs,   our   small   mom  and  pop  shops   do   deserve

encouragement.  They should be encouraged  to  grow.   We

should  level the playing field.  But they are unable  to

reach  out and anchor to the big powers, the big  players

in the West.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were young, we all know this refrain in

essay.   The teacher always says, "Singapore is  a  small

island  with limited resources."  I think, today, we  can

tell the teacher to tell Singaporeans that "Singapore  is

a  small island with Temasek".  If Temasek is our future,

we  should  chart  its  future together.   And  for  this

reason,  I really welcome this debate on Temasek  Charter

in  this House moved by Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit

Singh.   In some ways, I agree with them.  For too  long,

Temasek has been a passive holding company.  Its mode  of

operation  and  its mission were a little bit  opaque,  a

little  bit  over  our head.  I hope that  it  is  slowly

changing.   I  think  it  is  changing.   And  this   new

management is a catalyst for change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a dream that one day Temasek will be a

General Electric with a diversified stable of businesses,

each  of which is a world or, at least, a regional  brand

name.   It will take Temasek decades to reach this  goal.

It  took Jack Welch a good 20 to 30 years to finalise the

shape of General Electric that we know today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly some companies should be divested; some

merged;  some  acquired, but that is  best  left  to  the

management  of  Temasek.  But reading the Charter,  I  am

confident  that Temasek management has the ambitions  and

determination to succeed.  With this Charter, Temasek  is

really  chartering into uncharted waters,  because  there

are no MBA case studies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



for  Temasek  to  emulate and analyse.  Temasek  Holdings

will  have to write its own MBA case study, for  somebody

else  to study in the decades to come.  In time, we  will

know  how  Temasek has remained faithful to the  Charter,

how it has linked the future to Singapore, and how it has

performed  against its own benchmark.   I  think  today's

debate  is useful.  We should revisit this debate in  the

next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mdm Deputy Speaker, before I end, I hope I have

time  to  talk about the NTUC-linked companies.  Actually

NTUC-linked  companies are not part  of  today's  Motion.

NTUC-linked companies are largely formed for Singaporeans

and,  in fact, NTUC-linked companies - I know it, because

I  had  been  in  NTUC for sometime  now  -  were  formed

precisely  against  the Yellow Pages  rule.   The  Yellow

Pages  rule says that if the name is in the Yellow Pages,

let  us, say, a supermarket, it should get out.  But when

FairPrice was formed, there were few supermarkets.   NTUC

FairPrice  went in basically because the price  of  basic

commodities  was too high.  And NTUC went in  to  provide

competition  against the local retailers.   The  results,

after 20-odd years, I think, prove that it has succeeded.

NTUC  prices  today are among the lowest  prices  in  the

retail  scene.  Not every item but, by and large, if  you

look  at a typical basket of items, NTUC has the cheapest

basket in town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC companies are not funded by Government.

Government  does  not put money into NTUC.   NTUC's  seed

capital  comes from all of us.  It is a cooperative,  and

the  money comes from small timers like you and I who buy

shares, $1 a share, over the last many years.  I  am  not

sure  if we divest, let us say, FairPrice, we will  quell

the  public  discontent.  If FairPrice were to  be  sold,

sold to whom?  That is the first issue.  The second issue

is  the person who inherits FairPrice would want to  make

it  even  bigger, and he will crowd out even  more  local

retailers.  The presence of FairPrice in any new town  is

welcomed, I tell you, because it brings down the cost  of

living  in  that town.  It has what we call the  Wal-Mart

effect.  Every time a Wal-Mart



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



opens  up  a  big  supermarket chain  in  some  parts  of

America, the residents welcome it, because it lowers  the

cost  of  commodities by a huge margin.  But, of  course,

shopkeepers  around  the town  would  be  upset.   It  is

something  we have to live with.  In Malaysia, they  have

found that by allowing big retail giants, like Carrefour,

to  operate,  for  example,  retail  shops  went  out  of

business.   So unless you say that you want to limit  the

number  of supermarket outlets, it is not going  to  help

even if FairPrice were divested from the NTUC family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last word about academic advice. I have left

the  university for the last 10 years now, and of  course

not as well known as Michael Porter and all that.  Listen

to  their advice, they have a lot to offer us, but please

listen  with  a  pinch of salt.  Many renowned  academics

over the years, when you look back at their advice, their

advice sounded foolish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early years of independence, in the 60s, the

advice of the renowned academics around the world to  all

developing  countries was to close your doors,  be  self-sufficient, do what is best for you.  So many  countries,

like  India,  Malaysia, African countries,  closed  their

doors.   Singapore  went  against  the  advice  of  these

eminent  economists.  We opened up, we linked up  to  the

world,  we succeeded.  Because we went against the advice

of the day, we succeeded.  I am not saying that we should

go  against the advice of these renowned academics.   But

think  again.  We are here, we know our business  better.

We  are  here because our destiny is here.  They  are  in

Boston,  they are in London.  Their business is to  write

papers,  to gain a world-wide audience, to win the  Nobel

Prize.   Our duty is to provide for our future,  for  our

children's future.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Madam, I wish to thank you for

giving  me the opportunity to participate in this debate.

And in fact, I would also like to thank the movers of the

Motion,  my parliamentary colleagues, Mr Leong  Horn  Kee

and Mr Inderjit Singh, for tabling this Motion.  In doing

so,  I  think they have provided this House with a  great

opportunity to debate on a topic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



which is obviously of great interest to Singaporeans  and

which  is  also  important  for  our  future  growth  and

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I have listened very carefully to the

comments and viewpoints made by the speakers before me on

this  issue.  Generally, I do not disagree that  we  must

help  our local enterprises to develop and grow.  And  to

this  end,  we should examine existing schemes,  policies

and  regulations  to  determine  whether  there  are  any

impediments standing in the way of full participation  by

our   SMEs,   of  which  we  place  them  at  an   unfair

disadvantage compared to GLCs and MNCs.  In this respect,

the  recommendations  of  the EISC  should  be  seriously

looked  at  and the Government should seriously  consider

implementing useful and practical suggestions  that  will

strengthen  our  economy  and make  Singapore  even  more

competitive globally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am all for a level playing field. But I believe

that  we should not have protectionist policies, not only

for  GLCs and MNCs, but also for our own SMEs.  As  such,

protectionism  will  not,  in the  long  term,  help  our

domestic  industries  to  be  resilient  and  to  compete

globally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, having listened to this debate, I am not sure

whether  we are identifying the issues correctly.   There

is  a  tendency  to compartmentalise GLCs and  SMEs  into

different boxes and to assume that one can only  grow  at

the  expense  of  the other.  To me,  the  issue  is  not

whether  GLCs  should be competing  with  SMEs.   But  of

greater  significance  is  the  issue  of  how  Singapore

companies, whether they are GLCs or SMEs, can compete  in

a  very  competitive world economy which has become  even

more aggressive with the admission of China into the WTO.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, with my colleague, Mr Nithiah Nandan, we

led  the SLF model workers delegation to Shanghai and  we

visited  the Philips optical storage factory there.   The

plant's General Manager, who briefed us, told us that the

operating environment in China is very flexible and fast,

and  there  is  good support from the  authorities.   The

factory was sited on a huge piece of land



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



and the huge factory took only one year to build with the

workers  working round the clock come rain or shine.   He

said that in Europe, it would have taken two to two-and-a-half  years  to  build a similar factory.  The  education

system,  according  to him, is good and  among  the  non-production staff, almost 90% are degree holders.  And  of

these,  15%  are PhDs.  Among the production  staff,  the

average  level  of education is at least upper  secondary

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that, instead of

debating  about how GLCs are crowding out local companies

and  to add to that, I must add NLCs, a new term that has

just  been developed today, perhaps we should concentrate

more on how GLCs, NLCs and SMEs can partner each other as

one  united force to compete in the international  market

and to be more efficient and productive domestically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the workers' viewpoint, what is important is

not  so much whether companies operating in Singapore are

GLCs,   SMEs,  or  foreign-owned.   Rather,  of   greater

significance to us is whether such companies create jobs,

incomes  and  bring in new technologies  and  skills,  in

other  words, whether more jobs are created through  such

investments and whether these are well-paid jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it is a fact that, overall, GLCs and MNCs

provide  greater job stability to our workers  and  offer

more  attractive  terms of employment.  This  is  because

they  are generally bigger, have more resources  and  are

more professionally run.  In my view, promoting GLCs need

not  be  at  the expense of SMEs.  In fact, there  is  no

guarantee  that  pulling our GLCs  from  certain  sectors

would  automatically result in a mushrooming of more  and

stronger  SMEs.  What may happen, instead,  is  that  the

vacuum  would  be very quickly filled up by bigger,  more

competitive and globally-savvy foreign competitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is evident by looking at the retail sector. In

Thailand,  for instance, the competition comes  not  from

the  State-owned  enterprises but big foreign  retailers,

such as Carrefour and Taxco.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



There  are  local companies, but they are  weak  and  not

competitive.   In Taiwan, the supermarket  scene  is  all

foreign, with Carrefour being the biggest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me come to another point which has been

raised  by  previous speakers.  I think it is unfair  and

unwise to brush the NTUC companies in the same stroke  as

other  private  enterprises.  In the  first  place,  NTUC

companies  are,  in  fact, cooperatives  set  up  by  the

workers.   The  capital for each and  every  one  of  our

cooperatives comes from shareholders which are our  trade

unions and individual members.  Hence, these cooperatives

belong to the unions and workers, and not the Government.

We do not receive Government funding or capital to set up

any  one  of  our  cooperatives.  The  priority  of  NTUC

cooperatives  must  be the ordinary  consumers,  and  the

400,000  or so Singaporeans, many of whom are low  income

workers, who collectively own the cooperatives.  How many

of  our  workers could afford to invest in companies  and

hold  shares  on  the  same  basis  as  their  management

counterparts, or better-off Singaporeans?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC cooperatives will be measured by whether they

have helped to make a difference to the lives of ordinary

Singaporeans.   Our  responsibility is  to  help  workers

stretch  their  hard-earned  dollar  and  improve   their

quality of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in fact, our NTUC cooperatives too face

intense competition from major foreign retail chains many

times  their size.  It also has to contend with  business

alliances  by private sector players.  Since  the  1980s,

for  instance, FairPrice had to tender for sites in  open

competition.  In new suburban malls, FairPrice would  not

get  a  chance to even put in competitive bids,  as  some

developers  prefer  to  award the tender  to  supermarket

operators  with  whom  they  had  special  relationships.

Residents,  as  Prof. Koo Tsai Kee has said  earlier  on,

have  complained to their MPs when they do  not  have  an

NTUC  FairPrice outlet near their home.  This is  clearly

evident that people, ordinary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans,  average  workers,  support  the  idea   of

cooperatives and find them useful and meet their needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it is true that NTUC appoints some Government

Ministers, Members of Parliament and Government  officers

on  the board of directors of our cooperatives.  But this

is  to  enable  our  cooperatives  to  benefit  from  the

experience and expertise and, not as implied, to gain any

undue  or  unfair advantage compared to other businesses.

In  fact, NTUC also appoints prominent businessmen on the

board  of  NTUC  cooperatives and  many  have,  to  their

credit,  willingly  served  on  our  boards  which   have

benefited  not only the NTUC cooperatives  but,  in  many

ways,  have  contributed towards a  conducive  industrial

relations climate, as such co-option of business  leaders

has  provided  the  opportunity for  business  and  union

leaders to integrate and understand each other's position

better.   The fact that many prominent businessmen  agree

to  serve on our boards indicates that they too subscribe

to the social objectives of NTUC cooperatives and want to

contribute towards this larger community objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, NTUC cooperatives are truly mass movements

and  we play a social role by providing real and tangible

benefits  to Singaporeans.  During good times,  the  NTUC

cooperatives moderate cost increases by setting benchmark

prices.   And  during bad times, they help  workers  tide

over  the  difficulties, such as the 1998, 2001 and  2002

relief packages.  In fact, they collectively provided $26

million  in  relief package in 1998 and  $52  million  in

relief  package in 2001 and 2002.  NTUC cooperatives  are

not  set up for profits alone although, in order to  stay

viable,  they  have to be profitable  so  that  they  can

continue  to  contribute to society.  Wherever  possible,

NTUC  cooperatives also strive for win-win strategies  by

working  with  small businesses to help them  grow.   For

example, FairPrice and Healthcare work closely with small

retailers through their franchise schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, recently, the cooperatives, such as

FairPrice, Foodfare, Healthcare and Childcare, have  also

announced their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



commitment to help cushion the impact of the GST increase

on  Singaporeans  next year.  Since 1999,  we  have  been

publishing a set of social indicators together  with  our

statement  of  accounts.   This  is  an  example  of  the

transparency  requirement,  which  was  mentioned  by  Mr

Inderjit Singh earlier on.  Just as companies account  to

shareholders  each year, in terms of equity,  we  publish

social   indicators  to  show  that  we  are   not   just

businesses,  but that we believe in social responsibility

and  will do our part to help improve workers' lives  and

ensure  that  their  basic needs are met.   Although  our

cooperatives   belong   to  the   workers   and   unions,

shareholders  do  not profit from our  cooperatives.   In

fact,  under  the Cooperative Societies Act, the  maximum

rate of dividends that cooperatives can pay is capped  at

10%.   This means that whatever benefit is reaped by  the

cooperatives,   these  are  largely  ploughed   back   to

consumers and society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am proud to be associated with socially

responsible  employers  who  care  not  just  for   their

bottomline, but also enlarge their role to care  for  the

community.  Cooperatives can serve as a check against the

excesses  or failures of the market.  They are  bound  by

their  admission, values and traditions to  consider  the

wider  interests of society.  Each and every  cooperative

that  the  labour movement has set up is founded  upon  a

clear social objective.  For example, NTUC Income was set

up  in  those days because there is no insurance  company

that  is  prepared  to  provide  low  cost,  low  premium

insurance coverage for workers.  NTUC FairPrice  was  set

up  in those days because there was rampant inflation and

profiteering,  and that was eating into the  hard  earned

cash  and  money  of the workers.  The  presence  of  our

cooperative  movement  has  contributed  towards   social

stability.   It has helped to mitigate the effects  of  a

widening wage gap as it helps to level up workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, NTUC empathises with the problems faced by

small  retailers.  Without sufficient economies of scale,

they  will find it difficult to operate.  However, it  is

unfair to place the poor prospects of small neighbourhood

retail shops on the growth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



of   NTUC   cooperatives.   In  the   absence   of   NTUC

cooperatives,  small  retailers  would  face   the   same

competition by other big retailers, including the foreign

ones.   Of  the supermarkets, only Sheng Siong and  PRIME

are  owned by Singaporeans.  The rest are foreign  owned.

We  do not think that dismantling NTUC cooperatives would

improve  the  position of SMEs, or that it would  promote

greater  innovation  and  entrepreneurship  among   local

companies.  There are clearly many other factors that are

at  play,  such as access to capital expertise  and  size

which  affect the growth of our local companies  and  not

because of the presence of NTUC cooperatives or NLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, someone has suggested that some

of our cooperatives are too small and have little impact.

In  this  case,  is  the answer not to  grow  bigger,  to

develop  the  clout?  But if we do so, then  we  will  be

accused of crowding out the local companies.  Even so,  a

small  player,  such as Denticare, exerts  an  influence.

Denticare executives have been asked from time to time to

raise  their  prices  so that other dentists  can  follow

suit.   Does  Denticare  crowd out  other  dentists?   It

cannot  be  so, as the people in Denticare are themselves

dentists.   If  other  dentists  wish  to  compete   with

Denticare, they are free to grow together and  offer  the

public  prices lower than the table of rates set  by  the

Singapore Dental Association.  There is nothing  to  stop

them.  And the public would applaud them, and so would I.

Perhaps,  I  would also go and visit them,  when  I  need

dental treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, I agree with the

Motion that we should examine all ways to ensure that our

local   SMEs   stand  a  chance  and  can  benefit   from

Singapore's  economic growth.  I do not  think  that  the

debate should be about either promoting GLCs or SMEs, but

rather on how both can partner each other and compete  in

the  global economy.  Both have a role to play, and  they

can  certainly complement each other in order to  promote

and strengthen the Singapore brand.  Most certainly, NTUC

cooperatives will and must continue to play the role of a

social leveller and guardian of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



interests of the vast majority of Singaporeans  who  have

benefited from our presence in the market.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the EISC

Report  and  the  New Temasek Charter  are  fundamentally

sound.  The recommendations in the Report and the express

intention  to  wean  off  companies by  Temasek  Holdings

augur well for our nation's transition from an investment-driven  phase  to  an  innovation-driven  phase  in   our

economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call by many is that this is the time when the

Government is to take a back seat and allow companies  to

take  an  active role in shaping the business environment

and lead development through innovation and creativity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will lead the way in divesting non-core businesses, partner SMEs, form alliances, merge with

or   acquire  stakes  in  both  local  and  international

interests.  All these are happening in a difficult global

market environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An array of different strategies and conditions must

now  prevail  in  order that Singaporean companies  could

rise to the new challenge.  For example, local demand and

a challenging marketplace must develop as a source of new

ideas   for  product  and  service  innovations.    Other

imperatives    include   companies    rethinking    their

traditional assumptions, management techniques,  business

leaders  redefining their roles and their  initiative  in

moving into new territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, Singapore boasts an excellent track record in

rising  to  challenges. The Government has already  taken

several  measures to equip Singapore in this  transition.

The issues are how soon and are our companies ready?   To

what extent is our infrastructure ready or accessible  to

the  SMEs in terms of loans, funds and network?  Are GLCs

totally  irrelevant in this new economic era? Why  should

we still be holding on to some of them?  What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



flexible  model can we initiate as strategies  that  will

continue to anchor our flagships?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we have built the Singapore economy into what

it  is  today,  largely  through  local  talents  and  by

constantly  growing and strengthening  our  key  economic

institutions  such as the GLCs.  GLCs and  the  assiduous

cultivation of our local talents for public service  and,

in  recent  years for the private sector, have  been  the

cornerstones  of our economic growth.  We should  not  be

too hasty in wanting to do away with what has worked well

for us and to adopt some other strategies which may sound

fashionable but have not stood the test of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the World Bank, more than US$700

billion  in assets have been privatised around the  world

in  the  last  decade,  most of which  occurred  in  what

economists  call  "emerging  economies".   There   is   a

definite trend around the world towards privatisation  of

government-linked companies or what, in some circles,  is

called state-owned enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for the privatisation of these

enterprises  are many and varied.  Some of  them  may  be

relevant  to the GLC situation in Singapore, others  not.

Before  we join in the rush to divest some of our prized-assets,  it  is  important for us to understand  some  of

those  reasons  that  lead some  countries  to  undertake

privatisation  of  their  GLCs.   This   will   avoid   a

doctrinaire approach to this issue of privatisation.  One

of those reasons has to do with agency theory.  This says

that because GLCs belong to society as a whole, it is  an

agent  without  a  real  principal.   As  a  result,  the

performance  of  these GLCs is sub-optimal  because  they

have  rather  vague  goals, as  opposed  to  the  profit-maximising goals of privately-run outfits, like the MNCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for Singapore, our GLCs are run on an

arms-length  principle, in that the Government  does  not

directly  interfere  with the daily operations  of  these

companies.   In  actual  fact, they  are  run  on  purely

commercial   lines.   There  are  instances   where   the

Government may have invested money into these GLCs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



for   long-term  strategic  reasons  without  seeing   an

immediate  prospect  of making quick  returns.   However,

this  does  not mean that Government ownership  of  these

GLCs is not commercially-sound.  It just means that there

are  instances  where the market fails to identify  long-term  opportunities which Singapore  is  well  placed  to

exploit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why privatisation has been the order

of the day in many countries is because these enterprises

have  not  been competitive enough to take on world-class

competitors   in   an   era  of  trade   and   investment

liberalisation.    Is  this  situation   symptomatic   of

Singapore's GLCs?  Some GLCs may need to be partially  or

even  completely  privatised so  that  they  can  attract

foreign  technology transfers, managerial expertise,  and

capital.  The latter will also help boost our efforts  to

enlarge  the capital base of our stock exchange  and  the

increase  of  foreign portfolio investment in  Singapore.

However,  there  are  GLCs  with  substantial  Government

ownership  which  are doing quite well already  on  their

own.   Brand  names  like SIA, DBS  and  PSA  Corporation

spring quickly to mind in this regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further divest Government's holdings in these

companies  may  not necessarily improve  the  competitive

advantage  of these enterprises.  If the Government  were

to  relinquish  more control of these  enterprises,  what

compelling rationale is there to guarantee that they will

be  a  better run outfit than what is already  the  case?

SIA  has  consistently been one of  the  most  profitable

airlines  in the world.  PSA Corporation is likewise  one

of  the  most profitable port operators in the world  and

has  sustained  Singapore  as  the  second  largest  port

worldwide  in  terms  of  shipping  tonnage.   We  should

endeavour  to create more PSA Corps and SIAs out  of  the

more  promising  GLCs, instead of contemplating  to  hand

over  control of these companies to foreign interests  or

appoint foreign proxies to run them for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are small and vulnerable, human capital

is our most precious asset, and we must continue to build

up our own core of national talent to be in ultimate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



charge  of our key resources and institutions.  We cannot

depend  on  nor expect foreign managers and investors  to

take  ultimate  control of our key economic  institutions

and  expect them to make a living for us.  That  will  be

the end of Singapore as a sovereign nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still yet another reason why some countries join the

privatisation  mania  is  because  they  are  faced  with

balance-of-payments or fiscal crises  that  compel  their

governments to sell off state-owned enterprises in  order

to  raise  money  to  cover shortfalls  in  other  areas.

Surely, this is not the case in Singapore, as we all know

how prudent our Government has been in the stewardship of

our nation's reserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that we should not open up our

market  and companies to foreign investors and expertise.

To  remain  competitive, we must continue to attract  the

best  management  and business talents  to  Singapore  to

supplement  our national talent and, if possible,  absorb

them  into  our  citizenry to enlarge our  core  national

talent pool.  We can enlarge our domestic talent pool  by

making  Singapore  a global metropolis attractive  enough

for  foreigners  to  want  to  live  and  contribute   to

Singapore's prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving up ownership and control of our key home-grown industries that are strategic to our prosperity and

survival  as a nation is like cutting off a healthy  limb

from  a  healthy body.  Is it then necessary or wise  for

the  Government to privatise substantially or  completely

all  its GLCs?  Proponents for the divestment of our GLCs

argue that GLCs present unfair competition for both local

and    international   players,   given   the   Singapore

Government's backing in these companies.  For this reason

and  the perceived sensitivity that this may pose to  the

national  security of other countries, it is argued  that

the GLCs will not be welcomed in the international market

place.   Similarly, because the profit objective  of  our

GLCs  may  be  compromised  by  Government's  social  and

political   imperatives,  they   will   be   shunned   by

international funds and investors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, there is also a perception that

because they are GLCs per se, there is a lack of will  on

the  part  of  the  Government to ensure  that  the  best

possible management is in place.  But the catch  here  is

that  those  arguments  are  mostly  propagated  by   our

competitors  and  by  pundits  who  make  a  living  from

espousing trendy and esoteric management theories.   How,

for   example,  could  any  of  our  GLCs  be   seriously

considered  to  be  competing at an unfair  advantage  in

terms   of   financial   muscle  in   the   international

marketplace  merely  because  the  Government   has   the

controlling interest, when not even one of our  GLCs  can

be found on the Fortune 500 Global List?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our GLCs should be competitive and profitable

world-class players, it is also a legitimate objective to

ensure that profit maximisation is not at the expense  of

national   interest.   GLCs  should  not  only   generate

financial  gains for their shareholders, but they  should

also serve our national interests in contributing to  the

peace,  prosperity and security of Singapore.   Moreover,

our  GLCs  are  subject to the same rules that  apply  to

others in the international free marketplace.  Instead of

being  defensive about Government involvement,  our  GLCs

should  robustly  rebut unfounded criticism  from  vested

interests  and stake their claims strongly as  legitimate

participants    in   today's   increasingly    globalised

marketplace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, PSA Corporation and SIA have become world-class companies in their own right, consistently

outperforming many privately-controlled and managed ports

and  airlines  of international stature.  The  Government

need  not  be  apologetic  about their  achievements  and

contributions  to  Singapore.   All  businesses,  without

exception,  are subject to the fluctuations  of  business

cycles and world economic upturns and downturns.  So, for

example, if SIA is not making a profit for the first time

after decades of sterling performance, this should not be

the reason for it, or a sizeable chunk of its equity,  to

be handed over on a silver



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



platter  to  some  seemingly  savvy  international   fund

manager.   What  assurance can  we  have  that  they  can

perform  better than SIA?   By all means divest ourselves

of  all  long-standing non-performing GLCs or even  close

them  down.  But for those that perform or are  strategic

to  our national interests, such as in defence, it  makes

little  sense for us to throw out the baby with the  bath

water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent announcement of the PSA Corporation model

of  opening up berths to foreign and private operators to

manage  on  their  own  shows a  savvy  customer  service

response.   The  open  invitation by PSA  Corporation  to

shipping companies to participate in port management  and

operations  is  a clear signal of its open  and  flexible

approach in striking up new alliances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine some of our assumptions underlying

the  intention to divest before proceeding to do so.   To

what  extent must Government sell off its holdings before

investors   are   sufficiently   assuaged   that    these

enterprises are really bottom-line concerns?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another related issue that ought to be raised is

that the manner in which privatisation is carried out  is

just  as  important  as  the  rationale  for  divestment.

Firstly,  if  we decide on privatising some of  our  non-core,  non-strategic assets, we should do  so  gradually,

and not go for a quick sell-off, especially in times like

ours  when the market is still soft.  To do a quick sell-off  under today's market condition is unwise for obvious

reasons.  If we decide to let go of some of these assets,

we  should  do so in a staggered     manner, selling  off

tranches  at those points in time when the market  is  on

the  upturn.   Studies in other countries  show  that  by

gradually releasing its holdings over time, the  long-run

revenue  resulting from the sale of these shares will  be

maximised.  This is because, as investors gain confidence

in the privatisation programme, the value of these shares

will  tend  to  rise.  This, in turn,  will  benefit  all

Singaporeans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I feel that instead of selling large

chunks  of these holdings to foreign investors, we should

sell  them to large groups of small, dispersed investors.

SIA  and  SingTel  are  good cases  in  point.   In  this

connection, the rule for the disclosure of any  take-over

bids  by  powerful  investors  and  fund-managers  should

remain, and not be diluted further by a further reduction

in  the need for the disclosure of any take-over attempt.

Alternatively, we can consider selling off these holdings

to  the  management of these firms if they  are  able  to

raise sufficient funds to buy the shares on offer.   This

will  help  increase the sense of ownership  among  these

managers,  and  it  will  also help  to  retain  critical

managerial know-how in these firms and give our  managers

a chance at injecting the entrepreneurial spirit in these

firms.  The Ang Kong Hua-led proposal to buy NatSteel  is

a case in point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the GLCs are concerned, the Government's

policy of divesting them to the private sector when  they

no  longer serve a useful strategic thrust to the economy

is a correct one.  And, should the Government continue to

play  a  lead  role in identifying strategic sectors  for

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two fundamental forces at work here. One

is that the Government should devolve itself from running

state  enterprises.  The  other is  that  the  Government

should take the lead in identifying key sectors that will

do well in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of these two do we want? Are we sure that the

Government  can  always be spot-on to identify  areas  of

growth  in so prescient a fashion as was the case in  the

past?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to consider other ways of involving the

private sector is a good one provided that we involve the

private sector in a continual process of sectoral growth-identification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Report's recommendation on having a

generic  law  on  anti-competition is  good.   It  is  to

prevent collusion, anti-competition and the like.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



In  other  words,  in  so  far  as  it  pertains  to  the

encouragement  of entrepreneurship and competition  among

Singapore companies, it is truly commendable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can envisage potential instances where MNCs or

even  subsidiaries within MNCs collude to keep price high

or  merge  among themselves to corner a large segment  of

the  international market.  Do we seriously want to  keep

them  out  of  Singapore because  they  indulge  in  such

practices?   What  if Singapore companies  collude  among

themselves  to  corner  a slice of  the  foreign  market?

Indeed, the proposed law can prevent such instances  from

occurring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, another dimension which has been mentioned by

my  colleagues is the role of statutory boards and  their

effects on competition in Singapore. To reiterate, if the

function  of statutory boards in Singapore  is  to   help

provide   an  institutional  environment  where   private

businesses can compete on a transparent and level-playing

field,  then it stands to reason that these boards  ought

not  to be involved in the competition themselves or else

they will lose their standing as impartial guarantors  of

a  free  and fair regime in the various sectors they  are

supposed to be responsible for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many today are questioning the commercial

aspirations of spin-offs of statutory boards.  Two better

known ones in the manpower industry are the Civil Service

College  and  the  PSB  Corp.  Consultants  and  training

providers are asking why these two entities are vying for

the  same  commercial  pie.  They are  providing  similar

management training and consultancy programmes to a  near

saturated market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this runs against the original function of

the  statutory boards, thereby detracting from what  they

are  supposed  to  do.   Do these spin-offs  function  to

facilitate and enable the private operators in  enhancing

the  cluster of related and supporting sectors?  If their

objectives  are  contrary to one of the  key  thrusts  in

transitioning into the innovation-driven economy, then we

ought to hold



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



the brakes and urge a review of their directions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to avoid the Government from being alluded

in  competing in an unfair manner when it enters  certain

sectors of the local market that should be best served by

the  private sector.  Perhaps, a charter similar  to  the

New  Temasek  Charter should be considered for  statutory

boards  with  spun-off commercial set-ups.   This  is  to

better  scope their functions and ensure that if  at  all

for  any  useful contribution, they serve to enhance  the

cluster and related supporting industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on this note, I would like to support the

recommendations of the EISC to promote private enterprise

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the

Motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC proposals and the Temasek press release are

timely and welcomed by many Singaporeans.  GLCs have been

a  subject  of  much debate and controversy for  sometime

now.  Among the many issues that have surfaced, there are

two  that  have  generated  much  attention;  first,  the

question  of competition that the GLCs provide  to  local

non-GLC  enterprises  and, secondly,  and  one  which  is

related  to  the  first, the role and management  of  the

GLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, in this House, consistently maintained the

view that GLCs, if they are worth their salt, should play

an  active  role  in helping Singapore develop  a  strong

external   economy.    A  well-established   network   of

successful investments and strategic acquisitions outside

Singapore, particularly in areas where GLCs are  able  to

leverage on for the purpose of technology transfer, would

help  provide the platform for local industries  to  grow

and  for local employment to be generated.  I agree  that

GLCs   venturing  overseas  could  well   partner   local

enterprises  to  help  them expand beyond  local  shores.

Similarly, where we are able to develop our external wing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



successfully, we can afford a little inefficiency in  our

domestic  economy without having to worry too much  about

external  competition.  Our local workers, for  instance,

can,  through some tax incentives or otherwise,  or  even

indirect   subsidies,   continue   to   work   in   areas

traditionally occupied by foreign workers without  having

to earn their kind of salaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we are a small country and our resources are

limited.  We need to harness every resource  we  have  to

ensure  our  long-term survival.  The  GLCs,  because  of

their  larger  capital  resource, depth  and  breadth  of

experience  in various businesses and better  command  of

human talents, are best positioned to lead the charge for

Singapore  into the world economy.  The EISC  report  and

the proposed Charter by Temasek have both taken a step in

the  right  direction when it recognised that  increasing

focus  must  be  placed on divesting non-key  assets  and

placing our bets on strategic investments overseas.  I do

not  think  that anyone in this House will take exception

to the stated intention contained in the documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while no one would quarrel with the clarion

call  to divest and venture overseas, the devil, as  they

say,  is in the details. There are issues and, hopefully,

some of these issues will be dealt with in the course  of

this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as with the others, the GLCs. Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  we  all know that GLCs here serve the  specific

purpose  of  not  only providing the appropriate  vehicle

that  allows Government to invest the public  funds.   It

also, and more importantly, serves as tools that allow us

to  take  the  economy into strategic areas that  are  of

vital  economic interest to Singapore.  It is no surprise

therefore   that  the  main  protagonists  in   financial

services,   infrastructure  and  industrial  development,

utility  services  are GLCs.  GLCs that  are  engaged  in

businesses are therefore not only driven by the necessity

to ensure that they are not insolvent, but also to ensure

that the overall needs of the country are met at the same

time; which raises the question of whether GLCs ought  to

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



treated strictly as private sector companies, to be  left

to  shareholders  to  decide, or  be  treated  as  hybrid

companies which, because of the public interest that they

serve, not only owe a duty to the shareholders, but  also

a duty of accountability to the wider public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government has in the past consistently

maintained that the strict line of accountability of  the

GLCs  should be to the shareholders as these are  private

sector bodies and Parliament is not the appropriate  body

to undertake any oversight function.  Madam, the time has

now  come perhaps when we should review the stand  taken.

Over  the years, and much to their credit, the GLCs  have

successfully transformed our economy and helped build  up

Singapore,  as we know it today.  It is for  this  reason

that  your  typical  GLC  is not  just  your  mom-and-pop

neighbourbood shop but huge conglomerates with  interests

that  span  from  healthcare  and  telecommunications  to

utilities and aviation. These are companies that  command

very substantial capital resources, a large part of which

is  the taxpayers' money; your money and my money.  These

are  also companies that have intruded into our lives via

the  services  that they provide; that any adjustment  to

the  rates that they levy, whether it be hospital charges

or  bank  charges,  will affect a very  wide  segment  of

Singaporeans.   Should they therefore be in  the  private

domain  or  the public domain? Should their  concerns  be

matters which should be left entirely to the shareholders

or the wider public?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, our investments for the moment

are  safely watched over by Cabinet leaders or ex-Cabinet

leaders  through Temasek and GIC.  We have no doubt  that

the   present  leaders  are  exercising  their   watchdog

function  effectively.  However, one would say  that  the

present  safeguard also depends very much on the honesty,

integrity  and,  to a large extent, the trust  which  the

present leadership enjoys.  On the other hand, one  would

argue  that  there is very little by way of institutional

safeguard,  which could serve as a check  against  abuses

and excesses.  The question is:  who watches over the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



watchdog?  At  the  moment,  the  public  does  not  have

complete  access  to  the  accounts  of  some  Government

investment  companies; neither does the public  have  any

knowledge of the web of companies that the GLCs control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, while I can understand the need

for   confidentiality,  the  absence  of  an  appropriate

institution   for  independent  accountability   is   not

acceptable  either.  Our entire parliamentary  system  is

dedicated  to  the proposition of accountability  of  the

Government   to   the  people.   If   public   and   open

accountability  is neither feasible nor practical  for  a

variety of reasons, I would strongly suggest and urge the

Government  to consider setting up a council made  up  of

prominent  Singaporeans and parliamentarians  to  perform

the task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The council may be charged by Parliament to perform

the task of providing additional comfort to the public so

that the business of Government in the private sector  is

prudently managed to the highest standards. The  function

of  such a council would be no different from the  Public

Accounts Committee or the Audit Committee in the  context

of  a  listed  company.  Additionally, if the  Government

represents   the  interests  of  the  taxpayers   through

indirect  holdings  in  these  companies,  it  should  be

prepared to engage in more Parliamentary debates,  as  it

has  done in the past, on some key policies taken by  the

GLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would suppose that ultimately, the overriding

principle  should  be greater openness  on  the  part  of

Government  as  far  as possible.  With  openness,  there

would   be  greater  accountability,  and  with   greater

accountability,  one would minimise  the  possibility  of

abuse by those on whose shoulders rest the responsibility

of being the trustees of the people's assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, performance measures of GLCs and its Board.

Currently, the performance of GLCs is partly measured  by

Economic Value-Add (EVAs).  In its application, EVAs seek

to determine, as I understand it, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



value-add  of  the  enterprise  business  activities   in

relation  to  the capital employed. This yardstick  as  a

measure of the company provides the spurs for these  GLCs

to  perform.  However, while the use of EVAs may be well-meaning,   the  application  could  perhaps  be   refined

further.  At the moment, EVAs do not make any distinction

as  to  whether the value-add to the companies came  from

domestic business or foreign business.  What is important

in  the final analysis is that EVA is a reflection  based

on  the sum total revenue of the enterprise. As a result,

the  application is not satisfactory in its present form.

GLCs,  desperate  to perform to improve its  performance,

may  well be forced to unfairly compete head-on with  the

small  and  medium enterprises for business  or  even  to

acquire them; a complaint that is commonly heard.  It  is

no  wonder therefore that the roast meat business was  on

the menu for GLCs some years back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we accept the broad principle that GLCs should

concentrate  and  focus  their energies  overseas,  while

leaving  the domestic economy to be substantially handled

by  the small and medium enterprises, it would make  more

sense if the performance index of GLCs be tweaked to take

into  account  successful investments overseas.   And  to

refine  this further, we could base the determination  of

the  EVAs of the respective GLCs on industries that these

GLCs belong to.  For instance, it does not make sense  if

SingTel were to go overseas to become the best food court

operator.  It does not work that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us to the next point and that is,

measuring  the performance of the board of  GLCs.   Under

the  current proposal, the Corporate Governance Code will

be  fully  implemented in 2003 by the  listed  companies.

Non-listed  companies  will be encouraged  to  adopt  the

same.   Under the Code, the Board is expected to  set  up

functional  committees such as the  Nomination  Committee

and   the   Remuneration  Committees  to  determine   the

nomination  and  compensation of directors,  among  other

things.  The recent disclosure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



of  generous  pay-outs  to both executive  directors  and

directors  of a union linked transportation  company  has

put  the spotlight on the issue.  On what criteria should

directors be appointed and remunerated?  Should directors

of  GLCs be allowed to give themselves generous pay-outs,

including   stock   options?   Do  Government   appointed

directors   to  GLCs  operate  under  any  directive   or

remuneration  and standards, and if so, what  formula  is

this based? Should executive directors or Chief Executive

Officers of GLCs that are non-performing be asked to go?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, in my previous speeches, said that the

boards  of  GLCs must and should never be a  place  where

retired  civil servants and politicians fade away.  Every

director  who  is  appointed  to  the  boards  of   these

companies  must be able to hold their own appointment  to

these boards.  They must be effective contributors to the

business of the company and not just coast along.   While

Temasek  is  set about bringing out a charter  that  will

guide  its  business, it will also be helpful if  Temasek

could also publish its guidelines on the appointment  and

remuneration of their directors as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, our Government has always

lamented  the fact that there is a dearth of talents  for

the  appointment to the boards.  It seems that every time

an  appointment is considered, the usual list of suspects

is  taken out and reviewed.  It does not seem as  if  all

Government  appointed directors have  limited  tenure  of

appointment or are replaced by other younger and  equally

capable persons who may well be qualified to do the  job.

If  the policy on Permanent Secretaries is to limit their

term  of  office, the Government should perhaps  consider

such  a  similar policy in respect of appointment of  GLC

directors.   Similarly, when executive appointments  have

been extended to foreigners, although many, I understand,

are  presently  resigning as fast as they are  appointed,

GLCs   should   perhaps,  in  their  internationalisation

efforts,  consider appointing more experienced foreigners

to  their  boards, or to an international advisory  panel

set  up  for the purpose of advising the board.   Such  a

policy, Madam,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



would  give the Government the benefit of adding  breadth

and  depth to the experience and expertise of the  boards

of GLCs.  And I am sure such appointments do not cause as

much   rift  and  resentment  in  our  society   as   the

appointment  of  foreigners to executive offices  of  our

GLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, divestment of GLCs. The Temasek Charter, as

we note, sets out the basic principle that our Government

intends to divest investments that are non-core business,

in  the  sense  that I understand it, it  does  not  have

international growth potential.  Such a move is  welcomed

as  it  dovetails  into the broader plan of  successfully

creating an external wing for our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in as much as the intention is easy to

spell out, the role to implementing it is not.  First, we

are  not  told how businesses are going to be  classified

into  whether  or  not  they  have  international  growth

potential.   Let me take a simple example of a  fish-ball

business.  I  believe that Temasek has already  expressed

the  view  that if it is the business of fish ball  soup,

then  they  are  not  interested.  One would  immediately

recognise the practical difficulty of going through  such

a classification exercise.  While the person selling fish

ball  soup  may  not, at first glance, seem  like  a  hot

candidate for a world-class business, who is to  say  the

fish  ball seller does not have the potential if his fish

balls  are  the  best in the world,  and  that  he  could

potentially be a world-class supplier of fish  balls  and

related  products.  Maybe fish balls are  too  remote  an

example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use a more familiar example, Breadtalk. One

would  have  to admit that, at first blush, it  does  not

seem  likely that a bakery is in a position to put itself

in a list of companies that Singapore can hold out to the

world  as successful examples of entrepreneurship.   Yet,

Breadtalk, and Dr George Quek in particular, is  able  to

overcome the initial prejudices and is in the process  of

developing  a  brand  name that is  not  only  recognised

locally but in the region itself.  And to its credit,  it

has  just won an SME award recently as being a well-known

brand name in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, who is to say that Breadtalk does not have

the  potential  to  grow  its  business  internationally?

Would  McDonald's  not qualify as an international  brand

name?   If  GLCs were to a priori classify business  with

potential,  it  would  be  in no  different  position  of

possibly throwing the baby out with the bath water.  I am

concerned that by openly expressing their preference  for

certain types of businesses, the officers of the GLCs  at

the lower level may have inadvertently turned a blind eye

to some businesses with very good overseas potential, and

this  may  have  the  negative  effect  of  stifling  the

entrepreneurship potential or initiative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to a more serious issue, I note that the

Government is intent on selling or divesting of  business

that does not fit into its present overall game plan.   I

am  grateful  to  learn from Prof. Koo earlier  that  the

Government, in its desire to divest, is not about to do a

fire sale of its assets.  This certainly would not be  in

our  interest.  We must remember that some of these  non-core   assets  are  precious  jewels  no  less   in   our

collection,  even  if they are up for  sale.   There  are

several methods of disposing and valuing assets.  I shall

not   delay   our  colleagues  here  with  the  different

techniques,  save  to say that in any sale  and  purchase

situation,  valuation of assets on a  willing  buyer  and

willing seller basis is never easy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall just name one example. The subject of

management  buy-outs  featured very prominently  recently

when Temasek decided to put NatSteel up for sale.  In  an

MBO situation, what is clear is that the information flow

between  the  management  and the  shareholder  is  never

symmetrical; in other words, it is asymmetrical.  What it

means  is that the knowledge of the value of the  company

is  not  shared equally between the shareholder  and  the

managers.  Logically, it can never be, as who, other than

the managers who are engaged in the day-to-day running of

the  company, are better acquainted with the business and

the  value of the company.  In an MBO, any price that the

managers put to the shareholders will always result in  a

net gain for them.  It can never be that, in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



case   where  the  company  is  on  the  whole  generally

profitable, the managers are prepared to risk  more  than

$300  million  of their own money on a  gamble.   In  the

present  context,  it  is arguable  that  risk  money  is

directly   proportional  to  the  returns  and  inversely

proportional to the risk that they assume.  The  question

then is, if the managers are going to make money from the

exercise,  how  much will it be?  At best, the  potential

value of the company can only be an estimate.  Of course,

it  has  been said that tenders were called for  and  the

proposals  of  the  various  interested  were  evaluated.

However,  it should be noted that price fixing in  buying

and  selling  is  almost as much of an art  as  it  is  a

science.   What parties would typically do  in  order  to

ascertain  the value of the company is to conduct  a  due

diligence exercise on the company to verify the  accounts

and   the   corporate  books.   Again,  anyone  who   has

undertaken  work in the area of mergers and  acquisitions

will readily tell you that no amount of due diligence  is

going to put an outside party on par with the managers in

knowing  and understanding the true value of the company.

So,  the  point is while a tender may be called  for,  it

will  not  always  result in the seller ascertaining  the

correct value of the company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore a general perception that the

sale  of  Government assets, in this case, if it went  to

the  managers,  is  going to make some Singaporeans  very

rich.    The   greatest  travesty   on   enterprise   and

entrepreneurship will come if the managers  are  able  to

asset strip the company for a handsome profit after  they

have  acquired it from the Government.  The question then

is  in  selling  State assets to the  managers,  can  the

Government  provide the assurance that these buyers  will

continue  with  the  business and  give  comfort  to  the

employees that their jobs will be secure; that the buyers

will not asset strip the company; that if asset stripping

was the intention, a better way to do it would be for the

Government to do it itself; that the sale to the managers

is the best way to maximise the value of these assets?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, while the Government is

intent on divesting non-core assets, it should not do  so

in  a  hurry and, in the process, run the risk of selling

these assets on the cheap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final point is on the small and medium

enterprises in Singapore.  The complaint that  one  often

hears  within some circles, and was referred to  in  this

afternoon's debate, is that the presence of GLCs  stifles

much of the ability of the SMEs to compete and grow their

businesses.   While  there may  be  some  merits  to  the

argument,  one must not forget the converse side  to  the

argument,  ie,  the entry of the GLCs to  their  business

turfs has helped to raise the standard and quality of the

business  services.  Think of what the quality  of  motor

workshops  would be like today if a GLC had  not  entered

into the same arena.  Small and medium enterprises should

not  think that it is their God given right not to expect

competition  from  the bigger boys.  In  this  debate,  I

believe  the issue is not whether GLCs should enter  into

the  business of small and medium enterprises.   For,  if

this  was  the case, the absence of GLCs is not going  to

prevent  other bigger boys from entering the scene.   The

issue  is  whether the bigger boys, and in this case  the

GLCs, are able to dominate the business of the small  and

medium  enterprise simply because of unfair  competition.

Are  the  rules  and the practices of  the  market  place

stacked  in  favour  of the GLCs?  Here,  I  welcome  the

proposal  of the EISC that there should be some  form  of

competition  law to ensure that the playing  field  is  a

level  one, irrespective of whether you are a  big  or  a

small  player.   The point is that the small  and  medium

enterprises  should  not  expect  free  rides  from   any

quarters.  They must earn their spurs by competing in the

market  place  and survive.  Only then can they  hope  to

nurture  any  aspiration of competing on a  bigger  world

stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the

effectiveness of Government-linked companies  (GLCs)  and

Government  agencies in driving the economic  development

of  Singapore since independence is undeniable.  A report

by the US Embassy in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



recognised  Singapore GLCs to be well run, efficient  and

profitable,  unlike  typical state-owned  enterprises  in

many  other  countries.   It also acknowledged  that  the

major  GLCs, including Singapore Airlines, Neptune Orient

Lines,  Chartered Semiconductor, Keppel  Corporation  and

Sembawang  Corporation are publicly listed and among  the

best known corporate names locally and regionally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we should be proud of our GLCs and

Government  agencies which contributed about 13%  and  9%

respectively  to  our  Gross Domestic  Product  in  1998.

However,  the  very  success of the GLCs  and  Government

enterprises has reached a point where private enterprises

feel  crowded  out of local businesses  and  has  sparked

calls  for  a  refocus  of  the  role  of  Government  in

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An open and competitive economy like Singapore will

need to have rules to curb excessive economic power being

concentrated  in  and  wielded by any  particular  group,

thereby  resulting in inequitable conditions and stifling

of competition and choice.  A spread of economic clout is

necessary  to  ensure a balanced, healthy  and  sustained

growth  of  the  economy.  It is  thus  timely  that  the

Entrepreneurship  and Internationalisation  Sub-Committee

(EISC)  has  made several recommendations  that  seek  to

promote   a   level  playing  field  and   provide   fair

competition  and fair opportunities for all  enterprises,

big  and  small,  Government  and  private,  to  succeed.

Similarly, Temasek Holdings'  declaration of its  Charter

is  a  positive  move  that provides better  clarity  and

transparency in Government philosophies and dealings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my vision and hope is that, over time, we

will create an open, competitive economic environment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) where GLCs and SMEs will work closely together

and   symbiotically  to  build  a  vibrant  and  thriving

economy,  both domestically as well as externally,  where

each has a stake and each plays a complementary role, and

where one is comfortable dealing with the other,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



because of mutual trust, understanding and respect;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) where GLCs understand and focus on their core

businesses,  strengths  and  competencies  and  tap   on,

partner,  groom  and nurture SMEs to  break  new  ground,

develop  innovative  ideas and technologies  and  venture

into new businesses, markets and customers together;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) where the distinction between GLCs and local

enterprises  become increasingly blurred, as these  terms

become  interchangeable when GLCs get divested,  publicly

listed or bought out by management or private equity, and

budding  local  enterprises  and  start-ups  form   joint

ventures  with  GLCs or get acquired  by  GLCs,  groomed,

nurtured and get spun off again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, based on the comments and anecdotal stories

told by local private business people of their encounters

with  GLCs  and Government agencies, I fear that  we  are

still a long way from reaching and achieving such a happy

state of coexistence.  I sense that there may be a divide

between  the  management of GLCs who pride themselves  in

having  a  strong  culture,  good  corporate  governance,

transparencies and checks and controls, and the bosses of

SMEs  who  feel  proud being brash,  daring,  nimble  and

entrepreneurial.  A lot more needs to be done and must be

done  to  bridge the divide.  Otherwise, the divide  will

widen  into  a  gulf  filled  with  misunderstanding  and

distrust, where each side refuses to work with the  other

nor  share information or resources and prefers  to  work

with  its  own kind, or simply goes its own way and  does

its  own things.  This is divisive.  We will not  have  a

cohesive front to tackle our economic challenges.  On the

whole,  we will end up the poorer for it.  More needs  to

be  done for GLCs to actively engage SMEs and gain  their

trust, and for SMEs to improve and upgrade to secure  the

confidence of the GLCs that they are up to the  mark  and

will be able to deliver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation existing today? Today, more

so  than  ever  before,  I find that  our  local  private

enterprises are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



fearful of the competition coming from not just the  GLCs

but corporatised Government agencies and larger companies

as the domestic market place becomes increasingly crowded

and  keenly competitive.  The common complaint is centred

on having an unlevel playing field and being crowded out.

Our  smaller  local  companies find it  hard  to  compete

against the GLCs who have, over the years, as a result of

financial prudence, sound management and proper controls,

grown  even stronger, leaner, hungrier and better managed

than ever before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that at the millennium conference held a

couple  of  years back, when asked by a member  from  the

audience about competition from GLCs,  Senior Minister of

State Khaw Boon Wan, who was then Permanent Secretary  of

the Ministry of Trade and Industry, replied, "We put good

men to run our GLCs well.  If a GLC does not perform,  we

change  the  man."   I think that sent  chills  down  the

spines of many of the private sector bosses present then.

But  having  well-managed  and competitive  GLCs  is  not

necessarily a bad thing.  Our GLCs are not necessarily  a

bad   thing   to  building  internationally   competitive

Singapore companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned that, in the past, we did not have

sufficient private capital to fund the likes of  SIA  and

NOL,  and  therefore the Government had  to  step  in  to

provide  the  necessary funding.   And  that  times  have

changed  and  therefore  the  Government  should  not  be

involved in business nowadays, and should leave it to the

private sector.  But if we think about that, even  today,

if  we see the future is in wafer fabrication, which non-Government  related industrial conglomerate can  come  up

with the money to take up a meaningful equity stake in  a

billion  dollar  wafer  fab plant?   Can  our  wafer  fab

initiative be left totally to the private sector?  And if

not for the group of Hong Kong investors SM persuaded  to

invest  in  the Suntec City, which local group  would  be

daring  enough to invest in a Convention Centre the  size

of Suntec City at that time?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I think the Government and the Government-linked companies continue to have an important role to

play  even  today,  to  build  world-class  international

companies.   If, for example, there is good business in a

particular  area, should we identify a GLC,  promote  it,

manage  it  properly, so that it grows to be  substantial

enough  to compete with the best in the world,  and  then

later  divest it?  Or should we promote a private  sector

company  instead?  There is no one common  strategy  that

fits   across  the  broad  range  of  industries.    Some

industries, like wafer fab, port management and airlines,

must  at  least for now be left to the GLCs or  statutory

boards.  Others like pastries, security systems and trade

directories should clearly be left to private enterprise.

The  question is, where and how they should  be  involved

and   still   allow  room  for  creativity  and   private

enterprise  and  entrepreneurship to flourish?   And  the

objectives  and rules must be clearly spelt  out  and  be

made  transparent, and certain anti-competitive practices

must not be condoned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, Mr Ahmad Magad, will tell you that a

few  years  ago when he was planning to set up a  factory

for  his  company  in  the Suzhou  Industrial  Park,  the

authority  that issues the construction permit hinted  to

him  that  if he were to use a related design  house  and

contractor,  the permit would be issued in  a  matter  of

days.   But if he were to choose to use his own  designer

and contractor, then the permit may take much longer, and

even  months, before it is issued.  It seems that in  our

regionalisation  drive  and software  transfer  to  other

countries,  some of such bad practices have been  brought

back  into  Singapore  and have  slowly  crept  into  our

business environment.  This is not rampant as yet, but  I

think  a  larger  company  can  quite  easily  say  to  a

supplier,  "If you want this business from us,  then  you

must also use our sister company for other services."  We

must  not allow this practice to develop and must nip  it

in the bud.  This is beginning to happen in some sectors,

and I hope that we will take the initiative and take firm

action to nip it in the bud.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a case can be made out on why the continued

presence  of  GLCs is necessary, it is very difficult  to

convince the public and rationalise why statutory  boards

are  now  entering  the  market to compete  with  private

enterprises.    With  the  move  towards   privatisation,

liberalisation  and  deregulation,  the  Government  must

maintain a neutral position in order to be effective as a

regulator  and  national agency.  Is it  not  incongruous

that  SPRING  Singapore which spearheads SME  development

and  upgrading owns two subsidiaries (PSB Corporation and

PSB  Certification) that compete with the private sector?

These  two  entities operate as commercial  organisations

offering  training, consultancy, technology  and  testing

services  and  certification, leading  to  complaints  of

unfair advantage that these subsidiaries have against the

private  sector consultants.  Is there a  real  need  for

statutory  boards to form companies for them  to  achieve

its  mission?   A*STAR,  the new name  for  the  National

Science and Technology Board, formed Exploit Technologies

Private  Limited,  which the Agency  has  termed  as  its

commercialisation  arm.  Should  CISCO,  as  a  statutory

board,  venture beyond its armed protection  services  to

compete  head on with the private sector to  sell  alarms

and security systems, services and facilities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, what local SMEs greatly need is to have GLCs

help  open  doors for them, particularly  overseas.   The

GLCs  have  the  advantage of brand reputation,  network,

contacts,  connections and deep pockets.   The  SMEs  are

looking  for  a small piece of the action.  The  feedback

from  private bosses is that GLCs want to bao chek,  that

means  to take all, and bao yian, that means to win  all.

If  they  learn  a  good idea from the SMEs,  instead  of

working with the SMEs, they would take the idea and do it

themselves.  GLCs should work hard to dispel and  correct

this misconception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, local businessmen have told me

that  the MNCs are more open to tapping the local support

industries and outsourcing non-core activities  to  them.

Take Hewlett Packard, for example.  Throughout the years,

it has certainly provided many opportunities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



to  our local businessmen in the electronic manufacturing

services  and support industry, and given them a  crucial

leg up to help them start on their way to becoming world-class companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not until recent times, when market consolidation

pushes GLCs to focus on their core businesses, GLCs  were

aiming  to  be conglomerates, growing and expanding  into

all kinds of businesses with no regard to their strategic

relevance.   GLCs can gain in harnessing  the  creativity

and  entrepreneurship initiative of the local enterprises

by  partnering  them  in developing solutions  that  have

market  potential.  It can be a win-win  proposition  for

both  the SMEs and GLCs as a partnership of complementary

strength  can be forged.  Many of the budding  technology

companies lack the opportunity to build a track record to

commercialise  their solutions.  GLCs and Government  can

provide   the  test  bed  for  the  solutions   to   gain

recognition.  Some of these companies are even willing to

forgo commercial gains to build up their track record  or

even offer options for the companies to take up stakes in

these companies.  But not many got any headway as most of

the  GLCs  and  Government agencies prefer  to  take  the

option  of  DIY  (do-it-yourself) or use  the  tried  and

tested.   If  major  corporations  of  Singapore  do  not

support  the  SMEs, how can we expect  them  to  convince

potential overseas buyers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has various grants and financial

assistance  schemes in place to foster  innovation.   But

what  is lacking is the creation of an environment  where

local enterprises can easily find opportunities to deploy

their  solutions. Developing project or client references

is important.  It is also through larger scale deployment

and commercialisation that the innovative solution can be

tested   for   its  robustness  and  effectiveness,   and

stimulate continuing improvements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, local business associations' response to the

SME  21  has been lukewarm.  The feeling is that  SME  21

will  follow  the  fate  of  its  predecessor,  1998  SME

Masterplan,  which lost its momentum when  the  Singapore

economy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



picked  up and the MNCs returned to Singapore.  There  is

therefore a need to dedicate special attention and  focus

on  SMEs, even though the economy is starting to pick up.

In  many  advanced  countries, like USA  and  Japan,  the

government agencies set up to look after the interests of

SMEs  solely.   Therefore, this  debate  on  how  we  can

support  the  growth  of  our  private  enterprises   and

entrepreneurship  in  Singapore  is  timely.   I  believe

Singapore  entrepreneurs  and  businesses  too  have  big

dreams.  The Government and GLCs can act as a catalyst to

unleash  the  potential of the Singapore Enterprise.   By

supporting  the SMEs, we are nurturing a  culture  and  a

mindset  of  innovation  and creativity  that  marks  the

making of a great nation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  the Temasek Charter raises an issue  which  the

Minister  of  State  for Trade and Industry,  Mr  Raymond

Lim's  Entrepreneurship  and  Internationalisation   Sub-Committee  (EISC)  dealt with in their recently  released

report.  The main focus of the report is the role of  the

Government in business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public discourse has, of late, focused almost

exclusively on the issue of CPF after Senior Minister  of

State  for Trade and Industry Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam's

sub-committee  released its report.   However,  I  submit

that  the  issue  of the role of Government  in  business

deserves  equally intense scrutiny from Members  of  this

House  and  the public.   This is because it raises  very

fundamental  questions  about the  Government's  position

with  regard  to the nurturing of local enterprises,  the

responsibility   it  places  upon  itself   for   shaping

Singapore's economic landscape and hence, the  nature  of

government and its relation with the body politic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Temasek Charter cannot and should

not be divorced from the broader context of what the EISC

document  discusses.   This is  also  in  line  with  the

essence of the Motion before this House.  Moreover, it is

noted that parts of the Temasek Charter, especially the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



section on the raison d'etre of GLCs, are in fact similar

to those in the EISC document.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would like to deal with both the Temasek

Charter and the EISC recommendations in my speech,  under

what  I  term  as  the  four "Ds" of  the  Government  in

business.  The first "D" refers to delineation.  We  need

to  delineate  clearly  the  markers  for  Government  in

business.    This  would,  among  others,   help   reduce

allegations  from the private sector of encroachment  and

crowding out of their businesses by GLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC's recommendations regarding the

Government's  role  in business cover  not  only  Temasek

Holdings  but  also individual Ministries  and  statutory

boards.   The  EISC report is an excellent, well-thought-out  and  generally balanced report.  There  are  a  good

number  of wise and highly quotable statements  from  the

document, three of which are particularly memorable to me

and which provide good rules of thumb for delineating the

boundary  conditions of Government  in  business.   These

are,   firstly,   "We   should   not   corporatise    for

corporatisation's sake."  I strongly support  the  EISC's

recommendation  that statutory boards should  as  far  as

possible  not  corporatise regulatory  functions  because

these are often monopoly functions and will lead to  rent

seeking behaviour by the enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be a natural tendency for the public to

perceive,  rightly or wrongly, that the  enterprise  will

resist  simplifying rules and regulations as  this  could

lead  to  a loss of revenue in fees and charges.   Hence,

the  often heard refrain that the Government's  fees  and

charges are high and should be cut.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IRAS, for instance, was previously criticised,

in The Straits Times of 9th January 1997,  for announcing

its  staff  increments and bonuses took into account  the

amount of tax revenue collected.  This led the public  to

infer that the IRAS staff had every incentive to maximise

its tax collection!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the EISC, I submit that it will be better to

keep activities of statutory boards that are strategic to

their   missions  as  public  functions,  even   if   the

activities   can  be  organised  to  attract   commercial

returns.  We should not corporatise for corporatisation's

sake   or  just  because  everyone  is  jumping  on   the

bandwagon.  In this respect, if corporatisation is deemed

necessary,  the  EISC mentions the use  of  the  National

HealthGroup model, which I wholeheartedly support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second rule of thumb, as recommended by the

EISC,  is, "Temasek Holdings should compel GLCs to  scale

up their core competencies to build global businesses, as

opposed  to concentrating on the local market to build  a

diverse range of unrelated businesses."  Some GLCs  (such

as   SembCorp   Industries  and  NOL)  and   corporatised

enterprises  of statutory boards (such as Ascendas)  have

already  initiated  this aggressively.   Other  GLCs  and

corporatised entities should also strive to do the  same.

Their reliance on the local market should be reduced  and

the  temptation to invest in a diverse range of unrelated

businesses  to  improve  their bottomline  or  simply  to

justify  their existence should be resisted.  This  would

minimise the crowding out effect by GLCs which many  SMEs

complain they suffer from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last three decades, GLCs have proliferated

and  taken on a life of their own.  As noted in  Business

Times,   3rd  June  2002,  Singapore  Technologies,   for

instance,  has spawned so many subsidiaries that  if  its

new Chief Executive, Peter Seah, were to visit one a day,

it would reportedly take him up till 2005 to complete his

rounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, any major attempt to divest or rationalise

the  GLCs  could trigger a chain reaction,  upsetting  an

entire  apple cart of entrenched interests, institutional

arrangements   and   corporate   culture   and    agenda.

Fortunately,  as  noted  by  the  EISC,  many  GLCs   are

professionally run, profitable, listed on the bourse, and

own  reputable and thus valuable brand names that  should

not be destroyed purely to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



silence the large contingent of GLC critics and cynics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, history does contain some lessons for

us.   The  70s  and 80s were the era of the conglomerate.

It  became  fashionable among businesses  in  the  US  to

integrate vertically, horizontally, or even sideways,  to

cover  the  entire, or even out of the value chain.   The

result  was a mish-mash of business units often unrelated

to  the  original function.  The holding company  of  the

conglomerate, in effect, became a kind of internal  stock

market, allocating funds to its subsidiaries on the basis

of financial performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the late 80s and early 90s, it became evident

that  this  strategy  created  large  unwieldy  corporate

creatures  without  the agility to compete  against  more

nimble  firms  that  chipped  away  at  their  respective

businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research in the US has shown that the decline of

these conglomerates stems from the enormous difficulty of

managing  a  diversity  of  unrelated  operations.    The

reaction  was  to  return to "core  competencies"  and  a

painful  dismantling of these large business units.   The

semi-conductor  business,  for  example,  now   organises

itself around chip designers and foundries which are,  in

fact, sub-contractors to the former.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a danger that GLCs and Government agencies

may  sometimes fall into the trap of acting in the manner

of  the now discredited corporate conglomerates.  I speak

from  my personal experience.  During the heydays of  the

property  market  boom in the mid-90s,  not  a  few  non-property GLCs were tempted by the astounding profits  one

could  make  from property investment.  To be fair,  GLCs

were  not  the only firms to succumb to that  temptation.

On  hindsight,  property  investment  could  indeed  have

delivered  superior shareholder returns, but  most  firms

did not exit quick enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus many of these firms came to grief when the

bubble  burst, causing them to abandon their grand  plans

to turn into property players.  Many of them have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



since  unwound  or are unwinding unrelated businesses  to

focus  on  what  they do best, for instance,  Delgro  and

NatSteel.   Madam, I hope that GLCs will be ever  mindful

of  this  chapter of their history and not turn back  the

clock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third rule of thumb refers to the well known

"Yellow  Pages"  rule.  Instead of endorsing  the  EISC's

recommended  Yellow Pages rule, the Temasek Charter  has,

instead, chosen the opposite route - seeking to build  on

the  best  attributes of Singapore's unique GLC's  model.

Rather than destroying the value of GLCs which first took

shape  more  than three decades ago, Temasek  has  chosen

what is probably a more pragmatic incrementalist approach

and    eschewed    the   idea   of   privatisation    for

privatisation's sake.  Instead, GLCs are  to  be  run  as

commercial entities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not unlike the EISC's recommendations that

GLCs  should not do national service and only people  who

can  contribute  to  the businesses  of  GLCs  should  be

appointed  to the boards.  The GLCs are to shape  up  and

perform.  Otherwise, they may have to be shipped out  or,

in  the  words  of Temasek's Executive Director,  Mdm  Ho

Ching, be prepared to be had for lunch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs are to focus on core competencies, divest non-core businesses, but more importantly, they are to build

significant    international   or   regional    business.

Businesses  that  are  no  longer  relevant  or  have  no

international growth potential are likely to be divested.

I    will   talk   a   little   bit   more   about    the

internationalisation aspect later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the "Yellow Pages" rule proposed by the

EISC  would  still be relevant in the case  of  statutory

boards,  who should adopt this rule to set up enterprises

only  if the private sector is not providing or is unable

to  provide a particular service.  And I think  this  was

affirmed  earlier  by the Minister of State,  Mr  Raymond

Lim.   In the past, the private sector was underdeveloped

and thus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



unable  to  provide  a  host of  much  needed  and  vital

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector has now become much more

sophisticated  and  reached  a  degree  of  maturity,  as

evidenced  by the likes of Creative Technology  and  City

Development.  They have proven to be highly versatile  at

adapting  to  and exploiting evolving market  trends  and

technologies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory boards must religiously adopt the

principle  of  not  setting up an enterprise  unless  all

avenues   to  involve  private  sector  enterprises   are

exhausted.  Even so, statutory boards could still seek to

be   involved  with  the  private  sector  through  joint

ventures,   or  what  is  currently  a  global  corporate

favourite  -  outsourcing  - instead  of  setting  up  an

enterprise  by  itself.  This would help to  create  more

space and opportunities for the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the above principles enunciated by EISC,

I  fully endorse the three-fold rationale stated  in  the

Temasek  Charter  for the Government to be  in  business.

And  these  are to manage strategic, critical  resources,

such  as  water, power and gas; to pursue  public  policy

objectives,  such as healthcare, housing  and  education;

and  to  enable Singapore to sprout a second  wing  -  an

external  wing  -  so that we, as a nation,  can  compete

beyond  the narrow confines of Singapore's geography,  or

perhaps  to  quote  some famous words from  "Star  Trek",

"boldly go where no man has gone."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many large, as well as non-listed, GLCs fall into

the  first  two  categories - Group A which  is  what  is

referred to as Group A businesses - media, water,  power,

sea   and  airports.   Additionally,  many  non-Group   A

category GLCs are already loosely defined in category (3)

and referred to as Group B businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal a bit more with the

internationalisation aspect, or what I call,  the  second

D,  and  that  is,  Diaspora.  I submit that,  with  some

exceptions - notably firms, like the Millennium and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



Copthorne  Group - private enterprise will  probably  not

attempt  to enter, much less, conquer, lucrative overseas

markets without some nudging from the Government and GLCs

leading  the  way.  Hence, Group B GLCs will  undoubtedly

play   a   key   role  in  the  internationalisation   of

Singapore's private firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a word of caution is in order here. GLCs

must   be  constantly  reminded  that  they  should   not

internationalise for internationalisation's sake.   Based

on  Singapore  Inc's  track record till  date,  Singapore

companies  that  have succeeded in international  markets

have  been  rare, and profitable international  expansion

has  even  been  rarer.  But the value of  the  Singapore

brand  is  undoubtedly  high, as  experience  in  rapidly

developing  countries, like China,  demonstrates.   There

are   thus   wonderful  opportunities  for  a   Singapore

Diaspora.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs must be mindful that the promotion of the

external  economy  is only justifiable  if  it  generates

higher   returns  than  the  potential  growth  rate   of

Singapore without the external economy.  The burden  must

be  on  the  GLCs  to  deliver superior  returns  on  the

external  economy  to  justify their  course  of  action.

Expanding  aggressively  but blindly  into  international

markets  could, instead of improving our economic  bottom

line, do it more harm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the quest for a more diversified

earnings  base  by overseas expansion is a necessary  but

insufficient   condition   for   category   B   GLCs   to

internationalise.  IE Singapore, whose role  is  to  grow

our  external  wing, should make every  attempt  to  link

these  GLCs  up with suitable local private sector  firms

willing  and capable of expanding overseas in the  chosen

markets.  This way, definite benefits will accrue to both

parties, private and public sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third D refers to Detachment. The Temasek

Charter has emphasised the commitment of GLCs to  be  run

as commercial entities, detaching ownership by Government

from commercial-minded management.  Furthermore, they are

to strive to be truly international businesses,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



with  clear  strategies on how to get there.   Similarly,

the  EISC's  recommendations  also  favour  a  commercial

approach for GLCs.  Indeed, Temasek's choice of the  term

"TLCs"  to  describe its large and formidable  stable  of

companies seems to reinforce its desire to de-link itself

from the Government.  But the question is: "Can it really

do so?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the EISC notes, Temasek should make a conscious

effort   to  cast  a  wide  net  to  attract  world-class

managerial   talent  into  GLCs,  foreign  or  otherwise.

Indeed, Temasek could bring more private sector directors

on the boards of its companies and management to ensure a

good  mix  of people, able to give different perspectives

and ensure that the companies are run on sound commercial

principles - delivering commercial returns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow a good mix, Temasek should avoid appointing

too many Government and SAF scholars - undoubtedly highly

intelligent, driven and capable people - to the ranks  of

senior  management of these companies.  Undeniably,  many

of  them have subsequently carved out sterling careers in

the  private  sector.  However, even though these  people

are   placed  in  the  private  sector,  they   may   not

necessarily be of the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scholars carefully groomed by the system and attuned

to the culture of the public sector, parachuting into key

positions  in GLCs, may have a propensity to  carry  with

them a Government mindset that does not sit well with the

workings  of  the  private sector.  I submit  that  there

should be a greater degree of intermingling of public and

private  sector  talents  in  GLCs.   It  must  never  be

construed  as  a zero sum game when a public  servant  is

lost to the private sector, and vice versa.  Indeed,  the

intermingling will serve to enrich both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth and final D refers to Divestment. While

supporting  the  spirit of divestment where  appropriate,

the  Temasek  Charter  does not spell  out  any  definite

divestment   timetable,  as  some  of  my   parliamentary

colleagues  have  alluded to earlier.   Instead,  Temasek

notes that it has been progressively divesting its stake



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



in  non-strategic companies and listing some companies to

broaden  their  ownership base.  It also states  that  it

will   continue   to  rationalise  and  consolidate   its

shareholdings  where  it  is opportune  to  do  so.   The

argument  for the lack of a definite divestment programme

is  the need to achieve the best price for the unit being

divested.  If market conditions are not right,  it  makes

no commercial sense to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, whilst I agree that this is

largely a reasonable path to take, and I am certainly not

advocating  a great GLC sale, we have to be mindful  that

the  cost  for  not divesting soon enough could  be  even

higher,   and  that  is  the  killing  off   of   private

enterprise.   As a compromise, I suggest Temasek  perform

an  annual  divestment audit, taking into  account  other

than  the  usual factors, like capital market conditions,

strategic relevance and likely price, the impact  on  the

private  sector  of  divestment or  otherwise.   Further,

subject  to  suitable  safeguards, the  divestment  audit

could  be  tabled  in  Parliament for  debate.   This  is

another way of putting in place what the EISC has  itself

recommended - mandatory periodic housekeeping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the divestment programme, Temasek should also not

be  averse  to  the dismantling of its companies.   Size,

though  useful,  is  not always a competitive  advantage.

Specifically,  there  should  be  a  proper  cost-benefit

analysis  to  determine if the break-up  value  from  the

different logical parts of the business exceeds the value

of the entity as a unified whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying this, I must state that I am not against

size  for  its  own  sake.   I also  recognise  that  the

competition law that the EISC speaks of, operates only to

break  up  the  abuse  of monopoly  power,  not  monopoly

itself.  But quite apart from what the future competition

authorities can and will do, Temasek itself,  as  arm  of

the  Singapore Government, should proactively ensure that

the  actions  of  its subsidiaries do not stifle  private

enterprise through the sheer weight of its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



size  and market power.  Another model I support  is  the

management buy-out which has been proposed in the  recent

case of NatSteel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for Temasek to act more decisively

in   its  divestment  programme,  lest  the  Charter   be

construed as mere talk without action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to applaud the efforts

of  the  relevant  parties  in preparing  both  the  EISC

documents and the Temasek Charter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Temasek was formed in 1974 as the Government's

investment holding arm, it has grown to include more than

60  major  companies,  with  subsidiaries  and  associate

companies  in  almost  every  economic  sector,  with   a

workforce  of some 150,000.  This is more than twice  the

size  of  the  entire civil service, which  is  currently

reported   on   the  website  as  about  60,000   strong.

Furthermore, the top 22 GLCs are reported to account  for

13%  of  the  country's gross domestic product  in  1998.

GLCs  are  thus  indeed  very  significant  and  play  an

important role in Singapore's economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I submit that times have changed. GLCs will

need   multi-industry  knowledge,  technology  assessment

capabilities, and financial expertise well in  excess  of

what  it now has.  Recall the lessons of the conglomerate

and its demise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising that the private sector provides the

best  seedbed for enterprise and innovation, it will need

all  the  space  it  can  get - physical,  financial  and

economic.  In this regard, the business of government  is

ultimately not government in business, but government for

business  - planting, watering, pruning, nurturing  -  to

grow  and  nurture the future heroes of  capitalism  that

will  spearhead  the  next stage of Singapore's  economic

development  and, in the process, we could convince  more

would-be quitters to be stayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I therefore support the Motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



<br>7.05 pm



<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion to implement the

recommendations     of    the    Entrepreneurship     and

Internationalisation  Sub-Committee  (EISC).    I   fully

support  the  recommendation  to  redefine  the  role  of

Government  in business and to call on the Government  to

support  local  private enterprise.  I particularly  like

the idea that Government-linked companies should work  in

collaboration  and  partnership  with  small  and  medium

enterprises to complement their business rather  than  to

compete with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has already been said in Parliament as well as

outside  as  to  how  GLCs stifle and crowd  out  private

enterprise.   However, I would like to  say  that  it  is

equally  important  that we do not  over  exaggerate  the

negative  side of GLCs because, by and large,  they  have

not  done  too badly.  They have done quite a  good  job.

They   are  run  professionally,  efficiently  and   also

profitably.   They provide a lot of jobs for  our  people

and  they  also contribute to a significant part  of  our

GDP,  some  13%.   A handful of them -  I  am  glad  that

bouquets  have  also been thrown at GLCs  -  have  helped

Singapore establish its international brand name.  And it

is  because of the good reputation caused by GLCs, a  lot

of  local enterprises have been helped in their marketing

efforts overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the hue and cry and criticisms levelled

at  GLCs, some of them have already begun the process  of

collaborating with local enterprises.  The logistics  arm

of  SembCorp Industries teamed up with Goodpack  to  make

use  of  their  specially developed metal  containers  to

international  bulk  carriers.  We also  have  CapitaLand

with  Kinderkids  World providing childcare  services  at

their   properties  abroad.   All  these   are   positive

developments and ought to be acknowledged.  Of course,  a

lot more can be done and a lot needs to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether private enterprise would have flourished

without GLCs is a moot point.  But it is clear that  GLCs

were formed at a time when private enterprise was either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



unwilling  or  unable to get into businesses  which  GLCs

went  into.   Of  course, there are many instances  where

GLCs  slipped their fingers into one pie too  many.   But

most  of  that  is the past, and I think  they  are  also

embarrassed.  So, let us not harp on it.  Let us move  on

and find the proper solutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the EISC as well as the New

Temasek  Charter recently unveiled are all steps  in  the

right  direction.  There is a recognition that  Singapore

today  is  not quite the same as it was many  years  back

and,  in  the  new situation, the role of  Government  in

business  needs to change.  This role, however, need  not

be changed so quickly and so drastically.  Some of us may

think that the remaking of Singapore is all about turning

Singapore  upside down and inside out, but  life  is  not

quite  so simple as that.  Some things can be done,  some

things cannot be done, short of shooting your own foot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs, because of the magnitude of their presence in

the  marketplace, it would be imprudent to have a  sudden

divestment  of  businesses  worth  billions  of  dollars,

involving  hundreds  and thousands of  jobs.   This  will

surely destroy shareholders' values, and shareholders are

Singaporeans.  It will destroy shareholders'  values  and

it  will destroy jobs.  This will not be good for us  and

clearly, it will not be the right step to take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we need a much more well-managed and organised

approach towards divestment, and I am glad that the  EISC

as  well as Temasek Holdings are taking the positive  and

right  steps  in  this  direction.   What  is  much  more

important  is  the  development  of  the  entrepreneurial

spirit.   This is not an easy task, but steps  are  being

taken.   They  are  pushing this goal,  but  we  have  to

recognise  that it is going to be a long haul because  we

are starting fairly right from the bottom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to share with the

House  a  report  published  by  Global  Entrepreneurship

Monitor  (GEM),  which  is  an international  body  which

tracks entrepreneurial activity worldwide.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



In  its  2001 report, it compared some 29 countries.   We

fared  not so well.  We were ranked 27th out of  29.   In

its 2000 report, we were 19th out of 21.  So we are quite

far  away from the Number 1 position which we would  like

to occupy and boast about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this so? Critics of GLCs would probably jump

at  this and say, "I told you so!  GLCs are crowding  off

local  private  enterprises."  But the real  reasons  are

quite  complex.  The GEM report recognises that Singapore

has  a  rather  unique challenge and handicap.   This  is

because, as Mdm Deputy Speaker has said, we have a rather

small  domestic economy.  This means that, by  necessity,

businesses  must venture overseas in order to  acquire  a

size  that  matters.  Businesses may argue that  if  they

have had the entire domestic economy to itself, small  as

it  may  be,  it will give them that start-up  advantage.

But  we have to remember that we operate an open economy.

If  we do not compete against GLCs, then we will have  to

contend  with  MNCs.  So, in a way, the  GLCs  provide  a

check  against MNCs.  But, whatever the reason might  be,

there must be a recognition that because of the smallness

of  our  economy, businesses must, by nature, strike  out

and acquire a size that matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GEM report also noted that the Government has

already   promoted  entrepreneurial   activity   in   the

technology  area.   This  is a good  practical  approach,

because it is in the cutting-edge of technology and  life

sciences  that we have the greatest chances  of  success.

But  even this approach has its pitfalls, as the Internet

bubble  has  taught us a few painful  lessons.   But  the

point  here is that by playing safe, focusing  on  a  few

technology companies, we are actually also going  against

the grain or the spirit of entrepreneurship, which is not

being  afraid to fail.  Therefore, I would like  to  urge

the  Government to promote greater entrepreneurship.   It

is  not  just about high-tech; it should also be  medium-tech,  low-tech and no-tech, because the whole spirit  of

entrepreneurship  is  also  about  the  spirit  of  self-reliance.  If we look at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



products and services we use everyday - the food we  eat,

the clothes we wear, the chairs we sit on - these are no-tech   businesses.   These  are  services  and   products

provided  by  businesses with a few thousand  dollars  or

millions  of  dollars  of turnover.   But  one  thing  is

common.  They are started up by entrepreneurs, either out

of  necessity or out of a passion, ie, their  ability  to

know that they can do something better than others.   So,

whatever  their  motivation,  it  is  important  that  we

encourage and support them, because it is out of a  large

pool of entrepreneurs that some superstars can emerge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can use the analogy in football, I suppose.

Brazil  has  won the World Cup a few times, and  this  is

because  an  entire nation is just crazy about  football.

So,  they have a lot of footballers to choose from.   All

young Brazilian boys play it on every piece of land  that

they  can find.  We also celebrated a trawl of four goals

in the recent Commonwealth Games.  We won in table tennis

and  badminton, games which are not entirely popular with

Singaporeans.   But  we won because of  imported  foreign

talent.   That  is  not so bad.  And  this  is  the  same

formula which has won us many goals for our economy.   We

won  because of foreign direct investments, and this  has

helped us to achieve remarkable growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not quite the same. We could have

continued  this strategy, but the landscape has  changed.

So it is important that we grow more local entrepreneurs.

But  it  has  to  be also noted that there  is  a  direct

correlation   between  foreign  direct   investment   and

entrepreneurial activity.  The GEM report noted that,  in

the  case of Belgium - only Belgium and Japan were ranked

below Singapore - it was a country whose economy is  very

highly   dependent  on  foreign  direct  investment   and

international  trade,  its  entrepreneurial  activity  is

abysmally low.  So, critics said that this was due to the

fact   that   foreign   direct  investments   just   make

entrepreneurial activity less attractive.   But  the  GEM

report  also noted that Belgium did not quite help itself

in  terms  of  entrepreneurial  training  to  help  shape

attitudes  and  behaviour.  So, entrepreneurial  training

was only present at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



undergraduate  and  graduate level, but  it  was  totally

absent  across the system relating to primary,  secondary

and  pre-university level.  Therefore, it  just  did  not

stimulate  the  attitudes which  were  so  vital  for  an

entrepreneurial mindset and environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, perhaps, we too can look at our own education

system.   Our  schools now focus very  much  on  academic

results,  and  our  vocational institutes,  on  technical

skills.   This orientation has obviously served  us  well

for  many  years.  We will continue to require  brilliant

academics, competent technicians but, at this  stage,  we

need  something  more.   So we need  to  weave  into  our

education  system creativity, entrepreneurial  attributes

like  dare-to-dream and dare-to-fail.  That way,  we  can

develop and shape attitudes amongst our young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end by looking at which are the

countries which are ranked well, and what are the lessons

we  can  draw from them.  The dark horses were Australia,

New  Zealand and Mexico.  I call them dark horses because

they  do  not really have exactly high-profile economies.

But   they   were  ranked  very  highly   in   terms   of

entrepreneurial activity.  And this was attributed to the

fact  that there was a high level of government awareness

in  this  area, promoting entrepreneurship and having  an

active  engagement with entrepreneurial leaders as  well.

In  the  case  of  Mexico,  its  economy  was  very  much

dominated by large public and private monopolies, and yet

entrepreneurship is very much alive and  thriving.   This

is  because  these  large public  and  private  companies

actually   outsource  their  activities  to   the   small

independent businesses which are able to run  in  a  much

more  agile manner.  Hence, the point made on outsourcing

many times over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korea was also ranked very highly and this was due

to  the  fact  that it was able to address  the  problems

surfacing from the 1997 Asian economic crisis very  well.

It  was  able  to  develop  very  specific  measures,  in

particular  to  develop  new  businesses.  As  we  remake

Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



I  think  there  are  lessons to  gain  from  the  Korean

experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the great entrepreneurial star - the United

States  of  America.  It has been a star for  many,  many

years.   This is because its culture embraces change  and

opportunity  seeking.   Entrepreneurship  is  very   much

regarded  as an accepted and highly respected  occupation

and   failure   is  regarded  as  an  accepted   learning

experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we too can develop a culture which embraces

change  and  opportunity in a big way.  We too  can  make

entrepreneurship an accepted and highly respected  career

and   we  too  can  make  failure  an  accepted  learning

experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, we must have Government incentives

and support. We must have laws and regulations lightened.

We  must  have  the  GLCs now working more  and  more  in

collaboration and in support of local enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, we need a complete transformation of

the  entire  nation's attitude towards  entrepreneurship.

It  is  a  good start.  It is a long haul but it is  very

encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the

Motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  I would like to support the Motion by Mr  Leong

Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh and share in their request

for the Government to consider the implementation of some

of  the key recommendations of the EISC on Government  in

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other speakers ahead of me had spoken

persuasively  on  the merits  of the recommendations  and

also commented on the need for Singapore to encourage the

development of entrepreneurship and local enterprise  and

I need not elaborate again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GEM report has accumulated evidence from their

research over several



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



years that documents the significant relationship between

entrepreneurship  and  national economic  adaptation  and

expansion.  From the GEM report, it does appear  that  in

less-developed and developing countries where the economy

is  less dependent on international trade, where there is

less  extensive social welfare system and the  women  are

less empowered in the economy, necessity entrepreneurship

dominates  and it is positively related to the  state  of

economic  development.  India ranks  very  high  in  this

score.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in the more developed countries,

opportunity  entrepreneurship dominates. The  GEM  report

finds  that  the rate of opportunity entrepreneurship  is

higher  where  there  is  reduced  national  emphasis  on

manufacturing,  less  intrusive  Government   regulation,

higher prevalence of informal investors and a significant

respect  for  entrepreneurial activity.  In this  aspect,

the USA is a case in point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague had mentioned earlier, Singapore has

one  of  the  lowest rates of entrepreneurial  activities

amongst  the  GEM  2001 countries.  Many unique  national

features were earlier cited to explain the lower level of

entrepreneurial activities in Singapore.  These  features

are  embedded in our social and economic systems  and  we

need   to   actively   implement   some   of   the    key

recommendations of the EISC report so as  to  create  the

necessary mechanisms and structures to improve  our  rate

of entrepreneurship activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of our national goal of creating a more

vibrant and more diverse economy, we need to increase the

rate  of  public  and  private  investment,  devoted   to

entrepreneurial activity so as to accelerate  innovation,

technological  development  and  job  creation.   In  the

Singapore economy, there are 103,000 SMEs which  make  up

some  90%  of all establishments and employ  50%  of  the

workforce.   These SMEs contribute only 35% to  our  GDP,

whilst MNCs contribute 45% and, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



I understand earlier, the GLCs contribute some 13%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This formula had worked in the past but we need to

continuously improve the share of private entrepreneurial

activity   and   create  an  environment  whereby   local

enterprise  can develop the capabilities,  resources  and

size that would allow them to compete in the regional, if

not,  the  global marketplace.  The creation of  such  an

entrepreneurship  society  can only  benefit  Singapore's

economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singaporeans, we are heartened at the success of

our  GLCs, particularly in their ability to move into the

knowledge, technology and capital intensive sectors, both

locally  and also in the international arena.  GLCs  were

set  up  to  spearhead the development of  the  Singapore

economy and they had fulfilled their mission.  That said,

I  hope  that the GLCs would continue to play a  role  in

spearheading the remaking of the new Singapore economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate that Temasek Holdings had come forward

and  shared their new defined Charter and articulated the

role of the Temasek-linked companies to all Singaporeans.

However,  I would like to urge the other sectors  of  the

GLCs  including the labour-linked companies (LLCs)  (some

of  my  colleagues call them NLCs), the statutory  board-linked  companies (SBLCs) and the press-linked  companies

(PLCs)  to  follow the example set by Temasek  and  share

their  strategic  roadmap with Singaporeans.   I  believe

that such communication would address the anxiety of  the

local  enterprises  in  terms  of  the  perceived  unfair

competition from GLCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TLCs had communicated and informed Singaporeans that

they  intend  to spearhead the development of  enterprise

and to partner other non-TLCs, including local SMEs, when

venturing   into  more  knowledge-based  activities   and

regional  markets.  TLCs, in this instance, can play  the

role of the big brother or sister, where the case may be,

to  invest value-add and partner with the private  sector

to groom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



viable  local enterprises to compete effectively  in  the

regional  arena.   I am sure that local SMEs  would  look

forward  to further dialogues and exchanges with TLCs  to

work   out   effective   and   profitable   collaborative

arrangements.   I  also hope that over  time,  our  local

entrepreneurs  will  associate  TLCs  with  the  acronym,

"tender,  loving  care", signifying a  more  pro-business

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a renewed marked shift globally towards

private-public partnership (PPP) as an engine for growth.

PPP  recognises that both the public and private  sectors

have  certain  advantages relative to the performance  of

specific tasks. Thus, by allowing each sector to do  what

it  does best, public services and infrastructure can  be

provided  in the most economically efficient manner.   In

the  United States, over the last couple of years,  there

have  been  much renewed intense discussions on  how  the

Government can work better and cost less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, this focus has led to discussions as to

whether  or to what extent the private sector  should  be

performing  many of the functions currently performed  by

the  Government.  With budget deficit reduction  and  the

downsizing of Government agencies, the American attention

on  privatisation, competition and efficiency has greatly

increased.   In Ireland, PPP has been widely implemented,

initially through modestly scaled projects, with the  aim

of  combining  the  best  of public  and  private  sector

expertise to create value for money and quality outcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPP has been encouraged through many economic

sectors,  such  as housing, education, healthcare,  local

service,  public utilities and transport.   According  to

the   GEM   report,   Ireland  has  the   highest   total

entrepreneurial activity within Europe.  The  World  Bank

has  also  articulated their emphasis on  private  sector

participation  as engines for growth.  In  recent  years,

the  World Bank has encouraged private participation  not

only  in  infrastructure development but  also  in  human

services,  most prominently in education, healthcare  and

social security.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore faces major technological

transformation  and a maturing economy, both  the  public

and  private  sectors  must share the  responsibility  of

defining new national strategies that would unleash human

creativity   to   enable  us  to   innovate   and   adapt

technologies   and  opportunities  to  our   own   needs.

Singapore needs to build our own model for public-private

partnership.   Thus,  it is also timely  for  our  public

sector to review the potential of PPP in their activities

and to share such visions with Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the experience of other countries has

reminded   us   that   though   the   opportunities   for

privatisation  are  plentiful,  the  path  to  successful

business   relationships  and   implementation   of   PPP

nevertheless would face many challenges.  I believe  that

for  PPP  to  work in Singapore, we need to realistically

identify the hurdles to successful PPP implementation, to

develop the administrative structure to enable PPP to put

into  practice and to formalise an incentive system  that

would  foster collaboration and cooperation  between  the

two  sectors for the benefit and long-term needs  of  the

nation.  The success of PPP in Singapore would depend  to

a  large  extent, on a well-thought out charter and  plan

that    is    effectively   communicated   to   different

stakeholders  such  as  the one  articulated  by  Temasek

recently.   I  hope  that  the other  GLCs  and  relevant

Government agencies would also share their plans with  us

in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike TLCs which would primarily play the role as

the   co-investor,  other  public  sector  agencies   can

participate in many other forms of PPP which may  include

outsourcing, contract services, build, operate, transfer,

and many other types of PPP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful PPP can only result if there is

commitment  from top public officials who are willing  to

be actively engaged and support the concept and taking  a

leadership  role in the development of such partnerships.

Equally  important  is that the private  sector  partners

must  have  the  relevant skills and  experience  in  the

specific area of partnership being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



considered.   Once the partnership has been  established,

the  public sector must remain actively involved  in  the

programme or project not only in terms of monitoring, but

also  in  value-adding.  As such, PPP  will  provide  the

platform   for   the   creation   of   more   opportunity

entrepreneurship,   thereby  enabling   Singaporeans   to

continue   to   expand  our  economy  through   increased

entrepreneurial activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate, Mdm Deputy Speaker, my

support   for   the  Motion  proposed  for  debate   this

afternoon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

thank you for allowing me to speak on the Motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I would start by giving an analogy which

encapsulates  my opinion on the debate on  GLCs  and  the

SMEs.   In  an ecosystem, there is a dynamic  complex  of

plants,  animals and micro-organisms and their non-living

environment  interacting  as a  functional  unit.   Each,

regardless  of  size, has a role to play in  the  web  of

life.   For  example, in the ocean ecosystem, the  oceans

support  a  wide variety of plants and animals which  co-exist  in  relative harmony, each fulfilling  a  specific

niche and role they have in the ecosystem.  While in  any

ecosystem  there  is  competition  and  survival  of  the

fittest,  there  are  also symbiotic relationships.   The

ecosystem is really a matrix of inter-relations, not just

a  singular approach or formula.  Take, for example,  the

little  cleaner  fish in the ocean.  How does it survive?

Often,  tiny micro-organisms fasten themselves to  a  big

fish and make sores on its body.  When this happens,  the

big  fish  goes  to a coral reef where the  cleaner  fish

lives.   The  cleaner fish hunts all over the fish  body,

and  helps  the big fish by eating all these tiny  micro-organisms and, in this way, the cleaner fish gets fed and

the bigger fish is spared the discomfort.  An economy  is

similar to the ecosystem.  As such, there is a place  and

role for large corporations and smaller enterprises.  The

difficult part is how do we go about this balancing act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with the House my thoughts on this.

Rather than just levelling the playing field in Singapore

for  the SMEs, there should be more constructive ways  to

help  them  grow, compete and survive beyond our  shores.

The  Chinese proverb  -  give a man a fish, and he  would

eat  for a day; teach a man to fish, and he would eat for

the rest of his life  -  is very true.  There is no level

playing  field in the economic world anywhere.   So,  why

create  an  artificial environment that will only  ensure

local survival?  What is at stake is continued and global

survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I believe there are two key elements which are

critical to any GLC versus SME debate.  The first is  the

definition  of our economic ecosystem.  We  must  realise

that  the playing field is not just the domestic  market.

Rather,  the economic ecosystem is well beyond Singapore.

We  must  not  run  the risk of debating  how  we  should

compete  locally,  ie, keeping the balance  in  our  pond

ecosystem  while  the  larger ocean ecosystem,  which  is

globalisation, washes us over and leaves us in its wake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our discussions, we must be mindful that the

mission  is building establishments out in the world  for

our descendants, so that wherever we decide to stake out,

there  is  always   HQ Singapore.  To  have  such  global

ambitions, we need a strong home base, just as  the  SMEs

want  to build a strong home base, so we should not  deny

the  GLCs  the  same.   A strong home  base  will  better

prepare our companies to take on the world.  There is  an

incessant  cry  that SMEs are being  crowded  out.   When

faced  with  Goliath, David may have just  cause  to  cry

foul.  But, paradoxically, organisational ecologists have

observed  empirically that increased dominance  of  large

firms  actually creates an environment that is hospitable

to the entry of smaller specialist organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The August issue of Stamford Business further

reported  that this is seen in industry after industry  - breweries, airlines, auditing, music recording, newspaper

publishing, manufacturing of hard disks, etc.   As  large

generalist firms tend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



to  go  for  the market centre, niches appear around  the

periphery.   In  beer parlance, the small  craft  brewers

moved  in  to provide consumers with a wider  variety  in

taste, colour, form and serving temperature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibrancy of the local business landscape is

borne out by the statistics.  In the 10 years, from  1988

to  1998, the number of SME establishments grew  by  59%.

The  same organisational ecologists also subscribe to the

red  queen  theory.   Remember the  red  queen  in  Lewis

Carol's  fairytale "Through the Looking Glass".  The  red

queen  seems  to be running but actually staying  on  the

same spot.  What it means is that competition is good, in

that a company is forced by direct competition to improve

its  performance, in turn, pressurising its rivals to  do

so,  thereby  creating a virtuous cycle of  learning  and

competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A research has revealed that a lack of domestic

competitive experience is a critical disadvantage when  a

firm  is  thrust  into  global  competition.   Hence,   a

competitive landscape must be nurtured.  So, it is not  a

question of snuffing out the big boys, neither is it that

the  SMEs  do not have a role in embracing and  enhancing

Singapore's competitiveness and economic growth.  Rather,

let  us see how we can harness the strengths of the  GLCs

to  nurture and promote the SMEs, so that they  can  also

get  bigger, stronger and fly the Singapore flag  in  the

world.  Coexistence of the GLCs and SMEs would have to be

the  way  forward,  honing  our capabilities  within  our

shores, so that once we foray abroad and leaning on brand

Singapore, which is one that is already recognisable, one

with high regional and global awareness and standing  for

efficiency, fair dealing and transparency, we will have a

much better overall chance of success and survival.



<br><br><i>Competitive coexistence</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some of my suggestions. First, let us

network  and talk.  So, what is so difficult  about  this

especially  where  we proactively do this  with  overseas

businessmen and potential partners?  Strangely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



enough,  I  suspect  that we do not  do  enough  of  this

between  the GLCs and SMEs.  We need a bridge to  connect

the  GLCs  and SMEs.  Through this bridge, ideas  can  be

exchanged,  lessons learned can be shared,  new  business

thoughts  may spring forth and partnerships may  blossom.

These  partnerships may be between GLCs and SMEs or  even

among  the SMEs themselves.  Perhaps IE Singapore can  be

the business SDU to bring these parties together.  Or the

Chambers of Commerce and industry associations can act as

catalysts.   A forum needs to be created.   Just  as  our

successful  SDU  has  dinner talks, tea  parties,  social

activities  and match-making capabilities, this  business

SDU can do the same for GLCs and the SMEs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, GLCs can play an active role in helping

SMEs venture abroad by partnering them when they seek new

pastures.  A business associate, which I think  was  also

mentioned  by an earlier colleague, shared  with  me  the

observation on Taiwanese businesses venturing into China.

When  these  businesses have identified opportunities  in

China,  they  bring  along  their  suppliers  with  them.

Together, they almost replicate their entire supply chain

in China, ensuring a better chance of success.  They work

with  people they know best.  They link hands and venture

out  together.  It is a united approach with all  parties

benefitting   -   an  interesting  business  model  worth

considering for us in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our GLCs have a strong home base and are better

placed  to venture abroad.  They also have the management

and  financial capabilities.  So, what is stopping  these

GLCs from bringing along their local suppliers along with

them?   It  may mean to be more proactive in  identifying

good SME suppliers with potential to be part of a winning

combination.  It may also mean helping these suppliers by

equipping  them  with  the  know-how  to  improve   their

efficiency or management, so that they are more ready  to

weather  the  perils beyond our shores.  This  will  help

shorten  the SMEs learning curve by being able  to  piggy

back on the GLCs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In SME 21, the often mentioned structural weaknesses

of  the SMEs tend to be centred around inefficient use of

technology,  outmoded  methods  of  production,   limited

ability   to   tap  economies  of  scale,   shortage   of

professional   and   technical   manpower,   insufficient

management  know-how and professionalism.  I believe  the

emergence  of a partnering culture between the  GLCs  and

the  SMEs  would  mitigate,  to  a  large  extent,  these

structural issues.  It has to start with the building  of

trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SME 21 plan intends to treble the number of SMEs

with  sales  turnover of $10 million or  more  to  6,000.

With   such  growth,  I  believe  that  there  are  great

opportunities   that  exist,  and  these  cannot   remain

untapped, just because no one makes the first move or  we

are  focusing  our  energies on  only  competing  amongst

ourselves.   IE  Singapore's  Network  China   has   been

successful  and Network India is being set up.   Can  the

GLCs  not  partner some SMEs and tap into  these  markets

together?   Perhaps IE Singapore can play the matchmaker,

and it must have mechanisms in place, so that the concern

of  appearing  to be partial whenever one  SME  is  being

selected over another does not hold back initiatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clusters created to foray overseas must be based on

good  business  case with the best  chance  to  win.   To

consciously  make this happen, we should reorientate  our

view of GLCs and judge them on how much their business is

derived  offshore  and  how many  local  SMEs  they  have

spawned or partner with in their ventures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an economy that has seen a rapid

transformation  from  third  to  first   world   in   one

generation.   It  is unparalleled.  We  are  unique  with

unique  strengths and constraints.  In  short,  we  learn

from  others  but  we  need  to  adapt.   In  trying   to

transform, we must not throw out the baby with  the  bath

water,  as this is said three times today.  We  must  not

slay  all  our  sacred cows and then  discover  that  the

alternatives are stillborn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we must remember that we are Team

Singapore.   In a team, there are defenders,  midfielders

and  attackers.   The  ultimate goal  is  that  Singapore

should  win.   In-fighting amongst  the  players  to  get

choice  roles will just jeopardise our chance of winning.

We  are  Team Singapore and in the SME 21 plan, which  is

characterised   as  a  partnership  between   Government,

Chambers  of  Commerce,  industry  associations  and  the

private sector, it should also be expanded to include the

GLCs  as  well.   We  are  no longer  only  playing  home

matches.   We  are in a global match.  And  in  the  away

games,  we  must train to win.  While the  debate  is  on

GLCs,  I  think there is and must have resolve to  ensure

that the momentum behind SME 21 does not fizzle out.   We

must stay the course.  As in the ecosystem analogy that I

started  with, a symbiotic relationship with  competition

in  specific  niche areas will have  to  be  one  of  our

formulae  for  going forward.  So, in  the  Motion  which

supports  competition,  which nourishes  the  spirit  and

culture  of  partnerships, and which  squarely  sets  the

sight on the external wing, I am supportive.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  thank  you  for allowing me  to  join  in  this

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raison d'etre of GLCs and Temasek has been well

documented.  The reasons for the GLCs' existence was when

the SMEs were not able to access capital on their own, or

there  were  insufficient  entrepreneurs  that  had   the

capacity  to  risk  large quantum of capital.   Singapore

then needed the GLCs to build up the strategic industries

to  put  Singapore  on  firm economic,  social  and  even

political  pedestals.   It was for  the  sole  reason  of

survival,  and the GLCs have done a good job.   In  fact,

they  were so good at what they do that, over the  years,

the  GLCs  have  grown to cover a multitude  of  business

enterprises  -  many of which are perceptibly  to  be  in

direct  competition with the private  sector.   After  37

years  of  independence and rapid  economic  growth,  our

private  sector  is also a lot more mature  and  capable.

Coupled with the challenges of the new economy in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



global  playing  field, we need to re-examine  our  modus

operandi,  and make relevant the roles of both  the  GLCs

and  the  SMEs, so that we, as a nation, can  strive  and

thrive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, I also have an analogy which is based

on  the ecosystem.  Since we are an island, please  allow

me  to  use the analogy of fish and water.  The GLCs  are

like fishes that were originally introduced to a pond  to

promote  life, to  promote growth.  Over time,  it  keeps

spawning  and  while  the  pond  can  still  maintain  an

ecological  balance for coexistence, it  remains  placid.

However, when the spawned fishes begin to grow and become

overwhelming, the ecological balance within the  pond  is

disturbed.  It has now reached the point where  the  pond

has  become  too  small for this growing  ecosystem.   In

order  to survive, the big will eat the small fishes  and

even   compete  with  its  own  kind  to  survive.    The

ecological system is out of balance.



<br><br><i>Scepticism and Distrust: Playing Field</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the private sector reckons the GLCs to be the

fishes that have multiplied and grown to a monstrous size

in a small pond.  Willy-nilly, there appears to be a two-way  scepticism and distrust between the big fish  (GLCs)

and  the  small  fish (SMEs).  In fact, some  SMEs  avoid

contact  with  the  GLCs whenever  there  is  a  business

opportunity for fear that the GLCs may muscle them out of

the business.  This may well be true as GLCs function  as

a  profit organisation, and have often demonstrated  that

new  entities can be created whenever they want  to  take

advantage  of  an  opportunity.   Without  the  necessary

financial  muscles  and network, the  SME  simply  cannot

replicate companies with the same speed or size that GLCs

can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, we have a GLC that prepares,

manufactures  and distributes food, ranging from  chilled

meat,  ready-to-go meals and even right up to hog auction

and abattoir.  The original raison d'etre of this GLC was

one of strategic defence.  But how does the slaughtering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



of hogs contribute to the defence of Singapore?  GLCs are

also   found  in  other  non-strategic  industries,   for

example,   Internet  Service  Provider,  travel   agency,

supermarket,  real estate development and management,  IT

and    business    consultancy,   systems    integration,

outsourcing  networking, e-commerce, and  so  on  and  so

forth.  Even more recently, HDB, via its subsidiary firm,

HDBay,  is  also  getting  into the  Local  Area  Network

business!   In fact, if we include the NLCs, which  is  a

term coined by Mr Leong Horn Kee, they provide goods  and

services  from cradle to grave.  Can we really blame  the

SMEs  for keeping a distance from the GLCs?  Perhaps,  to

be  fair to the GLCs, such companies were created so that

the GLCs can have better control and it could be part  of

the risk management strategy.  But this is also precisely

where   the  problem  lies.   If  we  want  to  cultivate

entrepreneurship, then this mindset must change, both  on

the  SME side and GLC side.  Some things are indeed  much

better  left to the private sector.  And we need to  have

more faith in the market forces.



<br><br><i>Foster Culture of Partnership</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond SMEs, beyond GLCs, we as a nation in

challenging  times must come to sell all  enterprises  as

valuable to our economic aspirations.  We need to  see  a

vibrant  culture  of cooperation and partnership  between

GLCs and SMEs.  They both can and must play their role in

the  remaking  of our economic thrust and should  receive

equal facilitation and support from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue on my imagery analogy of the fish and

water,  I  would like to see the Government, and  perhaps

even  Temasek  Holdings, provide the  lead  to  ease  the

congestion  in this small pond, by digging a trench  that

would  provide alternatives to the contents of this small

pond  into the open sea of the global economy.  Once  the

monstrous  fishes in this small pond enter the open  sea,

they  may no longer be that big.  This is where the  GLCs

and SMEs can come together, support each other and assert

themselves in the new environment.  I urge the Government

to adopt the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



recommendation  of the EISC to "encourage  a  culture  of

partnership  between  GLCs, MNCs and  SMEs  and  adopt  a

cluster  approach when venturing overseas; and raise  the

profile of the Local Industry Upgrading Programme  (LIUP)

and  expanding  it to promote internationalisation."   We

need a paradigm shift, we need to promote partnership  as

a multiplier, and not a zero sum game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as Mr Inderjit Singh had also said, we need

to  leverage on each other's strength, in order to  grow.

The  SMEs, given their business instincts and acumen, can

sniff  out the business opportunities while the GLCs  can

also  support with their know-how and process  expertise.

The  GLCs, with their good brand name, can also pull  the

SMEs  along  while establishing a beach-head  on  foreign

soil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I urge that the Government also urgently

facilitate outlets for these monstrous fishes  and  guide

them  towards  the  open  sea.   The  movement  of  these

monstrous  fishes  would  stir the  seabed,  throwing  up

planktons  and  living  organisms  to  feed  the  smaller

fishes.   In time, these smaller fishes will be  able  to

grow,  be  able to fend for themselves and even establish

their  own  pedigree, their own brand.  I do not  support

the  exodus of GLCs, but that GLCs should stick to  their

original  reason for existence, and divest  the  non-core

businesses at a reasonable price over a reasonable period

of  time.   May I also add that any drastic movement  may

also upset the ecosystem in question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua's point that we

should  focus  on the GNP and not just the  GDP.   I  am,

however,  also  mindful that part of the  GNP  must  also

originate  from the domestic sector.  Hence, there  is  a

need to find a place for our private sector, the SMEs and

the  MNCs, on the continuum between the maximum  position

of  crowding  out  the  private sector  and  the  minimum

position  of non-interference.  A place between  the  two

where  we  can  find the optimum.  In a  world  of  rapid

changes, this continuum is dynamic, and so is the optimum

point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



Only when we look at the reason for existence can we then

find the optimum point between the two extreme points.  I

submit to this House, Mdm Deputy Speaker, that unless  we

consciously and continually seek this equilibrium or this

optimum  point,  we  will  eventually  lose  our  private

sector's  creativity and competitiveness.   It  would  be

worse  if  the  private sector allows their  perceptions,

whether  rightly  or wrongly, to fester  and  lead  to  a

culture  of cynicism.  It may lead to an outward movement

of not just capital, but also people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that we do not let the GLCs take the

wind out of the sails of the SMEs, but to help them build

and  direct the sails to catch the wind instead.  Perhaps

the  GLCs can take some of our SMEs under their wings and

start  a  mentorship programme.  Impart their experiences

and  know-how  to  the  private  sector  and  provide   a

springboard  for  our  private  sector  to  leapfrog  the

learning curve.  The question, of course, is if both  are

for profit organisations, then what is in it for me?  Why

should  the  GLCs do so?  I think besides  being  a  good

corporate  citizen,  GLCs can also  profit  by  taking  a

minority  stake in these companies.  In turn,  the  stake

money  will enhance the capital base for the SMEs.   When

the  SMEs are successful, they will then in turn  give  a

return to the stake money of the GLCs.  This process  can

also  be  vice versa where the SMEs could take a minority

stake  in  the GLCs.  It could be a win-win strategy.   I

also  support Mr Wee Siew Kim's call for a bridge  to  be

built  between the GLCs and the SMEs, perhaps a forum  as

well  and  even  his  call for a  business  SDU.   And  I

suppose, even if the business SDU can bring together some

marriage of convenience, it would have served its role.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another often heard feedback from the SMEs is the

lack   of  support  when  venturing  overseas.   Can   IE

Singapore  then  act as a facilitator  for  our  SMEs  in

linking  up  with our embassies, trade missions  or  even

trade  stations abroad, to serve as a launch pad for  our

SMEs'  foray into the foreign market?  Our embassies  and

trade  missions  are well placed to give an  insight,  at

least, into the culture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



and  local  knowledge in these foreign lands.  Just  like

foreign  companies coming into Singapore can obtain  one-stop information and help from EDB, could IE Singapore or

any   other   Government  agencies  provide   appropriate

information  and  database to facilitate  some  of  these

overseas  ventures?  This would serve our  SMEs  in  good

stead,  giving  them  a competitive  edge  with  reliable

support and good grade information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the GLCs have to compete with the private sector,

let it then be the objective of bringing up the standards

of  our private sector.  If there is a need for the  GLCs

to  compete, let it then be out of a need and not  greed.

If  there is a need for GLCs to compete, then let  it  be

from without and not within.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to conclude by

referring to the latest debate on stayers and quitters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had opportunities to speak with many of our

corporate  citizens  who are actually  SMEs.   These  are

corporations  that  have grown over the  years.   I  have

sought their permission to quote them.  Some of them I am

referring to are System Access Ltd, Technology  and  Apex

Systems  Pte  Ltd  and  this  company  called  Lindeteves

Jacobsberg Ltd, which is one company that specialises  in

electronic  motors,  and  they  are  the  third   largest

supplier  to  Europe.  For these companies  that  I  have

quoted,  they  derive the majority of their  revenue,  in

some  cases,  100%  of  their  revenue  outside  that  of

Singapore.   However, they are maintaining an  office  in

Singapore.   In fact, there is no compelling  reason  for

them  to  do  so, but they did.  The refrain  from  these

corporations  was that Singapore is their own.   This  is

the  place where they have sunk their roots and  this  is

the place where they would like their children to grow up

in.    They  are  here  because  their  hearts  are  with

Singapore.   However,  they also expressed  that  if  the

issues that were brought up by the EISC Committee are not

properly addressed, then in the long term, there may  not

be  a  lot  of  stayers purely because it  is  no  longer

economically viable to stay in Singapore.  Once they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



start  to  venture abroad, make their stake abroad,  what

may  happen  is in the process, they will start  to  lose

touch with Singapore.  And the heart stops where survival

is  choked.   So when they leave Singapore  for  economic

gains,  they asked not to be blamed.  Quitting is  not  a

sudden  decision, but it is a process that  may  lead  to

that decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these views, I support the Motion.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>

<br>8.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> I am

sorry to keep the House at this time of the evening,  but

we  have  no  choice and I will get straightaway  to  the

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker, for giving me the

opportunity to speak on the professionals in  the  social

service  sector.   I thank the Minister  for  hanging  on

right up to this moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to highlight the work of these

professionals, drawing special attention to their status,

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



professional growth and the current system in which  they

operate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a glimpse into the situation as it stands

today.  There is a shortage of social workers and we  all

know  that.  Just to illustrate the severity - two recent

reports in the newspapers attest to this - Straits  Times

in  January  and  another in June in the NewPaper.   Both

carried reports that only four out of 10 in every  cohort

of   graduates  from  the  Social  Work  and   Psychology

Department  at  the  National  University  of   Singapore

actually enter the field to work as social workers.   And

I  am  told that in three to five years' time about  half

from  each cohort of these graduates who enter the  field

to  work as social workers then leave the service,  often

citing burn-out as a reason.  Yet, it is estimated in the

same  Straits  Times' article that,  each  year,  40  new

positions go a-begging for social workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure does not take into account the number of

vacant positions due to resignations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do these figures mean in reality? The National

University  of  Singapore admits about 150 students  each

year  major  in social work at the Department  of  Social

Work  and Psychology.  Almost 50 new graduates, qualified

in  social  work, go on to become social workers  -  that

four in 10 figure. Of this group, in three or five years'

time,  perhaps, only 25 will remain in the  workforce  as

social  workers.     This is a shortage.  It is worrying.

Add  to it, another dimension.  Looking at the nature  of

the  degree  in  social work under  the  current  modular

structure  and  the  liberal  arts  approach  within  the

Faculty  of  Arts  and  Social Science  at  the  National

University  of  Singapore, students can graduate  with  a

degree  in social work by fulfilling a minimum  quota  of

eight  core modules out of the 24 modules offered by  the

department.  This is well and good for students who  wish

to diversify and keep their career options open.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when these same graduates enter the social

service  sector to work as social workers - listening  to

what  academics and practitioners on the ground have told

me - they are still lacking in skills that will give them

the  depth to deal with clients effectively.  Hence,  the

dilemma.  A tight labour market where the social  workers

scene  is concerned and new graduates who cannot  prepare

to  go  on  to further immediate training to become  more

competent in this field.  In fact, figures from MCDS  and

the  National  Council  of Social  Service  in  newspaper

reports  two  years  ago  showed  that  30%  of  its  550

professionals in the social service sector  do  not  have

social  work  qualifications.  Add to  that  the  current

group  of  community  development  officers,  who  number

between  10  and 40, at the five CDCs, who  work  in  the

community to help the less fortunate, with very few among

them  trained in social work.  So not only do we  have  a

shortage  but we also have a situation where some  social

workers,  new  graduates, already need more  training  to

function more effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also look at another group of professionals

who  are  making  their inroad into  the  social  service

sector,  the much needed group of - the psychotherapists,

family  therapists,  counsellors,  psychologists.   While

these  individuals  enter the  field  with  the  best  of

intentions,  there must also be a way  to  ascertain  the

nature  of  their  qualifications to  maintain  standards

within the social service sector.  I am told that some of

the  post-graduate degrees, doctorates and  certificates,

come  from institutions that practitioners do not totally

endorse.   Moreover, such professionals have  many  entry

points  into  the service - being appointed by  voluntary

welfare  organisations, schools and  other  institutions,

which having the autonomy make such appointments and  peg

their  salaries  to  the qualifications  and  experience.

While it is good to have this autonomy it also gives rise

to  approval  of  a  range  of qualifications  which  has

already raised questions at the ground level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is my suggestion that the four

organisations catering  to the different



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



professionals in the social service sector,  namely,  the

Singapore  Association  of  Social  Workers  (SASW),  the

Psychological Society, the Society of Marital  Therapists

and  Psychotherapists  and the Singapore  Association  of

Counselling,   work  with  the  Ministry   of   Community

Development and Sports and the National Council of Social

Service   to   build  up  a  common   registry   and   an

accreditation  scheme for both short-term  and  long-term

courses,  such  that officers will be well-qualified  and

can  be  employed with similar salary packages pegged  to

their qualifications that are approved, and come under an

approved scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that the Ministry of

Community  Development  and Sports  could  also  look  at

infrastructure and beef up an existing organisation - The

Family  Resource  Training Centre  -  or  work  with  the

National  University  of  Singapore  to  restructure  the

Department of Social Work and Psychology into  a  faculty

on its own or a training/research centre on its own, akin

to  the  National  Institute of  Education,  that  trains

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just elaborate the advantage in that. With

such  a  centre,  curriculum can be well-planned.   There

will   be  enough  scope  and  expertise  to  expand   on

programmes, such that existing officers can come back  to

upgrade  their skills and, at the same time, it can  also

bring  on  board quite a number of counsellors out  there

and  upgrade  them all to a certain set  of  standardised

course  skills.  After all, what is there to  stop  this.

Because,  right now, teachers have NIE, the lawyers-to-be

have  their  own Law Faculty, the medical  students  have

their Medical Faculty.  Why should social workers be  any

different?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a one-stop faculty, or centre, can handle all

matters  related  to training and accreditation  for  all

professionals.   This centre can be  modelled  after  the

well-reputed  George Warren Brown School of Social  Work,

an  entity unto itself at the University of Washington to

which, I think, the Ministry sends quite a number of  its

officers for upgrading skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me now move on to the second

issue here of how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



we recognise and reward those who stay in the profession.

A  new  social  work graduate receives a  median  monthly

salary of $2,114 as the starting salary, according to the

Ministry of Manpower's Report on Wages in Singapore 2000,

as was reported in the newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A check with VWOs on the National Council of Social

Service  suggested wage rates show that a  social  worker

with  a general degree starts off with a gross salary  of

between  $1,844 and $1,972.  A teacher in  training  gets

between  $1,967  and  $2,144 for the  same  qualification

while training to be a teacher at the NIE.  A nurse  with

a  degree  in  nursing  has his/her  starting  salary  as

$1,800.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social workers lot is a tough lot, as every

profession  would say.  But I think when you are  dealing

with  the vulnerable in society, it can be very tough  on

the  individual  social  worker.   Hence,  the  burn-out.

Hence, the drop-outs.  Hence, the attrition rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going further, while these salaries are there, let

us  look  at the workload.  Although salaries are perhaps

not as attractive as other vocations, the workload of the

social  worker  is  not  diminishing.   In  fact,  it  is

increasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A check with five FSCs for the month of July alone

shows  that each centre now handles between eight and  10

new  cases  a  month  while each  social  worker  manages

between  30  and 40 cases per month.  About  a  fifth  of

these  cases  are to be closed in a year  by  the  social

workers.   Social workers average about four at  each  of

these centres.  They said their time-consuming cases  are

those dealing with marital and parenting problems.   They

said that the cases, especially in the first half of this

year,  have also doubled because many clients are  coming

in with their financial problems.  So that is the current

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going further to policies that have been implemented

in   recent   years.   With  greater  enlightenment   and

appreciation, the courts today rule mandatory counselling

for juveniles beyond parental control,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



violent  spouses and couples going for  a  divorce.   All

these cases do land at the social workers door.  Going by

statistics  on  social trends, we can see  the  potential

increase  in workload for social workers - the number  of

divorces or separations has doubled in the last 10  years

from 1.3% in 1990 to 2.5% in the year 2000; the number of

juvenile  delinquents had risen last year  to  31.4%  per

100,000   young  people,  though  arrests  have   fallen;

violence  in the home still averages at about  six  cases

every  day, according to police statistics.  With greater

awareness,  there will be more reports on rapes,  incest,

etc,  cases that cannot be wrapped up in five counselling

sessions,  cases  that make a demand  on  the  individual

social  worker on his/her own emotional and psychological

make-up and energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there are our national trends. Also, with

an  ageing population and a widening income gap, all this

will  just mean more at the social workers door.  So what

then  can we do about all these?  To deal with such cases

and with rising sophistication in a Singapore client,  it

becomes  very  important for the social workers  to  keep

abreast of the latest counselling skills.  And also,  the

MCDS advocates family interventionist programme to handle

clients effectively.  These are time consuming.  So if we

just  look  at  all  that impinges on  a  social  worker,

increased case load, time consuming cases, cases that are

becoming  more complex, skills that you want  to  acquire

but  are  too  tight  for  time to  acquire  and  not  so

favourable salary package, I do not think things sound so

rosy at all for the social worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the situation where the salary is

concerned, I am told that, currently, the social worker's

salary  package is a 10% lag behind those senior officers

in  the  civil  service.  Bear with me, I  know  time  is

ticking by, just to study the background a bit on how the

salaries  have  been pegged for the social  workers.   In

1995, the salaries of social workers were aligned to that

of the civil service's Senior Officers' Scheme.  In 2000,

voluntary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



welfare   organisations  (VWOs)  adopted  the  NWC   wage

adjustment  scheme used by the civil service.   But  then

the   civil   service  moved  ahead  again  and   further

implemented  salary  revisions  for  its  superscale  and

timescale   officers.   Performance  bonuses  were   also

introduced.  Currently, VWOs are grappling with  what  it

means to have performance bonuses and an appraisal scheme

that  should follow that.  So with all these schemes that

the  civil  service has put in, social  workers  have  to

catch  up  all  the time where salaries  and  performance

bonuses are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As social workers work in different fields - in

hospitals, in schools, in VWOs and also, now, in  CDCs  - their  salaries are adjusted by the various  institutions

that  they  work in.  There are disparities,  and  social

workers do compare which institution is providing  better

for  them.   This  does  not augur well  for  the  social

workers.   It  is  perhaps timely that  the  Ministry  of

Community Development and Sports, NCSS, MOE, MOH, as well

as  the  PA,  could  come together  to  plan  the  career

development  structure for social workers,  as  has  been

done  for teachers under the Ministry of Education,  look

at  the  salary structures that they should be having  as

well as the training schemes that they can enjoy and look

at  a  massive recruitment drive, such that this shortage

can be weaning the way in the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I am sure, the Ministry is already thinking of

from  what  I  hear.  I would like at the  same  time  to

emphasise  that  recruiting males  must  also  be  a  top

priority here.  Because we have a lot of cases of spousal

violence,  children  who  need that  kind  of  male  role

modelling  even  within the social service  sector,  male

social workers whom spouses can talk to, etc.  Currently,

we have too few males in the social service sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this career development plan, which is in the

making  I  hear, should also look into ways of recruiting

males  into  the service too as their help is  needed  to

offer  counselling to violent spouses, many of  whom  are

males.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is already making some headway. Its

efforts are appreciated in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



that  it  has increased funding through a VWO  Capability

Fund  of $30 million and recently another $7 million  was

added  for  80  VWOs to run programmes.  All  this  means

staff  can  be  paid to run programmes and staff  can  be

retained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, without a systematic structure defining a

social  worker's career path, the training  needs  and  a

revised  salary  structure that  can  be  applied  across

employers, these gestures run the risk of becoming  band-aids, short-term solutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professionals in the social service sector are not

volunteers,  and it is not morally right of  us  to  look

into this issue without trying to give them the best deal

when  they  are  coping with a very vulnerable  community

within our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this revision, may I also suggest that the

Ministry   needs  to  re-examine  its  50-50   co-funding

structure  that  it shares with the National  Council  of

Social  Service, the reason being that when it is  pegged

at  50-50,  the Council does not have the flexibility  to

reward  social  workers  adequately  and  the  cycle   is

perpetuated.  Since I am at liberty to suggest a ratio, I

would  like  to suggest that this be 70-30 or  80-20,  so

that  the  whole  scheme  can improve  from  a  bottom-up

approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area which I would like to draw attention

to  is  the  role  of  the  social service  professional.

Because  of  this  shortage,  social  workers  are  often

functioning  as  just  doers, meaning  appraising  client

needs, sourcing for help, and counselling them.  However,

we  are  ignoring a greater and more fundamental role  of

the  social worker - preventive programmes.  They are the

professionals  in  the field, with  more  experience  and

energy  that we can tap on to design programmes.  We  can

use  their management skills, etc, to further develop the

non-profit  sector, get deeper into research,  such  that

the   social  worker  can  become  a  stronger  advocate,

commenting on the community's needs.  We need more  Laena

Thambyahs  to  talk  about the  needs  of  children  with

special needs, more Anthony Yeos to remind us about  what

life is worth, and more Ron



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



Chandran  Dudleys  to  remind us  of  the  needs  of  the

disabled.   Their voices must be heard,  and  the  social

worker is that advocate for the less privileged and  less

fortunate in our community.  But when there is not enough

time  and  too  much  work, they run  the  risk  of  just

becoming doers, and so we do ignore the pleas from people

whom we do not normally hear about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that we can tap the

expertise   of  the  social  workers  to  develop   joint

curriculum   projects   with  the   various   Ministries,

especially   the   Ministry  of  Education,   such   that

communication  skills,  one of the  fundamental  problems

always faced by social workers, are put into place within

the school system in a directed manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to suggest to the Ministry that

there  is  right now a window of opportunity to plug  the

gap  where  the  shortage is concerned, by enhancing  and

developing a para-counselling layer with help  from  NUS,

Nanyang  Polytechnic and the unions.   Using  the  Skills

Development  Fund  and  the Lifelong  Learning  Endowment

Fund,  retrenched workers of sound character who  can  be

assessed to be fit candidates ---

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Thank you, Mdm

Deputy  Speaker,  for allowing me to  respond.   I  would

like, first, to thank Ms Braema Mathiaparanam for raising

all  the  suggestions.  I do agree with her  that  social

workers  are an important professional component  in  the

social  service sector.  I would like to assure her  that

as  I  may  not  be  able to answer all  of  her  queries

tonight,  we will look into her suggestions and  that  my

Ministry  and NCSS will consider actively the  suggestion

she  has  made  in  areas such as social workers'  career

development and professional upgrading.  And to  consider

some of the suggestions that she has made as we develop a

master plan for the social worker community in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just touch on a few things first, beginning

with  the last, because that is the first thing that  one

can  remember.  The hon. Member spoke about the  role  of

social  workers beyond merely being part  of  the  social

delivery system, but their expertise and knowledge can be

tapped.  I certainly agree with Ms Braema that we  should

look  towards  the  social workers in  terms  of  getting

direct  feedback and knowledge on the problems they  face

and the kind of skills that they need.  I understand that

this  is something that is on-going between the VWOs  and

NCSS where there is constant dialogue and discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not we can tap their expertise in

terms   of   her   first  suggestion,  of  developing   a

curriculum,  I think we should consider  it.   I  am  not

clear about the format, but it is something which we  can

certainly work towards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Ms Braema's point about plugging the

gap by ensuring that there are enough para-counsellors, I

certainly  agree with that.  I am not familiar about  the

certificate  programme that she mentioned,  but  I  would

certainly  look  into  that  as  I  do  know  that   some

organisations  have actually looked into  training  their

own  para-counsellors because of the shortage  of  social

workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the first point the hon. Member

has  raised  is a very important point - the shortage  of

social  workers  and how we recognise them.   As  Members

might  know,  we have launched the VCF $30 million  fund.

Just  to clarify:  the $7 million annually is an increase

in  funding that we gave to VWOs this year.  So there  is

money that is available to the VWOs at this point in time

for them to use in terms of research, training, etc.   We

have  also  launched, with the Ministry of Manpower,  the

Strategic Conversion Manpower Programme in order to train

people who wish to convert from whatever occupation  they

were in, into social work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we do have a plan in place to address these

issues. Overall, I agree with Ms Braema that there  is  a

need  for  a master plan, which NCSS is looking into.  We

need  to  develop  something which is more  comprehensive

from  the point at which they graduate from NUS,  to  the

point  that they begin to work, and the sort of  training

they will need.  This is something which we will have  to

build  up  over  time.  Ms Braema mentioned  about  FRTC,

which  is a good example of a setting within the  VWO  to

provide  training for social workers.   There  have  been

some  suggestions  about  setting  up  a  social  service

training institute.  This is also currently being studied

as  to  whether there is a need for a training  institute

for  people  to  go to get new skills and  new  knowledge

about what is going on.  As mentioned by Ms Braema, there

are  now  social trends which are developing, and  social

workers need to be kept abreast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master plan is not ready yet. The thrust of the

master plan is to look at the overall development of  the

professional social worker, from the time he graduates to

the time he goes out into the field, and how he works his

way  through the VWOs.  I cannot promise that we can  get

male  social  workers.  We will try our  very  best.   As

Members  know,  we have tried to address the  problem  of

shortage  of social workers by providing scholarships  to

NUS  for  people to gain some expertise in  social  work,

both  at the undergraduate and the Master's level.  These

are some of the efforts that we have put in place.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not we can develop a system where

we  have a common registry and accreditation, we have  to

look  into  the  building  blocks  first.   Do  we  have,

firstly,  a  comprehensive training  programme?   Are  we

clear  about  what  are the core competencies  which  are

needed  in the various areas?  Ms Braema mentioned  about

aging.   That is a new phenomenon.  What exactly  is  the

competency   that  we  need?   So,  in  areas   such   as

gerontology  counselling that we are  now  looking  into,

what are the sorts of skills that we need?  Some VWOs are

in  discussion with some foreign experts.  I can be  very

candid.   They  have come to see me to  discuss  some  of

their  suggestions.  These are areas which are  evolving,

and  we will certainly want to understand how best we can

fit  in  this particular expertise that is needed because

this is a phenomenon which will come in 2010 and beyond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have to understand the core competencies

which  are needed and then identify what are the training

requirements for them.  As Ms Braema rightly pointed out,

when  they graduate from NUS - I am sure Prof. Ngiam will

agree  with  me - they are more generalists  rather  than

specialists.  They will have to go through some  form  of

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema also mentioned about recognition - in this

case,  remuneration.  She is right that NCSS  has  looked

into  the salary scheme to follow very closely the salary

scheme  of  the  civil service.  As to whether  they  can

match the kinds of schemes that are in place for teachers

and  nurses,  this is best left for NCSS to discuss  with

the  VWOs.  Having said that, I would like to assure  the

hon. Member also that, to a large extent, it is up to the

VWOs  to pay their social workers.  Some are able to  pay

more using their own funds.  The manpower cost is already

incorporated in our funds to VWOs.  We will  continue  to

adjust our funding to VWOs on a yearly basis to take into

account inflation, rising costs, etc.  We also take  into

account  the  need for wage increases.  But in  terms  of

whether  the  wage  structure is  consistent  with  other

professionals  that  Ms  Braema has  mentioned  -  be  it

teachers or nurses - this is best left for NCSS to study



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



further,  because we have to evolve as we go along.   So,

rather than looking at remuneration, I would prefer  that

we  look at the other parts of the building block  first,

whereby  we  have a system that they can  go  through  in

order  to  receive the training in the core competencies.

Thereafter  we  can set out to determine the  appropriate

salary level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key issues concerning social workers such as

attrition  and burn-out rate have to be addressed.   Like

all    paid   personnel,   they   are   basically   still

professionals who are working, who have a life  of  their

own,  families  to look after during weekends,  etc.   So

this is something which we have to work with the VWOs  to

look  at  how they can plan the workload and use some  of

the  worklife initiatives that we have introduced to make

sure  that the workload is more evenly spread.   I  agree

with  Ms  Braema  that we cannot predict  accurately  the

workload.   But, to a large extent, if there is  a  human

resource  programme  in  place at  the  VWO,  that  would

actually be very helpful, in terms of how they can adjust

the   workload.   These  are  the  things  that  we   are

discussing with the VWOs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us look at the overall system that we are

trying  to  put in place.  We  have increased funding  to

VWOs.   We  have set up a VCF fund so that they  can  use

that  money for training, research and even scholarships.

We  are  now  looking into how we can identify  the  core

competencies  needed  for various professionals.   Do  we

need  a  training institute to ensure that social workers

undergo  some training while they are even  on  the  job?

That  is  being studied at this point in time.   Once  we

have  that, something comprehensive, then we have to look

at what is the right and appropriate salary scale for the

social worker professional, primarily because, as Members

know,  the area of social work is diverse - from FSCs  to

eldercare,  to counselling, violence, abuse, etc.   There

is  a variety, in terms of the work that they do.  At the

end of the day, it is about dealing with people.  But  we

must  also understand that running a student-care  outfit

is slightly different from that of an FSC or dealing with

eldercare.  So we have to sort that out first.   This  is

something that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



will  have to evolve.  As I said earlier, we are  looking

into  a master plan for social workers in terms of  their

career  development, training needs, etc.  When  that  is

out, I will be most happy to discuss this with Ms Braema,

and  have  a  discussion on what are the things  that  we

really need to understand better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema suggested some changes to the funding and

felt  that the 50-50 ratio restricts the ability  of  the

VWOs to pay the social workers.  I am not quite sure that

I  agree  with her on that point.  For the 50-50  funding

ratio,  there is a certain philosophy of co-sharing  that

we want to encourage.  What we are trying to do now is to

put  a  system  in place called the Programme  Evaluation

System (PES).  This would allow VWOs to be more efficient

and,  hopefully, with greater efficiency, they will  have

greater savings.  The 50% funding is basically decided on

every  year  based on how much they need.  If  they  work

smarter  or  more efficiently, there will be a  lot  more

savings,  and they can use that money to pay bonuses  and

salaries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



So  far,  what we have seen is that the 50-50  basis  has

worked  quite well.  I am not prepared at this  point  in

time  to promise that we will change it.  Let us look  at

other parts of the system where we can try and improve so

that  at the end of the day we can at least address  some

of the problems that Ms Braema has mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I think I have addressed most of

the  concerns, and I would like to thank Ms Braema  again

for  raising some of those points.  As I said earlier,  I

cannot  address  all the issues, but I promise  the  hon.

Member that we will certainly look into her suggestions.

<div align="center"><b>PRESERVATION OF OLD PARLIAMENT BUILDING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Information, Communications and the Arts whether he  will

consider preserving the old Parliament building  and  its

chamber  as a museum for national heritage and  education

instead  of allowing it to be converted into a  food  and

beverage-cum-retail development.



<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Old Parliament House and its Annexe building

were  gazetted as national monuments in 1992.  It is  our

intent  to  preserve as much as possible  their  physical

architecture and historical character. One key  objective

is  to  preserve  our  constitutional  history  in  these

symbolic buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Arts Council (NAC) is spearheading this

project, jointly with the National Heritage Board  (NHB).

The  plan is to convert the Old Parliament House into  an

arts  and heritage centre.  There will be heritage  tours

and  arts  education  programmes  for  students  and  the

general public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight the main elements of the plan.

First,  we  will use the walls within the Old  Parliament

House  to  display both the history of the  building,  as

well as the constitutional history of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will mark several important rooms within

the  Old Parliament House with informational plaques,  to

tell  visitors of significant events which took place  in

these  rooms.  For  example,  Members  may  remember  the

Committee  Room of the Legislative Assembly on  Level  2,

next  to  the Members' Room.  This was where SM  met  the

"Plen"  in  1958.   We  will find  a  way  to  tell  this

important story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will preserve the Parliament Chamber even

as  we  convert it into a 160-seat performance venue  for

chamber   music,   choral   singing   and   small   drama

productions. There will be minimum changes.  For example,

we  will keep the seats in their original position.  They

will serve as audience seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we will convert some of the functional rooms

into public spaces for the arts and heritage. The Library

will  be  turned into a 120-seat blackbox.  Part  of  the

ground  floor office space will be converted into  a  72-seat  film  theatrette.  We will turn the Committee  Room

into an art exhibition space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we will set aside some spaces for food and

beverage and shops.  The public entrance lobby and  porch

can  house  a  restaurant with  al  fresco  dining.   The

previous  computer and store spaces will make way  for  a

book-cum-souvenir shop. The ground floor  of  the  Annexe

Building  will house another restaurant with a good  view

of  the  Singapore River. In total, not more than 20%  of

the  total  gross  floor  area is  set  aside  for  these

ancillary  services.  These are necessary  for  visitors'

comfort and convenience.

<div align="center"><b>COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mdm Cynthia Phua</b> asked the Minister for Law (a)

what  is  the  average timeframe for the  Singapore  Land

Authority  (SLA) to settle a compulsory land  acquisition

case;  (b)  in cases where an appeal is made against  the

compensation  awarded,  whether  SLA  makes  an   interim

payment to the affected party; and (c) whether any  party

had been made bankrupt by a mortgagee bank due to the low

compensation amount awarded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average time-frame to settle a land acquisition

case  depends on whether the property owner  agrees  with

the compensation offer by the Singapore Land Authority or

SLA.  If  he  does, the case is settled  quickly  and  he

receives the compensation monies early.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, about 94% of them were settled

within  two  and a half years from the date of  gazetting

the acquisition.  These owners' cases were settled by SLA

and were not heard by the Land Acquisition Appeals Board.

The  remaining  6%  which were heard by  the  Board  were

mainly  settled  within  2-3  years  from  the  date   of

gazetting the acquisition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 4 to 6 months of the gazetting of the

acquisition,  the  property owner  receives  20%  of  the

compensation  offer  from  the Singapore  Land  Authority

(SLA) when he surrenders his title deeds. This is to help

him relocate.  He receives this amount whether or not  he

appeals  to the Land Acquisition Appeals Board.  Once  he

vacates the premises, he receives the remaining 80%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no knowledge of any land owner who has been

made  a  bankrupt by the mortgagee bank  because  of  the

compensation  amount  awarded.  Indeed,  in  cases  where

owners   face  hardship  arising  from  the  acquisition,

Government extends ex-gratia payments to ameliorate their

hardship. Over the years, Government has expanded the ex-gratia  scheme to allow more affected owners  to  qualify

for ex-gratia payments.

<div align="center"><b>SPECIALIST CLINICS IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND POLYCLINICS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (a) what is the standard of service that patients

can  expect  from  specialist clinics  in  public  sector

hospitals  and  polyclinics; and (b) whether  doctors  at

these clinics are overworked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polyclinics provide a comprehensive range of

preventive and primary care services.  They are  able  to

manage  acute illnesses like the common cold as  well  as

the   more   chronic  problems  such  as   diabetes   and

hypertension.  Other services include  health  education,

family  planning, antenatal and postnatal care, childhood

immunisations and developmental assessment  of  children.

We  have about 200 doctors manning 17 polyclinics.  About

one-third  of  them  have postgraduate qualifications  in

family medicine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For patients with more complicated medical problems,

a   full  range  of  specialist  outpatient  clinics  are

available  in  the  various  restructured  hospitals  and

specialty centres. We have about 640 specialists covering

the  29  specialties with outpatient clinics, ensuring  a

high quality of clinical services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from professional standards, my Ministry also

recognises  the  importance of service  quality  such  as

waiting time and good communications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polyclinics are well-used by residents as fees are

affordable.  The  majority of the  patients  are  walk-in

cases  who  do not have prior appointments.  The  waiting

times  can  therefore be longer because of  the  bunching

effect.  During the morning peak hours between 8  and  11

am,  patients may have to wait up to 90 minutes to see  a

doctor. Waiting times could be improved if patients  were

to  visit  the  polyclinics  during  non-peak  hours.  My

Ministry  is monitoring this situation closely,  and  the

polyclinics  are  also  working  to  ensure  that   their

patients do not have to wait unnecessarily long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the specialist outpatient clinics, our target is

for  at  least 50% of our patients to be seen  within  30

minutes  of their appointment times, and for 95%  of  the

patients   to  be  seen  within  75  minutes   of   their

appointment   times.   Currently,  not   all   specialist

outpatient clinics



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



are   able   to   achieve  these  targets.  My   Ministry

commissioned an Operations Research study in  April  2001

to  look  into  the  causes of  this,  and  to  recommend

measures needed for the clinics to achieve these targets.

The study is expected to be completed soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ensuring clinical and service quality standards,

the  Ministry  and  hospitals  monitor  and  ensure  that

doctors    are   not   unnecessarily   overworked.     At

polyclinics,  doctors  work 45 hours  a  week,  excluding

lunch  hours.   This  is comparable to  a  private-sector

General  Practitioner who works an average of 43 hours  a

week. Doctors in hospitals work an average of 60 hours  a

week.  The working hours are longer because most hospital

doctors,  as  part  of their work, perform  night  calls.

However,  the working hours of our doctors are comparable

to  those of doctors in other developed countries.  While

public-sector doctors generally see more patients than  a

General Practitioner every day, hospitals and polyclinics

also  ensure that their doctors have sufficient time with

patients so that quality of care is not compromised.

<div align="center"><b>HOSPITAL WARDS AND BEDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Nithiah Nandan</b> asked the Minister for Health

(a)  whether  there has been an increase  in  demand  for

wards with higher subsidy and, if so, why and (b) what is

the  range  of  waiting time for Accident  and  Emergency

patients before being assigned to a hospital bed and  the

steps taken to reduce the time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demand for wards with higher subsidy has increased

in  the  past two years.  In 2000, 70% of total inpatient

discharges  in  restructured  hospitals  were  from   the

heavily  subsidised Class B2+, B2 and C.  This proportion

increased  to  74%  in first quarter  2002.  Singaporeans

could have become more cost conscious as a result of  the

economic  downturn  and our recent efforts  to  encourage

them to spend more prudently on healthcare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the higher demand for subsidised wards,

restructured  hospitals  are able  to  give  Singaporeans

timely access to subsidised healthcare services. Accident

and  Emergency (A&E) patients are given prompt treatments

at  the A&E Departments.  Moreover, more than 90% of  A&E

patients  who require admissions are allocated a hospital

bed within 1 hour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the small minority who has to wait more than 1

hour, our hospitals are looking into ways to speed up the

allocation process.  For example, on days when demand for

beds  of  a particular ward class is exceptionally  high,

the  hospitals will allow patients to occupy a bed  in  a

higher ward class first, until a bed in the ward class of

their  choice becomes available. They need only  pay  the

rates of the ward class of their choice for their stay in

the higher ward class.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOLASTIC ASSESSMENT TEST I</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether the new Scholastic Assessment  Test  I,

which  will  be used from 2005, will serve  the  original

objective  of  his Ministry in introducing an  additional

mode of assessment for admission into university.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of including the SAT I for university

admission  is   to  introduce  a  reasoning  test  as  an

additional  mode of assessment for university  admission.

The  use  of  SAT  I,  a reasoning test,  will  help  our

universities  assess  a candidate's  analytical  thinking

skills.   This  complements the  `A'-level  examinations,

which is a rigorous and effective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



measure  of content knowledge.  Coupling these two  modes

of  assessment will allow our universities to select  the

right  type of students, and signal the type of graduates

Singapore  needs  for  us  to succeed  in  the  knowledge

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June this year, the College Board, while

announcing the changes to the SAT I, stated that the  new

SAT  I  will  remain  a  test of reasoning  and  thinking

skills.  Notwithstanding this assurance, my Ministry  has

set  up  a  taskforce  consisting of  MOE,  NUS  and  NTU

representatives,  to  study in  depth  the  changes  that

College  Board  is making to SAT I and to  determine  how

best the new SAT I can be used to serve the universities'

objectives.    The taskforce is expected to complete  its

review by the end of 2002.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer fee is levied when a vehicle is

components  - a small administrative fee and a  tax.  The

administrative fee is $3 for motorcycles and $10 for  all

other vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax, which is also referred to as an Additional

Transfer Fee, is set at 2% of the assessed value  of  the

vehicle  and is part of our national taxation  framework.

It  goes  into the Government's Consolidated Fund,  which

funds  the various Government programmes for the  benefit

of all Singaporeans.

<div align="center"><b>TRAINING ON SAFETY FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  whether he will make it compulsory for  workers

at  construction sites to undergo more intensive training

in  safety before they are allowed to work at such  sites

in view of the rising number of fatal accidents involving

construction workers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, it is already a requirement for all

workers to undergo compulsory safety training before they

start  work  in a construction site. Under the  Factories

(Safety  Training) Order, any worker employed  in  manual

labour  to  carry  out construction work  in  a  building

operation or work of engineering construction site  shall

attend  and  successfully  complete  an  approved  safety

training  course for construction workers.  This  course,

the  Safety  Orientation Course (or SOC),  is  a  one-day

programme, and is designed to introduce workers to common

hazards   associated  with  construction  activity.   The

workers  are instructed on what they should do to protect

themselves against these hazards. Typical hazards such as

falling  from  height, falling objects,  electricity  and

hazards  associated with use of machinery are highlighted

to  the  workers. They are then taught of how they  could

protect themselves from these hazards.   The Course  also

teaches  them  how  to use Personal Protective  Equipment

properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help construction workers benefit more from the

safety-training  courses, the  Ministry  has  prepared  a

booklet  that  gives in pictorial form,  details  of  the

lessons they would learn during the course. This booklet,

available in 6 languages including English, Mandarin  and

Bangladeshi,  is  issued  to all  workers  attending  the

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current safety training course will provide

workers with basic safety knowledge for work.  Other than

the  compulsory course, under the law, employers are also

obligated  to  further  train  their  workers,  if  these

workers are engaged in operating machines, or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



working  at  processes  which may  cause  harm  to  them.

Workers must be instructed on the dangers associated with

these  machines  or  processes, and be  informed  of  the

measures  that  they  need to take to protect  themselves

from harm.

<div align="center"><b>CPF MONIES FOR RETENTION OF FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower whether his Ministry will allow the transfer  of

CPF  monies  between cash-strapped divorcing  couples  to

help  them retain their current flats and reduce the need

to downgrade.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where the ex-spouse who is to retain the

property has the required amount of CPF savings, the  CPF

Board does allow the transfer of his or her CPF to refund

the  CPF  savings  used  by the  ex-spouse.  This  is  no

different  from using one's CPF savings to buy  over  the

share  of  the property from the ex-spouse. Alternatively

the  spouse who gives up the flat can also choose to  use

cash to reimburse his or her CPF so that the property can

be  transferred  over to the ex-spouse. There  are  other

alternatives for cash-strapped divorcing couples who want

the  property to be transferred.  For example, the spouse

taking possession of the flat may approach HDB to seek an

additional housing loan to refund the CPF account of  the

ex-spouse.  HDB  will consider these  on  a  case-by-case

basis  and provided that the applicant meets  HDB's  loan

conditions.  If  the  spouse is  unable  to  service  the

additional  loan  for the current flat, and  transferring

CPF monies between ex- spouses to meet the CPF obligation

is   not  an  option,  the  more  prudent  and  effective

alternative  would  be  to downgrade  to  a  smaller  and

affordable flat.

made to submit to psychiatric examination with a view  to

treatment and commitment to an institution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbours and community leaders may want to

persuade  the  family  members to bring  the  person  for

voluntary  psychiatric treatment in the  first  instance.

Failing   this,  there  are  provisions  in  the   Mental

Disorders  and  Treatment  Act for  the  apprehension  of

mentally disordered persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person, who believes someone to be mentally

disordered and dangerous to himself or others, may report

him to the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police will investigate the matter and if

necessary  send  the mentally disordered person,  with  a

report of the facts of the case, to Woodbridge Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the doctor at the mental hospital believes such a

person   to   be  mentally  disordered  or   to   require

psychiatric treatment as an inpatient, he is empowered by

the  Act to admit and detain him for 3 days in the  first

instance. There are procedures established under the  law

to  extend  the period of detention incrementally  for  a

total of 13 months. Any further detention will be decided

by  a  magistrate  upon  the recommendation  of  visitors

appointed by the Minister to the mental hospital.

<div align="center"><b>MAINTENANCE CLAIMS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

Law  (a)  how many claims for non-maintenance  have  been

filed  by  ex-spouses each year over the  years  1999  to

2002;  and (b) in such cases, what are the actions  taken

against the defaulting spouses.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on figures provided by the family courts, the

number  of  enforcement applications filed by wives,  ex-wives  and  guardians of children to enforce  orders  for

spousal  or  child  maintenance from 1999  to  2001  were

3,820, 3,843 and 3,973 respectively. Complaints filed  by

ex-wives are not classified separately.  From January  to

July this year, there were 2,460 such applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 71 and Part IX of the Women's Charter,

if  an ex-spouse fails to make maintenance payments,  the

court may make the following orders:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Firstly, the court may direct the amount due to

be  levied by seizing his assets and selling them to  pay

the maintenance arrears;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Secondly, the court may sentence him to a term

of  imprisonment not exceeding one month for each month's

allowance remaining unpaid;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Thirdly, the court may make a garnishee

order.  By such an order, the court may direct  a  debtor

who owes a debt to the ex-husband to pay the sum owed  to

the  complainant instead of the ex-husband, to  discharge

the maintenance arrears; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Fourthly, the court may make an attachment of

earnings order. By this order, the court directs the  ex-husband's employer to deduct the maintenance amount  from

his salary and pay the money to the complainant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these orders, if the complainant is

agreeable to giving time to the defaulting ex-husband  to

pay  the  maintenance arrears or the court  is  satisfied

that  more  time should be given to pay the arrears,  the

court  may  direct the ex-husband to pay the  arrears  by

<div align="center"><b>REPOSITORIES FOR ABANDONED BABIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Community  Development and Sports, in view of the  number

of  reported  cases  of  new-born babies  being  left  in

rubbish  dumps, whether he will consider (i) constructing

repositories at special designated places in Housing  and

Development  Board  estates and at  strategic  convenient

places where abandoned babies can be left safely and (ii)

if necessary, making supporting statutory provisions.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MP has asked if my Ministry will consider

setting   up  a  repository  for  abandoned   babies   in

residential  areas  or  designated  places.   While   the

objective is to protect the baby from danger as  well  as

the  anonymity of the parent who abandons the baby,  such

repositories  remain  controversial,  even  in  countries

where they have been introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such repositories, also known as `Baby Drops', may

save a life, but they also make it easier for a parent to

abandon   an  infant,  thus  indirectly  encouraging   or

sanctioning child abandonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Singapore law, it is illegal to abandon a

baby.     This    is   to   underline   the   inalienable

responsibility of parents for the safety and  welfare  of

their children.  The `Baby Drop' scheme could unwittingly

instigate a parent to commit an offence.  Legalising such

a  scheme  will  not overcome the problem of  encouraging

child abandonment, which will, in the long term, put  far

more children at risk.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we recognise that mothers who cannot care for

their  babies need help, there are avenues  for  them  to

seek   help  for  themselves  and  their  babies  without

resorting to abandonment.  My Ministry prefers to  engage

the  mother,  inform her of her options and  assist  her,

through counselling with her partner and parents, to make

an informed and socially responsible decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are several avenues where unwed

mothers  or  those who feel they cannot  care  for  their

babies  can  turn to for help.  These avenues are  social

service  agencies, the hospitals and the Child Protection

and  Welfare  Service  at  my Ministry.   These  services

include  counselling on available options, the  provision

of shelter pending delivery and assistance in placing the

baby for adoption.  If the unwed mother is a teenager, my

Ministry or any social service agency will work with  the

girl,  and  if  possible  her  parents,  to  provide  the

necessary support and guidance needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelters for unwed mothers or mothers who wish to

give  up  their  child  are available  in  Singapore.   A

welfare  organisation,  Rose Villa,  provides  a  24-hour

hotline  and  crisis shelter to handle  emergency  cases.

Unwed  mothers  may also walk in to Rose  Villa  to  seek

further  assistance  and  support  and  are  assured   of

confidentiality.   The  Pertapis  Centre  for  Women  and

Children   also   provides   a   safe   environment   for

counselling,  support and adoption  placement  for  unwed

mothers.   My Ministry is currently working with  another

two  Voluntary Welfare Organisations to provide  shelters

for  unwed  mothers so that there are ample  options  and

services  for  mothers  who find  themselves  in  such  a

predicament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 3 years, the number of abandoned

babies  has dropped from 7 cases in 1999 to 4 cases  last

year.   This  is  largely  due to the  Ministry's  public

education  efforts  and the good work of  social  service

agencies  to increase awareness about where to get  help.

This  arrangement of involving the people sector has been

working  well.  There is no need for additional statutory

provisions.
