These issues have to be addressed against the backdrop of the uncertainties, not only from the economic perspective, but also the danger of an outbreak of diseases and omnipresent threat of terrorism and religious fanaticism.&nbsp; I would thus say&nbsp; that the 2004 Budget is as best as we can expect in the circumstances.&nbsp; It will require every Ministry to stretch the dollar to the limit, as they roll out the various policies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Issue of Ageing</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the policies that I wish to address is that of our rapidly ageing population. Today, about 7% of our population are aged 65 and above.&nbsp; By year 2030, this figure will rise to 19%, and will have a vast impact on productivity, healthcare and family support needs.&nbsp; We need to address this issue now, failing which, it will not only impact on our economic growth, but also<p align=left>Column: 929<p> our defence needs and the very existence of our nationhood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the ageing problem is not a particularly interesting subject. Everyone&nbsp;will get old.&nbsp; All you have to do is to live long enough.&nbsp; But we need to do more to prepare our society to cope, as older people are living alone. Some may have no one to care for them, and others may have no means to care for themselves. And still others might require special care because of the state of their health, physically and mentally.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been talking about these issues.&nbsp; However, so far, a more holistic approach has not been taken.&nbsp; For example, a resident requested for a lift at the Kovan Station.&nbsp; I was surprised by the request, as I know that there was a long debate in this House on the provision of public facilities for our elderly and there was assurance that the North-East Line would have the necessary lifts.&nbsp; I went for an inspection to see for myself, and I realised that there is only one lift at one side of the station.&nbsp; I then made an appeal. The reply came back asking for my understanding, as there was insufficient fund to provide additional lifts.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So where is the priority?&nbsp; We know that LTA has spent a lot of money installing various art pieces in the station to create the renaissance ambience.&nbsp; But what about the basic needs of our elderly, to enable them to be independent and move around?&nbsp; Is this being sacrificed for the artistic development?&nbsp; Which has a higher order in the hierarchy of needs for the population?</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till to-date, our buses are still not fitted to give easy mobility to our elderly.&nbsp; When is this going to happen?&nbsp; Leave it to the transport companies?&nbsp; They will tell you that they have no money. We have put ourselves in a bind and they need to answer to their shareholders and not the stakeholders.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 930<p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the efforts in providing elder homes are left to the voluntary welfare organisations.&nbsp; What is the role of the Government?&nbsp; Where are their estimation and projections of the requirement of these homes in the long-term and in the short-term?&nbsp; Has the Ministry of National Development done any survey to find out the needs of the people, for their alternative choices of homes for the families to have extended families and support each other?&nbsp; We understand that, in the case of studio apartments for the elderly, the residents are not finding them attractive.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What measures and motivations have we taken to encourage our middle-age population to stay healthy and alert and financially-able, as many couples of our generation have now one or two children to depend on in view of the population policies then? We should marshall the grassroots organisations, voluntary organisations and other interested bodies to train their volunteers, set up the infrastructure now to take on their role as caregivers or guardian angels to the lonely and elderly.&nbsp; They can visit them at home, attend to their basic needs, or even make regular phone calls to keep in touch with them.&nbsp; This way, the incidence of our old people dying at home and undiscovered until days later, can be minimised. We must reach out to these people before it is too late.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are people who can do their sums and do them well.&nbsp; If they can see the benefits of bigger families, they do not need the carrots to lure them.&nbsp; We should promote stronger family ties, filial piety and family togetherness which can then resolve at least partially, if not wholly, the cases of old people having to be home alone.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, here I have a few suggestions.&nbsp; For example, National Day tickets, concert tickets or SAF open houses can be on an extended family <p align=left>Column: 931<p>basis, ie, tickets for 6-8 persons, to cover the parents, children and grandparents. This can also apply to sale of extended family tickets to the Zoological Garden, Bird Park, Chinese Garden and holiday chalets.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, we encourage three-generation family outings.&nbsp; Even round-the-island tours or any outings organised by the grassroots organisations can be done on this basis. This journey to finding a solution to promote bigger families begins now. This is the mindset that Madam Yu-Foo has said that it has to be a societal movement.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children are our future. If we can succeed in selling the merits of having larger families, we can then move to the young people to persuade them to marry and marry early. The carrots that the Government will introduce will be an added incentive.&nbsp; Because these young people grow up in an environment of the extended family, they do not need much persuasion to have more children.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to remember that today's child will some day become the father of a child.&nbsp; So we have to start this cycle going.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now comes the question of bringing up children. The responsibility to bring up children must involve not only the married couple but also their parents, in-laws and other relatives like aunties, uncles, etc, as the case may be.&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><I>Sharing childcare responsibilities&nbsp;</I></p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If grandparents are able to lend a helping hand, even if it is just to fetch the child from the day-care centre to home, the parents of these children can then concentrate on building up their careers. The focus should be about sharing responsibilities, not transferring responsibilities, or worse, dumping responsibilities on grandparents.&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 932<p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the young Singaporeans, given the opportunity to pursue their careers, will also be able to enjoy parenthood, and the joys and benefits of an extended family.&nbsp; Nothing can be more heartwarming than to go home and&nbsp; be received by your children and parents at the dinner table.&nbsp; I have always valued my mother-in-law because, after work, there is always that steaming hot cup of coffee waiting for us, no matter what time it is.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the incentives for childbirth may not work, if the people do not see the benefits they can enjoy from having bigger families. We may recall those early days in the 1960s/1970s when someone would remark to another, "Oh!&nbsp; You are so lucky to have so many children!"&nbsp; Today, the tone of that remark is one of dismay when they hear you have children, "Oh! My goodness! How are you going to cope with so many children?&nbsp; Must be very stressful and very tiring!"</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coping with bringing up children is what we have to address.&nbsp; In fact, the issue of six months' maternity leave debate was a hot topic among the grassroots leaders of Paya Lebar.&nbsp; Many, including women employers, stated that the women are getting themselves out of job, as small and medium enterprises would not be able to provide women with such long leave nor afford the additional cost.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this incentive appropriate, in view of the volatile terms of employment in Singapore's global economy?&nbsp; Many of us have to double our efforts, as most companies have cut back on recruitment, with intense competition, in view of our global economy.&nbsp; Recent employment challenges, no iron rice bowl, retrenchment, the call for flexible wages, skills upgrading and retraining, all these compete with the effort of family procreation. Many people say unless they <p align=left>Column: 933<p>shut their eyes and do it blindly, then maybe they will have one or more children.&nbsp; So, indeed, we definitely need more than just economics when looking at procreation.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basic costs, many parents are asking for assistance for the 3rd and 4th child.&nbsp; It is only this year that the 4th child has the Edusave account.&nbsp; Many parents also need financial assistance beyond the childcare years, and many require support for their children in the before-and-after school care in the primary schools.&nbsp; The Inter-Ministry Committee may wish to add this incentive.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to reduce the stress of bringing up children.&nbsp; Many of the young adults who have gone through our education system are fearful of subjecting their children through the same stressful education system that they have gone through.&nbsp; They are afraid of their children being labelled EM1, EM2, Express and Normal.&nbsp; Are our current policies able to provide them the time and space for our young to enjoy learning?&nbsp; Are we not grouping and labelling them at a young age?&nbsp; Is our system pressing them too hard to excel and acquire the skills we deem they should acquire?&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that our education system is still too elitist in approach.&nbsp; I am pleased that the Ministry of Education has stopped making public the ranking of schools and releasing the names of schools with the best&nbsp;'O' or 'A' level passes.&nbsp; Competition is good, but not when the stress in the competition is passed on to those who have to carry the burden, that is, the students and their parents.&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we need not just have an inter-Ministry approach, but a multi-disciplinary review of the issue before drawing up the highway, the avenues and arterial roads to map out the roadmap to <p align=left>Column: 934<p>Baby Boom.&nbsp; We have to look at the ageing population and its impact, promote extended family values, encourage shared responsibilities in bringing up children, encourage early marriage, promote quality family lifestyle, minimise&nbsp;the stress in bringing up children and their education, and throw in whatever incentives we can give, so as to take a pincer approach when addressing this issue.</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that the PMO is now tackling the issue, and I am confident that they will take a comprehensive approach to nip the problem in the bud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>  	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.&nbsp; In this Budget, there are some goodies and practically&nbsp;no negative measures that would burden our taxpayers, except for some additional taxes on tobacco, which&nbsp;are implemented for a very special social purpose.&nbsp; I would like to congratulate the Finance Minister for putting up such a healthy budget despite all the revenue cuts.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of job prospects, the Budget Statement has confirmed that the new high value-added manufacturing sector will not create many jobs.&nbsp; The area where more jobs would be created will be&nbsp;in the service sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that although high-tech and high value-added industry creates&nbsp;few jobs,&nbsp;they are more rewarding jobs.&nbsp; This sends an alarm to the people that in future there will be less high-paid jobs available and that people should lower their expectation and accept&nbsp;the lower-paid jobs offered by the service sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on another aspect in the Budget Statement, to allow the repatriation of foreign income is a very sensible&nbsp;measure.&nbsp; Under the old regulation, people prefer to keep their foreign income outside Singapore, just to avoid taxation.&nbsp; Today, with the flow of&nbsp;funds and the easy movement of people, the location of&nbsp;the<p align=left>Column: 935<p> funds is&nbsp;not really an issue.&nbsp; The old rule which prevented the funds from being repatriated to Singapore,&nbsp;we tend to lose in all aspects, including the revenue tax that the Government may likely&nbsp;gain from the investment of these funds.&nbsp; With the new rule,&nbsp;funds will return to Singapore and&nbsp;will help to boost our financial industry.&nbsp; Perhaps with more money available in our market, the expenditure of those funds will also help the service sector.&nbsp; The Government too will&nbsp;benefit in terms of the taxation from the income derived from the investments.&nbsp; The question I would like to ask is:&nbsp; why is foreign derived income, which is distributed from the partnership company in Singapore,&nbsp;not qualified for exemption under this particular provision?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the foreign income paid by the partnership is of very little difference as compared with the personal income derived from overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Statement mentioned&nbsp;that university education will benefit the individual and that only about a quarter of our cohort will benefit from university education.&nbsp; It&nbsp;then&nbsp;said&nbsp;that in future, undergraduates will pay for 25% of the university's operating cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the people who are familiar with university education, they will know that the cost for running&nbsp;the undergraduate courses is very different from the university's operating cost.&nbsp; The announcement that the long-term university subsidy will be pegged to 75% of the university's operating costs is, in my view, an ambiguous and over-charged statement&nbsp;to the undergraduates.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The university has many operations and many of them have nothing to do with undergraduate education which the students pay their school fees for.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;cite a few examples.&nbsp; The university may run a lot of research institutions.&nbsp; There are many research institutions that we <p align=left>Column: 936<p>can name, like IPS, East Asian Studies, Strategic and Defence Studies, the Environmental Science Centre, etc.&nbsp; All these&nbsp;institutions are run by the university and have nothing to do with undergraduate education.&nbsp; The university manages their intellectual property.&nbsp; They register and&nbsp;manage the patent, hire lawyers and take prosecution action.&nbsp; These have nothing to do with undergraduate education.&nbsp; They do industrial collaboration and&nbsp;consultation, making money as a result.&nbsp; They do entrepreneurial development activities, university-to-university collaborations.&nbsp; Many of the expensive equipment in the laboratory have nothing to do with undergraduate education.&nbsp; The university runs courses with small classes,&nbsp;sometimes,&nbsp;for the purpose of national service.&nbsp; For any course with less than&nbsp;10 students per class, the amount of fees collected is not even enough to pay for the salary of the lecturer who is directly teaching the class.&nbsp; The post-graduate education, one-to-one supervision of the Masters and PhD degrees, is a pure money losing business.&nbsp; Teaching staff too have also been assigned to do all sorts of work&nbsp;that has nothing to do with undergraduate education.&nbsp; I can continue to name the endless activities done by the university which&nbsp;are pegged directly to the operating cost of the university that have nothing to do with undergraduate education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of undergraduate education is only part of the operating cost of the university.&nbsp; If the Government is going to pay 75% of the net cost in the running of undergraduate education, in my view, it is extremely generous and I support it.&nbsp; At present, each of the students in the university, depending on the course that he studies, is already paying about $5,000 per annum.&nbsp; This figure, compared with the unofficially announced figure of $17,000 per student per annum,&nbsp;is quite comparable to those in the Australian universities.&nbsp; If we look at the<p align=left>Column: 937<p> figure, in fact, the student is already paying for more than 25% of the operating cost of running the undergraduate course.&nbsp; If, eventually, the Government is able to quantify the cost of running undergraduate education, I believe that figure will work out to be less than $17,000 per annum per student.&nbsp; So my question to the Government is:&nbsp; if 75% is the subsidised policy, does it mean that we are going to adjust future education fees for the undergraduate course downwards?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we try to compare the fee increase in the past versus the reward of the student, as an argument in the increase&nbsp;in the student's contribution to the fees, then we can try to look back to my time.&nbsp; In 1969, I paid $600 per annum and, at that time, the&nbsp;engineer's basic&nbsp;starting pay was&nbsp;$900 per month, which was 1.5 times the fees that I paid.&nbsp; Today, the student pays $5,000 in terms of fees.&nbsp; If they are lucky, they are paid $2,500,&nbsp;&nbsp;if not, only $2,000.&nbsp; So, therefore, what they can receive per month is only a fraction of the fees that they have paid.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we try to look at the fee structure, comparing the old days and today, presently, the students are paying a lot for it.&nbsp; If the 75% includes all activities and costs unrelated to undergraduate education, I think it would not be right and fair for the undergraduate students to pay for those fees, as a large proportion is for activities&nbsp;which are unrelated to the undergraduate course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I come to birth rates.&nbsp; The day before the Budget was announced, many have already coined the name for this Budget - "Baby Boosting Budget" - slanting towards the adjustment of the declining birth rate.&nbsp; In the past few years, our economy has not been performing well.&nbsp; People take specific actions to reduce and conserve their expenditure.&nbsp; Giving birth is certainly one of the matters people try to delay due to the gloomy economic outlook.&nbsp; This could <p align=left>Column: 938<p>be the reason for this particular low birth rate of 1.27 per couple.&nbsp; I hope when the economy begins to go back to normal, higher birth rates could be restored.&nbsp; In many cases, giving birth is a very personal matter.&nbsp; Incentives could only work for someone who is hesitating whether or not to have more children in the family.&nbsp; All the measures talked about, like longer maternity leave, paternity leave, more subsidy for the child and baby, and so on,&nbsp;will have a certain effect in helping people in this particular category.&nbsp; I agree with many speakers who have said yesterday that changing the mindset of the people&nbsp;is the important aspect in addressing the population decline.&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee,&nbsp;Senior Parliamentary Secretary,&nbsp;informed the House on the first day of debate&nbsp;that the airmen detachment in the US, at the moment, is having a baby boom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 80s, I remember when I was in UK, at that time, New York City had an electricity blackout for a few days.&nbsp; A social chaotic situation developed.&nbsp; But, it&nbsp;registered a baby boom as a result of the blackout.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past many years, a survey reported by a contraceptive manufacturer, Durex,&nbsp;&nbsp;repeatedly put Singapore in the limelight of the survey results.&nbsp; Singapore always scored the best in "the least sexual activity" in the world.&nbsp; Sir, this issue is a very sensitive one and I do not want to elaborate any further.&nbsp; I hope the committee tasked to deal with the birth rate would seriously look into the above in relation to the declining birth rate in Singapore.&nbsp; Looking back, and viewing the birth incentives, we will discover some of its very unique characteristics.&nbsp; The uniqueness of the incentives&nbsp;being packaged would explain why it does not work so well for us.&nbsp; First, incentives&nbsp;are more for the working mothers - more benefits for the high income earners, eg, graduate mothers.&nbsp; Incentives in the form of tax relief - incentives stop immediately <p align=left>Column: 939<p>when the working mother stops working.&nbsp; Men have no role in the claim of the incentives, except the normal child relief.&nbsp; This incentive was actually given to the lower-educated, people with lower than "O" levels, asking them to stop at two.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising the birth rate is everybody's concern, whether you are rich or poor.&nbsp; If we only wish the rich and the educated to have more children, the incentive is sure to fail.&nbsp; If we are able to give the same amount of incentives to the lower income people, I believe that the effect would be more significant.&nbsp; The incentive to increase the birth rate is not aimed towards the whole population.&nbsp; In other words, we did not mobilise the whole nation to deal with the declining birth rate, but only call upon the well-to-do to produce more.&nbsp; Anyway, the well-to-do are the minority in our society and that policy will certainly not lead to the overall increase in the birth rate in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Tax relief in the form of incentives has its shortcomings.&nbsp; The perceived incentive will immediately vanish after the mother stops working due to heavy housework.&nbsp; The original claim for incentives would immediately turn into disincentives because there is no more call for the same person to give birth to&nbsp;a subsequent child.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Men, we all know, have half of the role to play in deciding whether or not the family should have more children.&nbsp; If the wife is not a working mother or a high-income earner, there is no incentive at all for him to persuade his wife to have more children.&nbsp; We must give the husband excuses, for example, some form of incentive to convince his non-working wife to have more children.&nbsp; Otherwise, the husband's hard work would be misunderstood by his wife.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addressing the declining population issue, increasing the birth rate and increasing the immigration rate are not the only solutions.&nbsp; One of the important aspects in the declining population is the emigration rate.&nbsp; Every year, I guess thousands of Singaporeans, especially the well-educated and who have the ability to work abroad, do not return to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; It is a serious matter.&nbsp; We must look into ways of how to reduce such outflow of our local talents, and lure them to return to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and serve us.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many things are reported in the media by returned scholars, how they love the food, how important are friends and families, and we expect them to come back to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Sir, on the negative <p align=left>Column: 941<p>aspect, there are many things people do not report when they return to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and it is because of the negative aspects of life in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I think all of us agree with me that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a very restrictive society and we have a very high legal norm.&nbsp; I listened to FM95.8 last weekend.&nbsp; They interviewed three successful men, one of whom was a lawyer.&nbsp; They were discussing about the problems of men.&nbsp; &nbsp;One person&nbsp;said that men should take proper care in order not to get into legal trouble.&nbsp; He cited two examples.&nbsp; He said that when you walk under an overhead pedestrian crossing, it would be good for you not to look upwards.&nbsp; If you are not careful, you may end up being alleged a peeping Tom.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a jailable offence.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also said that in the olden days, when you see a stranger at night and when you walk into the lift, you should avoid him.&nbsp; Pretend that you are checking your mail in your mailbox.&nbsp; After the stranger has gone, then you take the lift to go home.&nbsp; He said that nowadays it is not just strangers.&nbsp; If you see a lady at night and you are alone, you should avoid joining her in the same lift.&nbsp; It is better for you to pretend that you are checking the mailbox and wait until she has gone, and then you take the lift.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This kind of situation has created a lot of pressure in terms of life.&nbsp; This is precisely because of the publicity and the high level of punishment, causing fear in people's minds.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, there are many minor offences which carry jail sentences.&nbsp; I am sure professionals do not want to be jailed even for one day.&nbsp; For example, if you are not careful and you rent your flat to a person who looks educated but has a forged work permit or employment pass,&nbsp;and&nbsp; if you are caught, it is a jailable offence.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 942<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, when the Toto prize is $3 million,&nbsp;you bet all your take-home pay on Toto for that particular draw, and you lose all your money.&nbsp; If you want to avoid questioning by your wife, you go to a police station and report that your money was stolen.&nbsp; This offence is jailable.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our scholars and citizens who work abroad have enjoyed the air of freedom in overseas countries.&nbsp; In this kind of very restrictive environment, do you think&nbsp;they would like to return to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>?</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a very expensive place to live in.&nbsp; To enjoy the same material standard of owning a reasonably big car and house, many who are already living abroad will find that their standard of living would drop if they should return to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The good days of my generation of having high pay and good career development is over.&nbsp; Now it is a time of pay cut and to lower one's expectation.&nbsp; We have painted a gloomy future outlook for our younger generation.&nbsp; If we cannot offer them with what they currently enjoy elsewhere, how could we persuade them to return and to serve <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>?</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Singaporeans think that our Government is too calculative and very petty.&nbsp; For example, an employer in Jurong may offer his employees and visitors free car park.&nbsp; One day the Inland Revenue may come and tell the employee, "Please pay your tax because your free car park is one of your employment perks."</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example which has been well discussed and is also included in the Budget Statement is the announcement on means testing for people who earn more and use&nbsp;'C'&nbsp;class hospital beds.&nbsp; Sir, people go to hospital in accordance with their ability to foot the hospital bill.&nbsp; We know that the hospital bill is not cheap.&nbsp; If<p align=left>Column: 943<p> you have a medical problem and you know that you are not able to pay for 'A' class ward, it is better for you to downgrade and go to 'C' class.&nbsp; &nbsp;The use of 'C' class bed is considered as a misuse and you would be charged more.&nbsp; How about the poor people who use 'A' class beds?&nbsp; There are 3% of the poor people, under the lowest income category, who go to 'A' class ward.&nbsp; Do we also consider that as misuse?&nbsp; The person is misusing because he spends beyond his means.&nbsp; And he is misusing because he never used the Government subsidy.&nbsp; Does it mean that for such a person we have to give him a rebate?</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should we be so petty and claim that the person is misusing the subsidy? He has paid taxes for the past many years which has well exceeded the small benefit that he enjoys from the 'C' class ward.&nbsp; We are too petty.&nbsp; This is what they say.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> economy and the social policy should be supportive&nbsp;of the free economic system.&nbsp; Everyone, regardless of poor or rich, must be treated equally.&nbsp; However, if we look at our policy on taxation and the national benefit, we are indeed very socialistic.&nbsp; We tax the rich and give to the poor.&nbsp; The people who pay more taxes enjoy the least national benefits.&nbsp; The policy runs contrary to the free economic concept.&nbsp; We ask everybody to contribute and work hard, earn the most, pay the most tax, and enjoy the least of the national benefits.&nbsp; When there is a national crisis, they would be asked to pay the same price when they go to war.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this kind of discriminatory policy&nbsp;against the well-to-do will work against the Government and make us less attractive for the people who are already living abroad.&nbsp; With all this, how could <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> position herself in the arena of competing for the best talents, including<p align=left>Column: 944<p> our own citizens?&nbsp; Our leaders must think about this very carefully and take appropriate action&nbsp;to change certain aspects of&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and to see how we could make <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> a better place for Singaporeans who are living here, and also very attractive for the potential citizens returning from foreign lands.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

/>Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for permitting me to participate in this debate.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I join others before me in applauding the wisdom of this year&rsquo;s pro-enterprise Budget which augurs well for the continued prosperity and growth of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the well-being of Singaporeans. &nbsp; The various new initiatives proposed will most certainly boost entrepreneurship in our country.</p>      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, hearing what Prof. Low Seow Chay had to say a moment ago, perhaps we should consider engineering some blackouts at random&nbsp; in certain parts of the island to see if we could get a bumper harvest of babies!&nbsp; But this is not the topic that I am addressing today.&nbsp; I would like to focus on what I feel that we could do better to instill the entrepreneurial spirit across the economy, which is expected to be one of the propellants of growth in the not-too-distant future.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While good initiatives, such as tax incentives and better accessibility to financing, have been introduced in recent years, these changes have brought about, at best, only incremental improvements.&nbsp; We really need to look into policies that tackle the root causes of structural weaknesses in our economy, and that will bring about transforming changes.&nbsp; Sir, for <p align=left>Column: 945<p>this to come about, some degree of mindset shift is called for.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Sir, to turn <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> into a land of opportunity, one with boundless opportunities, we need to create a national sense of urgency about solving old problems in new ways.&nbsp; We need to explore new frontiers in how we create a nation of self-inspired people, focused and committed to be the best that they can be, and having a high sense of urgency to continually improve the way things are done.&nbsp; To operationalise this, I suggest that we forge a powerful and competitive sense of mission with key performance indicators (KPIs) that are effectively cascaded down, which every member of society can identify with and where people are inspired and motivated to achieve them.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, research shows that there is a strong link between personal freedom and innovation and entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Our citizens therefore should be given the freedom to unleash their creativity through approaches that they are comfortable with -&nbsp; not just confined only to those which are top-down driven.&nbsp; We need to find new ways to make a quantum leap in our ways of doing business.&nbsp; This is especially so for the larger MNCs and SMEs which will be overtaken by competitors in our neighbouring countries and region that have the benefit of more affordable labour and less governmental controls.&nbsp; We must be able to adapt to meet the challenges of a constantly changing environment in the region.&nbsp; In such an environment, it is imperative that successful companies, especially the MNCs and larger SMEs, share with other companies the creative and innovative ideas they have implemented which have contributed to their success.&nbsp; This culture of sharing is very much alive in the developed countries such as the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and many countries in <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 946<p>therefore urge business federations, such as the Singapore Confederation of Industries and the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, to organise seminars and other forums to facilitate the dissemination of innovative ideas for doing business.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative to personal freedom is the issue of media censorship, specifically with respect to satellite-based TV.&nbsp; Perhaps this is for fear of bad influences that our locals may be exposed to.&nbsp; What we may not have considered is the fact that satellite TV opens our nation to a wealth of views and ideas in the outside world, beyond what is currently made available in the current set of channels</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>through cable TV.&nbsp; It took us many years before opening the 'bandwidth' of broadcast media to our citizens which we are all benefiting from today.&nbsp; We are one of the few developed nations in the world that does not provide satellite based pay-TV as a choice to our citizens.&nbsp; The technology is advanced, able to be regulated and relatively cost effective.&nbsp; What wireless is to land-based phone lines, satellite technology provides another dimension to cable-based technology.&nbsp; On a lesser note, we might have an entire generation that will grow up without benefiting from this technology when it matures and becomes redundant.&nbsp; As a technology, it competes and provides a solution to the issue of 'who owns leased cable lines' between the incumbent players.&nbsp; And, in this House, it provides a small advantage to us parliamentarians in that it frees us from having to tackle such issues unnecessarily.&nbsp; But the bigger picture is that exposure to a variety of sources of information enhances our entrepreneurial drive, creates a more robust society and discourages monopolies.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to innovation, which is an important component of entrepreneurship.&nbsp; It is the pursuit of <p align=left>Column: 947<p>innovation that raises an organisation or a nation to a level beyond its competition and effectively carries them into the future, despite changing times.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is laudable that the Yellow Pages rule, as recommended by the Economic Review Committee, has been embraced by the Government.&nbsp; This should see the boundary between the state and market gradually shifting in favour of the market.&nbsp; This is exemplified by the Government's willingness, for example, to accept many ideas, including some entrepreneurial ones, emanating from the Feedback Unit as well as from citizens communicated through the Cut Waste Panel.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, innovation could be hampered at many stages of the entrepreneurial chain.&nbsp; Allow me to cite some of these along with suggested ideas on how they could be improved upon or overcome:</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Continue to review policies and regulations that inhibit and stifle innovation.&nbsp; For enterprise development to take off, we need to aggressively reduce red tape.&nbsp; Minister of State Raymond Lim has stated some time back that rules and regulations should be date-stamped.&nbsp; I would like to take this step further to suggest that we should even consider stating expiry dates on some time and environmental sensitive policies to force their regular reviews and ensure that they remain relevant with changing times.&nbsp; Mandating a thorough house-cleaning of rules and regulations every five years by Ministries may be too long and, therefore, not good enough.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Create the vehicles and platforms to harness ideas.&nbsp; This includes providing business support services to assist innovative start-ups and the commercialisation of their products or services.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 948<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; Publicise studies of successful companies which employ innovation as a model for business positioning and success.&nbsp; Showcase success stories of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> companies and those from the region to spark new ideas and inspire our budding entrepreneurs on how others have done it successfully.&nbsp; The success stories of companies such as OSIM, Hyflux (whose CEO is an hon. Member of this House) and Mil-Com are worth highlighting.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; Assist in creating markets for innovative ideas.&nbsp; For example, this could be done by organising a street fair, along the lines of those found in big cities like New York, that showcases ideas and inventions of start-ups and SMEs to gauge the reaction of the public.&nbsp; Encourage our students to also participate in such activities early in their lives.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp; Remove fear of failure.&nbsp; The stigma of bankruptcy, the fear of being impoverished and the lack of anonymity in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> send chills down the average citizen thinking about entrepreneurship as an option.&nbsp; This fear, coupled with an opportunity cost of switching from a comfortable 9 to 5 job, severely reduces the chances of one taking an idea and putting it to work by himself.&nbsp; Failure is indeed one of the prominent features of the new economy, but one must be willing to pick up the pieces and bounce back after falling.&nbsp; We need to find more effective ways to get Singaporeans to be more diverse, understand that second chances are becoming more and more of the norm and move away from a risk-averse mentality.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last point, Sir, is on micro-enterprises.&nbsp; Older workers with less than secondary education and menial skills are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable jobs.&nbsp; For this group, micro-enterprise development should be seen as an option to prevent poverty and enable economic self-sufficiency.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 949<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Micro-enterprises are quite prevalent in many developed countries such as the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United Kingdom</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Micro-enterprise development organisations work closely with welfare recipients to get them out of the poverty cycle and reduce their reliance on public assistance programmes.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;addition to SPRING's SEEDS, which is extendable to smaller SMEs, it would be perhaps beneficial to explore the possibility of setting aside funds for "Micro Seeds" aimed&nbsp; specifically at providing funding support of, say, up to $5,000 to the micro-entrepreneur.&nbsp; In addition to funding, SPRING <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> could also extend one of the schemes for on-going business counselling for a limited period to help the micro-entrepreneurs get off the ground.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for long-term sustainable competitiveness, we need to create the conditions that nurture both individuals and small firms as they will increasingly own intellectual capital and provide the flexibility and innovation that are essential for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s survival and growth.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude, allow me to quote Noel Treacy, the Minister for Science, Technology and Commerce of Ireland, a country which ranks high in the World Competitiveness Yearbook ranking, who said:</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our experience with local initiatives in Ireland lends support to the idea that an 'entrepreneurial culture' can exist in a much wider part of the population that was historically the case, and encompasses a much wider view of what an enterprise is.&nbsp; With this objective in mind we have adopted a pragmatic approach to enterprise development, working in close and continuing partnership with the other social actors, employers, unions and voluntary groups, to build up sustainable economic growth and prosperity through rigorous<p align=left>Column: 950<p> continuous assessment of our overall competitiveness." - (Noel Treacy in OECD Report 2002).</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe it will augur well for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> if we could approach entrepreneurship along these lines.&nbsp; On that note, Sir, I support the motion.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In an article entitled, "Unhappy staff burden Singapore economy," in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Financial Times</i> dated 17th October last year, it was reported that according to a gallop poll survey, 17% of our Singaporean workers are actively disengaged employees, a 5% increase compared with May 2002.&nbsp; The poll estimates that the general level of unhappiness among the workers is causing the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> economy a staggering $4.5 billion a year, based on factors such as absenteeism and lower productivity.&nbsp; If this finding is reliable, then this is a grave matter that warrants immediate attention.&nbsp; If we are able to recover even part of this $4.5 billion, then it is a great boost to our economy and our companies.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we have to take measures to remedy the situation where we have a high percentage of unhappy and disengaged workers.&nbsp; I am concerned whether in the preoccupation to deal with the economic crisis and new challenges, our companies have been too focused on numbers and bottomline at the neglect of the human element and, in the process, alienate or disengage our workers.&nbsp; Our corporate culture seems to have taken a very drastic change.&nbsp; It was like yesterday when we frowned on job-hoppers and valued loyalty, commitment and dedication, empowering our workers, and people first were the then buzzwords.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 951<p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we build strong companies without&nbsp;loyal, committed and highly motivated employees to deliver good services and make good products?&nbsp; Can we expect workers to be loyal and committed when their jobs are at risk whenever there is a crisis?&nbsp; Can we expect management and workers to work as a team and survive storms and share benefits when the company does well, if there is no job security?&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the rapidly changing economic environment, companies need to be nimble to survive.&nbsp; We accept that gone are the days of lifelong employment.&nbsp; But should we swing to the other extreme of hire and fire and of cold efficiency and nothing else?&nbsp; Sir, I believe that our companies should and could find a middle ground and a good balance between these two extremes and develop our own brand of corporate culture and philosophy that builds strong companies with happy employees with high morale in our land of opportunity.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next, I would like to bring up the subject of Chinese language.&nbsp; The recent changes in our education policy on mother tongue have generated a lot of discussions in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lianhe Zaobao</i>.&nbsp; Many were concerned if the learning of Chinese would be neglected or marginalised.&nbsp; I am speaking of learning Chinese not as a mother tongue for Singaporean Chinese only but as a language for all Singaporeans - a language that we need to learn for our future prosperity and survival as we meet the many challenges and opportunities of a rapidly growing China.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 12pt">In an article in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lianhe Zaobao</i> dated 29th February this year, Miss Pang Sin Hwa concluded that the Chinese economy is on the takeoff, whether to learn Chinese language or not, please weigh <p align=left>Column: 952<p>carefully.&nbsp; In the same article, Miss Pang also reported that media mogul, Chairman and CEO of News Corp, Mr Rupert Murdoch, has called on westerners to bring their children up to speed, in learning Chinese history, culture and language, in his keynote address at the Asia Society's Annual Dinner in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>.&nbsp; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">The Straits Times</i> of 2nd March carried an article from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Washington Post</i> that says, "Advice to a baby born today anywhere in the world - learn English.&nbsp;

Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I shall try to keep my speech short and simple, in other words, brief, as reminded by you.<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the future of Singapore is actually about the long-term survival of Singaporeans more than the survival of the country -- Singapore.&nbsp; This is because we have two intertwined national survival issues.&nbsp; One is sustaining our economic growth and of this, I have more confidence that we can find the solutions more readily than our second issue of sustaining our population replacement rate, which is intractable.&nbsp; As our country is similar to other industrial countries having a large urban population, we share a number of similar problems, including fertility growth.&nbsp; For my speech, I shall focus on the second national issue.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me use a business analogy.&nbsp; Our social fundamentals are sound.&nbsp; But why are the share prices of our stocks down and not flying high?&nbsp; Can we reverse our fertility recession the way we can <p align=left>Column: 955<p>engineer a reverse of our GDP decline?&nbsp; We have a relatively safe environment and a globally recognised education system for our children to be brought up in.&nbsp; We have a relatively safe family-life environment, too.&nbsp; But it appears to many of our young married couples that these are not enough to encourage a baby boom.&nbsp; So we have a paradoxical situation.&nbsp; Those who can afford to have babies do not want to -- that is, those with no kids or have only one child.&nbsp; Those who want to cannot -- these are couples with infertility problems.&nbsp; And, lastly, we have those who should not have, but they have, and therefore they have abortions, and we have, unfortunately, abandoned babies, too.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This suggests that we have to look at certain trends and issues at work in society and they make up the fundamental concerns that we have.&nbsp; Let me just go through briefly some of the main ones.&nbsp; One, we have to be very mindful of the unbalanced structural shift of our demographic pyramid.&nbsp; No longer is it a normal one, and we have to worry about its implication.&nbsp; If we have very sudden changes in the population birth cohorts, it will give headaches later on when we have to do planning.&nbsp; For instance, with a decline in enrolment, we may shrink school enrolment sizes, and we may have surplus teachers.&nbsp; And if, suddenly, later on, we have a big swing, then we have to catch up and make all those contingency plans.&nbsp; This is not good for social planning if you like to have an orderly form of development.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another trend that is emerging is that some Singaporeans, hopefully this is not the majority, are beginning to say that this is not their problem; this is the Government's problem.&nbsp; If it wants more babies, then it has to tackle the problems and leave us (the people) alone.&nbsp; We also have the bigger issue of changing values<p align=left>Column: 956<p> and perception.&nbsp; In the whole notion of marriage and the family as a social institution, we are now seeing a lacuna.&nbsp; In the past, there were values that kept us married, that gave us the incentives to have children, but we do not seem to have them now.&nbsp; So there is no longer a taboo.&nbsp; If you are divorced, no longer is there a stigma. If you are not married, even though my parliamentary colleagues had mentioned that, for female singles particularly, they still feel a bit of the heat, I think the pressure to get married is less now.&nbsp; Even the Chinese zodiac is no longer influential in persuading us to have babies - Dragon babies, or whatever auspicious animals are around the horizon.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, we have what is perceived as a "no-win" situation for our country and our economy.&nbsp; The equation is something like this.&nbsp; There are high costs of child upbringing plus, because of the new economic order, there is no job security, therefore the equation is "zero" child.&nbsp; This is negative thinking and something that has to do with perhaps individual issues also.&nbsp; One of which is the increasingly self-oriented lifestyle preference at work, whereby we are thinking of our present situation mainly.&nbsp; We like to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle.&nbsp; We are not prepared to put up with sacrifices.&nbsp; We are not prepared to think long term.&nbsp; So there is a de-emphasis in a community-oriented lifestyle, relatively speaking.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also, of course, the question of having a "Singapore DNA" in our genes, whether there is such a thing as having an instinct to preserve the next generation, of thinking about the long-term survival of our country, with Singaporeans that are true-blue, rather than relying on a massive influx of immigrants and foreign talents to make up for the shortfall in population.&nbsp; And what implications will this have?&nbsp; This will change the face of Singapore society as we know it and we must be prepared for<p align=left>Column: 957<p> the consequences if we were to allow that to happen, whereby Singaporeans would not form the majority, or would barely be the majority, of the total population of our country.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Related to parenting concerns, of course, we realise that parenting is not inborn, something that we all can do naturally.&nbsp; But we all seem to lack effective interpersonal and communication skills.&nbsp; We all seem to be at a loss as to how to parent effectively.&nbsp; And all these probably act as a damper to having children.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also then the mindset of employers, as again mentioned by my colleagues, that we have outdated human resource policies and practices in many companies and employers tend to take the short-term perspective.&nbsp; There is debate over extended maternity leave and other fringe benefits that will actually promote family life but are not really favoured upon by employers, which therefore add to the magnitude of our concerns.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would just touch briefly on the scope of the Working Committee on Population. With Minister Lim Hng Kiang involved, hopefully, the scope of this committee would be very broad and go beyond just what was released in the press statement by MITA, ie, for parenting concerns, there are only four issues highlighted: (1), maternity leave; (2), worklife balance; (3), childcare and infant care; and (4), financial support.&nbsp; I think we probably have to also go more into the values, attitudes and motivational aspects.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my suggestions, Mr Speaker, Sir, will focus on what would be the general areas that we must deal with.&nbsp; I agree with the hon. Member Mr David Lim, that we should be dealing with the emotional aspects and not just the material incentives.&nbsp; We have to let the average Singapore couple understand that there is also the private net product of having <p align=left>Column: 958<p>children, the gains and the joy they will get.&nbsp; And I would like to share this with Members.&nbsp; For me, I think the best part of being married, apart from having someone you love and someone whom you like to have as a partner for life, are the struggles that we, as parents, have to go through, to bring the children up, sharing with them the ups and downs.&nbsp; And I think the rewards are priceless, as others have mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, there is the social net product to society of bringing up the next generation of Singaporeans.&nbsp; When we pass away, they are going to inherit what we have, including our massive foreign reserves.&nbsp; To help Singaporeans cope with the vicissitudes of life in the new economic order, we have actually put in place very sound fundamentals here.&nbsp; So let us not underestimate or undermine the "treasures" that we have.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would actually look at the need for a "family impact analysis" of policies and measures that the Government, statutory boards, GLCs and even the private sector would be making.&nbsp; Do not underestimate or overlook what impact various policies would have on family well-being, and therefore we must struggle with negative-impact policies to make them more balanced.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to have a <i>kampong</i> spirit, even as we live in high-rise HDB blocks and neighbourhoods.&nbsp; I think we have not sufficiently utilised the golden opportunity of living in close proximity to each other to build community, social bonding, social networking and social support.&nbsp; I think these are the little things that matter.&nbsp; The "butterfly effect" mentioned by hon. Member Mr Leong Horn Kee is not so much all those big policies.&nbsp; For example, if we are friendlier, we can lend a helping hand to child-mind for our neighbours; when our neighbours or we ourselves are in difficulty, we go and support each other.&nbsp; These are the little things.&nbsp; I am reminded of the days when I was doing my PhD in Berkeley,<p align=left>Column: 959<p> and we were living in graduate housing.&nbsp; As students, we were more or less of the same social-economic status -- we were either on scholarships, or we had to work to pay for our expenses.&nbsp; So we had to pool our resources together.&nbsp; My wife and I decided not to own a car because we had neighbours who had cars.&nbsp; Every time they wanted to go shopping or do other errands, they would ask us, "Do you want to come along?&nbsp; Do you want us to buy things for you?"&nbsp; We baby-minded, child-minded each other's children.&nbsp; From this example you can see that it does not really take too much to bring up a family when you have social support.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I would say that we are beginning to have a new work order in which the traditional notion of a lifelong career followed by retirement, and having another 20-odd years to survive on a meagre retirement income for financial support will no longer be the general case.&nbsp; Probably we have to change our thinking and accept that we will actually be moving in and out of the labour force over our life span.&nbsp; We will be taking what I call "mini-retirements" along the way, allowing people to plan to have children and spending time with them, to take time out to go for skills training and upgrading, or even to just explore other parts of the world for a while.&nbsp; Therefore, the labour market can be more flexible.&nbsp; Employers do not really have to be worried over undue costs of labour concerning, for example, extended maternity leave or other kinds of leave, such as paternity leave or even parental leave for that matter.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this requires financial planning.&nbsp; We need to have ways and means to find support whilst we are not working, but I think that in some companies in some sectors, employees are already doing that.&nbsp; In the electronics sector, they get employed for a while; <p align=left>Column: 960<p>when there is a downturn, they are retrenched; when business booms again, they get re-employed.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would end by saying, let us have, maybe, a new set of five Cs, in addition to the so-called material five Cs:</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) We should really value <i>children</i>.&nbsp; So, children are important;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) We should have <i>caring family and kin</i>;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) We should have <i>CPF and financial planning</i>;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) We should have <i>community-based support</i>; and</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Employers should have <i>corporate social responsibility</i> towards family well-being.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think these are the new Cs that will actually sustain us and help us overcome our problems. &nbsp; I therefore look forward to the deliberations of the Working Committee on Population and I hope that they will "procreate" their recommendations with comprehensive solutions that will actually augur well for us in the long term for our future national interest.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;my colleague before me has eloquently stated the beauty of having a family and elaborated a lot on the social side of the Budget.&nbsp; I would like to concentrate on a&nbsp;few tax issues.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After recovering from a difficult year in which Singaporeans saw the unemployment rate soar to an all-time high of 5.5% in September before easing off to 4.5% in December, and with the<p align=left>Column: 961<p> country experiencing the dreaded SARS outbreak, it is not surprising that this year's Budget is one that sets the mood for Singaporeans to look forward and remake Singapore into a land of opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recommendations of the Economic Review Committee in 2002 are largely in place, and all that is left to do is a little tinkering here and there to make sure the country is kept on its course.&nbsp; On this note, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance for crafting a forward-looking Budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to direct my comments on specific issues relating to the competitive tax regime stated in this year's Budget.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin, I am happy to note that the Government has done much for businesses, with the corporate tax rate moving&nbsp;2% downwards to 20%, and entrepreneurs receiving help, such as the new tax initiatives that allow exemptions for three years for $100,000 of chargeable income of a new company.&nbsp; This effort will see more new businesses of all sorts starting up and which will, hopefully, generate more job opportunities for Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For individuals, however, little was seen of any fiscal handouts by the Government and, to add to the surprise, the top tax rate for&nbsp;individual taxpayers remains, until further notice, at&nbsp;22% instead of the widely expected rate of 20%.&nbsp; However, disappointed Singaporeans have been reassured by the Minister that the Government's target of top marginal personal tax rate of 20% remains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During last year's Budget debate, I had urged the Government to promote Singapore as a place for wealthy individuals to park their savings and assets.&nbsp; Not only will it help to increase the supply of money and to keep interest<p align=left>Column: 962<p> rates low, these individuals can also be role models for budding entrepreneurs to emulate and overtake in wealth creation.&nbsp; Thus, I welcome the Minister's decision to boost Singapore's private wealth management industry by deciding that all foreign-sourced income received in Singapore by resident individuals to be exempt from tax with effect from the year of assessment 2005.&nbsp; This initiative will entice high net worth individuals, who would otherwise park their money offshore for tax reasons, to bring it back.&nbsp; It has also a potential spin-off, as it is likely to attract these individuals from around the region to take up residence in Singapore.&nbsp; If they do so in significant numbers, other sectors of the economy will also benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the benefits, however, a few doubts on the Budget Statement on competitive tax regime need to be clarified.&nbsp; Let me elaborate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, in 2003, the Minister has already introduced the foreign-sourced exemption regimes which took effect from 1st June 2003.&nbsp; Dividends received by individuals will qualify for tax exemptions if certain conditions are met, such as whether the dividend has been subject to tax in the foreign country and is not less than 15%.&nbsp; What is not clear at this stage is whether individuals will have to satisfy those conditions before receiving tax exemption on their foreign-sourced dividends, or whether those requirements are now superseded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, some years ago, when I was an accountant with a bank, it was told to me many times that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has a strong dislike for banks and its customers to&nbsp;indulge in round-tripping, and that was to be highly discouraged.&nbsp; Round-tripping simply means putting what might have been regarded as Singapore-sourced income offshore and recycling it as exempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new competitive tax regime just introduced to exempt foreign-sourced income, has this fear now been forgotten<p align=left>Column: 963<p> in the interest of the Singapore wealth management industry?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, why is it that exemption of foreign-sourced income for individuals not applicable if it is received through a partnership in Singapore?&nbsp; Any partnership simply pools its resources together for investment purposes so as to have a better bargaining power and, thus, a better margin on their returns.&nbsp; It seems that partnerships are now better confined to non-investment income businesses, and that the partners will be forced to invest personally overseas than through a partnership in the tax planning exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to the exemption of Singapore-sourced investment incomes for individuals, it is not clear whether non-resident individuals are included in the exemption.&nbsp; If they are excluded, then it would appear that this tax incentive seems to run counter to the desire to stimulate the wealth management industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, will this new exemption for Singapore-sourced income for individuals see the end of the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)?&nbsp; At the moment, tax deductions are available for contributions to the SRS.&nbsp; When one retires, half of what is withdrawn on retirement is taxable.&nbsp; This means that even if the withdrawal may be largely made up of investment income, it would not be exempt from tax.&nbsp; However, if this investment income is now earned directly by the taxpayer, it would be tax exempt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another issue that needs further clarification is the method used to determine how much indirect taxes are due to the taxman when Government grants are involved.&nbsp; With more emphasis being placed on getting companies on the right footing through Government grants,<p align=left>Column: 964<p> some anomalies need to be addressed in respect of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).&nbsp; The current view is that where grants are given for no specific supplies of goods and services, these grants do not attract GST.&nbsp; As the grants are not subject to GST, it must mean that the recipient is involved in non-business activities.&nbsp; Thus, the recipient's input tax claims cannot be claimed in full and must be limited.&nbsp; This has caused much anguish and difficulties to companies, especially new ones that have benefited from Government grants as part of the Government's efforts to promote certain economic activities or to enable them to provide low-cost services.&nbsp; These companies are normally run on shoe-string budgets and do not have the luxury of time and money to explain to the tax authority about their business arrangements and to appeal&nbsp;for greater apportionment of input tax claims on GST returns.&nbsp; If such a situation arises, it would mean that the cost for these entrepreneurs will go up.&nbsp; Hence, the advantages of the grant have to be weighed against the hidden costs incurred in getting a fair amount on input tax claims against the output tax.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I understand the Minister's real concern is in the future size of the population.&nbsp; With no specific measures as yet to be tabled, I suggest that Singaporeans concentrate their time in seeking out all opportunities created by this year's Budget.&nbsp; As some might have noticed, more are offered in the appendices to the Budget Statement than in the Statement itself.&nbsp; The Minister has, in addition, said that this Budget will deliver $1 billion of tax savings and Medisave and Medifund benefits for business and individuals.&nbsp; Hopefully, together with the Minister's forthcoming policy on procreation, we can all see a fiery dragon in the next dragon year instead of a lizard.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.</p></P></span></div><p align=left>Column: 965<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have much to look forward to.&nbsp; We can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it is not because there is only one speaker after me.&nbsp; I am referring to the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;All signs point to the domestic economy gaining traction in its recovery, the strengthening economies in the West and Japan augur well for our exports, and the economic restructuring initiatives we had put in place are relentlessly pursued.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we have to be continuously on guard for the next challenge.&nbsp; Hence, when I heard the remarks made by the and Minister for Finance in the section of his speech entitled "Effective Government and Living Within Our Means", I am thrilled.&nbsp; There is now a determined effort to keep Government costs in check.&nbsp; Clear positions were taken by the Minister for Finance on two issues:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The expenditure cut, which is the year-on-year 2% permanent expenditure cut; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Productivity, not so much from the baby production angle, but the extraction of "productivity dividends" from the operating budgets of Ministries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I applaud the boldness.&nbsp; The action almost exquisitely timed to send a great signal.&nbsp; We are cutting just when the economy is gaining strength, not when the chips are down.&nbsp; Cost is paramount.&nbsp; No matter who you speak to, be it the MNC which is seeking to locate its next centre in Asia or the SME deciding to do more locally or diversify aggressively overseas, or even the family breadwinner struggling to provide a decent standard of living for his dependants, cost is top-most&nbsp; in all their minds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For companies, cost consciousness is a religion.&nbsp; Continuous attention is paid to taking out costs through productivity measures, such as Sigma and Kaizen, or <p align=left>Column: 966<p>through process re-engineering, or just hard-nosed attention to details.&nbsp; Cost reduction, cost avoidance and seeking lower cost of doing businesses are foremost in everyday's consideration.&nbsp; Companies have learned to live with less.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For our workers, many had their wages cut or frozen.&nbsp; They look forward, not as much to temporary rebates and one-time aid packages, but to a long-term sustained assault on the cost structure, eg,&nbsp;if they could look forward to a schedule of reducing cost of parking and&nbsp;SC&amp;C charges, lowering of Government fees and levies, lowering rentals and cost of transportation,&nbsp;or even an earlier arrival at the 20% top marginal personal tax rate.&nbsp; For our workers, they welcome no less than a total and sustained assault on what they would loosely term the "cost of living".&nbsp; Our citizens have also learned to live with less.&nbsp; Now, the Government has also jumped in.&nbsp; It is also learning to live with less.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The year-on-year 2% permanent expenditure cut is indeed a move in the right direction, considering the competitive environment that we live in.&nbsp; Mr Chew Heng Ching referred to this as a wake-up call.&nbsp; However, my question is whether 2% is enough.&nbsp; I would like to highlight today my perception of a disparity in the Ministries' cost reduction efforts in comparison with what the private sector has been doing in the face of competition over the last years, and what individual breadwinners are facing: lowered income and seemingly increasing cost of living.&nbsp; I am heartened by the fact that $1.8 million was saved</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

This 10% savings must be a good indicator of the stretched targets that Ministries can step up to. We can do much better than 2%. Do not stop at two.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can take a leaf from our own history. Civil servants of old must be <p align=left>Column: 967<p>abound with stories of working in much trying conditions.&nbsp; In the recent past, we did a lot with much less.&nbsp; I remember in National Service, when I got my first desk, it was one that had definitely seen much better days.&nbsp; It is one of those desks that if we pull a little harder, all the contents will be on the floor.&nbsp; It is a desk whose appearance definitely exudes history as generations of officers must have toiled on it.&nbsp; But we made do then; we can make do again today.&nbsp; We must learn to be hungry again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I want to turn to productivity.&nbsp; The extraction of "productivity dividends" from the operating budgets of all Ministries except&nbsp;MINDEF is a move that ought to signal that the Government is serious in matching the private sector in productivity performance.&nbsp; There must be already many examples of what can be achieved if we continue to push and slay old sacred cows.&nbsp; I ask the Government to consider providing a comparison of the agencies that had been privatised by the Government into private entities, or divested to other owners and see how these entities perform before and after the change of ownership.&nbsp; Factors that are regularly reported in the business world, such as revenue per employee, profits per employee or even the job-shop basis of work done per employee ought to be good indicators.&nbsp; Anecdotes of divested entities doing so much more with so many less people tend to raise one's hopes of great productivity jumps.&nbsp; But I know life is never so simple. Let the data from factual experience speak for themselves.&nbsp; Based on this experience, good benchmarks for productivity improvements across the Government sector could be derived.&nbsp; Continuous improvements can be made a way of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one talks about productivity and paring costs, one quickly associates with <p align=left>Column: 968<p>suffering.&nbsp; Civil servants are no different.&nbsp; If they undertake such programmes, the downside for them must not be disproportionately greater than the upside.&nbsp; The Government must set the right incentive structure in order that there is a sustained drive for productivity improvements.&nbsp; Only then can the mindset change.&nbsp;&nbsp; In its effort to encourage civil servants to find productivity gains by breaking free of the shackles of the IM, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has cheekily warned that at the time of reckoning when civil servants meet their creators and judged to have failed if they have been totally straight-jacketed by the IM.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ultimately, I firmly believe that from both the cost and productivity perspectives, the Government not only can lead by example, but can actually set the pace for the private sector to emulate.&nbsp; An ever leaner Government that continues to deliver would win many kudos from both within and without.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coupled with the expectation of a stronger economic performance, much more can be put aside for new priority and strategic areas. More money would be available.&nbsp; So contrary to what Mr Low Thia Khiang had said, the citizens of Singapore would stand to gain more.&nbsp; The way I see it, a virtuous cycle would be unleashed.&nbsp; Leaner Government, lower fees, increasing the potential for private consumption and investment and more money for other initiatives and programmes that would fuel other growths and ultimately, the creation of more jobs.&nbsp; All of us gain when more money is freed up to realise a stronger society and enhance the land of opportunity.&nbsp; We are all going to be so much more richer as a people and as a country.&nbsp; Hence, I am less disturbed by the many cautions sounded out by some of my parliamentary colleagues on the potential adverse impacts on current social programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 969<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governments all over the world face the challenge of balancing taxation and expenditure.&nbsp; But in Singapore, we have the political will to make the necessary adjustments.&nbsp; Let us now take the scalpel and make even deeper cuts.&nbsp; Take out the whip and drive productivity to higher levels.&nbsp; We all want to get to 36,000 feet.&nbsp; Let us start by jettisoning some fat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, with that, I support the Budget.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in&nbsp;the debate as the last speaker before the Hon. Minister for Finance makes his reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to welcome this Budget for its stance of reminding all of us that, as a country, we must live within our means, while continuing to invest in our future, especially in defence and education.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Budget is clearly pro-business with the 2% corporate tax reduction and the removal of tax from personal income remitted from overseas is very well-received.&nbsp; What&nbsp;I hope would also come soon is the removal of tax from corporate income earned overseas and remitted to Singapore.&nbsp; I believe that this measure would encourage offshore funds to move back to Singapore to benefit our banking industry and our role as a capital-exporting country.&nbsp; Perhaps, the potential revenue forgone in removing this tax would be balanced by the downstream gains from these funds flowing in and through Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am heartened to note this Budget continues to pay attention to education and training and retraining of workers, rather than taking the populist way out of giving more rebates and subsidies for low-income families.&nbsp; I would like to draw hon. Members' attention to a heartening article in today's <I>Straits Times</I> entitled, "It's back to Japan for high-precision goods".&nbsp; In this article, on page 6, it reports that <p align=left>Column: 970<p>Canon, Kenwood, Seiko Epson and others are planning to move production of high-end consumer electronic products back to Japan from some of the factories in&nbsp;the surrounding countries because of the lower cost of procuring components in Japan, flexibility of workforce and proximity of R&amp;D facilities plus the higher skills and productivity of Japanese workers. All these help to make it cheaper to produce these high-end articles back in Japan, in some cases, with a total savings of 10%.&nbsp; This article further noted that labour cost may only constitute 5% of the cost of these high-end products and further notes that one of the rationale, for one of these companies,&nbsp;is that&nbsp;workers in Japan could do the job of 22 workers in a neighbouring country.&nbsp; I think we should continue to encourage our manufacturing sector to upgrade and to continue to help companies find reasons to stay in Singapore, such as upgrading our workforce and also making a sustained effort to lower cost for companies and individuals through greater Government efficiencies and realistic pricing of Government services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn now&nbsp;to babies.&nbsp; Like many of my colleagues, this time, I would like to say that when we got married, my wife and I wanted three or four children.&nbsp; But after my daughter was born, my wife changed her mind.&nbsp; She was not convinced that I would have been able to share more of the responsibility of looking after the next&nbsp;baby since I had seemed very hands-off with the first.&nbsp; In her eyes, a disproportionate share of the responsibility for child-rearing had been&nbsp;laid&nbsp;on her&nbsp;lap.&nbsp; Sadly, I must confess the truth of this.&nbsp; On my part,&nbsp; I had always felt a struggle to balance the demands of career and family.&nbsp; If I look back, I would regret what&nbsp;I had done.&nbsp; As the years have caught up with us, perhaps the time has passed for myself.&nbsp; But I wonder how many other husbands in Singapore have been faced&nbsp;with this dilemma.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would call on other husbands not to make the same mistake<p align=left>Column: 971<p> but to find&nbsp;a way to convince their wives that they will do more, and&nbsp;after that, better keep their promise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, having four to six months of extended maternity leave has been suggested.&nbsp; It is an attractive sounding option for some potential mothers but the employers may not be happy and female employees may not dare to take up this offer for fear of losing their jobs or promotion prospects.&nbsp; As one of my grassroots leaders very succinctly said, "You want to take six months, do not bother to come to work!"&nbsp; These are real attitudes that we must face.&nbsp; Another option might be to make it a statutory entitlement for companies to give parents, both male and female, maybe an extra 5 days a year for the first few years of each child's life and maybe three days a year extra for the next few years to age 10, with a maximum number of days of family leave, which would, in this case, have to be subsidised by the Government.&nbsp; The cost for this child leave could be shared by the employer and the Government and will not be deferrable or accumulated. We will need to send a signal that it has to be taken by both parents for the purpose of sharing out the responsibilities of sending the child to the doctor, attending a kindergarten performance or seeing the teacher about the child's work or just spending a day&nbsp;at the beach together as a family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, bringing up a child is an expensive business in Singapore.&nbsp; Not all will be able to use the tax incentives that have been offered.&nbsp; And at&nbsp;a time where many people with so-called "good jobs" are now worrying about job security, it will be better to assure them that the child will be looked after should something happen to the parents, rather than to give tax incentives which may not be for everybody.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 972<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of maids, I agree with my colleagues in this House that for many families, if having a maid is not a necessity&nbsp;then the deciding factor is in terms of their timing for starting a family.&nbsp; We need to ask ourselves about the options available to families who need care arrangements for young children.&nbsp; For many, having a domestic helper makes more sense than childcare because childcare often costs more and childcare cannot do the laundry or help with the house chores.&nbsp; One simple relief could be that for families with two children, the maid levy could be reduced and reduced further for those with three or more children but&nbsp;with a cap. Some of my colleagues have also mentioned that we should rationalise the policy of where exactly a maid can be located. I recognise the Government's intention to prevent the abuse of domestic helpers' work conditions in having to look after two households on one salary.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it may be a practical arrangement for the granny to oversee the maid who is physically looking after the grandchildren.&nbsp; In this way, the child's parents would have the security of knowing that the family member is overseeing the children while the grandparents will not have to feel overwhelmed with the task of looking after the grandchildren by themselves.&nbsp; If what we are after is a fair arrangement for family and maid, will it not be possible to have a form of differential pricing of both the levy and the maid salary to take this into account rather than saying it cannot be done at all?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, we are still saying to people&nbsp;- have three children if you can afford it.&nbsp; However, I would like to ask the Government to consider the situation of twin pregnancies. Whether the first or second pregnancy&nbsp;of a twin or multiple pregnancies, it would be good if parents could use Medisave for the third child or for the fourth if the mother actually has two sets of twin pregnancies.&nbsp; People who want to have another baby after <p align=left>Column: 973<p>having twins obviously like children and should be encouraged rather than punished.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I laud the Deputy Prime Minister's plan to contribute $50-$100 to the Medisave accounts of elderly Singaporeans.&nbsp; But I think that the money will go a longer way if it could be directed towards a medical insurance policy for the first cut of all medical costs, even as MediShield is targeted towards mitigating the second tier of costs of major illnesses.&nbsp; People should become accustomed to having to set a portion of their family budget for healthcare.&nbsp; However, we know that Medisave is often insufficient when illness strikes one or more members of the family and especially when the Medisave account holder is a self-employed person, for example, a taxi-driver struggling to pay his annual Medisave contribution, or when the complications of child birth and the neonatal period strikes a young couple having a baby early in their working lives. This proposed type of policy could still be based on co-payment and have a limited pay-out but could be compulsory and have universal coverage of all Singaporeans so that while avoiding the buffet syndrome, it will help alleviate the hardship caused when illness strikes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to appeal to the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Finance to further refine the regulations of medical insurance in Singapore to ensure that no Singaporean is without medical insurance coverage in the long-term.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>Children born with congenital conditions or illnesses that start in childhood, and those who have lost jobs and have lost their medical benefits after having developed a medical condition during their working lives, are particularly vulnerable to being denied insurance coverage just when they needed most.&nbsp; In Australia, there is a scheme in place<p align=left>Column: 974<p> which ensures that anyone can get medical insurance coverage even if you had a previously diagnosed condition like, eg, cancer, on the condition that no claims can be made for that pre-existing condition for a period of, say, a year after the inception of the policy.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As my hon. colleagues have exhaustively covered points on the Budget for Singapore,<I>&nbsp;</I> I would like to say a few words on the Singaporeans' budget.&nbsp; With flexi-wages here to stay, has the Government focused on educating our people on how to budget for themselves and spend prudently within their means?&nbsp; With the flexible component of wages set to become 30%-50%, perhaps the rule of thumb of, say, setting aside 35% of household income for debt servicing should become lower, maybe even 25% of the income.&nbsp; For the&nbsp;financially savvy, this is not an issue.&nbsp; But I feel that for many of the people, financial information should be simple, straightforward and perhaps even prescriptive, such as if you have a basic income of $1,400, a flexi-wage component of $600, it is best not to spend more than $350 on loan repayments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the people whom I get to see at the meet-the-people&nbsp;sessions, have gotten into trouble over relatively simple renovation loans and hire-purchase items.&nbsp; A prudent budget would have allowed many of them to keep their heads above water, even with job changes and wage reductions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once over-extended, and forced into a lower paying job, many fall into a spiral of juggling debts, such as the power bill, conservancy fees, HDB instalments and telephone bills.&nbsp; School fees and examination fees also go unpaid.&nbsp; Little luxury like the air-conditioner for a hot night becomes unaffordable and the spectre of bankruptcy looms, further threatening existing jobs where companies may not want an employee who is an undischarged bankrupt in certain posts.&nbsp; Young people, who see their peers and<p align=left>Column: 975<p> neighbours in this situation, could draw the wrong&nbsp;conclusion that in the midst of such financial uncertainties they too would rather put off starting a family.&nbsp; In this regard, I would echo the concerns put forward by many of my colleagues in this House regarding the affordability of university education.&nbsp; For young&nbsp;couples planning to have kids, an important question is:&nbsp; can I give my kids the same opportunities that I had, including a shot at tertiary education and perhaps a leg-up on owning&nbsp;their first home?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of my colleagues have spoken of the need to build the spirit of the nation.&nbsp; Starting a family is about exercising an option on your own hopes for the future.&nbsp; Hope, enthusiasm, a belief that there is a future for Singapore and, more importantly, a belief that there is a future for themselves and for their children in Singapore, is a plus point for the national budget that cannot be easily quantified but perhaps is more important than any budget surplus or cut waste campaigns.&nbsp; We should continue to seek to build that spirit for Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to put in a word for those retired teachers who taught in Government-aided schools at the time when their counterparts teaching in Government schools received both pensions and&nbsp;medical benefits on retirement.&nbsp; While Government school teachers have the Singapore Allowance&nbsp;to their pensions adjusted to meet the cost of living, aided-school teachers, on the other hand, received only prevailing CPF terms.&nbsp; While the Government is not contractually obligated to help these people, perhaps some assistance could be given to these same teachers who had given of their best years to produce many of the top students in Singapore, students who include many of the Members of this House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 976<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mr Iswaran has asked if the projected deficit for this year is too conservative or cautious.&nbsp; I do not think $1.35 billion deficit is conservative, given that the economy is on the mend.&nbsp; &nbsp;We have to judge the fiscal stance with reference to the state of the economy.&nbsp; If the economy is down,&nbsp;we must do more.&nbsp; If the economy is picking up,&nbsp;we need to do less, or&nbsp;we may even have to dampen the economy.&nbsp; This year,&nbsp;the economy is recovering.&nbsp; I think a modest boost like this is about right.&nbsp; We are projecting GDP growth of 3½%-5½% this year.&nbsp; In fact, if&nbsp;we look at the projections, they are&nbsp;at the top end of that range.&nbsp; But we have set that range this way, down to 3½%, because of what Donald Rumsfeld would call "unknown unknowns".&nbsp; &nbsp;We do not know what may strike us.&nbsp; It could be a terrorist attack.&nbsp; It could be another virus. Or it could be some totally unexpected mishap.&nbsp; So, just to be careful, we are telling everybody, "Watch it."&nbsp; But if&nbsp;we are just going on momentum, I think the momentum is strong and there is no need for a larger fiscal stimulus.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that Dr Gan See Khem felt that the Constitution forces "extreme fiscal conservatism", if I may quote her, and she argued that the Government should have a more aggressive fiscal policy and run budget deficits for many years to come.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not an extreme fiscal conservative, but I do not think this is necessary or wise.&nbsp; It is not a sustainable path to take.&nbsp; We are prepared to run a deficit in a downturn, as we have done in the last few years, but we must not end up with structural deficits, as <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> has done.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Because that would undermine investor confidence, crowd out the private <p align=left>Column: 979<p>sector and, in fact,&nbsp;far from promoting growth, after a while, it will dampen growth and weaken the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> dollar, and inflation will go up.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Fiscal choices</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the economy recovers to its potential growth path&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; that means growing as fast as it has the potential to grow&nbsp; -&nbsp; we have to strengthen our fiscal position, not too early, but not too slowly either.&nbsp; So, as a first step, we aim to balance our budget by next year, FY 2005.&nbsp; But balancing the budget is only one decision.&nbsp; The other major decision is in what way we are going to balance the budget. And there are two ways to do this:&nbsp; (1) high taxes, high spending; or (2) low taxes, low spending.&nbsp; And that is a fundamental policy choice:&nbsp; do we want high spending, universal social benefits and be subject to much higher taxes, or do we want free enterprise, more targeted social benefits and much lower taxes?&nbsp; It is a basic choice.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we want <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to be a land of opportunity where the private sector is the engine of growth, then we have got to keep both taxes and spending low.&nbsp; &nbsp;Because by keeping taxes low, we foster a dynamic society where individuals will strive to achieve and excel, and where they are free to decide for themselves how they wish to spend their own money.&nbsp; They earned it, it is their choice.&nbsp; And by keeping public spending low, we foster a self-reliant society where individuals assume primary responsibility for themselves and their families.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we will need a safety net.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every society needs to provide a safety net, and we will provide a safety net.&nbsp; But we should focus the safety net on those who need it most.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 980<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Keeping taxes low</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been steadily reducing our direct taxes over the last few years.&nbsp; &nbsp;This year, we have lowered the corporate tax rate down to 20%.&nbsp; There are no plans to lower it further, but let me assure Mrs Fang Ai Lian that neither is 20% a sacred cow.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;they have become an endangered species! &nbsp; Many countries are cutting their corporate income taxes.&nbsp; We have to continue to monitor our competitiveness.&nbsp; If it should become necessary to cut the corporate income tax again, we will have to do so.&nbsp; If the Americans bring their rate down, and if the Europeans bring their rate down, we have to do so.&nbsp; But, remember, it will mean we have to make up the revenue in some other way.&nbsp; Some other taxes will have to go up.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we watch the other countries.&nbsp; &nbsp;We see <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>, 16½%, going up slightly.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure what they will do today&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; it is their Budget day.&nbsp; Or <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 12½%, as Dr Gan mentioned.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are trade-offs.&nbsp; &nbsp;In <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>, the corporate tax is low; the personal income tax is low; the budget deficit is 7% of GDP.&nbsp; They hope to cover it but it is going to be a tough slog.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the corporate tax is very low, 12½%, but the GST is something close to 20% and the personal income tax is something close to 50%.&nbsp; So, there are trade-offs which we have to make.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for personal income tax, Dr Gan expressed disappointment that we have "mothballed" the reduction in personal income tax to 20%.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me assure her that we have not mothballed the idea.&nbsp; We had to postpone the reduction, but I have not given up the objective.&nbsp; The Government remains committed to cut the top personal income tax rate to 20% as soon as our fiscal position and our economic conditions permit.&nbsp; We have not changed our goal.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 981<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Keeping Government trim</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low taxes mean low spending and a trim and efficient Government.&nbsp; &nbsp;No doubt there will always be strong pressures for higher Government spending.&nbsp; We want better teacher-student ratios.&nbsp; We hope for more healthcare subsidies.&nbsp; We press for more public transport infrastructure, more train lines, unemployment allowances, more housing benefits and so on.&nbsp; They are all reasonable requests, and some of them are worthwhile public expenditures.&nbsp; Others are desirable, nice to have, but may or may not be sustainable.&nbsp; So, we have to review each proposal,&nbsp;decide whether it is something that the Government should do first. And if we think we should do it, then we rank it against all the other demands on the exchequer to decide where it ranks, how much we should support it, and whether it has to wait or not, so that we can meet all the pressing demands within our budget.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore agree with Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Chew Heng Ching that all Government agencies should review their missions and objectives periodically and assess the relevance of their programmes.&nbsp; &nbsp;First, we have to decide: are we doing the right thing?&nbsp; Then we can examine whether we are doing it efficiently or not.&nbsp; So, Ministries have to prioritise their activities, instead of simply employing more people to do new functions while retaining existing officers in old and outdated functions.&nbsp; They have&nbsp;to subject their functions to a market test to see which of them can be better done by the private sector.&nbsp; They have&nbsp;to restructure and streamline their operations and share resources in order to derive greater economies of scale and better efficiencies.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are primarily Ministries' responsibilities but also Ministry of Finance's duty to ensure because we are guarding public money. So, MOF has been <p align=left>Column: 982<p>working with the Ministries on this and we will regularly and systematically review the functions and the activities of the Ministries and statutory boards, to make sure that they are effective&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; not just efficient, but effective, doing the right thing.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to watch the costs of Government, and one cost which we particularly need to watch is the rising manpower expenditure, which several MPs have mentioned.&nbsp; &nbsp;Our total Government spending is now about 18% of GDP.&nbsp; By world's standard, this is not high.&nbsp; The OECD, typically, is 30%-40% of GDP.&nbsp; But considering that we were at 14% of GDP just a decade ago in 1995, from 14% we have ballooned up to 18%, just in nine years, I think there is reason to be watchful.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, the civil service had a headcount freeze.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then in 1996, MOF lifted it, mistakenly believing that controlling budget dollars was enough.&nbsp; We thought that if we just limited the amount of money the Ministries had, they would spend within their means and make sure that they were lean.&nbsp; But it does not quite work that way and, as a result of lifting the controls, the public sector headcount has grown by 17% since 1996.&nbsp; In eight years, it has grown 17%.&nbsp; In other words, more than 2% a year.&nbsp; Some of the increases have been necessary, eg, teachers, we want to improve teacher-student ratio, and we have recruited more teachers.&nbsp; But overall, I believe there has been some slackening.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, going forward, we will have to be more stringent on headcounts.&nbsp; &nbsp;Agencies will have to be more circumspect in expanding their manpower needs, and must trim back wherever possible.&nbsp; I am reluctant to impose a freeze again, but MOF is working on ways to control total headcount numbers, while allowing Ministries flexibility to grow and to shrink their departments and agencies.&nbsp; One of <p align=left>Column: 983<p>the ideas that we are thinking of is to impose a headcount tax.&nbsp; If we think that is what you should have</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Just like in the private sector, every public officer must continually improve his productivity, work smarter, upgrade and learn new skills.&nbsp; When missions and needs change, which from time to time they do, then Government departments and statutory boards will have to restructure, and sometimes they will have to shed staff.&nbsp; It is inevitable, but when it happens the civil service will work closely with the public sector unions to manage the change, as we did in the case of the HDB restructuring last year.&nbsp; Where possible, we will redeploy the officers but where it cannot be done, then we will have to release them&nbsp;on fair separation terms.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the FY 2004 Budget, we impose a permanent 2% cut on the budget caps of all the Ministries, except MINDEF, and we are going to cut by another 2% by next year.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Mr Leong Horn Kee expressed concern that the 2% cut should not be achieved by sacrificing social programmes or passing on costs to the private sector.&nbsp; Let me assure them that the cut will not be onerous to the Ministries.&nbsp; Ministries' budgets are tied to the GDP.&nbsp; Because we are projecting growth this year, in dollar terms, the spending caps for all the Ministries are higher this year than last year, despite the 2% cut.&nbsp; Because you take a percentage of GDP, GDP grows, so your budget grows, then a 2% cut.&nbsp; If the GDP grows <p align=left>Column: 984<p>by more than 2%,&nbsp;in fact, in dollar terms, you still get more.&nbsp; So social subventions for healthcare, schools, voluntary organisations and town councils will not be cut.&nbsp; In fact, we are budgeting for 14% more social subventions this year compared to last year, of&nbsp;$287 million.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">"<I>No free lunch</I>"</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think all the PAP MPs understand the importance of keeping the Government trim.&nbsp; Even Mr Steve Chia supports our prudent fiscal position.&nbsp; He said so.&nbsp; In contrast, Mr Low Thia Khiang argued against the Government's fiscal policies.&nbsp; He questioned the 2% cut in Ministries' budgets; he opposed changing the basis for university fees, and he also opposed using means testing in healthcare.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are easy, populist demands to make.&nbsp; But supposing we agree.&nbsp; Who is to pay?&nbsp; We are already drawing on the returns on our reserves, up to the constitutional limit.&nbsp; Is Mr Low Thia Khiang suggesting a further increase in GST?&nbsp; Or should we raise income taxes, instead of reducing them? &nbsp; He did not say.&nbsp; But his unspoken message is that someone else, presumably someone else richer, can cough up, not middle or lower-income Singaporeans.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is not possible simply to pass on the cost to someone else.&nbsp; Today, the top 20% of people working already pay 93% of the net income tax assessed.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, if we go the way Mr Low proposes, then we are going to have to tax the majority of Singaporeans more heavily, in order to pay for the benefits to themselves.&nbsp; In other words, tax the middle-class and lower middle-class in order to benefit the middle-class and lower middle-class.&nbsp; That is how welfare states work.&nbsp; That is how the British work - the first pound you earn, you pay about 20 pence on the pound.&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the first $20,000 you earn is tax-free.&nbsp; So, that is what it<p align=left>Column: 985<p> amounts to.&nbsp; And if Mr Low were candid, I think he would admit this.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Opportunities for individuals</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam See Tong and some other Members have commented that this Budget does not offer much to the man-in-the-street.&nbsp; But maybe they have forgotten&nbsp;the many rebates which are still in place for the households and many programmes to get the unemployed back to work.&nbsp; Some were from the GST offset package two years ago; others were from the off-Budget package last September.&nbsp; As these are quite generous, there has been no need to increase them, especially with the economy picking up and unemployment going down.&nbsp; Instead, this Budget focuses on creating opportunities for individuals to help themselves.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Help for households</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just briefly name the items which are still in force.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 12pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a second tranche of Economic Restructuring Shares in January and February this year.&nbsp; Altogether, we have given out $814 million worth of shares.&nbsp; $814 million - that is equal to the whole corporate tax cut this year.&nbsp; And of this, $562 million has been encashed, that means nearly 70% has been cashed out.&nbsp; And there is a third tranche, which is worth an estimated $900 million, which will be allotted next year.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, HDB households are receiving rebates this year on the Service and Conservancy (S&amp;C) charges (up to five months), rentals (up to four months) and they are getting Utilities-Save rebates too (up to four months), and the S&amp;C and rental rebates are going to continue for another couple of years.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 12pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, needy persons affected by the downturn can turn to the Interim Financial Assistance Scheme (IFAS) for help.&nbsp; In FY<p align=left>Column: 986<p> 2003, we had disbursed more than $4 million to assist more than 8,000 individuals.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this year's Budget, I decided to make Medisave top-ups from $50 to $200 for older Singaporeans, and to inject another $100 million into Medifund for needy patients.&nbsp; Dr Jennifer Lee did not think that Medisave top-up was necessary, and she preferred to put the money into Medifund.&nbsp; But I think, on balance, it is necessary.&nbsp; Firstly, because the older workers are suffering a deeper CPF cut when we made the changes to the CPF system last year, and I think we owe them an obligation.&nbsp; I said then that at the next opportunity, the Government would do a little more for them in terms of top-ups.&nbsp; Secondly, we have structured the Medisave top-up to give more to those with lower Medisave balances, who are likely to be the less well-off.&nbsp; And if they already are on Medifund, this will help to pay for the MediShield premiums.&nbsp; Thirdly, I have not neglected Medifund, and I have put $100 million into Medifund to bring the fund to its target size of $1 billion, to look after the group that Dr Lee is concerned about, which we are also concerned about.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Middle/lower income groups gain more</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many MPs have expressed concern with the well-being of middle and lower income Singaporeans.&nbsp; Let me assure the House that this is a group that the Government pays close attention to.&nbsp; In assessing how the middle and lower income groups have fared, we have to look at a broad range of factors, not just&nbsp;in this Budget - consumer prices, wages, taxes, benefits.&nbsp; By almost any measure, the middle and lower income groups have not been left behind.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, on the cost of living.&nbsp; This is a perennial subject.&nbsp; But inflation in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> continues to be low.&nbsp; Last year, the CPI rose by only 0.5%, although for <p align=left>Column: 987<p>lower income groups, it went up slightly more - by 1.1% - but this is still very low.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the purchasing power of Singaporeans has increased over the years.&nbsp; Their real wages have gone up.&nbsp; In the last two decades, nominal wages have nearly tripled - they have gone up by 190% - whereas the CPI has only increased by 28%.&nbsp; So, real wages have more than doubled.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MOF recently did a study to compare different households, different income groups, different housing, all the taxes they paid compared to all the subsidies they received.&nbsp; I have a Chart* which is also on the screens.&nbsp; And you can see that we have taken in all the taxes they paid - personal income tax, GST, property tax, foreign maid levy, car taxes, and all the subsidies they received (healthcare, education, public housing, plus one-off transfers like ERS and rebates on rental, utilities, and S&amp;C charges).&nbsp; You can see how each household fares in terms of what they paid and what they received.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">* Cols. 1081-1082&nbsp;<BR></div></P></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, 90% of the households gain more in subsidies than they pay in taxes, that is, if they do not own a car.&nbsp; If you own a car, even then more than half the households gain more than they receive.&nbsp; If you look at a typical household from different income levels, the bottom 20% of households (those who are in the 1- and 2-room flats), they gain the most - $13,000 or so a year.&nbsp; The middle and lower middle-income households, they gain about $11,000, so long as they have no car, no maid but two children.&nbsp; Even households at the 60th to 80th percentile level (that means, the 5-room or executive HDB flats), if you do not own a car and do not have a maid, you are still getting about $7,400 each year in net subsidies.&nbsp; In contrast, for the top 20% of households owning a car and with a maid, <p align=left>Column: 988<p>which most of them have, taxes exceed subsidies by more than $42,000 each year.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; So, that is how it balances out.&nbsp; And I think that is the background which we should remember when we talk about the middle class squeeze which Dr Amy Khor and Dr Wang Kai Yuen mentioned.&nbsp; In many ways, the "middle-class squeeze", or the squeeze on middle-class households, really boils down to lifestyle choices, whether or not you want to own a car, and the car is a very big item.&nbsp; To some extent, the high cost is unavoidable because it reflects our need to control congestion in a land-scarce city.&nbsp; However, the Government recognises that many Singaporeans hope to own cars, and we have been reducing the upfront cost of owning a car.&nbsp; Over the last two years, we have reduced the upfront car taxes, which include the ARF and the excise duty, from 171% of OMV to 130% of OMV.&nbsp; Even though we have done that, if you look at the COE prices, they have not really gone up that much.&nbsp; So, overall, the cost of owning a car has come down.&nbsp; With the ERP, I believe, over time, we can gradually lower the upfront ownership taxes further.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Help for the unemployed</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Othman Haron Eusofe asked how the Government is helping the older workers who have been laid off.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Workforce Development Agency (WDA) administers training programmes, grants and other assistance measures, especially for older workers.&nbsp; But the older workers themselves have to be prepared to undergo training to upgrade and equip themselves with new skills, and take on jobs which can be quite different from their previous jobs.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme (PJTP) which continues to be popular for placing older <p align=left>Column: 989<p>workers. &nbsp;Every month, it places about 500 to 800 older workers and there is a subvention, part of their pay, up to half, up to quite a high limit, for up to six months.&nbsp; Since the scheme started in June 2001, it has placed more than 16,000 workers.&nbsp; Under the PJTP, the Government pays up to 50% of the wages of an older worker who takes a job in a different field for six months.&nbsp; Last year, 44% of the older workers stayed on with their employers, even after the salary support from Government ended.&nbsp; And now the proportion has gone up to 57%.&nbsp; So I think that we are making some headway.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other unemployed low-income Singaporeans can also make use of the Work Assistance Programme to help them get back to work as quickly as possible.&nbsp; For FY 2003, the scheme helped about 2,500 unemployed Singaporeans.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A global economy means more intense competition for investments and for jobs.&nbsp; Even as the output of our manufacturing sector grows, I do not expect the number of manufacturing jobs to go up.&nbsp; Increasingly, the growth will be through higher output per worker, not through more workers.&nbsp; Over the years, manufacturing has held its share of GDP to one-quarter, but the share of employment has been going down for over a decade.&nbsp; But this is happening in almost every economy in the developed world, and the only countries where there are big increases in manufacturing employment are in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; So, I think if we can keep our manufacturing jobs here by upgrading the industry, by bringing in new investments and replacing the jobs which leave,&nbsp;we are doing well.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mr Seng Han Thong pointed out that we would need to bring in foreign workers even as we upgrade and develop our own local workers.&nbsp; Indeed, if our local workforce is fully employed, we will still face shortfalls, particularly if the economy grows strongly and particularly in some sectors.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I think before we discuss the 'S' Pass, which many Members have been focusing on, it is useful for us to see how the foreign workers have helped us over the last 10 years.&nbsp; I have divided the last 10 years into two periods, the first five and the next five.&nbsp; If you look at Chart 3*, you can see the first five years, 1993-1997, boom years before the crisis.&nbsp; We attracted strong flows of investments.&nbsp; We created many jobs, nearly half a million, 470,000, and the jobs went to locals as well as to foreigners.&nbsp; 180,000 jobs to locals, 290,000 jobs to foreigners.&nbsp; In fact, in this period, more jobs went to foreigners than to locals, but nobody complained.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there were not enough locals and if we have not given the jobs to foreigners and let the foreigners come in, our economy would have overheated, our growth would have been lower,&nbsp;and I think we would have been worse off.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

During good times, they top up our supply of workers and enable us to grow faster.&nbsp; But during bad times, they cushion the impact which would otherwise fall squarely on Singaporeans.&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members expressed concern that the 'S' Pass scheme would hurt workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Nithiah Nandan spoke for the unions and explained how his members and his colleagues saw this.&nbsp; I understand their concern.&nbsp; But, overall, I believe that the 'S' Pass scheme will benefit Singaporeans and Singaporean workers.&nbsp; Let me explain why.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we upgrade and train our local workers, we cannot provide the full range and diversity of skills and experiences which the companies need.&nbsp; No single country can.&nbsp; It is not just numbers.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;the range.&nbsp; It is the experience.&nbsp; It is what you are able to bring to the table.&nbsp; So we have polytechnic graduates and&nbsp;university graduates.&nbsp; The foreign workers on 'S' Passes will complement these polytechnic and university graduates,&nbsp; and allow our companies to grow and hire more Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I give you two examples.&nbsp; We started the petrochemical industry in Jurong in the 1990s.&nbsp; We&nbsp;linked the islands together, building <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Jurong</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.&nbsp; There were no locals who could do the job.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 992<p> There was no expertise available to train the locals.&nbsp; Mr Nithiah would know because he represents that group of trade unions.&nbsp; So we allowed the companies to bring in chemical technicians and process specialists from abroad.&nbsp; He may not be a graduate, but he is trained, he is skilled.&nbsp; He is in charge of the whole petrochemical plant, sitting in the control room, and if something goes wrong, it is his job to carry out&nbsp;an orderly shutdown before some disaster happens.&nbsp; Because we allowed them to come in,&nbsp; so now many Singaporean managers and engineers work on <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Jurong</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, and many more Singaporeans benefit from the supporting activities, eg,&nbsp;in port, shipping the staff in and out, banking, dealing with the financial side, logistics, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we had said no foreign workers, no technicians, I think we could not have started.&nbsp; Take banking -&nbsp;the major banks operating in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> have people here from more than a dozen countries.&nbsp; Standard Chartered Bank, I asked them, one-quarter (26%) of their total staff strength are foreigners.&nbsp; &nbsp;They have 31 nationalities.&nbsp; They have people from <st1:place>North America</st1:place>, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the Indian sub-continent, various parts of <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>, and all over the world.&nbsp; They are not just&nbsp;in the top management.&nbsp; Many of them occupy middle executive positions.&nbsp; They are in corporate finance, in treasury, in private equity, in wealth management.&nbsp; And they possess specialised skills which are in demand worldwide.&nbsp; Without this one-quarter of foreigners, I do not think Standard Chartered could employ the other three-quarters of its employees who are Singaporeans.&nbsp; And it is not just Standard Chartered,&nbsp; Citibank has almost as many countries represented.&nbsp; DBS, if they are going to be in fore, they also have to trawl the same talent pool.&nbsp; So I asked them.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have got foreign employment pass holders from 14 different countries.&nbsp; DBS has to do that in order to compete.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 993<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IT skills are always going to be in demand,&nbsp; and high order IT skills, we will need very&nbsp;bright people, imaginative, hardworking, creative.&nbsp; We have NEC Solutions Asia Pacific here, which is a well-established IT service provider and it has been here for 25 years.&nbsp; It has continued to expand its operations in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; It has not hollowed out, gone off to <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>,&nbsp;<st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> or somewhere.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it is able to grow here and get the talented ones.&nbsp; It set up new R&amp;D centres here, hospital information systems, global e-procurement, biometrics technologies, that means, measuring your thumbprint, measuring your face, measuring your&nbsp;iris pattern.&nbsp; They could only do this because we allow them to employ IT professionals, many of them from <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, to meet part of its need for skilled manpower.&nbsp; If we had not done that, they would be gone.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The companies that EDB is now bringing to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> are knowledge and technology companies.&nbsp; They all depend heavily on skilled workers, technicians and specialists, not on low cost labour.&nbsp; One major reason they come here is because they know we will allow them to hire the people they need, whether Singaporean or foreign, without hassle.&nbsp; The foreign skilled workers we allow in complement our own skilled workers and enable companies to grow and, in turn, hire more Singaporeans.&nbsp; When I was in <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> recently, I visited one of these IT companies and they raised this with me.&nbsp; They said, "Please understand, we are very happy with <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Compared to any other country,&nbsp; you are much more flexible and that is why we are there.&nbsp; But there are still some practical difficulties which we would like to draw to&nbsp;your attention, and please can you do something about it."&nbsp; So I have looked into the matter and I think these are issues which can be resolved, particularly with the 'S' Pass.&nbsp; But they are real problems.&nbsp; Do we want the companies?&nbsp; If <p align=left>Column: 994<p>we do, then we have to make these adjustments.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new 'S' Pass scheme allows the companies to hire these skilled workers.&nbsp; The criterion is not just the $1,800 salary floor, but also the fact that the worker must have an acceptable tertiary qualification, that means, a degree.&nbsp; We are prepared to be flexible what the degree is, but it has to be an acceptable tertiary qualification.&nbsp; So we are talking about qualified trained people.&nbsp; And furthermore, we have put in place control mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not&nbsp;a blank cheque.&nbsp; We have a 5% quota.&nbsp; We have a $50 levy.&nbsp; It is not onerous.&nbsp; But it is an instrument which is in place and a tool with which we can manage the demand if we need to tighten or loosen, and we can adjust.&nbsp; So we do not have to worry that we are going to be flooded with 'S' Pass holders.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Olivia Lum suggests that we vary the quota depending on the sector and the type of activity.&nbsp; I think this is the way forward if we&nbsp;are going&nbsp;to compete and to seize opportunities.&nbsp; We need flexible systems where a company can get quick access to skilled workers, whether it is local or foreign, to meet new opportunities and business demands.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you another example.&nbsp; This is not 'S' Pass, but another example of where we have to be flexible because there is an opportunity which we have created.&nbsp; We signed the&nbsp;US-Singapore FTA (USSFTA).&nbsp; As a result, we have&nbsp;given a new lease of life to the textile industry.&nbsp; We thought we had left textiles behind.&nbsp; But now with the USSFTA rules of origin, preferential access, we have an advantage, and textile companies want to come to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> now to take advantage of our tariff savings.&nbsp; But the window of opportunity is&nbsp;small because other countries are also signing FTAs with <st1:country-region><st1:place><p align=left>Column: 995<p>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp;and negotiating FTAs with <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>,&nbsp;and they will secure the same tariff preferences.&nbsp; So we have to move quickly to get the companies here.&nbsp; How do we do that?&nbsp; All our old textile workers have retired.&nbsp; So we need to help our companies ride on our competitive advantage quickly and gain a headstart.&nbsp; &nbsp;We do not have enough Singaporeans, and those&nbsp;we have are not going to be able to pick up the skills overnight.&nbsp; So MOM will exercise flexibility for these companies to bring in additional skilled foreign workers during this ramp-up phase, so that they can start operations immediately.&nbsp; And, over time, Singaporeans can learn new skills and take up the jobs.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Preserving jobs&nbsp;</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that many Singaporeans are a little unsettled by the changes we have to make to the labour market in recent years.&nbsp; And there are many changes&nbsp;-&nbsp;talk about flexible wage, talk about co-payment, medical benefits, retrenchment benefits, capping that, and many more.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to preserve jobs, we have had to do all these changes to make ourselves more competitive and flexible.&nbsp; It is not easy, but our great advantage is that the unions have supported these changes because they accept and understand and are convinced that these changes are in the long term interest of the workers.&nbsp; Unlike many other countries, we are able to implement these reforms.&nbsp; Because of the excellent relationship and trust built up by the tripartite partners, that is the master key, that is the magic.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp;the formula.&nbsp; Anybody can design the policy.&nbsp; But without that foundation of tripartite relationships,&nbsp;you cannot make the policy work.&nbsp; As Mr Yeo Guat Kwang pointed out, good tripartite relations should not be taken for granted and they have got to be constantly nurtured.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 996<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that is&nbsp;the answer to Dr Tan Cheng Bock who asked why it was necessary for the Senior Minister to intervene in the SIA pilot issue.&nbsp; As SM explained, this is not just an ordinary management-labour dispute in a company.&nbsp; SIA is not only a big employer, but it is also an icon of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the anchor to the whole aviation sector in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake.&nbsp; And, more importantly, the way the issue was developing could have undermined the foundation of the tripartite approach that we have painstakingly built up over the years.&nbsp; Therefore, it was critical to nip the problem in the bud effectively, while maintaining the trust of all parties involved.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did SM do this rather than one of the other Ministers?&nbsp; The short answer is because this was unfinished business.&nbsp; It was left over from 1980, when there were troubles between SIA and the pilots which SM handled.&nbsp; So this time the problem had not been cleared.&nbsp; SM went in,&nbsp;and&nbsp; I hope this time the matter is done.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I><B>Opportunities for enterprises</B></I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Reducing business costs</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no question that companies need to watch their business costs.&nbsp; But lowering the cost of factors of production - land, labour, utilities, which MPs have talked about -&nbsp;is only half the equation.&nbsp; The other critical part is how efficiently companies make use of these factors of production which determine what the company cost is.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The unit cost of labour in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp;- we have been watching it - has not increased significantly even though wages have been rising.&nbsp; And this is because our productivity has risen together with&nbsp;our wages.&nbsp; In the last 10 years, overall unit labour costs only increased by 4% while<p align=left>Column: 997<p> unit labour costs for manufacturing actually fell by 19%.&nbsp; So, overall, labour costs have gone up by 4%, but in manufacturing where we are, I think both open to international competition, productivity went up faster than wages and over 10 years, our wage cost per unit output has gone down by 19%.&nbsp; But there are some cases where the wages have gone out of line, and downward adjustments would have to be necessary.&nbsp; And that is what PSA and SIA have had to do.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also critical that our wages respond flexibly to changing market conditions.&nbsp; This would allow companies to adjust to the ups and downs in the business climate and give workers more job security, of course, with the trade-off which is more variability in their wages.&nbsp; If you are prepared to accept some uncertainty in your pay, not from 0% to 200%, but maybe from 80% to 150% as a range, then it is possible to have greater certainty that your job will not be lost.&nbsp; Not an absolute certainty, but a better chance.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of land has also been on&nbsp;the downtrend.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

So, in January this year, JTC reduced its rentals of ready-built factories by as much as 17% and land rents by up to 6%.&nbsp; With this reduction, JTC's rentals would have fallen by nearly 40% on average since the start of the financial crisis in 1997.&nbsp; You can see a similar trend downwards for private industrial <p align=left>Column: 998<p>factories, and for commercial and office rentals.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the cost of utilities, competition in the liberalised electricity market has also gained us benefits.&nbsp; As of the end of last year, electricity tariffs are at least 9.5% lower than in December 2001, after adjusting for oil prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min spoke about how vesting contracts in the electricity industry have led to higher prices for some industrial users.&nbsp; I think the matter is more complex than Mr Ong makes it out to be.&nbsp; Vesting contracts seek to curb the market power of generating companies to stimulate greater competition.&nbsp; Since the introduction of these vesting contracts, pool prices have fallen, which reflects the over-capacity which was there but might not have surfaced in the absence of competition.&nbsp; I do not have time to explain all of this now, but the Minister for Trade and Industry will respond to Mr Ong in greater detail during MTI's COS.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of water, our tariffs are higher than in other countries.&nbsp; I think everybody understands the strategic reasons why.&nbsp; But now, with NEWater, we will be able to supply more cheaply to the industries, as we are already doing with the wafer fab plants, and we are building the second, third and a fourth NEWater plants.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh has suggested that we keep business costs low by giving permanent rebates and subsidies so that costs will stay low even when times are good.&nbsp; I think that would not be the right approach.&nbsp; We have to go on what the factors of production cost.&nbsp; We cannot subsidise services below their true costs.&nbsp; If you have to buy oil and gas, you have to pay for the oil and gas.&nbsp; I cannot charge you less for the electricity than it costs me to buy the oil and gas to generate the electricity.&nbsp; That will only<p align=left>Column: 999<p> lead to over-consumption and a misallocation of resources and a drain on the exchequer.&nbsp; We can make temporary concessions when we are in a downturn but, once that passes, we have to reassess and adjust to the new situation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not mean that we are going back to the <I>status quo ante</I>.&nbsp; Rather, the rates should reflect the prevailing economic and market conditions.&nbsp; That means the rates will be set by supply and demand, and will settle at a level that businesses can afford and people are prepared to pay.&nbsp; People do not understand this.&nbsp; When&nbsp;we say market prices, they fear, because they think that market prices are something which they cannot pay.&nbsp; But if nobody can afford to pay, it cannot be the market price,&nbsp;something&nbsp;must be&nbsp;wrong with the price.&nbsp; The market price must be one&nbsp;which people can afford to pay.&nbsp; We have industrial land and factory space, we are producing utilities, that is the rate, that is what it costs us, that is what people can afford to pay, and that is the market clearing price.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, JTC is charging market prices, but these are low market prices.&nbsp; They have come down, reflecting the new market realities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, with Government charges.&nbsp; The foreign worker levy was high before the crisis, because the market was tight and there was a great demand for foreign workers coming in and we had to control the inflow.&nbsp; But we brought it down to very low levels during the crisis.&nbsp; Now, the crisis is over, we have to bring it up, but we have only brought it up by a little bit for the skilled workers, from $30 to $50.&nbsp; And we are not aiming to restore the foreign worker levy to the pre-crisis rate.&nbsp; We are going to set it depending on the circumstances now.&nbsp; If there is an inflow, we have to adjust it up; if there is no pressure, we will leave it where it is.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1000<p> But the market, the benchmark, is now, not five years ago.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;we are very mindful of costs and its impact on businesses, and businesses should not worry because, if you look at the Government part of the costs, statutory items, eg, CPF, taxes, they have also come down significantly in recent years and overall business costs today are quite a lot lower than a few years ago.&nbsp; As Prof. Koo Tsai Kee said, "We have been right-sized, Singapore is now ready to row once more."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even as we focus on keeping costs low, the more important challenge for us is for companies to reduce their overall costs by what they themselves can do, ie, operating more efficiently and increasing the productivity of their workforce.&nbsp; So, they have to continually restructure their organisations, redeploy their workers, adjust their labour costs, and make the most of their office and factory space.&nbsp; These are business decisions which they have to take.&nbsp; They have to make themselves efficient.&nbsp; They have to trim.&nbsp; Unless they do that, no amount of subsidised labour or land will make them cost competitive.&nbsp; And I remind Members of this because,&nbsp;to see it in perspective, we have to watch our labour costs but, remember, it is not just wages.&nbsp; It is also what employers do with their workers.&nbsp; And if they do not do the right thing with their workers, then the workers will go and work for somebody else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>A pro-enterprise civil service</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as businesses need to change, the civil service also needs to change.&nbsp; So, I fully agree with Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mrs Fang Ai Lian that civil servants need to be more responsive, innovative and prepared to accept change.&nbsp; Do not be "bureaupreneurs"; too complicated. &nbsp;Just be entrepreneurs!&nbsp; Part of this involves<p align=left>Column: 1001<p> trimming our rules and regulations to create space and opportunities for enterprise to flourish.&nbsp; But, of course, when we relax rules and regulations or apply them more flexibly, then we have to be prepared to live with untidiness and stop taking care of every aspect of people's lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equally, people must be prepared to accept some risks and inconveniences.&nbsp; I will just give you two recent examples.&nbsp; They are not big ones, but they just show the mindset change which is necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, reverse bungee jumping.&nbsp; We took the plunge recently and decided to allow reverse bungee jumping even though some of us were worried about public safety.&nbsp; But it was not the end of the story, because our instincts are very deep.&nbsp; So, when we allowed reverse bungee jumping, we said stop jumping at 10.30 pm because, after 10.30 pm, you jump, there may be screams, squeals, etc, and you may wake up the neighbours.&nbsp; But, in Singapore, it is very warm.&nbsp; Nobody wants to go bungee jumping in the day time, and their peak hours are late at night when you have had a drink, you want to&nbsp;enjoy yourself, you want to show off to your girlfriend.&nbsp; Hence, 10.30 pm was a problem.&nbsp; So, they appealed several times.&nbsp; Eventually, they appealed to the Head of the Civil Service and, after a thorough investigation, of course, we established that there were hardly any residents within a 50-metre radius of the bungee jumping site.&nbsp; So, if only three people are screaming at the time, it should be all right!&nbsp; And we have decided to allow reverse bungee jumping until 2 o'clock in the morning.&nbsp; So, we have made a small victory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you another example - home brewing of beer.&nbsp; Under the Customs Act, anyone who wants to brew beer must have a licence.&nbsp; The licence costs $43,200, because it is meant for Asia Pacific Breweries and people like<p align=left>Column: 1002<p> that.&nbsp; But, recently, an entrepreneur came along and wanted to sell kits to brew at home.&nbsp; So, he asked for exemption of the liquor duty and licence fee for people who brew beer at home for their own consumption.&nbsp; I suppose they are not allowed to invite their friends to a party!&nbsp; So, MOF had to review its rules and come up with a position.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first question was not the licence fee.&nbsp; It was whether to allow home brewing at all.&nbsp; And there were many possible objections.&nbsp; We consulted all the agencies and wrote a staff paper.&nbsp; There were concerns about smell, binge drinking, social disturbances to their neighbourhood, etc.&nbsp; And from MOF's parochial point of view, loss of tax revenue.&nbsp; If you keep your home brewery going all the year round and produce the maximum amount of beer, you can lose $1,000 of tax revenue per year per kit, at full capacity.&nbsp; But when we looked at the experience of other countries, we found that home brewing only appeals to a small group of hobbyists.&nbsp; It needs a lot of time, patience, effort and quite a lot of money.&nbsp; It is really for fun and, after a while, it is easier to just go and buy the can!&nbsp; So, we decided that we will not stand in the way of enterprise.&nbsp; Now, home brewers will enjoy a duty exemption on the beer they produce for personal consumption, and we will levy just a small licence fee of $100 for two years, just to know who is buying the kits and whether it is successful or not.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the point is not home-brewing.&nbsp; The point is that Government agencies have to make sensible judgements and relax their rules to facilitate enterprise.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;erred on the side of caution and conservatism, and we have often taken a "one-size-fits-all" regulatory approach.&nbsp; If we thought a particular activity poses risks, even if only to a small section of the population, then our instinct was to just disallow that activity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1003<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But increasingly, our approach should be to balance the risks and potential problems the activity might pose to society at large against the overriding need to encourage private enterprise and initiative.&nbsp; As long as it does not cause unmanageable problems or harm to others, I think our default position should be to allow this entrepreneurial activity with as few bureaucratic impediments as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Opportunities for SMEs and start-ups</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me talk about SMEs very briefly, because these are&nbsp;small companies but a big subject, and it will be discussed&nbsp;in the Committee of Supply further.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMEs are a key part of our economy.&nbsp; The Government will support SMEs where we can, but we cannot smother them either with too many rules or with too much help.&nbsp; Contrary to the popular perception, SMEs are not so badly off.&nbsp; They do get a fair share of business opportunities.&nbsp; For example, we made a sample of the small Government tenders which were awarded&nbsp;in FY 2002, of values up to $100,000.&nbsp; There were 404 tenders awarded.&nbsp; Of these, 70% went to companies with net assets which were less than $50,000, which are very small companies, and 90% went to companies with net assets of less than half a million dollars.&nbsp; And this does not include supplies procured through quotations or Government work performed by such SMEs through subcontracting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee suggested that the Government could help the SMEs by giving them non-strategic and non-critical Government projects.&nbsp; I think this is not right.&nbsp; Government projects must be<p align=left>Column: 1004<p> allocated through open tenders.&nbsp; We cannot exclude big companies from tendering because they are too efficient or too strong.&nbsp; If they offer me a good price, I have to take the good price.&nbsp; If they offer me better quality, I have to accept that.&nbsp; I&nbsp;cannot say, "No, you are too big.&nbsp; Only the little guys are allowed to play."&nbsp; This would only raise cost to the Government, lower efficiency and reduce the drive and enterprise of the SMEs themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right strategy is to help the SMEs upgrade their capabilities, improve their productivity and competitiveness, and venture abroad if they can.&nbsp; And we are doing a lot in this respect, which MTI will deal with in the Committee of Supply.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this Budget, we have granted a 3-year tax exemption for the first $100,000 earned by the start-ups.&nbsp; Miss Penny Low, Mr Ang Mong Seng, Mr Arthur Fong and several others have asked the Government to consider extending the tax exemption period.&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee further suggested that the Government grant the tax exemption from the first year of profit rather than the first year of operation.&nbsp; I have had a look at the data.&nbsp; Based on IRAS returns over the last six years, about one quarter of start-ups become profitable ever and, of those who do, most do so in their second year of operations.&nbsp; So, if you look at it, in the first year, hardly any are&nbsp;profitable.&nbsp; In&nbsp;the second year, a few are.&nbsp; The third year, about one quarter are profitable.&nbsp; Fourth year, also one quarter profitable.&nbsp; Fifth year, also one quarter profitable.&nbsp; I am not sure they are all the same companies in every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, by the third year, if they are going to make it, the chances are that they would have made it.&nbsp; So, I think three years&nbsp;are reasonable.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I will keep an open mind and consider whether to extend the length of the exemption after monitoring the results over the next few years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1005<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, even after the 3-year tax exemption period, small companies and start-ups will not get taxed at the full corporate tax rate on the first $100,000 of income because we have a partial tax exemption within our corporate tax structure.&nbsp; For the first $10,000 of chargeable income, there is a 75% discount.&nbsp; For the next $90,000 of chargeable income, there is a 50% discount.&nbsp; So,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>Mr Ang Mong Seng says "<I>san mian er jian</I>", that is, three exemptions and two reductions. This is even better than that.&nbsp; This is "<I>san mian chang jian</I>" - three exemptions, perpetual reductions.&nbsp; But, of course, after some time, you ask for more.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Enhancing competition</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me say something about enhancing competition.&nbsp; The Government will continue to divest its stakes in GLCs which are non-strategic or have no international potential. We have done our first review of corporate holdings for the Ministries and statutory boards. We have identified about 90 companies that are no longer relevant to the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten of them have since been divested. This is not counting the 12, which I listed in the Budget&nbsp;Statement, which was done by Temasek. We will divest the rest progressively, subject to the right market conditions.&nbsp; MOF will keep on reminding the Ministries to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the major GLCs, divesting them will not help the SMEs.&nbsp; The issue is not how SMEs can compete against the GLCs but rather whether they can hold their own against large companies. Whether or not the GLCs are divested, SMEs will still face the same competition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will continue to ensure that GLCs are not given unfair advantage.&nbsp; The Competition Law to be enacted next year will provide a level playing field for companies in Singapore.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1006<p> MTI will begin consultations on the draft in the next two to three months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann extols the virtues of competition but, at the same time, he blames excessive competition for over-capacity in the power industry, resulting in PowerSeraya retrenching its workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sin's statement could be misleading because as I have said, the power industry is a very complex one.&nbsp; A fairer, still not complete, explanation would go something like this.&nbsp; Technological advancement has led to the emergence of gas plants, which are much cheaper and cleaner to operate than steam plants.&nbsp; This has made our existing steam plants obsolete and expensive.&nbsp; The question is: what should the Government do?&nbsp; If we had done&nbsp;nothing, if we had allowed&nbsp;SingPower&nbsp;to continue to operate as a monopoly, chances are we would have continued with the old technology and just passed on the extra costs to consumers and businesses.&nbsp; Because there is no market test,&nbsp;it is a monopoly, whatever my costs, add the return, mark up, and pass on.&nbsp; But by restructuring the industry and introducing competition, we have forced generating companies to restructure, lower their costs and to adopt the new technology.&nbsp; In the transition period, we will have both steam and gas plants operating, contributing to excess capacity.&nbsp; But prices have come down.&nbsp; Some generating companies are taking&nbsp;a hit&nbsp;but from the point of view of the economy as a whole, we are deriving a benefit, and we are doing the right thing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I say in passing that Mr Sin Boon Ann raised many other issues in his speech, many of which I disagree with.&nbsp; But if I respond to all of them, I will have no time to respond to all the other MPs.&nbsp; So let me just say two things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he is wrong on the property market.&nbsp; He talked apocalyptically and<p align=left>Column: 1007<p> glibly about negative equity.&nbsp; But an MAS' study showed that less than 3% of private property owners were in negative equity.&nbsp; Negative equity means owing the bank more than the property is worth.&nbsp; As for HDB owners, the percentage is even lower.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is also wrong on healthcare, another complicated subject, but just one small example,&nbsp;we only have one gamma knife centre, and not two.&nbsp; I state&nbsp;this so that nobody thinks that because I did not counter Mr Sin's arguments, that means I agree with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I><B>Affordable healthcare for all</B></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Means testing</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that many MPs have supported the principle of means testing and&nbsp;agree that subsidies, whether for healthcare,&nbsp;education, housing or other living costs, should be targeted according to need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;also agree with Mr Loh Meng See, Mr Zainul Abidin and the others that we&nbsp;need to proceed carefully.&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong&nbsp;has&nbsp;suggested that MOH&nbsp;adopts a multi-tiered approach, rather than an all-or-nothing&nbsp;framework to determine the subsidy level, with an appeal&nbsp;mechanism for deserving cases.&nbsp; I think that is a workable pragmatic strategy. We have to make judgments. We have to look at many factors.&nbsp; It is not just&nbsp;his pay, it is not just&nbsp;his&nbsp;wealth.&nbsp; It is his family obligations, his family circumstances, his needs, his outlook.&nbsp; A judgment&nbsp;has to be made but&nbsp;we should avoid&nbsp;having a step function, where a small difference in the&nbsp;judgment makes a big difference in the subsidy&nbsp;which he gets.&nbsp; There has to be some smoothness in what he gets.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The step-down care sector and the primary care services, which means the<p align=left>Column: 1008<p> community hospitals, nursing homes and home nursing, where means testing has been running since July 2000, use a three-tier subsidy level.&nbsp; We have some experience doing this. We will continue to accumulate experience.&nbsp; I assure MPs that we will try and learn how it works in practice and we will consult extensively before settling on the rules for expanding means testing to other parts of the healthcare sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we&nbsp;target our medical subsidies at those in need, we will also need to ensure that healthcare remains affordable for the middle income group.&nbsp; Our current 3M health financing framework is quite sound - Medisave, MediShield and Medifund.&nbsp; Our Medisave is actually a very important part of this scheme.&nbsp; We introduced it in 1984. &nbsp;The amounts have been building up gradually.&nbsp; On average, Singaporeans are saving more than enough in their Medisave accounts to provide for their needs - themselves and their families.&nbsp; If we look at the CPF accounts, each year, contributions to Medisave amount to about $2.5 billion, while withdrawals amount to only about $1 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So for most Singaporeans, affordability is not a problem.&nbsp; The problem arises if&nbsp;you are unlucky, because not everybody has&nbsp;the same medical expenses.&nbsp; $1 billion is on average.&nbsp; But if&nbsp;you happen to have an accident or a serious illness requiring expensive treatment,&nbsp;you may be in trouble. So there is a problem.&nbsp; The solution to that is to make greater use of medical insurance, beyond MediShield, to cater for non-catastrophic illnesses, so as to stretch the Medisave dollar. It has to be properly designed - there must be co-payments, there must be deductibles.&nbsp; But I think with risk-pooling, with Medisave, we can make the Medisave dollar go further and we can lift the worry&nbsp;which many people have, that is, just in case, they have kidney disease&nbsp;or are incapacitated, who is going to look after them and how they are going to cover <p align=left>Column: 1009<p>this.&nbsp; This is something which MOH is studying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Education opportunity for all</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me talk about educational opportunities and university funding.&nbsp; Several MPs have asked how the review will affect students.&nbsp; Let me assure everybody again that nobody will be denied an educational opportunity which is appropriate to his talents and abilities.&nbsp; Meritocracy and full and equal opportunities are key tenets of our society, and always will be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Low Seow Chay today said that when he was a university student in 1969, he paid annual university fees of $600 at a time when the starting salary of graduates was $900 per month.&nbsp; So now that starting salaries are $1,500-$2,000, university fees should be lower than the starting salaries, but they are not.&nbsp; I think this is the wrong principle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low earned $900 as a starting salary at a time when only 4% of the cohort went to university.&nbsp; He was very privileged to go to university. Today, 21% enter university.&nbsp; So graduates no longer command as large a premium when they start work.&nbsp; Are they badly off?&nbsp; No. Are they as privileged as their previous generation?&nbsp; Neither.&nbsp; But the relativities have shifted.&nbsp; And because we have widened university education, we have allowed the economy to grow. Graduates are not poor,&nbsp;and I think we can no longer expect to say university fees should be lower than their starting salaries.&nbsp; Because even now, university fees are still small compared to their earning power.&nbsp; Even if&nbsp;you add up all the university fees for taking an engineering programme, let us say, $6,000 a year x 4 years is $24,000,&nbsp;it is one year of a starting salary.&nbsp; In fact, it is very affordable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the right principle to say fees must be lower than starting salaries. The<p align=left>Column: 1010<p> right principle is to relate fees to the cost of the university education and to the value of this university education to the individual over his working life.&nbsp; Here, I agree with Prof. Low that we should be looking at the cost of providing undergraduate education and separate out the cost of post-graduate education and the research institutes.&nbsp; In fact, that is how MOE does its sums.&nbsp; But even then,&nbsp;you must remember, since 1969, the number of undergraduates has gone up six-fold. The quality of university education has improved tremendously. The facilities have changed, the laboratories have changed, the quality of the staff we are looking for has gone up, and there are the opportunities to travel and link up with other institutions.&nbsp; Who is going to pay the cost of all these?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, the Government has paid three-quarters of the operating costs, plus all of the infrastructure costs. The undergraduate pays only 25% of the operating costs and that is just the operating costs of the undergraduate education.&nbsp; If, over the next few years, still more university students make it to university, and if we want to improve the quality of their education further, then we need to adjust this balance.&nbsp; It is not to put all the load on the student,&nbsp;but to shift the balance to something which is more sustainable.&nbsp; The Government will still account for a big part of the university costs through its subvention.&nbsp; But I think, proportionately, it should be a smaller part than now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr John Chen said that graduates pay higher income tax and therefore they benefit society more than the individual. Therefore, there is no need to charge them more when they go to university. He has a point.&nbsp; We need to pay for this university education and I suppose we could raise income taxes to meet the higher costs of more people going to university and more expensive per capita cost.&nbsp; But not all high income earners are <p align=left>Column: 1011<p>graduates. So why should a non-graduate who has done well pay more income tax to finance the education of&nbsp;graduates?&nbsp; He did not benefit,&nbsp;why should&nbsp;you tax him the same?&nbsp; But Dr John Chen has a point. If we follow Dr John Chen's argument, then we should have a graduate tax, which I think is what Mr Iswaran suggested and is similar to what the Australians do.&nbsp; We can consider this, although I am not absolutely sure&nbsp;Dr Chen would prefer it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will study this problem carefully.&nbsp; We are not making any sudden changes. We have said, no adjustments this year, and even if we have adjustments next year and beyond, this will be phased in gradually over several years. This is a long-term problem, not an immediate one.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would ensure affordable financing arrangements. There will be scholarships, bursaries and&nbsp;loans available to all students. The loan repayments will be reasonable. We are not out to bankrupt you, to squeeze you, or to profit from you.&nbsp; We just need to recover the costs, and you have a whole working life to pay back, and we will work out repayment terms so that you can afford to get married early, have a flat, have your babies, and not have to say,&nbsp;"I have to pay back my study loans, I cannot afford two babies."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang, of course, made a political point of this and accused the Government of intending to treat foreign students better than our local students when we revise the university fees.&nbsp; He has made up a fictitious scenario and twisted the facts. The Government will always treat Singaporeans better than foreigners.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;that was one of the principles when we talked about the baby procreation incentives, and&nbsp;one of the things which we are going to study as to <p align=left>Column: 1012<p>how we can make this distinction clearer.&nbsp; But as far as university education is concerned, the distinction is already there because under the Tuition Grant Scheme, foreign students pay 10% more than locals in school fees.&nbsp; If school fees go up for the locals, they are going to go up for the foreigners too.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are even a few foreigners who pay a 100% fee with no tuition grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked why they did that.&nbsp; The answer was:&nbsp; if you have a tuition grant, there is a three-year bond to work in Singapore.&nbsp; We do not give away our money for free and, least of all, do we give away money for foreigners at the expense of Singaporeans.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P><I><B>Raising families for our future</B></I><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Holistic approach, realistic expectations</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me talk about babies.&nbsp; More than any other issue, the topic of marriage and parenthood has dominated the last&nbsp;three days of discussion in this House.&nbsp; I am heartened by this because it shows that Members understand the seriousness of the problem.&nbsp; They have applied their minds to it and, in many cases,&nbsp;obviously their hearts as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many spoke with passion on this subject, not only the parents, but also the grandparents.&nbsp; Some devoted large parts of their speeches to analysing the problem and to suggesting ideas to tackle it.&nbsp; So, over the next few months, the Working Committee on Population will carefully consider all the views that have been put forward.&nbsp; I understand that Mrs Yu-Foo has added them altogether, and counted 50, and has given the list to Mr Lim Hng Kiang.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dr Amy Khor pointed out, most young Singaporeans want to get married.&nbsp; And most married couples want to have children.&nbsp; The trouble is not all the young Singaporeans&nbsp;get married and not all those who get married end up having<p align=left>Column: 1013<p> children.&nbsp; But, anyway, they do want to and this is an important starting point.&nbsp; Hence, the SDU and SDS provide match-making services, which are very popular, despite the fees that Dr Teo Ho Pin complained about.&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked SDS and SDU what the explanation was and they gave me two very good explanations.&nbsp; First, the fees are very low compared to the private sector because they charge $30-$150, whereas the private sector charges $700-$1,000.&nbsp; So it is a real bargain.&nbsp; In fact, Mr Inderjit Singh may accuse us of unfair competition one of these days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the second reason is from SDU's and SDS' experience, people who are prepared to pay a fee are much more serious in wanting to look for a partner than those who use the services because they are&nbsp;free.&nbsp; So I think that this is quite a good thing going on and we should not disturb it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's role is to foster a conducive environment and strengthen the support network to help Singaporeans fulfil their aspirations and to enjoy parenthood and family living.&nbsp; As I emphasised in my Budget Statement, the Government will take a holistic and coherent approach to this issue.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we have to be realistic in our expectations.&nbsp; Members have made many suggestions on how we can create a pro-natal environment.&nbsp; They cover everything under the sun:&nbsp; reduce stress in school; 5-day week in the civil service; different permutations of maternity or paternity leave; flexi-work arrangements; more subsidies for childcare; reduce foreign maid levy; reduce abortion rate; make adoption easier; ensure gender equality; equal medical benefits for men and women in the civil service; grant citizenship by descent to children born overseas to women citizens; make boys and girls spend time together through national service; and many more.&nbsp; And even this&nbsp;is not an exhaustive list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1014<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will do its best to reduce the burden and anxieties which families face in having and bringing up children.&nbsp; But the Government cannot solve all of life's problems.&nbsp; The package will be holistic, but it must also be realistic.&nbsp; We would like people to get married and have families, even if we have not succeeded in making Singapore perfect in every respect.&nbsp; But, finally, at the end of the day, if somebody still says, "I have this unhappiness and you have not solved it.&nbsp; Therefore, I am unhappy; therefore I have no babies."&nbsp; Well, I will try my best, but I would not always be able to solve the problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should not focus exclusively on any single measure or solution.&nbsp; Different parents have very different needs.&nbsp; Different women have very different needs.&nbsp; That is one reason why there are so many different suggestions.&nbsp; So our package must take a balanced approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hesitate to go into all of these suggestions.&nbsp; As Ms Indranee Rajah reminded us, the more I speak on the suggestions put forward, the greater the risk that the women may hear me differently and, maybe, even the men!&nbsp; So Minister Lim Hng Kiang and his committee will carefully evaluate all of them, but let me just comment briefly on three of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, citizenship by descent to children born overseas to women citizens.&nbsp; We will do this.&nbsp; We will amend the Constitution so that children born overseas to female Singaporeans will be of the same status as children born overseas to male Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs will elaborate on this in the Committee of Supply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the 5-day work week for the civil service.&nbsp; The Government has said "no" many times before.&nbsp; But many Members have argued that this is important to families.&nbsp; And I can tell you that many civil servants have told me that<p align=left>Column: 1015<p> it is important to them.&nbsp; So the Working Committee on Population will study it carefully, taking all the other suggestions, and taking into consideration the need to maintain service standards in the civil service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, equalisation of medical benefits for men and women in the civil service.&nbsp;&nbsp; This also has been raised in this House many times, especially by our women MPs.&nbsp; On this too, the Government has said "no" many times.&nbsp; In fact, my answer is already drafted for tomorrow's Committee of Supply. But in the spirit of leaving no stone unturned, and never saying never, I will also refer this to the Working Committee to consider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I would like to add that couples wanting to have babies should not wait till the announcement of the package in August.&nbsp; I have heard of some women who&nbsp;are planning to&nbsp;have a baby, but have decided to hold off trying until the incentives are announced, in case the baby is born too early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Iswaran has suggested that I backdate the procreation benefits.&nbsp; I do not think we need to go that far.&nbsp; August is not too long away, to be exact, it is less than&nbsp;nine months away.&nbsp; So the Government has decided that the procreation benefits will take effect once we settle and announce them in August.&nbsp; So, it is definitely not too early for all couples to start trying for babies now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, ultimately, it is our attitudes and values that we need to reflect on and to shift.&nbsp; We can have the most family-friendly practices enshrined in law, but if social attitudes do not support parenthood and families, and if couples do not see having babies and bringing up families as one of their personal priorities, our birth rates will continue to languish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1016<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tan Soo Khoon mentioned how Italy has a generous maternity leave scheme.&nbsp; Well, we have studied Italy.&nbsp; I am told that although the legislation allows working women&nbsp;five months of maternity leave, many do not take it.&nbsp; Our study team went there and they were told by unions and academics that some companies require their employees to sign undated resignation letters when they join.&nbsp; And then when the female employee becomes pregnant and applies for maternity leave, date applied, contract terminated.&nbsp; The women sign the letters because they need the work.&nbsp; But then they 'vote with their wombs' and forgo having more than one child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that is why the challenge cannot be solved just by Government measures.&nbsp; We need the support of employers, unions, and society as a whole to help our fellow Singaporeans have children and to raise babies.&nbsp; The decisions to marry, have children, and raise a family are personal ones.&nbsp; We are guided by our values and attitudes towards life.&nbsp; Maternity leave, flexi-work arrangements, financial incentives and all the other measures, 50 or more, influence these decisions, but they are not the decisive factors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the many MPs who have said that this is an issue of the heart, of emotions, not one that can be solved by financial incentives alone.&nbsp; They spoke eloquently and with feeling about the joys of parenthood.&nbsp; As a father, I share their sentiments, because ultimately it is for the love of children that we have children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So our values and priorities in life will need to shift.&nbsp; Couples will need to realise that while it is important to pursue a career, it cannot be the only thing in life.&nbsp; It is good to go on holidays, three, four or five times a year, as some young people wrote in the <I>Straits Times,</I> but that is not the only thing in life.&nbsp; We become whole<p align=left>Column: 1017<p> through our families, and society must not only recognise this but embrace it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women are caught at the heart of the many difficult trade-offs involved in having children and raising families.&nbsp; The women MPs have all reminded us that what we need are mindset changes - in the home, the workplace, and society at large.&nbsp; The challenge of parenthood is one where both husbands and wives must shoulder together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon said -&nbsp;this year, I agree with most of Mr Tan Soo Khoon's speech -&nbsp;the question of whether to raise a family is one that every Singaporean will have to seriously ask himself or herself.&nbsp; And the answers that each one of us gives, taken together, will decide what kind of Singapore&nbsp;this is going to be.&nbsp; Is it going to be a young vibrant, forward-looking society, or an aging self-centred declining society?&nbsp; It is not just about building a critical mass of people to ensure the security and economic vitality of Singapore, or even a question of who is going to look after us when we grow old.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about the values which will shape the society of the future, and what we ourselves will leave behind when we pass on.&nbsp; Because having children is believing in the future.&nbsp; It is about setting aside our own comforts and conveniences for their sake.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same values that make us good parents - sacrifice, selflessness, confidence, and resilience - that will also make us a strong society.&nbsp; And that, more than anything else, is why we must help Singaporeans to raise families for the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Creating a future of opportunity</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang Kai Yuen spoke passionately about how Singapore could be a land of opportunity.&nbsp; We must grow by 7%-8% per year, grow our population to 8 million, and exploit our strengths as a safe and peaceful oasis in a world of turbulence.&nbsp; He described how impressed he was by <p align=left>Column: 1018<p>the United Arab Emirates - he did not say, but I think he was referring specifically to Dubai - doing this in the Gulf, and he asked: could Singapore do the same?&nbsp; I say, why not?&nbsp; Let us do it.&nbsp; We have many things going for us.&nbsp; We have a good market catchment, especially the growing wealth in India and China.&nbsp; We have a safe, clean and green environment and a cosmopolitan culture which welcomes foreigners.&nbsp; Our arts, leisure and entertainment scene is now much livelier.&nbsp; Even our old Parliament House has become an Arts House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure we can achieve and sustain 7%-8% growth.&nbsp; We are past that stage of rapid expansion.&nbsp; Also, I do not think that reaching 8 million population in 15 years is realistic because it means growing our population by more than a quarter million per year.&nbsp; It is not possible.&nbsp; But we must do our utmost to grow our economy, and if we can make 3%-5% growth per year,&nbsp;and more in good years, then we will progressively change the face of Singapore.&nbsp; We should also work hard to grow our population so that we can come closer to Hong Kong or Switzerland which are both 7.3-7.4 million and have that critical mass and that verve.&nbsp; And we are a safe and peaceful oasis in a turbulent world, a special red dot that is a haven for Singaporeans and foreigners alike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang described how Dubai is building Palm Island, a beautiful resort attracting foreigners from all over the world, buying beachfront properties and building homes.&nbsp; I think the PM on his recent Middle-eastern trip visited it.&nbsp; Dr Wang referred to Sentosa Cove, suggesting that we should&nbsp;do the same.&nbsp; In fact, we will do the same.&nbsp; We have decided to allow foreigners to buy landed properties at Sentosa Cove, for precisely the reasons that Dr Wang has argued.&nbsp; This is a special arrangement for Sentosa Cove.&nbsp; It does not apply to the rest of Singapore.&nbsp; BG George Yeo will tell you <p align=left>Column: 1019<p>more about the plans in MTI's Committee of Supply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our future is full of promise.&nbsp; As we connect ourselves to the global economy, as we build a cosmopolitan, open society that is more welcoming to diversity, we will preserve a cohesive society with strong social bonds, where the able and well-off care for and help the weak and the poor, and where the family unit remains as our foundation and our future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Budget continues what we started off doing in the Economic Review Committee - to promote industries, to promote entrepreneurship and encourage restructuring; and to create a nimble and flexible economy, with enterprising people that can take advantage of the rise of Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as we restructure our economy, we also focus on the long term social challenges.&nbsp; We must rise to these challenges to preserve the vitality of Singapore for many years to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let us pull together as one to make Singapore a Land of Opportunity:&nbsp; opportunity for each person to be the best that he can be; the opportunity for businesses to start, grow and thrive; the opportunity for parents to raise their children in a safe and secure environment; and the opportunity for all Singaporeans to build a Singapore they can be proud of as a country and a home.&nbsp; [<I>Applause</I>.]</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head B of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The criminal prosecutorial system in Singapore has worked reasonably well.&nbsp; There is, however, room for improvement.&nbsp; The process involves investigation by the Police and other appropriate enforcement agencies like the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, the Central Narcotics Bureau, the Customs Department, etc, once there is a first information report lodged by a complainant or victim of crime to any of these Government authorities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the investigation is more or less completed, the Attorney-General's Chambers' Crime Division is consulted, that is, the Public Prosecutor or his deputies called Deputy Public Prosecutors (DPPs) and they will consider the merits and demerits of the case and decide whether to charge the accused in court by giving his fiat or not to take any further action because there is no <I>prima facie</I> case or sufficient evidence to get a conviction in a court of law.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, it would appear the accused has no right to see or obtain legal advice from his lawyer.

Therefore, all investigation papers should be made available to defence or to its counsel, especially cautioned statements and long statements,&nbsp;under section 122(5) and 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code.&nbsp; These are for statements of the accused.&nbsp; Cautioned statements of the accused are made available upon request and upon payment of&nbsp;a fee.&nbsp; Long statements are never or seldom given.&nbsp; They are often used to impeach the credit of the accused or witnesses for the defence but never the prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; This may be unfair and might affect the quality of truth.&nbsp; Why must one pay for his own statement?&nbsp; Cost must be reduced.&nbsp; When such statements are given to the accused or to his counsel, he&nbsp;would be able to <p align=left>Column: 1024<p>decide at an early stage whether or not to plead guilty or claim trial.&nbsp;This would save money, cost and time for the Police, prosecutorial court and related parties.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A Judge holds office till 65 years of age (unless extended). There is security of tenure and he can only be removed under Article 98 of the Constitution after a proper inquiry <p align=left>Column: 1027<p>by a Tribunal appointed by the President of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the general public expects, and the practice of good governance requires, that there is greater transparency in how the different branches of the Organs of State operate. These Organs are accountable to the citizens of Singapore and, inter alia, Parliament must be the main vehicle to ensure this by questioning policies and suggesting improvements. What then can Parliament recommend as far as the Judiciary is concerned?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important for Parliament and the citizens to know the scheme of remuneration of all people employed by the various Organs of State, including those of the Judiciary. The monies paid to have a Judiciary are public funds and the public has the right to know whether money is well spent. I am sure the Government is careful and prudent about monies being utilised for the Judiciary. What may be lacking in the public arena is sufficient information being disseminated about these matters? What are the criteria used to assess the Judges' performance, independence, competency and value for money, and who decides these? Is there a structured salary scheme, increments, bonus scheme, etc, how much is paid out per year, in terms of salary and bonus? The salaries of Judges in the 1980s were much less than in the 1990s and 2000s. Who decides this? Is there a recommending body of panel of Judges, Legal Service personnel, Cabinet Ministers or any other Committees? What are the rules applicable? Perhaps more information could be disseminated to Parliament and the citizenry so that the informed public could appreciate these matters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is payment of bonus to Judges, does the granting of bonus in any way affect the independent thinking of <p align=left>Column: 1028<p>the Judges - could they be wittingly or unwittingly enticed in subtle ways into thinking along certain lines? Is it good to have the bonus scheme for Judges? Are we paying Judges too little or too much? And therefore why the need for bonus? In the long term, would it be possible, like some other Government matters and like arbitration matters, to privatise the dispensing of cases and justice and perhaps save costs? Could we have a pool of legal talent from the Judiciary, Legal Service, practising advocates and solicitors, law lecturers, professors and legal experts from regional and international community to form a "Panel of Judiciary" from whom court cases could be handled and heard in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also would like to ask, related to this, about the new Supreme Court Building. What is the state of readiness of that building and what are the costs involved? And secondly, what is going to happen to the Subordinate Courts Building at Havelock Road? Will it be replaced soon? What is the long-term plan - will it be housed near the Supreme Court, if it is going to be moved?</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>  	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Judicial Renewal</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Law whether there is in place any policy or system to ensure renewal of High Court Judges. According to the Constitution, a Judge of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice, is to hold office till he is 65 years old or up to six months thereafter, as the President shall approve. I also understand that the President has powers to appoint the Chief Justice or a Judge for such period as he deems fit after consulting the Prime Minister. It seems that there are instances where a High Court Judge who is way beyond the usual age of retirement is still required to serve on the Bench. Take, for instance, our honourable Chief Justice, he is now 78<p align=left>Column: 1029<p> years old and has even gone for heart surgery. How much longer does the Minister expect him to carry on? Should we not have a proper succession plan so that our Judges will be able to enjoy their retirement after serving the nation?</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Access to and Cost of Litigation</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:&nbsp;</B> Sir, on access to and cost of litigation.&nbsp; The administration of justice in Singapore requires that there be easy access to justice with minimal costs and this must be the cornerstone of our legal system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, in Singapore, those involved with litigation in court argue that access to justice&nbsp;in Singapore is getting more expensive, especially in civil court cases. The court filing fees, the fairly recently introduced electronic filing fees and other forms of payment for court records have increased especially in the last two to three years. For instance, under the Rules of Court, filing&nbsp;a Writ of Summons before 2000 was $150. Since around December 2002, it is $500 for claims below $1 million and $1,000 for claims above $1 million. Filing a Memorandum of Appearance was $20 and, today, it is $120. Hearing fees per day (except the first three days because of the SARS problem that we had last year) since June 2003 is $6,000 with value up to $1 million and $9,000 with value exceeding $1 million per day, and it is at a reducing scale thereafter. Before 1990, it was free of charge. Filing of a Petition of Probate or Petition for Letters of Administration was $150. Today, it is $1,000 (for estate exceeding $3 million). That is a lot of money for lay persons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this connection, it is very commendable that the Law Society of Singapore and the Ministry of Law, together with the Supreme Court Registrar, are assisting by providing lawyers to do <I>pro bono</I> work and in reducing costs in criminal matters, but not<p align=left>Column: 1030<p> civil, by providing free or reduced costs. Volunteer lawyers from the Bar must be commended for doing voluntary service. The Legal Aid Bureau must also be commended for providing legal aid in some sectors of civil law. I hope more lawyers, especially the younger ones, would come forward to help in giving free legal aid to our poor people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I presume, Sir, the courts are trying hard to reduce costs. I do hope the priority is to reduce costs and not to recoup the expenses in introducing and maintaining our electronic filing system. We should do a study and review all these escalating costs so that litigants would have cheaper means of access to justice.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar):</B> Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken. Having listened to what you have said about compliance with time, I worry how many of the points that have been raised can be answered during the short period. But if I do not answer all the points, or I do not answer all the points satisfactorily, I hope the Member would feel free to file Questions for Oral Answer or take it up under the Ministry of Law.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me, first, take the points raised by Mr Chandra Mohan, who raised several points about our system of appointment of Judges, whether&nbsp;we can privatise, whether&nbsp;we can have a panel, and so on. My answer is that he knows that in our system in Singapore, the method of appointment of Judges follows the provisions and system to be found in many Commonwealth countries. But I agree with him that&nbsp;we can have any kind of system as&nbsp;we can think of. In the world there are many systems -&nbsp;the Americans have a particular procedure, the Europeans have other procedures. But, at the end of the day, what is important is the integrity, honesty and incorruptibility of the total system and of the people who operate the system, not only in the Judiciary but of the <p align=left>Column: 1031<p>Government and other agencies in their relationship with the Judiciary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our system has worked. It has worked satisfactorily and has gained the kudos and credit from international circles and international ranking agencies.&nbsp;The Member knows that the agencies had given high marks of our Judiciary. We&nbsp;have ranked tops in most of the international surveys and Asia Pacific Legal&nbsp;said in their survey: "Singapore courts are both highly expert and untainted by corruption. Singapore courts have a good reputation for both impartiality and efficiency." So, yes, we can devise new systems but I would ask: is it necessary?&nbsp; No, because the system works.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to privatising cases, that is an interesting proposition. But it is one that has considerable implications. If he meant&nbsp;to say that some of the workload can be reduced by having arbitration of cases, I would agree, because we do want to position Singapore as an international arbitration centre. And if parties choose not to litigate but send the cases to arbitration, they are perfectly free to do so.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>  	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>In fact, we&nbsp;encourage arbitration, both domestic and international.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the new Supreme Court, I do not have all the figures with me on the cost but, as to when it is going to be ready, I believe the construction is slated to be completed in 2005.&nbsp; I do not have the details of the construction cost, but I do know that substantial savings were made after a very careful review of the procedures and, as a result <p align=left>Column: 1032<p>of&nbsp;the cost-cutting exercise, I think&nbsp;6.7% or some $17 million of the construction cost was saved.&nbsp; The plans for the new Subordinate Courts have been put on hold as a result of the cost-cutting exercise.&nbsp; They have&nbsp;been shelved for the time being.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang referred to the system of renewal of judges.&nbsp; He has two general points.&nbsp; The first point is that there should be&nbsp;continual renewal.&nbsp; In fact, the Chief Justice is taking the leadership in proposing to the Prime Minister outstanding lawyers from the practitioners as well as the Legal Service who have done excellently in private practice,&nbsp;the Legal Service or&nbsp;in the Subordinate Courts.&nbsp; As a result, over recent years, from 1997,&nbsp;six or so Judicial Commissioners have been appointed, and all of them, if you ask members of the legal profession, would be recognised as outstanding legal talents.&nbsp; He mentioned the Chief Justice, that he had heart surgery and so on.&nbsp; I know that the Prime Minister is satisfied that the Chief Justice is medically fit, otherwise the Prime Minister would not have recommended to the President to have the Chief Justice's appointment renewed after he had reached retirement age.&nbsp; Why has the Prime Minister advised the President to renew the Chief Justice's appointment?&nbsp; The answer is simple:&nbsp; because he has done an excellent job and&nbsp;has transformed the Singapore Judiciary really to what it is today.&nbsp; And I would advise Mr Low Thia Khiang to read what the Senior Minister said in his book "From Third World to First":</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yong Pung How turned out to be an outstanding Chief Justice.&nbsp; He gave leadership to the judges and set a high tone for the Bar.&nbsp; By 1999, the reputation of our courts brought visits by judges and Chief Justices from developing as well as developed countries to study his reorganisation ... The World Bank recommended the Singapore system, both at High Court and Subordinate Court levels, for other countries to learn from."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So long as he is able to continue doing this excellent job, I am not surprised that the Prime Minister had recommended that<p align=left>Column: 1033<p> the Chief Justice continues.&nbsp; But let me say that Mr Low Thia Khiang should look at other jurisdictions like the US Supreme Court where the average age of the judges is 70 years, and their Chief Justice is 80 years old.&nbsp; By comparison, our Chief Justice is quite young.&nbsp; But the point is that there is renewal and self-renewal.&nbsp; The average age of our Bench in the Supreme Court is 55.8 years, compared to 70 in the&nbsp;US, 62 in Canada, and 64 in Australia.&nbsp; So, we are doing quite well.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</B> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</I>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of $89,476,670 for Head E ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of $167,884,300 for Head E ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.</p></P></span></div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--TITLE_NAME:HEAD R - MINISTRY OF LAW--><p align=left>Column:1033<p></span>			 </span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Head R - Ministry of Law</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> The Chairman:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Head R -&nbsp;Ministry of&nbsp;Law.&nbsp; Assoc.

While we applaud the extension of various tax incentives, we know that these will not be sufficient.&nbsp; Singapore is still at the early stages of building up a knowledge economy and we need to put many more supporting structures in place, one of which is the capabilities of the intellectual property law regime.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister had previously announced that there will be improvements made to the IP law regime.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1035<p> I would like to know how far these improvements have gone and whether we can expect more improvements to come.&nbsp; The DPM and Minister for Finance's Budget speech mentioned the importance of FTAs in helping Singapore businesses make inroads into key markets like the US and Japan.&nbsp; The US-Singapore FTA also contains a very substantial IP chapter.&nbsp; Singapore is of course at a very different stage of IP development compared to countries like the US.&nbsp; Our businesses have just recovered from difficult times, and they may not be ready enough to take advantage of IP while avoiding many of the legal problems that may arise.&nbsp;

How many persons have been made bankrupt?&nbsp; Of these, how many were&nbsp;made bankrupt&nbsp;because they had failed in business, and how many&nbsp;had been so because of poor personal financial management?&nbsp; Has the legislation been able to differentiate between those who take business risks which subsequently failed, and those who simply overspent?&nbsp; Is it time to review and refine the legislation so that we can help Singaporeans who do want to be active in entrepreneurship and so on but who unfortunately failed from those who simply take advantage of the liberal bankruptcy laws and overspend?&nbsp;

It had led to a steady increase of bankruptcy cases in Singapore.&nbsp; While some were declared bankrupt because of genuine business failures, there&nbsp;were also those who became undischarged bankrupts for living beyond their means.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my MPS sessions, I came across a number of undischarged bankrupt cases related to the use of credit card facilities.&nbsp; One particular case involved a resident who owed&nbsp;close to $80,000 from seven credit card companies.&nbsp; He earned about $3,500 a month before the economic downturn.&nbsp; With such income, how could he be allowed to have seven credit cards and accumulated close to $80,000 liability?&nbsp; Now, he gets only $1,500 a month and he has chosen bankruptcy rather than paying the banks.&nbsp; There are many bankruptcy cases I have read in the newspapers involving professionals, celebrities and executives.&nbsp; There was&nbsp;this very well-known personality who owed $300,000 to a stockbroking firm when the share market crashed.&nbsp; The said celebrity has conveniently self-petitioned for bankruptcy, continues with normal lifestyle and career, and makes some payments and waits for three or more years for a discharge order.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the remisier who had handled the transactions and who had failed to make good was sacked and declared a bankrupt.&nbsp; He lost everything, including his social standing.&nbsp; Yet, the bankrupt concerned continues living a normal life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, is it true that only 10% of bankruptcy cases are due to business failures?&nbsp; If it is so, indeed it is alarming,<p align=left>Column: 1037<p> as the remaining 90% are for other reasons, most of which could be due to their living less than desired lifestyles.&nbsp; Is there a way whereby these people can be prevented from seeking refuge under the bankruptcy law without having to take responsibility for their actions?&nbsp; In this connection, I think there is a need to further refine the existing bankruptcy law to prevent this abuse.&nbsp; I would be grateful if the Minister could comment on this.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Let me say that we have excellent teams to deal with these issues, whether it is the Pedra Branca issue&nbsp;before the ICJ or reclamation before the International&nbsp;Tribunal&nbsp;for the Law of the Sea.&nbsp; Not only&nbsp;the AG's Chambers have a specialist unit in their International Affairs Division, but&nbsp;they have also enlisted the services of international lawyers and experts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point I want to make is that to deal with these international cases, we not only need just good legal minds, but we also need the services of an array of people in other areas, ie,&nbsp;experts in&nbsp;allied subjects. For reclamation, we will need experts, for example,&nbsp;currents velocity and so on.&nbsp; Thirdly, it is not just the Ministry of Law,&nbsp;Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Attorney-General's Chambers, but many Government agencies have to be involved.&nbsp; I am glad<p align=left>Column: 1040<p> to say that, having observed this first-hand, I am very satisfied with the way in which the different Government agencies are pulling together.&nbsp; If I may give an example.&nbsp; In the preparation&nbsp;for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) when Malaysia took us to international litigation on our reclamation, there was a true team Singapore effort by all the different agencies.&nbsp; The Attorney-General's Chambers, the Ministry of Law, the Ministry of National Development, URA, ENV and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs worked very closely as a team in the national interest.&nbsp; Prof. Tommy Koh, as we know, acted as the Agent before the Tribunal.&nbsp; Our Attorney-General personally represented Singapore, backed by an able team of lawyers.&nbsp; And now&nbsp;Second Deputy Secretary in MND, Mrs Cheong Koon Hean, acted as the Advocate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we have never hesitated to use the services of well-known international lawyers and experts.&nbsp; I should add that we also plan ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is right that we must develop the expertise in this area, and Attorney-General's Chambers' International Affairs Department does that. But there is also scope for other agencies, like the Faculty of Law.&nbsp; I know they have been improving their international law capabilities and competence&nbsp;and more subjects are being taught in that area.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that a specialised Master of Laws degree in International and Comparative Law is being offered in the Faculty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To sum up, I am satisfied that the Government, through the AG and other agencies, are fully equipped to deal with the two current issues and we will have the capability to deal with any other future international legal litigation when it comes up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On intellectual property, I take Prof. Chin's point that it is important to put in place capabilities to help our companies <p align=left>Column: 1041<p>create and exploit IP.&nbsp; That is, in fact, the key priority of the Intellectual Property Office&nbsp;of Singapore (IPOS) which has organised many events to deepen the business community's appreciation of IP issues.&nbsp; It has partnered relevant bodies to bring across customised IP messages to different audiences.&nbsp; These partners include the Singapore Business Federation, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, European Patent Office, Japan Patent Office.&nbsp; The whole idea of this is to conduct many seminars, some 33 or so seminars and discussions, and they have been able to reach out to more than 3,000 people.&nbsp; I should also add that the IP Academy was launched last year. This was very timely because we have been able to train IT professionals and businessmen. They have conducted some 18 or so training programmes, which have covered over 1,400 participants. And to reach out to the younger group, IPOS targets educational institutions and has conducted some 60 events&nbsp;with secondary schools and polytechnics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Chin&nbsp;has made an important point in asking whether we take into account Singapore's stage of development when we draft legislation or enhance existing IP legislation. The answer is yes, we do. We recognise that, precisely because of the recent difficult conditions,&nbsp;our businesses may not be fully able to invest in building up their IP capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, we have to recognise that we operate in a very globalised economy and our businesses rely heavily on the external markets.&nbsp; Many of these markets&nbsp; have developed sophisticated IP regimes and their companies employ very savvy IP strategies. Therefore, to succeed, Sir, Singapore companies must be able to operate in these countries which are very advanced in their stage of IP development, for example, United States.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1042<p>It represents an important market for many of our companies and to succeed in the US, they have no choice but&nbsp;learn how to navigate the IP regime in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is&nbsp;a key priority for IPOS.&nbsp; It is because some of these companies may not be familiar to do what is necessary to protect and exploit the intellectual assets that IPOS formed an IP taskforce to help them understand how the field of IP is evolving and how they can take advantage of upcoming enhancements through Singapore's IP regime.&nbsp;&nbsp; The IP taskforce comprises business associations, such as the Association of Small and Medium Enterprise, the Singapore Business Federation and other organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the enhancement to the IP regime which I have&nbsp;mentioned, they will be introduced in this House in the coming months.&nbsp; I will not go into detail right now but to give you a few examples.&nbsp; One, we will strengthen our patent regime to protect bio-inventions and related R&amp;D, specifically&nbsp;our patent legislation for bio-inventions like pharmaceuticals will be strengthened to recognise the significant investment and efforts required to develop pharmaceutical products.&nbsp; Also, we will encourage companies to explore more innovative ways to distinguish their products and their brands. For example, I am sure many of us recognise familiar sounds, such as Nokia's -&nbsp;which we occasionally&nbsp;hear in this Chamber -&nbsp;and Yahoo Yodel.&nbsp; These are examples of sound marks which are another form of trademark.&nbsp; We intend to table amendments to our law to give recognition to distinctive non-visual marks which will include sound marks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On bankruptcy, Sir, I understand the points that Prof. Chin and Mr Yatiman have made. But before I go into our approach on bankrupticies, they asked for an update on bankruptcies.&nbsp; Sir, as at December 2003, we have about 18,600 undischarged bankrupts in Singapore.&nbsp; Mr <p align=left>Column: 1043<p>Yatiman is quite correct. Statistics from 1996 show that some 90% of the bankruptcies from that period onwards are consumer bankrupticies arising mainly from the use of credit cards or credit facilities.&nbsp; The balance 10% are business bankruptcies. The reasons for the bankruptcies of different individuals are not easy to generalise and I would not conclude, as Mr Yatiman suggests, that all this is because of less than desirable lifestyle.&nbsp; Different people have different problems.&nbsp; Yes, some have not been able to manage their affairs and some have over-spent, and so on.&nbsp; I do not know about the example when he asked the question how an individual, earning $3,500, has so many credit cards and&nbsp;can chalk up $80,000 or so.&nbsp; We will have to ask him, and his creditors will be better able to explain.&nbsp; But hopefully, with the setting up of the Credit Bureau, financial institutions can make better decisions in future on&nbsp;whether to extend credit or not to individuals and how much credit to give.&nbsp; Also, I cannot off-hand tell him about the case of the celebrity, a professional whom he mentioned.&nbsp; If he wishes to pursue that, he can deal with that by filing a Question here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thrust of what Prof. Chin and Mr Yatiman have said really raises the question whether we need to change our bankruptcy law. I do not think it is a question of amending the bankruptcy law.&nbsp; It is how we administer the bankruptcy laws, ie, what sort of policies.&nbsp; Let me say that our approach to bankruptcies is to try to strike a balance between satisfying the legitimate interest of investors and creditors who naturally want to recover debts owed to them and, on the other hand, ensuring that we do not stifle entrepreneurship.&nbsp; It is a delicate balance between the interest of society in allowing bankrupts a second chance and&nbsp;the creditors who like a robust system to ensure maximum repayment.&nbsp; Of course,<p align=left>Column: 1044<p> too liberal a bankruptcy regime will erode creditors' right whereas too rigid a regime will prevent bankrupts from making a fresh start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; What I want to stress is that our system does not allow any bankrupts an automatic free passage out of bankruptucy. The Official Assignee has the discretion to discharge only deserving bankrupts who have cooperated fully with him.&nbsp; We do treat cooperative bankrupts differently from those who are not cooperative.&nbsp; That must be so.&nbsp; So we have moved away sometime ago from the one-size-fits-all approach to bankruptcy administration.&nbsp; We categorise bankrupts who are cooperative and have a certain track, which we call the "green zone"</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Yes, we recognise there is a rising trend in the number of debtors applying to the courts, on their own accord, to declare themselves bankrupt.&nbsp; Many of these self-petition bankrupts, Sir, act under the mistaken, and it is a mistaken, impression that by declaring themselves as bankrupts they would not have to repay their debts and would get an automatic discharge after three years.&nbsp; Let me say that this is not the case and the Official Assignee always makes it a point to let those who approach the Official Assignee with such an intention that he disabuses them of it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to the legal profession on the comments made by<p align=left>Column: 1045<p> Prof. Chin and Mr Chandra Mohan.&nbsp; On errant lawyers, I fully share the concerns of Prof. Chin.&nbsp; Here, I want to say that I fully agree with the concerns of the Chief Justice made in his remarks at the opening of the Legal Year, about lawyers absconding with clients' money.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, when we view the number of people involved, in the context of the total number of lawyers in the profession, one could say that it is a small minority,&nbsp;and it is a small minority.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, this small minority gives the entire profession a very bad name and public trust and confidence in the legal profession is undermined.&nbsp; So, there is a public interest which is very important to protect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Chief Justice, I prefer that the Law Society takes decisive measures to deal with this.&nbsp; I think it is better that the Society takes such sensible and responsible preventive measures instead of the Government having to step in and legislate, which we will, if the need arises and if the Society and the profession themselves fail to do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I am glad, and I support the efforts of the Law Society to curb this problem.&nbsp; You have read in the newspapers that the Law Society would have enacted measures last year, if not for opposition from a small group.&nbsp; But the Law Society now has, in fact, settled on the amendments to the Solicitors' Accounts Rules.&nbsp; They were approved by the Chief Justice on 3rd March 2004 and the Society will gazette the amendments to come into force on 1st April 2004.&nbsp; I will not go into the details of the scheme which has been publicised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say I also had a working lunch recently with the President of the Law Society and its key council members.&nbsp; They are clearly concerned with the problem, and I believe that they know that the profession itself has to take the lead in policing such delinquent lawyers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1046<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to Prof. Chin's suggestion of doing another study, we have just done a comprehensive study on the legal profession and I do not think it is a great mystery as to why lawyers are leaving the legal profession.&nbsp; I touched on it last year.&nbsp; Various reasons were given - stress, they want something else, they want to do non-legal work, and so on.&nbsp; Many of the factors why they leave are not peculiar to the legal profession.&nbsp; It is reflective of modern Singapore.&nbsp; It affects other sectors of work and it&nbsp;is also reflective of the younger generation where changing a job after a while is nothing unusual.&nbsp; But we must ensure that there is a critical&nbsp;core of good legal talent in the legal profession.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Chin has asked how we can assist lawyers in weathering the storm of fiercer competition.&nbsp; I mentioned last year that we have accepted the recommendations of the Legal Services Working Group, chaired&nbsp;by Mr&nbsp;Shanmugam and Solicitor-General, Mr Chan Seng Onn.&nbsp; My Ministry oversees and coordinates the implementation of the Working Group's recommendations through a Legal Services Inter-agency Committee.&nbsp; This&nbsp;Inter-Agency Committee has mapped out a 3-pronged strategy to drive the development of the Legal Services sector.&nbsp; I should mention that, first, we intend to promote Singapore as an alternative dispute resolution centre in the region, focusing primarily on international arbitration.&nbsp; Second, to develop capability through&nbsp;improving the provision of continuing legal education.&nbsp; This, of course, the Law Society and the profession must take the lead.&nbsp; Third, to market our legal services abroad and to enlarge the playing field for our lawyers.&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 1047<p>think this is one of the points touched by Mr Chandra Mohan.&nbsp; We will do our best to create as many&nbsp;opportunities as possible for our lawyers, but the lawyers and law firms also have to do their part in promoting and selling their services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the final point,&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan refers to section 38(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act.&nbsp; Many were not in this House when that section was amended in 1986.&nbsp; Let me recall that&nbsp;in 1986, we amended the Legal Profession Act (section 38(1)(c)) to make clear that where the section said that the Law Society is to assist the Government - one of the functions is to assist the Government -&nbsp;in all matters affecting legislation,&nbsp;we made it clear that it is legislation submitted to it.&nbsp; And that amendment was, in fact, restoring the language which had been there previously.&nbsp; Why did we amend in 1986?&nbsp; We did it because the then Law Society Council engaged in politicking and confronting the Government under the guise of assisting the Government.&nbsp; Now, Mr Chandra Mohan wants us to remove those words.&nbsp; Let me say I do not intend to do that.&nbsp; I do not see&nbsp;how it is affecting the dignity of lawyers if the Law Society Council does not have a <I>carte blanche</I> to make comments on all legislation&nbsp;.&nbsp; I do not see how the Law Society can claim a special statutory right which other societies do not have, as a body to make pronouncements on all legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, let me make two points, Sir.&nbsp; Firstly, I have never declined to receive comments and suggestions from the Law Society on specific legislation, where it concerns the legal profession.&nbsp; In fact, I have always advised the Attorney-General to consult the&nbsp;Law Society on any legislative changes which affect the&nbsp;legal profession, and I will continue to do so.&nbsp; Secondly, I realise that<p align=left>Column: 1048<p> in some specific legal areas, there are lawyers who are specialists and experts in various areas of law whose input can be very useful.&nbsp; Therefore, we have never hesitated to consult the Law Society where the views of these specialists and experts can be valuable.&nbsp; I will give you two recent examples:&nbsp; Land Titles&nbsp;(Amendment) Act in 2003 to introduce electronic lodgment of documents, and the recent amendments to the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act in 2003.&nbsp; And I will continue to do so.&nbsp; But, that is different from what Mr Chandra Mohan wants me to do - to amend the Legal Profession Act so that we can go back to the days of the 80s where the Law Society behaved like a political pressure group.&nbsp; The answer to that is no.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung</B>:<B>&nbsp;</B> Sir, I will deal with the issue of Community Mediation.&nbsp; Recently, the law was amended to confer a power on Magistrates to refer neighbour disputes to Community Mediation Centres, even if one of the parties does not consent.&nbsp; This is a bold move, and one, may I add, that makes mediation a form of dispute settlement somewhat more difficult.&nbsp; Non-consensual mediation does not often result in agreement.&nbsp; If we want to extend powers in this fashion, is it not time to extend the role of CMCs as well - to be a quasi-judicial in its approach -&nbsp;to empower mediators to issue, if necessary, administrative orders that would ensure peace and harmony in the neighbourhood?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a neighbour is determined enough to go to court, it is likely that any referral to a CMC may fail, as parties at that time may be past talking about their dispute.&nbsp; We should consider&nbsp;giving such powers to mediators to see whether they can perform an administrative tribunal or quasi-judicial function in settling such disputes.&nbsp; At the same time, perhaps it is time to merge the settling of small <p align=left>Column: 1049<p>commercial claims with that of the CMCs.&nbsp; There may no longer be any need for the role of the Small Claims Tribunal as such.&nbsp; The Ministry can therefore make better use of resources once they merge CMCs with the Small Claims Tribunal and set up, what I would call, "Community Dispute Settlement Centres" (CDSC).</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</B> Sir, Singapore is a small compact society.&nbsp; We live tightly packed together and invariably there will be disputes that arise between neighbours.&nbsp; Traditionally, grassroots organisations, grassroots leaders, Government agencies like the HDB and Town Councils, do their part to try to help the neighbours to resolve their disputes.&nbsp; They are not always successful and, therefore, I fully support the development of mediation as a channel to assist in dispute resolutions, as opposed to letting our society move more and more towards litigation as the way to solve problems.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to find out from the Minister what is the result of mediation as an approach&nbsp;in our mediation centres so far.&nbsp; What is&nbsp;the percentage of cases mediated that has actually resulted in resolution?&nbsp; I ask this because, to the extent that not all mediation succeeds even when mandated by the court,&nbsp;there could be some of the more difficult ones that take up a disproportionate amount of resources on the part of Government agencies.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;they just go round and round without any resolution and the matter just gets worse and worse on the ground.&nbsp; In this connection, I support the idea&nbsp;of examining the role of our mediation centres to see whether or not it might be possible, in cases where they are protracted, and for which neither&nbsp;party is prepared to come to a consensus on the resolution, for some form of<p align=left>Column: 1050<p> arbitration to take place, so that we can bring&nbsp;the matter to a close.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> Sir, Alternative Dispute Resolution&nbsp;(ADR) awareness programme was launched last year to promote awareness of ADR options to the general public and specialised&nbsp;sectors, such as members of trade and industry-based organisations.&nbsp; Indeed, this was a commendable effort to encourage settlement of private disputes out of the arduous court process.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this juncture, I would like to ask the Minister how he would&nbsp;assess the effectiveness of community mediation in Singapore.&nbsp; Can he say that indeed a culture of mediation has taken root in Singaporeans?&nbsp; Sir, as I understand it, the focus of the CMCs&nbsp;is on disputes involving neighbours&nbsp;and peers.&nbsp; Such disputes usually relate to assault and use of vulgarities arising from heated quarrels over use of common property or excessive noise.&nbsp; One observation on&nbsp;the shortcomings of the present community mediation centres is that they are aloof from the community.&nbsp; Why do I say this?&nbsp; I would like to support it with this example.&nbsp; Now, if two neighbours in, say, Lorong 17, Geylang, have a dispute and are referred to a mediator in, say, Marine Parade CMC, the nearest location, what sense of identity do they bring with them?&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the mediator is a person unknown to these two neighbours.&nbsp; Who is he, the neighbours may wonder.&nbsp; This is important because the mediator must be a person of standing in the eyes of the party, as otherwise the mediator will not have the clout to extract concessions from them.&nbsp; In the good old days, the <I>kampong</I> headman who mediated in a dispute involving two fellow villagers was able to command the deference of the villagers simply by reason of his standing as the headman, a person&nbsp;whom the villagers looked up to&nbsp;and seek&nbsp;help and advice if they have a problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1051<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the location of the mediation centre is alien to the quarrelling parties.&nbsp; Would it not be more meaningful for the two quarrelling residents to go</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister the following questions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To what extent can we improve the accessibility of the mediation centres and the effectiveness of the mediators?&nbsp;

(1)&nbsp; a contract for the sale of goods; or</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; a contract for the provision of services; or</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; tortuous damage to property (not including motor vehicle accidents).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The original intent of the Tribunal was to provide a quick and inexpensive forum for the resolution of small claims between consumers and suppliers.&nbsp; I believe that we should expand the intent and jurisdiction of the Tribunal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, the Tribunal does not hear employment disputes.&nbsp; Where the employee earns less than $1,500 a month, he has a recourse to the Ministry of Manpower.&nbsp; However, if his salary exceeds that, even if his claim is less than $10,000, he has to bring his claim to the Subordinate Courts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the Tribunal does not hear disputes between landlord and tenant, or torts involving personal injury and others, even if the claims are&nbsp;less than $10,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these cases, the claimant&nbsp; may not be able to bring the matter for resolution&nbsp;at the community mediation centres unless the other party consents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can he not proceed in court?&nbsp; Yes, but our current Rules of Court require compliance of many procedures.&nbsp; Anecdotal evidence suggests that legal costs for pre-trial preparation alone, say,&nbsp;for a $50,000 claim, could easily range between $5,000&nbsp;and $10,000.&nbsp; A claim, say,&nbsp;for $5,000, may entail the same kind of preparations<p align=left>Column: 1053<p> and therefore the same but relatively much more prohibitive costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore is positioning itself well as a forum for international arbitration and alternative dispute resolution. Our judicial system is among the most impartial and efficient in the world.&nbsp; To complete the loop, we must have in place a mechanism that facilitates the proper resolution or closure of local civil disputes.&nbsp; And in this respect, we ought not to assume that all small disputes are trivial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask whether the Minister is looking at the feasibility of expanding the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal?&nbsp; Sir, since the Tribunal has been in existence since February 1985, may I also ask the Minister whether the Tribunal is making use of its accumulated body of case law to evolve certain guiding principles and to educate the public on them?</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

By this, I do not mean just having more lawyers, but making sure that we do not put ourselves in a position where only the rich have access to the judicial process, and hence justice.&nbsp; In his reply, the Minister gave the assurance that assistance given is adequate as the means test, which was revised recently, even allows someone who earns more than $1,000 to qualify for legal aid.&nbsp; Sir, I must confess that I am a little disappointed with the reply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I go on, I would like to declare, once again for the record, that I am a practising lawyer and hence may have an interest in the outcome of my comment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, legal services are not cheap.&nbsp; Charges generally vary, based on the complexity of the matter and the standing of the lawyer concerned.&nbsp; Going to court to litigate a matter and to defend against a charge can set a person's finances back quite substantially.&nbsp; A three-day trial can easily set a party back by $10,000.&nbsp; If a man with a wife not working with two school-going children to feed, and not to mention aged parents to support, is barely making over $2,000 a month,&nbsp;how much savings do you think he will have?&nbsp; And how much more do you think he will have left over for legal expenses?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the budget we set aside for healthcare subsidy, our budget for legal aid seems miniscule indeed.&nbsp; Yet, both legal aid and medical well-being are a necessary part of a person's happiness.&nbsp; In Singapore, I have worked out the sums of the extent of legal aid to about $1.60 per head.&nbsp; Whereas if we compare&nbsp;that to<p align=left>Column: 1055<p> Hong Kong, the extent of legal aid&nbsp;comes to about $12 per head.&nbsp; At the moment, we have a means test where you either qualify or you do not qualify for legal assistance or legal aid.&nbsp; I agree with my colleague's suggestion that perhaps a more flexible means test can be introduced to open up accessibility to justice for more Singaporeans in this regard.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Sir, the point I wish to raise is that the Government should compensate people for losses&nbsp;which they suffer if they are wrongly arrested or charged.&nbsp; I wish to clarify that I am&nbsp;referring here to those cases where a suspect is factually innocent, which means that he did not commit a crime or the offence in question.&nbsp; For instance, a person may have been prosecuted for cheating, but it turns out that he is not guilty because he had a good explanation in defence for what he did.&nbsp; I am not talking about situations where cases are dropped, because witnesses are reluctant to testify or on technicalities.&nbsp; These people may not be factually innocent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person wrongly arrested or charged will suffer losses, both financial and non-financial.&nbsp; His financial losses will include loss of income when he is detained and the cost of employing a lawyer to defend him.&nbsp;

However, I also understand that it is very difficult to succeed, because the burden on the plaintiff is very high.&nbsp; He has to show that the police had no grounds to arrest, but that is nearly <p align=left>Column: 1056<p>impossible as police powers in Singapore are very wide.&nbsp;

I think such a compensation scheme will also have the effect in making the police more careful in exercising arresting powers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also understand that such a right to compensation has been studied and adopted internationally, and is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Legislative Amendments</I><p><I>&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair</B>:<B>&nbsp;</B> Sir, our Ministry of Law, together with the legal fraternity, perhaps should review the names of some pieces of legislation every five years or so.&nbsp; For example, we have the Women's Charter.&nbsp; The name perhaps should be changed as it is not a Charter for women.&nbsp; It is also a piece of legislation for children, men and even their families and relatives.&nbsp; Perhaps we could call it either the Family Charter or the Matrimonial Proceedings Act.&nbsp; The relevant bodies could look into the matter with a view to amendment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.&nbsp; It is actually a misnomer, as this is not a temporary provision.&nbsp; It is a permanent feature of our statute books to detain undesirable elements in our society, including secret society&nbsp;members, drug offenders, etc, without trial.&nbsp; Perhaps it could be called the Criminal Detention Act or the Criminal Detention (Special Provisions) Act.&nbsp; Although I do understand the fact that it is temporary provisions, it is because <p align=left>Column: 1057<p>every five years we come back to Parliament to get an endorsement to renew and make it effective every five years or so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am sure there are many other statutes with names which could be amended, and perhaps the Attorney-General's Chambers could be tasked to look into this and they could work closely with the legal fraternity to come up with sound proposals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Right to Counsel</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> The other matter is right to counsel.&nbsp; In our system of criminal justice, there appears to be no right to a lawyer, ie, counsel, for a person arrested until police investigations are completed.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Is this an ideal state of affairs?&nbsp; If one were to be arrested, the first thing he wants is to contact his family members and/or his lawyers.&nbsp; Why is there a&nbsp; stumbling block amongst the police to refuse this aspect of human rights?&nbsp; I would urge the Government to review this restriction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The various stages in the criminal process include police arrest, investigation, recording of statements from potential witnesses and arrested persons under the Criminal Procedure Code, charged in court and right to counsel.&nbsp; The right to counsel comes a little too late.&nbsp; It may be too late for the accused.&nbsp; This perhaps should be changed and counsel should be allowed to see a person once he is arrested.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For poorer people, Sir,&nbsp;access is available, but the only thing is that it is a bit late.&nbsp;&nbsp; And these avenues that are available include the criminal legal aid of the Law Society.&nbsp;&nbsp; In capital cases in the High Court, we have assigned cases where the Registrar of the Supreme Court, in other words, the State, provides legal counsel to&nbsp;accused persons in capital cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1058<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In civil&nbsp; matters also, it is good that&nbsp;we have the Legal Aid Bureau under the Legal Aid and Advice Act.&nbsp; Perhaps I could suggest that, in terms of right to counsel in those instances,&nbsp;we could expand the areas covered besides that of road accidents, industrial accidents, divorce, probate and administration, and the like.&nbsp; Perhaps&nbsp;the State could afford to expand it so that poorer people would have better access to justice in other areas of law.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Sir, first, I would take the cuts on community mediation.&nbsp; I want to thank the&nbsp;Members who have spoken on this topic.&nbsp; I think their speeches reflect the recognition that community mediation is important and has a role to play in ensuring that urbanised compact Singapore will have their relational and community disputes on the ground settled in a way that will promote good neighbourliness.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Members have asked for an update on how community mediation has progressed.&nbsp; In particular, Mdm Ho has asked&nbsp;whether or not there is a culture of mediation on the ground.&nbsp; Let me just update Members on some of the key points.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Members know, community mediation was introduced in 1998, about 4-5 years ago.&nbsp; Today, three out of four cases mediated at the CMCs are successfully resolved.&nbsp; I think Mr Heng asked for some statistics.&nbsp; CMCs have successfully mediated more than 1,400 cases so far.&nbsp; Last year, CMCs mediated 342 cases compared to 120 in 1998.&nbsp; Of course, we do not take joy in there being more cases.&nbsp; But I think the fact that there are cases out there means that we have to do more to make community mediation more well-known and acceptable on the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of making community mediation more acceptable and also instilling a culture is this whole question of <p align=left>Column: 1059<p>awareness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho also asked how&nbsp;we create more awareness.&nbsp; I think that is an excellent point&nbsp;because community mediation may be new to some people, and some of them may have misperceptions as to how it works.&nbsp; Hence, one target area that we have been working on is to make community mediation more well-known on the ground through activities like road shows and talks in schools.&nbsp; In addition to this, we have also made community mediation more accessible.&nbsp; I think this is the point that Mdm Ho also made.&nbsp; She cited examples of people travelling very far to go for mediation, and that is why, over the last 2-3 years, we have established satellite venues.&nbsp; There are about eight of them now and they are all established in appropriate community clubs or community centres.&nbsp; In this way, we hope to replicate, as Mdm Ho suggested, the days of old when the <I>ketua kampong,</I> or the village headman, would&nbsp;mediate disputes in his own area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point that Mdm Ho asked is how we take care of volunteers.&nbsp; In fact, this is a recurring theme of her speeches in Parliament, which I think is very important because that is the key of our community mediation efforts.&nbsp; It is based on&nbsp;stout hearted, committed, passionate and trained volunteers who are prepared to give time to ensure that the process works.&nbsp; Hence, basically, the short answer is that&nbsp;we do recognise their efforts.&nbsp; We provide them training.&nbsp; This is important</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

Hence, out of a group of 152 mediators, there are now 62 who are master mediators.<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">5.45 pm</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho also suggests that we should tap the grassroots leaders even more.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1060<p> This is something that we are working on.&nbsp; We are getting more grassroots leaders to come forward to train as mediators.&nbsp; This point is important because Prof. Chin, in his speech, mentioned the situation where if we try to get the parties to talk after the dispute has been boiling for some time, it is difficult.&nbsp; He called it a bold move on the part of MinLaw in introducing amendments to the CMC Act, making it compulsory for parties to go for mediation if required by the magistrate.&nbsp; But that is after the complaint has been lodged.&nbsp; I fully agree with him.&nbsp; That is why we are working towards a scheme which we call&nbsp;the "Persuader Scheme".&nbsp; This is where one party has lodged the complaint but the other party refuses to come.&nbsp; And I think this is the nub of many of the frustrations on the ground.&nbsp; Then what do we do?&nbsp; Instead of just waiting for the other party to come forward or writing to him a letter that, to him,&nbsp;may not make sense, we are training grassroots leaders to be involved in the scheme, to visit and persuade, and to try to change any wrong impressions that any person may have of the entire process.&nbsp; So let us see how that works.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, this is the approach that we are taking.&nbsp; We are also strengthening the referral schemes.&nbsp; We have several sources of referral, including the Police and the Multi-Door Court-house, HDB, CDCs and Family Service Centres.&nbsp; So I think it is important that all these referral sources should see the CMCs as the focus, the first stop should neighbours have problems, or family members have problems, or stallholders have problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been reflected to me also the frustrations of residents who may think that they are being pushed from pillar to post.&nbsp; So we want to strengthen the referral system.&nbsp; We want to work with grassroots leaders to strengthen the Persuader Scheme.&nbsp; I share this in response to what Prof. Chin and Mr Heng&nbsp;have suggested, whether we should do more now to change the entire structure <p align=left>Column: 1061<p>of CMCs.&nbsp; I would say we should not do more now because we recognise that CMCs&nbsp;started with a specific purpose.&nbsp; They were to parallel the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT) system.&nbsp; Small Claims Tribunal would&nbsp;take care of small commercial claims on the ground and there would be adjudicatory function for the SCT.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But CMCs, on the other hand, would take care of relational and community disputes where the primary task would be to mediate.&nbsp; So we can see that there is a difference in treatment, and rightly so.&nbsp; Because for CMCs, we are talking about neighbours and&nbsp;family members who have continuing relationships.&nbsp; To adjudicate would mean that you have, in a sense, to find out who is at fault.&nbsp; You have to do more than just trying to bring the parties together.&nbsp; Merging the functions will save resources, and it makes sense from an organisational point of view.&nbsp; I think in terms of achieving the objectives of these two parallel systems, we should, what the Chinese say, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">san si</i>, think very hard before we do that.&nbsp; So let us see how these improvements work out first before we do something as revolutionary as that.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next point is legal aid.&nbsp; Legal aid is&nbsp;a recurrent theme in this House, and quite rightly so, because Members are concerned that Singaporeans&nbsp;should have&nbsp;the means whereby their disputes can be settled.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I want to make is that the way we have developed alternative dispute resolution processes helps Singaporeans to have different avenues to ventilate their disputes.&nbsp; In fact, over the past two or&nbsp;three years, not just the CMCs, but also the Singapore Mediation Centre,&nbsp;the Small Claims Tribunal as well, and also many industry-based mediation services have surfaced, including Insurance Dispute Resolution Organisation (IDRO),&nbsp;Association of Banks of Singapore and&nbsp;the Consumers' Association.</p><p align=left>Column: 1062<p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the first point I want to make is that, when we talk about access to justice, we should see it in a larger context.&nbsp; Yes, access to justice in the courts is important, being helped by the Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) to have your problems aired in the court is important.&nbsp; But really we want to help Singaporeans see that there are also other viable means of settling their disputes.&nbsp; So that is the first key point.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point is that we are not deaf to the pleas of many MPs that we should always constantly be mindful of whether the means test is serving its purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;assure the House that, over the past 20 years, we had&nbsp;amended the means test several times, and the last time was only about 2½ years ago.&nbsp; We amended the means test&nbsp;and now the income is $10,000 and the capital&nbsp;is $7,000.&nbsp; Actually, a family of four where the father works, with two children, the wife does not work, if he has an income of about $2,000, because of the allowance scheme, he will still qualify for legal aid.&nbsp; I think that is not bad.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to assure Members that while we will continue to monitor the means test, let us not rush into raising it every time we feel that more Singaporeans need aid.&nbsp; We should not forget that, however we raise it, there will always be people who are cut off, at least the group of people that Prof. Chin and Mr Sin in a way have heartfelt concerns for.&nbsp; But these people are not bereft of any help.&nbsp; Because I am happy to say that we have got other people with the good hearts out there.&nbsp; So, for example, if a case like that happens in the LAB, LAB officials will be helpful, sometimes counselling can be given.&nbsp; And if the person really needs more specific help, they will provide&nbsp;the person with a&nbsp;list of voluntary welfare organisations to whom the applicant, who does not get aid, can turn to.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1063<p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, for example, of one quite recently, the Tanjong Pagar Family Service Centre now has a scheme, and it is on the website, where they administer <I>pro bono</I> legal assistance scheme, providing legal assistance, for an&nbsp;honorarium, to those who do not qualify for legal aid and are unable to afford the services of private lawyers.&nbsp; So I think that is wonderful.&nbsp; This is a situation where VWOs out there are given the opportunities and&nbsp;space to complement what the Government is doing.&nbsp; And, indeed, the Law Society is also considering ways in which they can help people like that.&nbsp; Because I understand the Law Society is currently working on a new scheme called "Law Help", to extend help to deserving applicants in civil matters.&nbsp; This scheme would&nbsp;first target&nbsp;voluntary welfare organisations doing charitable work, matching those who need legal advice and help with law firms who could do the work on a <I>pro bono</I> basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;In time, building on the experience with "Law Help" and&nbsp;its criminal legal aid scheme, the Law Society hopes to construct a model to enable representation of people in family matters who do not meet the means test for Government legal aid.&nbsp; But I understand that this is currently at a preliminary stage.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let us see things in context.&nbsp; We cannot compare medical subsidies with legal aid.&nbsp; Everybody in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> would need medical aid, but not everybody would need legal aid.&nbsp; So I think the comparison Mr Sin makes is not quite on, although of course he makes it in a heartfelt way.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chandra Mohan suggests&nbsp;giving the legal aid even to criminal accused persons.&nbsp; We have argued this out before in this House as to whether we should extend the state-assisted scheme where now only those who are facing capital <p align=left>Column: 1064<p>charges would be given legal representation, two counsels in fact.&nbsp; We have said quite clearly in this House that it would be inconsistent.&nbsp; On one hand, the State decides to charge somebody for wrongdoing,&nbsp;and when we do that, I think Mr Mohan knows that there is a very careful process that before even a charge is levied, both in terms of the investigation process and also the prosecution process, the decision is that&nbsp;this is a&nbsp;case in the public interest ought to be prosecuted and which the State would devote resources to securing a conviction within the law, of course,&nbsp;then it would be incongruous for the State to say, "All right, we will also provide you with aid, either assigned counsel or with criminal legal aid, for you to fight the charge."&nbsp; So let us not do that.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But of course, Mr Mohan knows that CLAS (Criminal Legal Aid Scheme) under the Law Society does a wonderful work.&nbsp; And we should again continue to promote that.&nbsp; It is a win-win situation where lawyers in town, particularly, younger ones, can do <I>pro bono</I> work.&nbsp; We talked about, for example, the image of lawyers earlier on.&nbsp; Prof. Chin mentioned&nbsp;the point about a few lawyers slurring the name of the legal profession.&nbsp; I think the CLAS is a wonderful scheme, where particularly young lawyers can enhance the image of the Law Society.&nbsp; And we do not give aid from the State.&nbsp; But Prof. Jayakumar, myself and others in the legal fraternity, we play golf and do other things, to help the lawyers raise funds.&nbsp; So we should leave it at that.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked whether we should have a criminal compensation scheme.&nbsp; I think he is talking about people who are arrested and then detained during investigations and, after some time, they are released, not those who are charged.&nbsp; Because we have answered this second point before that for people who are charged in court and then acquitted, should we compensate them.&nbsp; I think we<p align=left>Column: 1065<p> have explained in this House that because of the burden of proof being so high, beyond a reasonable doubt, any accused&nbsp;who can cast a reasonable doubt on a prosecution's case will be acquitted.&nbsp; It does not necessarily follow that he or she is innocent.&nbsp; Whilst the law is such that he has succeeded to free himself of the charge,&nbsp;it should not be&nbsp;the case&nbsp;that we should&nbsp;then give a compensation&nbsp;to these people.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the other group of people who are arrested by Police, I would like to let Mr Low&nbsp; know -&nbsp; I am sure&nbsp;now that he has got the help of &nbsp;lawyers he knows already -&nbsp;that under the law, the Police can only hold a&nbsp;suspect for 48 hours.&nbsp; Beyond that, the Police has to produce the suspect in court and the court will then give an order to continue detaining the suspect.&nbsp;I am told that, in most cases, the Police in fact can complete the investigations within 48 hours.&nbsp; So the Police will not just willy-nilly ask for an extension.&nbsp; If we require Police in such cases, if it decides after very full and complete investigations that the person will not be charged to&nbsp;compensate him, then it will hinder the Police in its work. &nbsp; And it will not be in the public interest because then our crime rates will not be the same.&nbsp; Police will then think very carefully before even picking up a person for questioning.&nbsp; Ultimately, like Prof. Jayakumar says, it is the people that run the system.&nbsp; I think the facts speak for themselves.&nbsp; People who come here know that we operate an honest system.&nbsp; The Mercer poll, not just by Singaporeans, but worldwide, 1½ years ago rated <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> very highly, in terms of law and order, and the Police's honesty, competence, have also come through very well.&nbsp; Let us leave the Police to do its job, and not introduce this new scheme.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Khalis has asked whether we can extend the scope for the Small Claims Tribunal.&nbsp; Over the years, just like <p align=left>Column: 1066<p>legal aid, we have actually extended the Small Claims Tribunal's ambit.&nbsp; But this is an ongoing exercise.&nbsp; So I want to assure him that, as he has made some suggestions as to some areas where we may want to see how we can enhance the SCT's reach,&nbsp;we&nbsp;will consider his suggestion.&nbsp; In fact, if he has any suggestions, he can let me know.&nbsp; Because the SCT is indeed playing a&nbsp;key role in this overall scheme that I have talked about, that of &nbsp;helping Singaporeans to have&nbsp;greater access to justice.&nbsp; For example, in 2002, there were 40,132 claimants who went before the SCT,&nbsp;up from 37,000 in the year 2001.&nbsp; But&nbsp;when we examine whether or not to extend the scope, I think Mr Khalis will know that if contracts are too complex, if&nbsp;they require close examination of legal issues or legislation, then&nbsp;they may not fit the bill as one that comes within the SCT.&nbsp; Because with the SCT, it is an informal process.&nbsp; We will&nbsp;take some care in enhancing the scope without changing the nature of the SCT.&nbsp; Whether or not the SCT is reaching out,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Sir, I thank both Mr Ravindran and Mr Chiam for their cuts, in particular, Mr Ravindran.&nbsp; I think it is a favourite topic of his, fighting on behalf of many residents who want more land.&nbsp; Over the years, we have heeded the call, because we have made more land available, including one in his constituency which it&nbsp;has been using very well for football and other activities.&nbsp; But we will continue to be proactive and make more land available.&nbsp; Indeed, one or two key measures have been implemented, eg,&nbsp;the reduction of TOL fees - I think all of us in this House will rejoice about that - by 70% from the market rates in 2000 and, now, by another 15%, giving a total discount of 85%.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ravindran talked about the portal.&nbsp; We have the State Properties Information Online (SPIO) set up in 2002 to make information on state properties easily available and accessible to all.&nbsp; In October 2002, SLA added an additional feature to enhance the portal's usefulness.&nbsp; This is a dedicated website to facilitate applications by Community Development Councils and Constituency Offices to use vacant state land for community and social purposes.&nbsp; Indeed, there are also plans to enhance this even further, because we are going to have SLA working on a&nbsp;public e-query<p align=left>Column: 1070<p> facility that will allow online checks on land ownership and managing agents for Government-owned land parcels.&nbsp; So, this will be a consolidated information that people can log in to find out how they can use the land.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ravindran talked about the signs on the fields.&nbsp; I think Members will know that SLA has indeed heard the feedback.&nbsp; Instead of the no-trespassing sign&nbsp;that dots a lot of our fields all over the island, for those lands that are in the HDB residential areas and which are deemed to be playable, we have replaced those signs to the effect that residents can go on to the land.&nbsp; But, of course, they must do so at their own risk.&nbsp; We cannot be guarantors of their safety.&nbsp; When they use these lands, residents must, of course, take care.&nbsp; So, that will make more land available.&nbsp; Together with what SLA has done with the SSC and&nbsp;MOE, collaborative efforts to open up more school fields and also new playing fields at the Turf Club at Marina South,&nbsp;Singaporeans on a Sunday, whether morning, afternoon or evening, when they drive around the whole of Singapore, will find many people out there playing all kinds of games, including football.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam asked about this case that we discussed in Parliament in August last year.&nbsp; He said that it did not look right.&nbsp; In fact, when I shared in this House, I said that the Minister and I also looked at it and felt it was not right that the owners should be paid $1, and that we were relooking at how we could do more.&nbsp; So, I am happy to say that after looking at the case in some detail and talking to the owners, now the owners have been paid much more than $1.&nbsp; So, they are happy, I hope Mr Chiam is happy, and certainly we are happy.&nbsp; Indeed, there will be other owners who would be paid $1.&nbsp; Let us not make any bones about it.&nbsp; As I explained last year in Parliament, there are three or four established categories where $1 will be paid, and these are based on<p align=left>Column: 1071<p> sound valuation principles, including, for example, odd-lots, small backlanes and splay corners or situations where the landowner&nbsp;has already vested the front part for road purposes and then had benefited because of transferred higher GFA.&nbsp; So, these will continue to be paid $1.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp;

All along, I have been using my mother tongue, Mandarin, to speak and participate in parliamentary discussions where I raised a good number of suggestions, such as lift upgrading, medical check-ups for senior citizens, lowering of Sentosa entrance fees and reviewing the criteria for school ranking,<p align=left>Column: 1072<p> etc, and they have been accepted and implemented by the relevant authorities.&nbsp; However, when I wanted to look for the text of my past speeches, I could only find the English record and not the Chinese version.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the present parliamentary records system, if a Member of Parliament speaks in his mother tongue, his speech will be orally translated into English and recorded in the verbatim report.&nbsp; The translated text may not capture the original flavour and humour expressed in the original language, and the essence of the language is lost.&nbsp; The original text of speeches delivered in&nbsp;mother tongue may become an important archival material&nbsp;of the historical and cultural legacy of our Parliament.&nbsp; As such, I hope that the Minister would consider keeping the original text of speeches made in the mother tongues, eg, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil, as a record for our future reference.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Yet if, on the other hand, it is the Singaporean who pays for the enactment of our laws through his or her own taxes, then should the Singaporean not&nbsp;also have an easier access to these documents through <I>Hansard</I>?<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, having <I>Hansard</I> online is not just for researchers&nbsp;or an&nbsp;academic process.&nbsp; Members of the public too need to be engaged and these archives help each citizen to get a sense of history of our nation, how it was built, and how it is reinventing itself. An example will be the recent discussion in Parliament on head of household.&nbsp; It was first brought up, according to <I>Hansard,</I> in 1994 by NMP, Kanwaljit Soin.&nbsp; The social climate then and now are interesting comparisons for members of the public to also look at.&nbsp; The public&nbsp; can then make meaningful contributions to debates&nbsp;with better access to the archives.&nbsp; We have just heard DPM mentioned about things that are nice to have and things that we have to be prudent.&nbsp; I do understand that.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I see the accessibility of the <I>Hansard</I> as something that should be<p align=left>Column: 1075<p> given to citizens, and one way is using SingPass.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; Sir, both Mr Ang and Dr Ong wanted the text of their speeches made in Mandarin to be kept in the Parliament Library for future reference.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, all speeches are recorded in <I>Hansard</I> in English, which is the administrative language. &nbsp;As Dr Ong has said, the speeches in Mandarin, Malay or Tamil are now recorded on CDs and kept in the Library.&nbsp; Members can have access to these CDs and listen to the speeches, if they wish.&nbsp; They can listen to&nbsp;the speeches that they have made in the mother tongue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Member does not have a written script and requires our Parliament staff to have the speech transcribed and keep it in the Library, I think that will add extra work and cost to Parliament.&nbsp; Afer all, Members' speeches are already recorded on CDs in their original language.&nbsp; I do not think it is necessary to have them transcribed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):&nbsp; Next, I come to Mr Chandra Mohan's request&nbsp;for more professional staff to be employed by Parliament so that they can help the parliamentarians to do research and provide support to them&nbsp;in their work.&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan raised this before and I will give him the same answer.&nbsp; Our Parliament Library already provides some kind of a research support for MPs.&nbsp; If they want to look up some materials, they can ask the librarian to look&nbsp;up for them.&nbsp; But if they want work to be done for them,&nbsp;I think that is not possible.

Of course, there is a cost to maintaining the <I>Hansard</I>, whether it is by Parliament or by LawNet.&nbsp; Therefore, those who wish to access it&nbsp;have to pay for it.&nbsp; Paying for access to the LawNet is not a new thing.&nbsp; In the past, before such records were placed in the LawNet, members of the public have to buy a copy of the <I>Hansard</I> from the Singapore National Printers. They already have to pay for access.&nbsp; If they do not want to pay for access, they can go to the National Library and&nbsp;read the <I>Hansard</I>.&nbsp; I do not think we&nbsp;need to do anything more than that.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ong Seh Hong</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek further clarification from the Minister.
