FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) (for the Minister for Finance):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's mandate for GIC is to achieve a reasonable rate of return above global inflation, over a long-term horizon.&nbsp; In the last 20 years to March 2008, the average annual rate of return of the portfolio was 5.8% in Singapore dollar terms.&nbsp; This was 4.5% above global inflation.&nbsp; This data and more information can actually be found in the GIC Report published in September 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIC has performed well over the long term, in accordance with its mandate.&nbsp; In the current financial meltdown, GIC's investments have lost value, just like any other institutional investors.&nbsp; The overall value has, however, fallen by much less than the decline in global equity markets of 42% for 2008, mitigated by GIC's decision early in the crisis to reduce its equity market exposures, and its portfolio diversification strategy.&nbsp; Further, GIC takes a long-term approach to investment management, which enables it to ride through the cycles, including the current severe downcycle.&nbsp; It is difficult to make meaningful direct comparisons between the performance of GIC and other <p align=left>Column: 1624<p>institutional investors as the investment horizons, objectives and parameters vary widely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guidelines for GIC have not changed fundamentally over the years since its inception.&nbsp; However, GIC has gradually evolved its asset allocation strategy, from the early days when its emphasis was on fixed income instruments, towards an increased allocation for higher risk and higher returns investments like equities and alternative investments.&nbsp; This evolution has resulted in a more diversified and balanced portfolio, aimed at achieving long-term returns, but keeping to an acceptable risk level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investment approach of seeking to achieve reasonable returns above global inflation, within overall risk tolerance parameters set by the Government, is appropriate for our purpose.&nbsp; It will grow the real value of Singapore's reserves over time, which provide an important cushion for crisis situations like the current economic downturn, as well as generate a continual stream of income that can contribute towards the Government's budgetary needs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will continue to review from time to time whether the guidelines are appropriate, given the investment objectives and the investment climate going forward.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

2.&nbsp; <B>Miss Penny Low</B> asked the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (a) what is the rationale behind the step-by-step approach in the Government's acceptance of the report of the Advisory Council on the Impact of New Media on Society (AIMS) published in December 2008 which recommended the liberalisation of cyberspace; and (b) in the light of past experience, whether local netizens have shown sufficient maturity and consistency in entering a self-regulated regime and, if not, how can the Ministry, netizens and related NGOs help develop a more responsible cyberspace that can eventually be self-regulated.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew) (for the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts):</B>&nbsp; The Government has accepted most of the AIMS' recommendations.&nbsp; But in some areas, we have differed from the AIMS' proposal for liberalisation and have opted for a progressive and pragmatic approach.&nbsp; Let me explain why.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on e-engagement, the Government agrees with AIMS that an evolutionary approach is sensible.&nbsp; Government agencies need time to build capabilities and experience in e-engagement.&nbsp; It is also simply not feasible nor productive for the Government to engage on all websites or blogs, as this will simple require too much resources.&nbsp; Hence, it makes practical sense to focus <p align=left>Column: 1626<p>our available resources to engage on established platforms, such as the REACH portal and the online letter forums of our mainstream media.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REACH offers a convenient one-stop portal for citizens who want to be heard and who would like to offer their views, reactions and suggestions to the Government.&nbsp; Views, for and against, are welcomed in the spirit of a robust, constructive and meaningful debate.&nbsp; In fact, anyone who visits REACH will be able to see the diversity of comments and vigorous exchanges taking place in the discussion forum and blogs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On e-engagement, while we are proceeding cautiously, we are not closed to the idea of engaging on other objective and credible sites, in future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning online political content, the Government has in fact gone beyond the AIMS' recommendation.&nbsp; We have accepted the AIMS' recommendation to expand the positive list to allow political parties, and their election candidates and agents, to use new media tools in Internet election advertising, such as in promoting themselves, their manifestoes and their activities during election.&nbsp; In addition, we are allowing individuals to participate in Internet election advertising, by blogging or posting election materials.&nbsp; Beyond this, we are also allowing party political films that would be exempted under the Films (Amendment) Bill for Internet election advertising during elections.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AIMS has recommended removing the registration requirement for political parties as well as individuals and bodies of persons who provide any programme for propagation, promotion or discussion of political or religious issues relating to Singapore through Internet websites.&nbsp; AIMS believes that the removal will allow people to participate freely.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1627<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The registration requirement does not carry any additional restrictions.&nbsp; Registrants are subjected to the same set of Class Licence conditions and the&nbsp;Internet Code of Practice as any other non-registered Internet Content Provider.&nbsp; The reason for requiring registration is to maintain a higher level of accountability of those responsible for such websites.&nbsp; Registration has not stopped political parties' websites from posting critical comments and engaging in free and open discussions on government policies and issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, the Government has taken significant and substantive steps to expand the space for socio-political discourse.&nbsp; I would like to assure the House that we will continue to review and update our policies to keep them relevant with the times and technology.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now address the second part of the question.&nbsp; We have not done any studies to assess the level of maturity and consistency of local netizens in entering a self-regulated regime.&nbsp; However, for Members of the House who have surfed the Internet, you would have observed that while there are some serious and objective postings, there is also a prevalence of noises, rumours and distortions in cyberspace.&nbsp; As the AIMS report has noted, while there were reasoned and critical views, there were also "a great deal of unhelpful commentary and discussions online".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it would be quite apparent that the Internet is not an effective self-regulated regime as some may have touted it to be.&nbsp; Rumours and lies are prevalent in cyberspace.&nbsp; Flaming and cyber-bullying are not uncommon.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this is the downside of the Internet, given the borderless nature of cyberspace and the cloak of anonymity that comes with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1628<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To develop a responsible cyberspace, all parties need to play their role responsibly.&nbsp; On its part, the Government had in the past set up the Parents Advisory Group for the Internet (PAGi) and National Internet Advisory Committee (NIAC) to promote a culture of cyber wellness, especially among our young and their parents.&nbsp; Today, the Media Development Authority (MDA) works with the Internet and Media Advisory Committee (INMAC), the industry, as well as NGOs like the Touch Community, to foster cyber wellness among our young people.&nbsp; In response to AIMS, the Government will set up an Inter-Ministry Taskforce on Cyber Wellness to coordinate national efforts and develop strategies and programmes on cyber wellness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significantly, netizens themselves have a major and critical role to play in developing a responsible cyberspace.&nbsp; Individual bloggers ought to be responsible and accountable in their postings. &nbsp;Website proprietors and the online contributors must be responsible and prompt in moderating the sites to ensure credibility, objectivity and balance in the content posted. &nbsp;Netizens can and should do more to establish and enforce the norms of acceptable online behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Government moves towards engagement in cyberspace, we hope that the online community, as well as those in the real world, will contribute constructive and meaningful ideas and comments to help strengthen Singapore and better prepare us for the rigours of global competition.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

A significant number&nbsp;was unkind.&nbsp; A small number&nbsp;was downright outrageous.&nbsp; It was disappointing and my impression is that I do not think the community itself has done enough to rebut some of these unhelpful comments delivered by the fellow netizens.&nbsp; It is a squandered opportunity for a higher degree of self-regulation.&nbsp; It would have been an example of the genesis of the first steps towards a more responsible,&nbsp;a greater self-regulatory regime, but many of those responses were not rebutted nor answered, and I think it is not healthy for some of these to remain on the Internet unchallenged, unquestioned and unanswered.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang) (for the Senior Minister):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;Parliament passed the Insurance Act (Amendment) Bill on 19th January 2009.&nbsp; The Bill contained a framework for nomination of beneficiaries in respect of insurance policy proceeds.&nbsp; Prior to the amendment, the Insurance Act did not contain provisions for the nomination of beneficiaries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of nomination forms by insurance companies created legal uncertainty and ambiguity, given the existence of section 73 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (CLPA). &nbsp;Several court cases also brought to light the <p align=left>Column: 1631<p>inflexibility of these arrangements.&nbsp; These cases were brought to the courts sporadically over the years, although a few were given a high profile by the media in 2002 and 2003.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After studying various approaches, MAS decided to introduce a framework under the Insurance Act to give policy owners clear, simple and economical means to decide on how the proceeds from their insurance policies should be disbursed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In preparing the Bill, MAS conducted two extensive consultations with the industry and the public in 2005 and again in 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issues were rather complicated and diverse feedback was received from a wide range of stakeholders.&nbsp; MAS had to take all these views into consideration, in addition to the impact of the proposed framework on other pieces of legislation, such as the Central Provident Fund Act, the Administration of Muslim Law Act and the Co-operative Societies Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this took some time.&nbsp; The Bill was tabled for Parliament as soon as MAS was able to do so.&nbsp; The new framework contained in the Insurance Act will clarify the current uncertainty surrounding the disbursement of insurance policy proceeds and give policy owners the assurance that the proceeds from their insurance policies will be disbursed as they intended.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Between then and now, it is a good&nbsp;five to&nbsp;six years.&nbsp; I am wondering why it took so long to reconcile and harmonise it, even though I understand <p align=left>Column: 1632<p>that some time is needed for industry-wide consultation.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So they started consulting with the industry in 2005 on the principles and the methods.&nbsp; They got the feedback and&nbsp;responded.&nbsp; In 2007, they consulted the industry on the draft of the Bill, and responding to the feedback, took us to 2008.&nbsp;

I want to take this opportunity to <p align=left>Column: 1633<p>commend the Finance Minister for an exceptional Budget that aims to instil a sense of caring and sharing as well as inculcate a sense of&nbsp; <I>espirit de corp</I> in the community.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this recession is a by-product of our new age of globalisation, where volatile economic cycles and job insecurity are part of the equation.&nbsp; In biblical times, wine grapes were not put into used leather pouches as the fermentation process would burst the old pouches.&nbsp; Hence, the saying, "you don't put new wine in old bottles".&nbsp; Hence, too new thinking and new action are critical to contain today's problems and provide solutions for tomorrow.&nbsp; We cannot solve new problems with pat old answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Boldness and iconoclasm are in.&nbsp; So, by all means give help to the needy but we must ensure that we do not, in the process, make "needy" a new growth industry and acceptable career.&nbsp; What remains a constant is that while it is new age to have a bleeding heart, but as relevant is what Minister Mentor once said, we have to be careful not to bleed to death.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have had two generations of job security. What do we have now?&nbsp; Job insecurity.&nbsp; Clearly, with our increasingly globalised economy and society, the periods of growth have become shorter, placing tremendous strain on individuals and families.&nbsp; Singapore's unemployment figures are grim.&nbsp; The total number of people laid off last year was 16,000.&nbsp; Credit Suisse recently projected that we could see some 300,000 people laid off in this recession, out of which 100,000 would be Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is&nbsp;just a projection.&nbsp; What is a fact is this: We are already into our fourth quarter of negative growth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In essence, these are unprecedented times and for unprecedented times, we need unprecedented measures.&nbsp; In a new globalised world, we need&nbsp;new thinking&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1634<p>and&nbsp;new action. &nbsp;US President Barack Obama said in his inauguration speech, the old ways of thinking about government are over.&nbsp; He said, "What we need is not big government or small government, we need a government that works."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng Xiao Peng once said, "It doesn't matter if the cat is white or black, so long as it catches mice."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, for Singapore to deal with this recession, we should not deliberate between a supply-side approach or a demand-side approach and debate the theoretical merits of each.&nbsp; What we most want is "measures that work".&nbsp; The objective is clear -&nbsp;to help Singaporeans retain their jobs and tide over this recession.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, several of the Budget measures proposed are in the new thinking&nbsp;and&nbsp;new action&nbsp;categories, which I applaud.&nbsp; Firstly, the courage to use past reserves for the first time.&nbsp; And to use it for a Jobs Credit Scheme which effectively gives companies across the board money for retaining staff.&nbsp; Specifically, 12% of an employee's pay up to $2,500.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some say this amounts to only a maximum of $300 per worker.&nbsp; If a company is doing very badly and has to fold up, a savings of $300 per employee is not going to help retain the employee.&nbsp; Why not just save the $2,500 by laying off that employee?&nbsp; &nbsp;I say, look at this as a lifeline for a start.&nbsp; The aim is to keep companies afloat.&nbsp; The Government knows that securing jobs is the best form of social welfare and is focused on doing that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, the Jobs Credit Scheme has its limitations.&nbsp; Most importantly, it does not differentiate between companies most likely to lay off workers from those that are not intending to lay off workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put another way, the success of the Jobs Credit Scheme is not measurable.&nbsp; What is the objective of this scheme?&nbsp; It is to save jobs, via helping businesses <p align=left>Column: 1635<p>manage labour costs. &nbsp;Some companies will have to fold because they are just doing too badly. But what percentage of job losses will determine if the scheme is successful or not?&nbsp; We do not know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way to refine it, I would suggest, is to establish a feedback mechanism where all companies&nbsp;&ndash; large, small, unionised or not&nbsp;&ndash; are required to inform the Government&nbsp;beforehand&nbsp;if they are considering retrenchment.&nbsp; The Government can then devise specific measures on how to better assist such companies.&nbsp; It can refer them to other business assistance schemes that the affected company might not know about, or refer them to business consultants who can help them manage their costs better.&nbsp; Their consultancy fees could be funded or co-funded by the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If companies still do eventually retrench staff, we can stop or reduce the Jobs Credit payment quantum per worker towards these companies. &nbsp;Laid off workers can be helped through measures I will elaborate later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the enhanced SPUR programme is excellent, but one of the concerns I have is that it could be open to abuse if companies were to send staff for training simply for the financial incentive and then retrench them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some regularity mechanism is required to ensure that this does not occur.&nbsp; Above all, we must have that can-do spirit and come up with creative solutions.&nbsp; I would like to make a few recommendations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on older workers and innovative HR practices.&nbsp;With improvements in health and medicine, many older workers are still agile and alert.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a rapidly greying population. The Government estimates that the number of older citizens 65 years and above will mushroom from the current 9% to 23% <p align=left>Column: 1636<p>of the population in 2037.&nbsp; Older workers, especially those 45 and above, often have difficulties finding a new job if they are laid off. &nbsp;As a Government, we have advocated the restructuring of relevant jobs for older workers. The Government should now take the lead and hire more older workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I suggest we have an Older Worker Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp; We could&nbsp;double the Government's contribution under the Jobs Credit Scheme to encourage the hiring of older workers. As such, if a company hires an older worker, the Government gives the company 24% up to a wage limit of $2,500.&nbsp; To prevent companies from abusing this scheme, I suggest we make it only applicable to new recruits and not people who have been retrenched from the same company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the group of highly skilled older workers, I urge the Government and corporate sector to look at innovative ways to tap into their expertise.&nbsp; After 40-odd years of economic growth as a country, we have a generation of experienced middle-aged professionals and executives whose skills we can harness for the next lap of growth. We should encourage companies to employ such people for strategic purposes. That way, everyone, from corporations to the Government, benefit from their collective skill and wisdom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, SMEs employ the majority of workers in Singapore&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;six out of 10.&nbsp; While they employ the majority of workers in Singapore, they are also the most vulnerable to a prolonged slowdown as they do not have the deep profits, large revenues or cash reserves that enable larger companies to withstand a long- term slowdown.&nbsp; I commend the Government for its Special Risk-Sharing Initiative (SRI), in assisting to keep these companies afloat.&nbsp; But we must monitor the effectiveness of this scheme, perhaps on a monthly basis.&nbsp; If bank credit lines do <p align=left>Column: 1637<p>not open up fast enough, we should perhaps give a tax break to these companies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the 40% property tax rebate on industrial and commercial property for 2009 is a substantive move, but the rebate should go directly to the tenants rather than the landlords.&nbsp; That way, we directly&nbsp;help the tenants.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, aside from proposals to improve the Jobs Credit Scheme, I ask the Government to consider&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;what if the money still results in large scale retrenchments?&nbsp; Should more money not&nbsp;be given to people to tide them over this difficult period? &nbsp;It is, after all, turning out to be the worst recession Singapore has ever had.&nbsp; This is the time to really take major action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, doubling GST credits is too timid.&nbsp; Maybe we should look at quadrupling the GST credits?&nbsp; Or slash the GST by half, to 3.5%?&nbsp; We can also spend more on healthcare and education and even move money from defence spending to these areas. &nbsp;In times like these, do we need to spend so much on traditional defence?&nbsp; FY2009 defence spending is projected to be $11.4 billion or 26% of the Budget.&nbsp; It is better to employ some of that money to build up economic defence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why have just a 20% personal income tax rebate capped at $2,000?&nbsp; Perhaps we should, in addition, waive the personal income tax for income earned in 2008, subject to a tax liability of&nbsp;x dollars.&nbsp; This will give better relief to Singaporeans in the&nbsp;sandwich class in this difficult time and free up some cash which could be especially useful for the newly unemployed. &nbsp;Going forward, we should also adopt a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax system as a built-in stabiliser.&nbsp; Taxing Singaporeans for income earned the previous year where they may have <p align=left>Column: 1638<p>earned significant bonuses or were at the very least working, could be especially burdensome for those that have been laid-off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, from an economic perspective, if the export sector continues to sink, we cannot logically rely on that to boost demand.&nbsp; As a Government, we should also use other ways, such as priming consumption to stimulate demand and bolster the economy.</p></P></span></div>    <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As such, larger Government measures directed at the people could be seen as a recessionary counter-cyclical bonus to pick up the slack from the export slump.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All families&nbsp;&ndash; from low-income to the needy middle-income - should be given food vouchers, GST credits and utility rebates, based solely on their household income.&nbsp; Because there could be discrepancies&nbsp;&ndash; a family of five who live in a 3-room HDB flat but have&nbsp;three family members working and those who live in a semi-detached house but have the sole breadwinner retrenched.&nbsp; He has to support three children and a wife.&nbsp; Giving food vouchers, GST credits and utility rebates based on household income would be fairer since both families pay taxes, and both families have bills to pay regularly.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, households are under tremendous strain now.&nbsp; To prevent any large scale default on mortgage payments like what happened in the US, which a major recession like this just do if people continue to lose jobs, I support MP Inderjit Singh's call to defer principal mortgage payments for HDB mortgages.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also look into providing rebates for non-working mothers since they also contribute to the economy indirectly.&nbsp; This is not only in line with our idea of making Singapore an inclusive society, but it is also in line with our policy of encouraging marriage, families and parenthood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1639<p> And what if the sole breadwinner loses his job?&nbsp; I suggest we establish an income relief loan, subject to a cap,&nbsp;where the person can draw upon at a low interest rate, say, 2% per annum for 12 to 24 months. This is practical and useful, given the increasingly volatile nature of our global economy and in lieu of the unemployment insurance.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in this recession,&nbsp; PMETs&nbsp; need assistance more than ever before.&nbsp; With Singapore being plugged into the global economy, the new&nbsp;reality here in Singapore is that increasingly, more white-collar workers will be affected.&nbsp; I am glad that the Government has acknowledged this with its targeted 46&nbsp; Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP) by year-end, and its enhanced SPUR offerings.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 2006 Budget debate, I urged the Government to target assistance to these PMETs.&nbsp; I commend the WDA for expanding the SPUR programme from 150 to 800 courses, covering up to advanced diploma courses at polytechnics and selected tertiary courses at UniSIM and the&nbsp;three publicly funded universities.&nbsp; PMETs are usually well educated, and such higher level courses will directly benefit them. And now, when they enrol in such courses, they get paid for the hours spent taking a course&nbsp;&ndash; a training allowance&nbsp;&ndash; for the duration of the course, instead of at the end of it.&nbsp; That will help in managing daily expenses.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, even with all these changes, only a small number of higher education and training providers get funding in offering these SPUR-approved courses.&nbsp; If we are serious about assisting everyone who has been hit by this economic crisis, we must also be serious about reaching out to as many as possible through funding a wider range of educational providers.&nbsp; The Government can, together with industry experts, <p align=left>Column: 1640<p>devise a list of criteria to set certain standards for such SPUR course providers, as examples to other providers like&nbsp;SHRI and MDIS.&nbsp;&shy;I declare here that I am the President of SHRI.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government has been creative in introducing the PCP.&nbsp; This is farsighted but I caution the Government not to err too much on the side of anticipating future employer or market demands.&nbsp; We must also balance that with human resource capabilities and interests.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does this mean for managing surplus executive-level human capital?&nbsp; For those who are looking for opportunities to market their acquired skills, the Government working together with relevant agencies,&nbsp;even&nbsp;the private or NGO sector, can assist them.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along these lines, for the PMET group, what would also benefit them is&nbsp;(1) a database of these PMETs&nbsp; to enable the Government to assist them in job placement; (2) a network hub for companies and PMETs to further facilitate job and business opportunities; and (3) a scheme to enable the establishment of micro-enterprises of any nature&nbsp;&ndash; not just in the Government-targeted science or engineering fields, as what many of the Government incentive schemes are now aiming at.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a prolonged downturn, many larger companies will be keen to outsource certain business functions such as human resources, IT management as well as marketing.&nbsp; PMETs with such skill sets could assist companies with such work, thereby gaining useful employment for themselves while enabling companies to stay trim and lean.&nbsp; The Government can provide funding to companies who contract with these consultants.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, it is a "SPUR for employers".</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me to the issue of medical insurance for the unemployed or self-<p align=left>Column: 1641<p>employed.&nbsp; Currently, if a person is unemployed,&nbsp;it is&nbsp;likely that he does not have medical insurance.&nbsp; If&nbsp;he is&nbsp;hospitalised or requires outpatient hospital care during&nbsp;his period of unemployment,&nbsp;he will probably choose to pay&nbsp;the fees by withdrawing from his Medisave Account, up to a certain limit.&nbsp; But the coverage is at a very basic level. &nbsp;I suggest that the Government provides more medical insurance coverage for the unemployed.&nbsp; When they find work again, they can repay the Government.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, if the person has an existing medical insurance policy from, say, a private insurer, I suggest that&nbsp;the Government help pay for the premiums during the period of unemployment.&nbsp; The affected person can repay at no interest charge after resuming employment.&nbsp; To encourage speedy repayment, interest charges can kick in if the person finds employment again, either with a company or through self-employment, but does not settle these arrears.&nbsp; Again, we can use the CPF payroll to ascertain when such medical insurance premium payments can be discontinued.&nbsp; Some self-employed who do not make much do not need to contribute to CPF.&nbsp; For such cases, we should continue to assist in premium payments, reviewing them on a periodic basis, perhaps yearly when they file their income taxes.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to acknowledge the EDB funding to assist fresh graduates with on-the-job training. Perhaps we can take a cue from the UK where the government there is creating internships in order to provide university graduates with work experience.&nbsp; Internships would provide the new graduate with a holistic induction into the world of work, thus making them even&nbsp;more attractive to employers.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken as a whole, the Budget has substantive measures that show a prudent but realistic Government at work.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1642<p> However, we can and should improve this Budget and use more of our financial resources at our disposal.&nbsp; Our Government has never over-spent over an office term.&nbsp; Our reserves are large.&nbsp; Our fiscal prudence is meant to protect us on a rainy day.&nbsp; It is now, not just a rainy day, it is a hurricane! &nbsp;If ever there was a time to use our financial resources to boost our economy and assist our strained society, it is now!</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must not let this "global economic tsunami" become a "spiritual tsunami", sapping our optimism and increasing our cynicism about the future and about the Government.&nbsp; Yes, the Government must seek all ways to bolster the economy and aid the people.&nbsp; Above all, let us all be optimistic, and nurture a sense of care and share in the community, where everyone from the humblest to the wealthiest steps forward, to do something for himself or others, so that all can sail through this storm safely.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to end by sharing how the residents of&nbsp; Boon Lay, my constituency, and the larger Singapore community have started doing it.&nbsp; When we started a fund raising project for needy residents&nbsp;five months ago with a target of $1.5 million, we were filled with trepidation as the economic clouds were growing darker around us.&nbsp; We persisted in unity and managed to raise&nbsp;a tidy sum of $2.68 million in&nbsp;five months!&nbsp; We did this partly through a unique fund raising model, banding everybody together for&nbsp; a common cause,&nbsp; selling of cookbooks with recipes from Boon Lay residents, hawkers&nbsp;themselves as well as from supporters, including&nbsp; Mrs Yusof&nbsp; Ishak.&nbsp; We were also fortunate to have the active support and participation of our President Nathan. Donors ranged from Boon Lay residents to the well-known Lee Foundation. The proceeds will be used to develop an Elderly Wellness Centre, and the Lee Kong Chian Academic and Character Enhancement Centre for latchkey children, many <p align=left>Column: 1643<p>of whom do not get proper meals or academic guidance.&nbsp; A scholarship programme has also been launched for needy student leaders of the Boon Lay Youth Club.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that dishing out more money is not the answer to tide over financial difficulties.&nbsp; It is, at best, an interim measure.&nbsp; More important would&nbsp; be the programmes that provide the foundation to help those in need&nbsp; to survive.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, dipping more into our reserves must be carried out within the boundary laid out, and I support Senior Minister's call for the three guidelines to be in place in the use of our reserves.&nbsp; I believe in the generosity and the can-do spirit of Singaporeans, rich and poor, to help each other and help themselves, and not just depend on the Government alone.&nbsp; And my fellow citizens, I ask&nbsp;them to tap into that can-do spirit which is within all of us, and use it to light our way.&nbsp; As this song says, "Yesterday is dead and gone; tomorrow is out of sight."&nbsp; Let me now adapt the last line, "Come, let's walk side by side, helping one another make it through the night."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In our Budget debate last year, measures were aimed at invigorating the Singapore economy.&nbsp; Throughout last year, we had been inoculating ourselves from the financial pandemic.&nbsp; In the US, President Bush had touted a US$150&nbsp;billion stimulus package and a year later, the Obama Administration is now pushing through a US$825&nbsp;billion stimulus package.&nbsp; Indeed, a Bloomberg report cited the market capitalisation of&nbsp;five global <p align=left>Column: 1644<p>banks, namely, Citigroup, HSBC, UBS, JP Morgan and RBS, had&nbsp;their combined US$870&nbsp;billion market capitalisation reduced to US$240&nbsp;billion as of January 2009.&nbsp; A massive plunge of over US$630 billion&nbsp;of market value wiped out and this is just for these&nbsp;five banks!&nbsp; This has resulted in the knock-on effects to the credit markets and the associated credit crunch.<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were hopes early last year by some economists that a decoupling effect of many economies from the US would shelter&nbsp;from the US recession.&nbsp; Well, even the man in the street now will tell you that was wishful thinking.&nbsp; Hindsight is indeed 20/20.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having foresight as a description of this year's Budget may be premature at the moment, but I think the Resilience Package presented by the Minister of Finance is best described as being innovative, inventive and inspiring!</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resilience, or in Mandarin, "<I>kang ya xin</I> ", is the capacity to withstand shock without permanent deformation or rupture; tending to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change.&nbsp; Simply put,&nbsp; resilient can be described as the ability&nbsp;to bounce back from adversity.&nbsp; However, to be able to&nbsp;bounce back, we must first recognise the unwelcome truths&nbsp;that these are extraordinary times and the harsh realities we are confronted with today are unprecedented.&nbsp; The Government has never shirk its responsibility of facing up to harsh and unwelcome truths and thus the extraordinary budgetary measures in 2009 and the bold move to dip into our reserves.&nbsp; We have had many robust debates in this House whenever it came to our reserves, many bloody noses too, figuratively, and also accusation from some quarters said that the Government was hoarding our reserves.&nbsp; If we had not been careful, if we had not guarded our reserves, I shudder to think what few options we would have at our disposal <p align=left>Column: 1645<p>today.&nbsp; Therefore, I was glad to hear, at several grassroots functions, that our citizens can now identify with the Government's stand on guarding our reserves through the tough times we have had.&nbsp; Singaporeans also understand that by dipping into the reserves today, Singapore is&nbsp;indeed steering&nbsp;through a very rough sea.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is this realisation in mind that the innovative Jobs Credit programme has resonated with our citizens and businesses.&nbsp; We need to keep jobs and help stem job losses. This will help Singaporeans&nbsp; "steady" ourselves as we ride through the stormy sea&nbsp;but, at the same time, prepare us for a recovery and bounce back once there&nbsp;are clear waters&nbsp;ahead.&nbsp; The keeping of jobs will&nbsp;bolster the spirit, keep the self-esteem of individuals, feed their families, and not take the fight out of our people.&nbsp; Most of all, the Jobs Credit programme will nurse the flame of a slower economy and not snuff out basic domestic demand.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>    <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The MoneySENSE programme is a good start but I feel that we should broaden financial education so that young Singaporeans can draw lessons from the current difficult economy.&nbsp; The last recession had seen many Singaporeans in a financial bind.&nbsp; I have no doubt that this time round, many will be caught again.&nbsp; From having adequate reserves, to what is an acceptable degree of leveraging, to virtues of frugality and&nbsp;investing wisely, all these virtues ring true not only for a&nbsp;government of a country, but for its citizens too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another front, I call on the Government to urge their agencies to be <p align=left>Column: 1646<p>in better sync with the reality of the economy and the sentiments of businesses.&nbsp; I cite an example.&nbsp; Many businesses have been slapped with a revised assessment of the annual value of their business facilities in 2008.&nbsp; The assessment was sent out in November 2008 and revised amounts to be collected were as much as 45% higher.&nbsp; A business owner told me that on the way to work, he heard a report over the radio from the Government calling on&nbsp;employers to save jobs and not to retrench workers to cut costs.&nbsp; Upon reaching his factory, he was greeted with a 45% increase in property tax for the year received, 11 months into the year in November 2008.&nbsp; The reality for the businessman was that factory orders and business volume had dropped by 50% to 60% from September last year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure many businesses share his plight.&nbsp; Due to the spike in oil prices, many businesses have had their cost structures and revenue drastically affected.&nbsp; When viewed against a backdrop of Government leaders asking businesses not to cut costs by cutting jobs, the receipt of an increased tax bill, at around the same time, disenchants these business owners.&nbsp; They felt a disconnect between what the Government was saying to the businesses and what their agencies were doing. &nbsp;I told the businessman that it may be due to a mix of data and process lag in the system and therefore, the timing of the assessment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But notwithstanding, I think this can be avoided.&nbsp; It creates an element of cynicism to what the Government does to help businesses.&nbsp; A 45% increase in November to be met with a 40% rebate in January the year after, has left some with a bad taste in the figurative mouths of our SMEs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the areas of Stimulating Bank Lending through the Special Risk-Sharing <p align=left>Column: 1647<p>Initiative (SRI), many SMEs have greeted this with a sense of hopeful anticipation.&nbsp; Many SMEs have felt the effects of the risk aversion of banks to lend which have also contributed to the credit crunch.&nbsp; It is indeed welcome news that the Government has identified&nbsp;this risk aversion of banks and mitigated&nbsp;it by assuming another 30% of risk, thereby increasing the portion of Government risk-sharing to 80%.&nbsp; This is a positive move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I call on the Government to monitor the loan approvals and subsequent drawdowns of the businesses.&nbsp; We have heard many anecdotes of the stringent approval processes and many have been rejected due to the PFI's lending criteria in the previous downturn.&nbsp; With an increase to 80% risk-sharing, we need to see the loans going out the door for the businesses to draw on.&nbsp; It is no use having a supply of firemen in the firehouse if they are not going out to fight the fires&nbsp;and extinguish them.&nbsp; If they act early enough, the $5.8 billion&nbsp;or a quarter of the $20.5&nbsp;billion is contingent, upon the success of this.&nbsp; Any coagulation here will mean the objective of freeing up credit will come to naught.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the&nbsp;intravenous drips that are already in place, we need to administer the solutions before our businesses are met with even more headwind.&nbsp; There will be some "unknown-unknowns" in the horizons that will exist.&nbsp; An "unknown-unknown" was perhaps the Lehman collapse in September 2008.&nbsp; For instance, perhaps, there may be a shift from a confidence crisis of banks to a growing concern of an increase in sovereign risks of countries that are shouldering corporate risks.&nbsp; What will that do down the road for our businesses?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Budget shows Singapore has the wherewithal to be resilient.&nbsp; We have made a realistic assessment, have been <p align=left>Column: 1648<p>decisive in our action and innovative in our solutions and, thankfully, a cohesive and resolute citizenry.&nbsp; As sure as the sun will rise tomorrow, the dark clouds will lift.&nbsp; I hope that with the help schemes in place within this Budget and the readiness of our Government to extend even more assistance should the situation deteriorate, we will ride out this year to be resilient and, hopefully, welcome the Year of The Tiger with a roar, if not a loud meow. &nbsp;What a difference a year will make!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

All things considered, it&nbsp; is an&nbsp;<I>uber</I> budget&nbsp;&ndash; daring, highly imaginative, responsive and precedent setting in scale and scope.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Chairman of REACH, I have the privilege of being able to gauge, at close range, the ground reactions to the Budget.&nbsp; An e-poll conducted by REACH had&nbsp;seven in 10 of the 72 respondents agreeing that the Budget addressed Singaporeans' key concerns in the light of the economic downturn and&nbsp;slightly more than&nbsp;six in 10 agreeing that the Budget will be effective in saving jobs and helping viable companies stay afloat.&nbsp; The sample size may not be huge, but at least, whatever the merits of the arguments relating to the Jobs Credit, Risk-Sharing Scheme or any other aspects of Budget 2009 being debated, this snapshot of ground sentiment is a broadly positive one.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I am&nbsp;comforted&nbsp;that the years of fiscal prudence and spending within our means, of resisting populist calls for drawing down our reserves have <p align=left>Column: 1649<p>now borne fruit, in terms of the fiscal weaponry we can muster against the advancing economic thunderstorm.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a time when other governments around the world are putting their future generations in debt&nbsp;to pay for today's stimulus packages,&nbsp;it is very reassuring to know that Singapore is able to finance deficits entirely from our own savings without borrowing a single cent, and still have capacity to spend on infrastructure, invest in R&amp;D and cut&nbsp; the corporate tax at that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, as we have already heard in this House yesterday, the uneventful manner in which the reserves have been unlocked, has raised some eyebrows. &nbsp;Concerns have also been raised as to whether jobs will indeed be saved and credit unlocked with the Jobs Credit Scheme and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative&nbsp;&ndash; the two major planks of this year's Budget.&nbsp; Arguably, we will always have our share of detractors and skeptics.&nbsp; But I submit that some of these concerns do warrant our collective action and attention. &nbsp;I would, thus,&nbsp;like to revisit&nbsp;three key initiatives of&nbsp;this Budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my parliamentary&nbsp;colleagues before me have already debated this issue extensively and intensively. Even at the risk of sounding like a broken record by repeating for the 28th time, as I am the 28th speaker for this debate, I feel it cannot be over emphasised simply because&nbsp;the decision to use past reserves is unprecedented and will have a lasting influence on future decisions to use our reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Singaporeans agree that this is well and truly the time to use our reserves, but many, myself included, are taken aback by the speed with which this decision has been made.&nbsp; Their reaction is understandable, given the Government's steadfast resistance against tapping into <p align=left>Column: 1650<p>reserves all these years, amidst strong pressures to do so at each recession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this is the first time the reserves have been tapped into, and will set the precedent for future such actions, it is important that the&nbsp;Government clearly articulates the benchmarks and circumstances under which past reserves can be drawn upon. &nbsp;Such a disclosure would help to allay the concerns of some Singaporeans&nbsp;that this could set a dangerous precedent for future governments to go down the slippery path and take the easy way out of dipping into our reserves, every time there is pressure for them to do so.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior Minister Goh has already set the tone by clarifying that past reserves should not be used for social assistance and permanent programmes and that it should only be drawn under "dire circumstances".&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be&nbsp;useful to provide some guidelines as to what would be deemed as "dire circumstances".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I appreciate that it would be difficult to anticipate and spell out fully the boundary conditions for such a drawdown, but having some clarity on the matter would be helpful to prevent future governments from facetiously labelling any economic slowdown as a cause for making a draw on our reserves.&nbsp; Moreover, regardless of our present economic circumstances, our long-term growth is expected to slow down as our economy matures.&nbsp; Reserves, once drawn, will be harder to replenish and build up.&nbsp; Should there not be some guidelines on the maximum limit or proportion of past reserves any government can draw down from each time?&nbsp; Also, should there not&nbsp;be clarity on the process leading to Presidential Assent and the role of the Council of Presidential Advisers?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>Straits Times</I>&nbsp;journalist, Chua Mui Hoong, noted that the Government's pre-emptive tapping into past reserves <p align=left>Column: 1651<p>appears to be a paradigm shift from its previous rhetoric that we should exhaust our own resources before tapping into the resources of others as a last resort.&nbsp; Will this unwittingly trigger an unhealthy mindset change among Singaporeans that it is all right to seek assistance from the Government before exhausting one's own resources, especially when we have consistently preached self-dependency as a virtue?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the very name of this Budget&nbsp;&ndash; "resilience" confirms where the Government's priorities lie.&nbsp; Given that no one knows how long and deep this recession would be, the need for off-budget measures and even to break into our war chest again is not unimaginable.&nbsp; Hence, it is important at this early stage that the Government articulates clear principles and processes for which we can dip into our reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the small businessmen to multinational corporations, Budget 2009 must be the most proactive and responsive budget ever.&nbsp; It has bolstered the confidence of companies in doing business in Singapore.&nbsp; Like someone described, it shows business that we mean business.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, whilst almost all would agree that the most sensible and practical way to help Singaporeans cope with the crisis is to help them keep their jobs, aside from the issue whether a superior outcome can be achieved by directly injecting the same cash into workers' CPF accounts or not, the more practical concern that many workers have is whether this primary objective will indeed be met.&nbsp; Again, this has been extensively debated in the House yesterday.&nbsp; Nonetheless, as the centerpiece of this year's&nbsp;Budget, it would be useful to examine how we can maximise its efficacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1652<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Jobs Credit Scheme is apportioned the largest budget in the Resilience Package, paradoxically, this is a measure that the Government has very little oversight of.&nbsp; In practice, no one can compel companies to share their cost savings with workers or to keep them on their payrolls.&nbsp; Multinational corporations, in particular, very often take their manpower cues from their overseas HQ&nbsp;and, thus, could be compelled to axe workers due to the global manpower reduction targets set by their HQ regardless, or perhaps in spite of, the Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; US President Obama is reported to have dropped a somewhat similar jobs tax credit plan, which he had initially touted as one of the chief provisions in the Stimulus Bill that is now being argued in Congress.&nbsp; The $3,000 per job credit&nbsp; to businesses for every job that is saved or created, was met with skepticism by both Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp; Many said that the scheme would be difficult to administer, prone to abuse and the potential cost could be huge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, thanks to our capable MOF administrative officers, Singapore's Jobs Credit Scheme have ingeniously surmounted the administrative difficulty presented by&nbsp; President Obama's jobs&nbsp;tax credit plan by giving jobs credit to all companies&nbsp;&ndash; small or big, local or multinational, profitable or unprofitable&nbsp;&ndash; according to the number of&nbsp;employees on the CPF payroll.&nbsp; Implemented in this manner, it is,&nbsp;first and foremost, a fiscal stimulus for all sectors of the economy, regardless of whether jobs are saved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping companies, particularly those who still have viable business models&nbsp;ride out the storm, will also benefit the economy in the longer term by allowing us to retain capabilities and get back on our feet more quickly to&nbsp;take advantage of the opportunities again when they come.&nbsp; In effect, the Jobs Credit Scheme could also be viewed as corporate <p align=left>Column: 1653<p>workfare to help companies tide over a global economic pandemic that&nbsp;they have largely no control over.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potential of the scheme to ease companies' cash flows, save jobs and avert a worse crisis is not in dispute, only its effectiveness.&nbsp; To be able to extract maximum benefits for workers from this scheme for which about a quarter of the Budget has been allocated, the Government, through MOM and WDA in conjunction with NTUC and SNEF, should go on an intensive education blitz</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

MOM and NTUC should also closely monitor the efficacy and effectiveness of the Jobs Credit Scheme over the next few months to ensure that this Scheme ultimately benefits Singaporean workers as it is intended to and that companies will indeed pass on at least some of&nbsp; the benefit of this Scheme to the workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise the Scheme should be tweaked to ensure some accountability by the companies.&nbsp; Whilst the Acting Minister for Manpower has said&nbsp; that it would be left to the companies to decide how to make use of the Jobs Credit Scheme, a completely <I>laissez faire</I> approach in this case may appear quite unproductive to Singaporean workers, concerned about their livelihood.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is a cash injection from Government coffers, arguably, the Government has the moral authority to compel recipients of the Jobs Credit Scheme&nbsp;to save jobs for Singaporeans as much as is reasonably possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an aside, MOM should review the foreign worker quota for the various sectors, since many of them were relaxed in the last few years to meet the labour <p align=left>Column: 1654<p>shortage in better times.&nbsp; Now that the economy has taken a nosedive, these quotas should be reviewed so that only those industries with jobs that Singaporeans truly and&nbsp;clearly shun, might have their quota retained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applications by companies for foreign workers, be they for Work Permit or S Pass Holders, should also be more closely scrutinised although in reality such applications would probably have plunged from pre-crisis levels.&nbsp; While we acknowledge and value the contribution of foreign workers to the economy, in times such as this, when retrenchment is predicted to be from between 40,000 to as high as 300,000, we need to save as many jobs as possible for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Citizenship should have its privileges.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A quick poll by REACH indicated that only 28% of the 885 respondents felt that the direct assistance measures to help families cope were adequate, with half of the respondents disagreeing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on feedback received, the group with the most concerns would be the lower-middle and middle-income&nbsp;&ndash; the sandwich generation&nbsp;&ndash; who have it the toughest with school-going children and, often times, elderly parents to care for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the latest employment data shows, retrenchments in the services sector multiplied nearly six-fold to 3,200 in the last quarter of 2008 driven largely by lay-offs in the financial sector and wholesale trade.&nbsp; Many economists expect this figure to climb with much of the attrition coming from the services sector.&nbsp; Hence, more PMETs are likely to be affected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the South West CDC where I am Mayor, we have already seen a 10% increase in the proportion of retrenched PMETs seeking employment assistance between September and December last year as compared to the same period in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1655<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst low income and retrenched workers whose household income is $1,500 and below will generally qualify for many of the Government's existing national assistance schemes such as work support employment or self reliance schemes, which include cash and other forms of assistance, PMETs who have been retrenched but&nbsp;whose household income is still above $1,500 per month will likely fall out of these schemes although there is some room for flexibility and exceptions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, most of the measures announced in the Budget to support families such as the GST Offset Credits are weighted in favour of the most vulnerable segment of the population, whilst the 20% income tax rebate capped at $2,000,&nbsp;although helpful,&nbsp;is similar to what was given in 2008's Budget when times were much better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allowing income tax payment to be stretched over 24 months instead of 12 months for those who are retrenched is of limited help and offers little comfort. Tax, as the taxman vigorously reminds us, is still a liability, whether payable in one lump sum, over 12 months or over 24 months.&nbsp; The anxiety of the middle-income wage earner and especially the older ones, is palpable in this economic climate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although SPUR has been enhanced for the PMETs, this may again be of limited use since many PMETs already have qualifications and professional experience and so re-skilling may not quite apply to them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PMETs adversely affected by this recession would need more focused efforts to help them tide over this period and get back on their feet again.&nbsp; The Government could, for instance, give some assurance that fair opportunity <p align=left>Column: 1656<p>would be given to mid-career applicants who are most in need of help, for the 18,000 or&nbsp;so jobs created by the Government.&nbsp; More resources and efforts should be invested to identify and devise suitable re-skilling programmes under SPUR to spur them on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These retrenched PMETs may also need some interim help to allow them to adjust to their new circumstances such as providing assistance to the family and the children&rsquo;s education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, the Government could give assurance that over the duration of this downturn, more flexibility could be accorded to help agencies to deliver assistance to the PMETs who have been retrenched and are assessed to be in need of help by relaxing the guidelines in the interim and allowing a higher household income cut off, such as the lowest 35th percentile household income instead of the lowest 20th percentile as it is now.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This way they can be assured that when they are down and out, help is at hand so that their families can continue to be cared for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst there is already some flexibility at the grassroots and CDC levels in terms of their own local assistance schemes, in view of the severity of the recession and the likelihood that this could be long drawn, we would also need the criteria for the national assistance schemes to be relaxed, at least, for the duration of this downturn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would also be helpful for the Government to exercise more flexibility towards arrears in housing mortgage and means testing for healthcare services during this period, especially for those who have been retrenched or have suffered drastic wage cuts as a result of the current recession and are assessed to be in need of help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1657<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, President Obama announced the creation of a Middle Class Task Force which aims to raise the standard of living of millions of Americans hit hard by loss of jobs, savings and homes.&nbsp; Admittedly, the majority of our middle class Singaporeans are far from the dire situation currently experienced by countless middle class Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as noted by the Minister for Finance himself, we have not seen the worst yet of this economic turmoil.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have to monitor the situation carefully and consider our next steps, including the possibility of off-budget measures to help businesses and individuals cope.&nbsp; At the same time, we should also use this opportunity to reassess and further restructure our economic growth model that has spurred our growth but at the same time makes us highly vulnerable to swings in global demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year&rsquo;s popular animated film "Bolt" has a moral. At the end of the day, it is not super canine power that saved the day for Bolt and his mistress, Penny.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;his true grit and ability to accept and adjust to the reality of the situation&nbsp;that he is not a super canine as well as the support and encouragement from the friends he had made in his quest to save her &ndash;&nbsp;the somewhat cynical and worldly wise Mittens, the cat,&nbsp;and the highly adorable and trusting hamster, Rhino.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applied to us, fiscal firepower, however large the calibre of the weapon, will only go so far.&nbsp; The people of Singapore must each do our part to help one another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker Sir, I support the Resilience Package.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I> ): [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2009/20090204/20090204VS_112814.pdf"">Appendix A</a>*.</I> ]&nbsp; I believe that everyone <p align=left>Column: 1658<p>knows by now that in this year&rsquo;s Budget, the Government strives to create more job opportunities so that we can have stable income.&nbsp; The Government will maintain peace and order in Singapore so that we can go out and establish our career without any fear or anxiety.<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government&rsquo;s main concern is to help our people retain their rice bowl, lower the unemployment rate and help our manufacturers to ride out this crisis.&nbsp; We hope that the employers would cooperate with the workers by providing more flexible work arrangements and training opportunities, so that once economy is recovered, the workers can work hand-in-hand with the company to make greater contribution.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, some countries are facing bankruptcy, yet our Government is able to allocate funds at this difficult time to help our businesses invest in their workers and indirectly helping our Singapore citizens.&nbsp; This goes to show that the Singapore Government&rsquo;s rational and prudent approach in managing surpluses has made&nbsp;our coffer rich and abundant, so that when the thunderstorm comes, we have the reserves that we can rely upon.&nbsp; So I hope that all our people will understand the intentions of the Government and the plans to help our economy recover.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us go forward together, especially during this time of economic recession,&nbsp; look after one another, be concerned and care for one another and be full of confidence for the future and the Government, so as to build a harmonious and loving society to march towards a future that is bright and prosperous.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I> ): Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;the Jobs Credit has earned applause from many quarters. This is the&nbsp;eighth&nbsp;Budget session&nbsp;that I am sitting in&nbsp;and I would like to say to the Prime Minister that this Budget is really one that has the workers' <p align=left>Column: 1659<p>perspective and their needs in mind.&nbsp; In it, he has shown affection, care and concern for the people.&nbsp; I believe the same principles were applied by Minister Tharman as well.&nbsp; Let me comment on this element of LOVE that I will time and again make mention throughout my speech today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must continue to address socio-community needs despite facing challenges posed by the economic crisis.&nbsp; The key is to look into the needs of the people that we seek to help, to be bold and be flexible in implementation of our policies. Take the Catholic High School as an example. In 2006, the school made a bold step to allow students to take&nbsp;"O" level examination subjects that they preferred to study instead of choosing from fixed subject combinations which most schools do.&nbsp; In this way, students study the subjects that interest them.&nbsp; The result: they excelled in the&nbsp;"O" level examination.&nbsp; In fact, from a total of 43 top students island-wide, 12 were from Catholic High School, with all scoring nine straight A1s.&nbsp; So now, Catholic High School has achieved its aim of being a top school not through selecting students and raising the&nbsp;entry point of PSLE scores but this was achieved because the principal has care and taken cognisance of the students' interest and needs.&nbsp; He listened to the students and trusted them to speak their minds.&nbsp; He dared to be creative and be flexible in his approach to issues.&nbsp; He knows that there will be more work for his teachers and administrative staff, a total of 100+ combination of subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because of his love for the children, he took that Bold Step.&nbsp; We need more civil servants like him and I would like to urge all the civil servants, while drafting and implementing policies, to look at the needs of the people and look at their perspectives.&nbsp; And this is what I coined the LOVE approach that one should adopt when drafting and <p align=left>Column: 1660<p>implementing social community policies with a passion to help the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that retrenchments and recession are invariably intertwined.&nbsp; Unemployment rates are expected to be much worse during this recession, a fact underscored by&nbsp;the recent announcement made by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), as many as 51 million jobs worldwide could be lost in 2009.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be realistic, we must be prepared for the prospect of higher job attrition this year.&nbsp; But I am also confident that the Jobs Credit Scheme will help to reduce the attrition by mitigating their wage cost.&nbsp; Here I would like to commend NTUC Chief, Minister Lim Swee Say, for his timely manner in speaking for the workers and chiding those employers who take the easy route of retrenchment without an after thought. The message is loud and clear:&nbsp; Keep the workers and take the opportunity to cross train the workers to make them flexible by upgrading their skills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have raised the question of&nbsp;why has the Government has&nbsp;decided to introduce this Scheme instead of simply lowering CPF contribution rates. &nbsp;I am glad that the Government did not lower CPF contribution rates as it would have a detrimental impact on our residents, many of whom have to service home mortgage loans.&nbsp; A lower CPF contribution rate may cause&nbsp;our residents&nbsp;to stall their monthly mortgage repayments. We would then have on our hands, our own version of "sub prime".&nbsp; As it stands, there are already concerns about whether those who bought properties at the&nbsp;peak during 2007 under deferred payment schemes would be able to honour their commitments when the projects are completed in the course of the year or the year after.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also quarters within the community who grumbled because they <p align=left>Column: 1661<p>do not&nbsp;get more cash to take home. What they do not understand is that the Jobs Credit Scheme helps them to stay on their jobs.&nbsp; We do not know how long the recession would last and by helping them&nbsp;keep their jobs, their families would benefit.&nbsp; And this is even more valuable and beneficial in the long run than a one-time payout or a few-time payouts. Here, the details&nbsp;of the GST Offsets and the Senior Citizen's Bonus should be given more highlight by the major media, or MOF could prepare some materials to circulate to the ground.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1839-1840.<BR></div></P></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While on the Jobs Credit Scheme, I hope the Government would explore how to refine the scheme to further motivate employers who are standing at the edge in deciding whether or not to let their workers go. We must encourage them to retain rather than to retrench their workers. One suggestion is to give more cash to companies that retain majority of their workers and give less to companies, which despite the incentives given, have resorted to trim their workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important that both employees and employers must work together hand in hand to look into the company's strategies to survive in this difficult time and also in the long-term. Once the goal is clear, training and convincing workers to train&nbsp;or to start shorter work-weeks will be part of the day's business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative (SRI) has opened up the credit lines for small and medium enterprises, however, the cost is high.&nbsp; I am told that one bank&nbsp;has offered 12.5% for the loan and after much negotiation,&nbsp;it has just lowered by 0.5% to 12%.&nbsp; The interest would be an added burden in the progress of business. MOF has to work closely with the banks to mitigate such high costs of loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who have already been laid off, the Government has already put in <p align=left>Column: 1662<p>place many measures to support them in their effort to regain employment. For example, the MOM/WDA Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) programme, and the NTUC's e2i centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent half an hour two days ago to access the two websites, ie, the WDA as well as e2i, as an unemployed. The WDA website, like many, are keen to offer much information but&nbsp;it does not approach it from the workers'&nbsp;needs. The websites provided a&nbsp;list of jobs available. I am excited and I just clicked on, for example, "health attendant". To my disappointment,&nbsp;under "qualification needed",&nbsp;the column mentioned the training provider.&nbsp; The e2i website has more information. It stated that the healthcare sector has 6,400 vacancies. When I clicked on it, it showed the jobs available, the salary range and also the entry requirements. I delved further and it prompted me if I want to apply for the job, I must fill in a form and I must&nbsp;attend a job fair or go down to the centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to appeal to these agencies to put up dedicated websites to assist the unemployed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the&nbsp;LOVE approach&nbsp;which I mentioned earlier, as a retrenched person, I need to know what are the jobs available for me. How can I apply online? If I cannot&nbsp;qualify, can I find something suitable? What are the courses relative to my qualifications and how can I tap on them?&nbsp; And finally, if I cannot find something suitable for me, I may, as a last resort, consider switching career and go for retraining. However, this is going to be very painful. Next, I will ask: what is the course fee that I have to pay? How long is the course? Can I get some kind of allowance for my home while I go for training? These are pertinent questions. I know these are all available in the various websites but can we not&nbsp;put together in one particular website to help our unemployed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1663<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another laudable decision by the Government is the doubling of the amount of GST Offset Credits this year. However, I would like to ask for more. The medical bills are on the increase month after month. More could be given in terms of the senior citizens' bonus to help defray the cost of rising medical bills. My concern is that families may cut medical bills to channel the money to pay for households needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wall Street saga has taught us many things. Among the lessons learnt, one is about greed, the other is about financial surveillance.&nbsp;All the firms had their accounts audited and certified as complying with regulatory requirements, yet each passing day throws&nbsp;up some kind of fraud and malfeasance of such magnitude that further aggravates the financial and economic crisis. It is a stark reminder to us all in Singapore that we should either re-examine the system of accounting and accountability of auditors, or review our system and test it to ascertain its strengths and weaknesses. Public confidence will be shaken if we were to have a Madoff or Ponzi saga in our midst. The Monetary Authority of Singapore could well prod our Singapore Stock Exchange and other financial bodies to act proactively and give closer scrutiny without waiting for the hurricane to descend and rip off the roofs over their heads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Here again, we need to apply the LOVE approach and look at the ground needs. There is an urgent need to upgrade the capacities of our current polyclinics, where long queues are the order of the day.&nbsp;Singapore is also on track to be the world's third-fastest ageing nation, with 20% of its population aged 65 and above by 2020.&nbsp; They are making very visible presence at our polyclinics. We must find a way to help these senior citizens get <p align=left>Column: 1664<p>medical treatment in a timely manner and have more specialised help at the community level. We must not only provide more polyclinics but also counselling centres, physiotherapy centres and mental wellness centres.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to appeal here personally on behalf of a group of residents that are mentally not stable. We have not looked squarely into their eyes for a long time. Not only them, but we have also not helped their families. Many have been left behind to cope with their dependents on their own. We really need the LOVE approach to this issue. Many families have difficulty seeking help as they are either embarrassed and do not want to face the&nbsp;stigma from the society. I have checked.&nbsp; There are only three day care centres in Singapore for the mentally-ill patients. I have made a cold call and spoken to one occupational therapist taking care of one of these centres. He has two other colleagues who are helping him to take care of about 40 to 50 customers a day. And they are under-staffed. The average age of their customers are aged 30 to 40 years old. Physically, these are very healthy men and women in their prime. Yet, they need long-term medication. The burden on the family is very high.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have done well in our community support for our elderly. We have neighbourhood links, senior citizen connects and we&nbsp;must&nbsp;have similar networks for our mentally unstable patients. Presently, many of our community leaders and volunteers do not understand the various ailments relating to mental health, let alone how to help them and support them and their family members. I am appealing that our Health Promotion Board and the Ministry of Health to help share this&nbsp;knowledge on&nbsp;the ground. I would also appeal for more VWOs to come forward to set up such community support centres to support these residents and their families with&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1665<p>help from the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other end of the spectrum, we should also take a look at the needs of the youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, in the past five years, glue-sniffing has been on the rise, especially among young people. Within just the first half of last year, 352 inhalant abusers were caught . This is an alarmingly huge figure that demands our&nbsp;attention. Furthermore, more than half of these people are under 20, with the majority being students. We have just done a review in the primary school. Can we have a serious review of the secondary school? Can we use the LOVE approach to look at the secondary school curriculum to see how we can support the dual working parents? How do we motivate our children? Can we cut down the drop-out rate? I am concerned&nbsp;about the moral values of our young wards. &nbsp;The sexual offences involving young people are on the rise. The teenage years need more guidance from parents and school supports. Can we spare more resources on development of life skills, more resources for CCA?&nbsp;&nbsp;Many are kept out of meaningful CCA and sports as many schools claim that they do not have enough resources and facilities. They only concentrated on achieving the sports excellence awards which the sports club should now take over instead of the schools.&nbsp; If we use the LOVE approach, maybe, we should have an award for schools with the&nbsp;highest participation rate in sports,&nbsp;arts, music and maybe, in theatre works too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is one Budget that will take us on&nbsp;an uphill climb. But I am confident that we have a headstart as we have adopted a LOVE approach in first introducing the Jobs Credit and we hope that more of the Ministries could approach their policies and implementation on the same basis.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 1666<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> (<I>In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2009/20090204/20090204VS_112930.pdf"">Appendix A</a>*.</I> ] &nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget this year is $20.5 billion. Although the amount is very big, apart from the additional GST rebate, there&nbsp;are no other provisions to help the unemployed or retrenched. This is something of great concern to us.&nbsp; I believe that Singaporeans do understand the importance of self-reliance and to be able to fend for themselves. They want to be able to support their family, and be proud of it.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, faced with the global recession and many companies&nbsp; running into losses, it is inevitable that many workers may be retrenched.&nbsp; With the cost of employing foreign workers being lower, the possibility of local workers being retrenched is much higher. With this rising number of unemployed Singaporeans, although the Government has launched a number of training programmes and the Jobs Credit scheme designed with the hope of keeping retrenchment under control, I think that the Government should also have some <I>ad hoc</I> measures to help those who are retrenched and already unemployed&nbsp;to meet their daily needs.&nbsp; I know that&nbsp;the Government has&nbsp;always been very apprehensive about any welfare scheme but in these extraordinary times, apart from training, I think the Government should also give some financial assistance to the unemployed so that their families could tide over these difficult times.&nbsp; I would suggest a short-term financial assistance scheme&nbsp;could be called&nbsp;a Job-seekers' Allowance.&nbsp; Applicants&nbsp;must show that they are actively looking for work and did not unreasonably reject job offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowance would be pegged at the equivalent to 50% of their last drawn salary, subject to a cap of $500. The moment the economy&nbsp;recovers, the scheme should be scrapped.&nbsp; I hope that the Government would seriously consider this suggestion.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1841-1842.<BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1667<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I> ):&nbsp;&nbsp;For the average Singaporean, $20.5 billion is a sum out of this world.&nbsp; Even with that, economists and the Government agreed that this will not take us out of recession but is aimed at saving jobs.&nbsp; That is the interesting part.&nbsp; How effective would the $20.5 billion be in minimising pain, hence saving jobs?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all hope to save jobs. Whether jobs will be saved and how many, remains to be seen.&nbsp; But what we know for sure is that jobs will inadvertently be lost.&nbsp; The <I>Weekend Business Time</I>,&nbsp;31st&nbsp;January to 1st February, the cover's headline was "Business braces for six months of deepening gloom", quoting Government data from the Department of Statistics and the EDB, across a broad range of industries, from retail to hospitality and manufacturing.&nbsp; The next page was a story entitled "Singapore's job market shrinks", stating that as December, the number of Singapore residents who were jobless stood at 73,100, which was a 58% jump year-on-year.&nbsp; Looking ahead by all accounts, the unemployment situation is expected to worsen for the first half of the year.&nbsp; How is the Government planning to deal with the rest of the unemployed which will grow in the coming months?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The average Singaporean knows that no one owes them a living. He or she treasures the self-respect which comes with being able to provide for the family, to strive for a better life. To this day, I still meet low-wage earners who refuse tips from customers. Singaporeans are now caught in&nbsp;a global slump.&nbsp; Many have been or will be displaced from their jobs, not of their own doing, not out of laziness, but due to factors beyond their control.</p></span></div   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The consequences of being unemployed are not just economic but social. Unemployment has long been associated with higher crime rates and family <p align=left>Column: 1668<p>breakdown. More family quarrels and&nbsp;marriage breakdowns are likely. There may also be inter-generational effects, such as not being able to afford children's education, which will perpetuate the family sinking further into poverty. I, myself, have seen young people being asked by desperate parents to quit their education to work to support the family. This will increase the income divide in our society. If we believe that the family is the building block of the society, then this will weaken our society as a whole and, as a nation, we should all be concerned to avoid this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the Budget respond to these risks? Yes, the ideal is to get people back to work. But what if they cannot resume work immediately? One possible hint of any help for the unemployed comes from SPUR, where an unemployed person can enrol for training and apply for&nbsp;a training allowance of some sort. However, no sum or formula is mentioned on the SPUR&nbsp;website. There is a course fee subsidy which, I assume, means that the unemployed would still&nbsp;need to pay something for the course. Courses will end before the downturn ends. Some unemployed may also fall out of the SPUR net.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ruling party's aversion to anything akin to unemployment benefits is well known. However, the problem of having unemployed will remain. Globalisation will continue to test us as jobs are off-shored to cheaper locations. Even if jobs remained here, Singaporeans may lose jobs to foreign workers. While it is right that these unemployed Singaporeans must be upskilled, wherever possible, full employment at the national level is unlikely. The Government will have to provide a policy response and safety net to these citizens in the medium to long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for now, in these extraordinary times, a lifeline should be thrown to the <p align=left>Column: 1669<p>unemployed besides the offer of&nbsp;training. My view is that the Government should provide at least a temporary financial assistance programme for job seekers during this period of global crisis. We could call this a Job Seeker's Allowance. Since the outlook is bleak in the next six months, the scheme could be instituted for six months and thereafter extended if the downturn persists. Such temporary assistance could be in the form of a monthly allowance of half the person's previous salary, subject to a&nbsp;strict cap of about $500 per month, which is pegged at subsistence plus. To ensure that such&nbsp;assistance is targeted only to those who need it, a means test should be designed to weed out those with significant savings, assets or family income in the same household. To reinforce the work ethic, the applicant will qualify only if he is actively looking for work and has not unreasonably rejected job offers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe there is scope for the Government to seriously examine such a scheme clearly targeted at those who are unemployed at this time. In this most trying of times, this will be an important relief to our job seekers while they continue with their job search.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I next move on to the topic of minimising pain. The Government has given rebates on various taxes which should be of some help to businesses. However, one of the main causes of pain for everyone is still there and that is the Goods and Services Tax at 7%. In the run-up to the Budget Statement,&nbsp; Prime Minister Lee had already made clear that&nbsp;a GST cut was&nbsp;not on the cards. The reason given was that since Singapore was a highly open economy, any stimulation of consumption demand would not be very effective, due to high import leakages, ie,&nbsp;consume imported goods and services, and the benefits of consumption will go to foreign suppliers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1670<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it has been pointed out by economists, like NUS' Prof. Basant Kapur, that to ignore the demand side of the Budget would not be advisable. A few reasons were cited. First, Singapore's Input-Output Tables 2000 (which was the latest available) showed that the import content of&nbsp;consumption expenditure was about 34%, whereas the domestic value-added content was about 54%. Secondly, consumption domestic demand was particularly important to the SMEs, which accounted for 55% of total employment and especially to the wholesale, retail and commercial service sectors. Third, targeted GST Credits at the less well-off were unlikely to provide as broad-based a stimulus to consumption as an across-the-board 2% GST reduction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In yesterday's <I>Straits Times Forum</I> page, Prof. Kapur further noted that GST Credits are targeted at only Singapore citizens above 21. Therefore, everybody else&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Singaporeans who are below 21, permanent residents, foreign labour and tourists&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;do not benefit from the GST Credits. If the GST rate was reduced, everyone would benefit and, presumably, be more willing to spend. This will provide a more broad-based stimulus to the economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the effect of GST on the cost of living is significant and real. When the 2% hike in 2007 kicked in, the Consumer Price Index rose by about 1.5%. Reducing the GST by 2% would thus lower the overall cost of living for everyone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is just focusing on&nbsp;a supply-side Budget wise?&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the growth forecasts, even after factoring the stimulus accorded by the Budget, the economic growth figures for 2009 are expected at around -2% to -5% of GDP contraction. This seems to support the argument that the Government should have paid attention to the demand side as well. It is still not too late for the<p align=left>Column: 1671<p> Government to consider a cut in the GST rate by 2%. Any such cut will cost the Government about $1.8 billion, within the Government's means. In any case, the revenue loss will probably be less if people start consuming more as expected. If needed, the Government could reduce additional GST Credits given to those who are better off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, lastly, use of past reserves. Finally, Government is asking for Parliament's approval to use past reserves without information on how much we have in current reserves. We are told that this package does not need us to dig into the past reserves, yet we are doing it because, and I quote the Finance Minister,&nbsp;"it gives us the resources that we need to deal decisively with the current economic crisis and also ensures that we have all the resources we need to correspond to the considerable uncertainties that lie ahead. It will give us full flexibility to respond as the situation requires, and to pre-empt the severe consequences that this crisis could have for our economy and our society."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With due respect to the Finance Minister, that does not tell us very much. How close are we to depleting our current reserves? If things go well, we may not need to have drawn on past reserves at all. Why cannot we not&nbsp;go to the President only when we need to draw? Is the approval process very cumbersome? Is the drawdown on past reserves needed because the Government has lost money in its investments of current reserves? In my view, some answers are badly needed before a considered decision can be made.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang):</B> Sir, a clarification.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;</I> <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2009/20090204/20090204VS_141830.pdf""><I>Appendix A</I></a> *.]&nbsp; Just now, Ms Lim said that the Government should <p align=left>Column: 1672<p>consider her suggestion,&nbsp;ie, to set aside a sum of money to subsidise the unemployed or&nbsp;those who are retrenched, with a ceiling of $500. And yesterday, we heard in the debate that Mr Low Thia Khiang was strongly against the Government's decision to draw down on the reserves. We know that this Budget is already a&nbsp;deficit budget, yet Ms Lim is saying that we would have to have this scheme.&nbsp;Then where are we going to get this money? Are we to draw down more from our reserves?</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1843-1844.<BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Based on my suggestion, the amount prescribed for allowance is a maximum of $500 and it also relates back to the retrenched person's last drawn pay. So, we are talking about any sum between&nbsp;$0&nbsp;and $500, depending on how much the jobless worker was earning previously. And, secondly, even if we just&nbsp;take a ball-park figure and calculate, assuming that 100,000 people come under this scheme, if you multiply that by six months by $500, you will get a sum of $300 million and that is not even 10% of the Jobs Credit Scheme. As debated yesterday, our position is that there is going to be a considerable amount of wastage at the Jobs Credit Scheme and some of that money is better used in this instance to put it directly&nbsp;into the hands of the people who need it most, rather than to companies which have no intention to retrench anyone. So, I do not think that we are breaking the bank and the&nbsp;Finance Minister has not even told us how much we have in the&nbsp;current reserves. So, this question is something that I do not think I can confirm&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that we need to dig into the past reserves&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;because there is no basis for me to say that.<p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</B> Sir,&nbsp;is the Member aware that for those people, they can actually turn to CDC or&nbsp;the local CCC for ComCare assistance?

So, what we are proposing to the Government is that this scheme be implemented so that the unemployed who are really taking effort to seek jobs,&nbsp;will know that at the very least, there is this either half pay or up to $500 that they will get if they satisfy the criteria. I think the difference here is that there will be much more clarity and those who are at the position of job-risk, there will be a greater assurance for them that, okay, this is what&nbsp;they can get if&nbsp;they need to draw on it, and&nbsp;they can go and apply for it.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Cham Hui Fong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Cham Hui Fong (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, there was a lot of anxiety amongst the businesses, the workers, the unions and&nbsp;Singaporeans, before the Budget was unveiled on 22nd January.&nbsp; Bringing the Budget forward sent the right signal that the Budget will be here to help boost the economy and, of course, to keep jobs. We are here today, not just to debate what ought to be included and what ought not to be included in this Budget. But, importantly, I think we ought to send the right signal to our workers and employers out there that we are serious that this Budget will help us through this crisis.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On jobs for Singaporeans, we are pleasantly surprised that with the unprecedented measures introduced&nbsp;this year, especially the Jobs Credit Scheme, last year, 13,000 workers were retrenched at the national level.&nbsp; Just in the fourth&nbsp;quarter of 2008, there were 7,000&nbsp;workers hit versus&nbsp;6,400 workers in the first three quarters. So, we could see that retrenchment is actually increasing rapidly.&nbsp;Look at the unionised sectors. In the&nbsp;unionised sectors, we have 3,800 workers retrenched for the whole <p align=left>Column: 1674<p>of last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;We did a comparison, it is about 28% of the national figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we take a look&nbsp;at the past years' records. The past records show that in terms of the proportion of the share, the unionised sectors usually take up about 40% to 50%. &nbsp;In&nbsp;1998 and 1999, it was 45% and 54% respectively, but last year, it was 29%. So for&nbsp;the 29%, did it happen by chance? The answer is no. So we asked ourselves, are the unionised sectors more insulated from retrenchments? Are they doing better than the rest? Again,&nbsp;the manufacturing sectors bear the brunt in all retrenchments, and we represent most of the manufacturing companies, big and small. And we were asked whether we only represent the bigger companies that are performing better. &nbsp;Again, the answer is no, because we do represent the MNCs as well as the&nbsp;SMEs. And we know that this year, or&nbsp;in fact the end of last year, many MNCs were also badly hit.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we take a look and&nbsp;we&nbsp;realise that we have been working with the tripartite partners over the years, to build up the trust and confidence with the employers and with our people.&nbsp;We have adopted the tripartite guidelines on managing excess manpower, and we actually applied it in a timely manner&nbsp;to ensure that the companies are coping with&nbsp;the crisis of having low or no orders.&nbsp;We put them onto shorter work weeks or temporary lay-offs. We explained to the workers to make them understand and accept&nbsp;that.&nbsp;And this will help to, at least, stave off retrenchments. In other cases, they could have just resorted to retrenchment. We have also put in place flexible wage systems and work arrangements&nbsp;to ensure that we can actually optimise the manpower and also cut costs, if necessary, to save jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But again, we look at the number of workers on shorter work weeks. Last year, there were a total of 16,000 <p align=left>Column: 1675<p>workers that were put on shorter work weeks because we have been working with the companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;They put them on shorter work weeks instead of retrenching them immediately. 16,000 of them were put on shorter work weeks versus 22,800 of them in 2004. That was the highest since last year. It was&nbsp;22,000 because of the spillover effect of SARS in 2003.&nbsp; Just the first quarter of this year, we have 21,000 workers already affected or will be affected by shorter work weeks and changes are already taking place in the companies. There&nbsp;are already negotiations on whether we should put them on three-day or four-day work week. And there are already changes in the shift patterns, from three shifts to&nbsp;two shifts to one shift, and a lot of them have even gone on&nbsp;temporary layoff, which means that they do not even have to come back to work for a period of time, two weeks or one month.</p></P></span></div>    <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, of course, we are concerned with the high number of workers on shorter work week. But, on the other hand, we are actually heartened that&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;because of the relationship that&nbsp;we have built up with the companies and workers over the years&nbsp;&ndash; we managed to gain their trust to actually work together during this period, at least to stave off retrenchment, and see how we can get ourselves out of this downturn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPUR was introduced at the right time.&nbsp; The timely announcement has also helped many of our workers make use of the lull period to go for training, something which they could not afford to do previously, either they do not want to miss their overtime or the company just does not want to release them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just recently, we spoke to WDA to sort out some arrangements on the payment of absentee payroll, because if a person is technically not working, he is <p align=left>Column: 1676<p>not entitled to absentee payroll.&nbsp; So we sorted that out and we managed to get it done which means that, effectively, as long as our workers are all on a shorter work week, they can claim the absentee payroll to ensure that they at least get part of their pay, if not full pay.&nbsp;&nbsp;We spoke to some of the companies before and after the Budget announcement.&nbsp; They are hopeful that the Singapore Government will do its best to help businesses and&nbsp;save jobs. In fact, it is with such commitment and belief that many of the MNCs have informed their HQs that Singapore will have what it takes to let them stay afloat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there will certainly be workers who worry that the Jobs Credit Scheme may not help them save jobs.&nbsp; We can understand their concerns. The Government has already done&nbsp;its part to introduce the scheme.&nbsp; What is left here is for employers, unions and workers to do their part and act responsibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One plastics moulding company with about 560 workers was doing badly,&nbsp;with its capacity&nbsp;already dropping and today, it is probably less than 50%.&nbsp; They went into temporary layoff in December, had one round of retrenchment in December, and they are now into shorter work weeks until February.&nbsp; They told us early this year that further retrenchment is unavoidable.&nbsp; We have already cut all sorts of non-wage costs, &nbsp;including cutting the AWS last December.&nbsp; We last spoke to them last Wednesday&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;third day of Chinese New Year&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and&nbsp;got a favourable response from them.&nbsp; They did their calculations and told us that now, the retrenchment numbers will be reduced considerably and, more importantly, they will retrench in batches and only the non-Singaporeans.&nbsp; And they told us that the Jobs Credit Scheme helps them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may just add, the batch that was actually retrenched in December, through the assistance of the union and, of <p align=left>Column: 1677<p>course, through the company,&nbsp;we have actually arranged training for them&nbsp;at e2i.&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand from them that after going through some days of employability camp training, they were put on training courses and given $30 training allowance, up to&nbsp;a maximum of $600 a month.&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers were telling us that although this falls short of what they were earning previously&nbsp;at $800, this is something much better than they have expected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another US semiconductor company that produces epoxy moulding compound with about 150 workers was&nbsp;also discussing with the union on possible retrenchment, shorter work weeks and SPUR before the&nbsp;Lunar New Year.&nbsp; This was the company that&nbsp;we managed to&nbsp;get WDA&nbsp;to approve their claim for absentee payroll when their workers are on shorter work weeks.&nbsp; Their SPUR training will begin on 18th February and they have now reverted to us that, because of the SPUR and the Jobs Credit Scheme, they have now deferred retrenchment indefinitely, and they&nbsp;will come back to us because orders are still low.&nbsp; They will take this time to reposition themselves to look at new skills and new training that may be needed to equip their people to up their capabilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another well-known paint company that has about 200 workers,&nbsp;got a directive from its&nbsp;HQ this year for a wage freeze.&nbsp; The company is actually doing pretty well.&nbsp; But, understanding the NWC guidelines, we would rather that they have some savings.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the&nbsp;end of the day, under the flexible wage system, the savings will be translated into KPI bonuses for the workers.&nbsp; But the management actually wanted to pay some form of increment to the workers, so they were trying to find ways to justify this&nbsp;to&nbsp;its HQ.&nbsp; When the Jobs Credit Scheme was announced, they readily got it approved and all the 200 workers will now enjoy some form of wage increment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1678<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talked to some companies that are doing well and they have no signs of retrenchment.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;how are&nbsp;they going to make use of this Jobs Credit Scheme?&nbsp; Because it will amount to a few hundred thousand dollars a month as they have quite a huge workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;They told us that they are committed to use these savings to train their workers.&nbsp; They understand the need to stay competitive because they know that other companies out there which are also doing well will also be having the same amount of savings.&nbsp; They want to make full use of these savings to ensure that they can become more competitive, so that they will have a competitive edge over others.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the commitments from companies that are doing well, who are prepared to spend this money to invest in their people.&nbsp; They told us that, to them, they do not look at this as mere cost savings that fatten up their bottomline.&nbsp; This is actually something that they will treat as part of their investment in their people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have seen how Jobs Credits Scheme has helped some workers save their jobs and, in some cases, get some wage increment and given them some confidence that, at least, they stay viable.&nbsp; Another company&nbsp;told us that while they are not able to keep all the jobs, they may still have to retrench 15% or 20% of the workers, and that happened just last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can at least be assured that there will be more viability for the remaining 80%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we want to echo is that the whole Resilience Package is for us to build&nbsp;more confidence in our businesses and our people, so that they do not give up hope.&nbsp; We do not want to have a batch of people who are helpless and hopeless, and feel that this is just the end for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next,&nbsp;I would like to touch on the older workers.&nbsp; We have 709 companies committed to re-employing older workers. &nbsp;We hit as high as 5,400 workers being re-<p align=left>Column: 1679<p>employed&nbsp;in October last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;But as at today, &nbsp;it has dropped to 4,600.&nbsp; This means that some of them will not be able to get their second renewal, or we find it even more challenging to get those who are in the "new" 62s to be re-employed.&nbsp; It will be a very challenging year for those workers seeking re-employment or hoping for a second renewal of their contract, and I was also hoping that the Jobs Credit could have actually given a slight slant towards the older workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked to the companies and the workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the plethora of bad news, people are more aware and more realistic today.&nbsp; Many are actually receptive to flexible work, shorter work hours, flexible time, as long as they keep their jobs because they understand that if their pay drops below certain level, they can be supplemented through Workfare Income Supplement, as long as they remain in the payroll.&nbsp; Some companies told us that the lower employer's CPF contribution rate, together with the Jobs Credit, actually gives them an added advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is&nbsp;one company who even did up the calculation to compare the cost between the locals and the foreign workers.&nbsp; So with all those different cost components of the foreign workers, including airfare, accommodation, etc, they openly tell us that, certainly, the older workers will be more cost competitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we spoke to them and we all agreed that while this is a temporary relief, it will only be here for one year.&nbsp; We should make sure that we should not exploit this cost advantage that we have.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should actually ensure that we can make use of these savings and really invest more in the older workers to ensure that they can remain in the workforce.&nbsp; Because what we want to see is that, when the economy recovers, the older workers continue to be employed and stay in employment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1680<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have made good progress over the last three years to restructure the wages, redesign the work processes, engage the companies on workplace health programmes to ensure that older workers have all that is necessary to continue working.&nbsp; We should not let this go to waste but we should continue our long-term objective of ensuring that our older workers can stay employed and employable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to say that tripartism is indeed our unique advantage.&nbsp; It is a strong relationship we have nurtured for many years.&nbsp; It is because of this strong relationship that we have that we are able to build up confidence with the employers and the workers to make them go through different changes in their worklife.&nbsp; It is not an easy decision to dip into the reserves to fund the Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp; But I think it sends a strong signal to everyone, whether&nbsp;it is the workers or the employers, that the fact that we are dipping into the reserves is that we are very serious, that we are here to work closely with you and with the workers to save jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenges before us&nbsp;are&nbsp;tremendous but we do have our own ammunition&nbsp;&ndash; our united tripartism, the trust and confidence in our people, or unique Singapore.&nbsp; It is an extraordinary programme during extraordinary times, and we&nbsp;require extraordinary efforts.&nbsp; So it is not going to be a miracle jock that will just bring us out of this crisis immediately.&nbsp; If we want to see the outcome, then we have to work hard to achieve that.&nbsp; So we will be engaging all our partners to work even harder and I will call upon everyone to maximise the Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp; Do not discredit this.&nbsp; Turn this adversity into our Singapore advantage, and I am sure we will emerge stronger in this downturn.&nbsp; So, in this downturn, please do not turn us down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1681<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I fully support this Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.54 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, today is the rainy day we have been saving up for.&nbsp; The idea of dipping into our savings during extraordinarily hard times is natural.&nbsp; This is why I support this Budget's move to use our reserves for two things: one, to prevent a severe loss of jobs; and two, to help tide low-income citizens over this trying period.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Budget 2009 was crafted with a strong sense of realism and a deep respect of uncertainties of the future.&nbsp; There is no doubt that this Budget had to be expansionary. &nbsp;Compared to the trillion dollar collapses that we have seen around the world, $20.5 billion&nbsp;or approximately US$15 billion&nbsp;might not sound like a lot of money, but let us put things in perspective.&nbsp; The $20.5 billion&nbsp;represents 6% of&nbsp;our GDP.&nbsp; To date, it has become one of the most aggressive stimulus plans per capita basis on this planet.&nbsp; That is why when I hear the hon. Member Low Thia Khiang say in his speech that is "not unusual fiscal response", I wondered what would be unusual for him and what would be enough in his view.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this Budget only marks the beginning of a long road we all need to undertake, individually and as a nation.&nbsp; Let us use this financial crisis as an opportunity to examine the way we do things&nbsp;&ndash; to refocus on the basics and re-determine our fundamentals. We seem to have forgotten what these are, judging by the excesses of the last 10 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to jobs, I call upon both employers and employees to do the right thing, for each group depends on the other for the means to make it through terrible economic times.&nbsp; To the employers, I say that the survival and success of <p align=left>Column: 1682<p>your businesses and companies are crucial. &nbsp;It means more to the continuation of all you have worked hard to achieve.&nbsp; For in your hands is the livelihood of thousands of people.&nbsp; However, allow me to point out that for us to be a more competitive economy, the productivity must improve. Unfortunately, this is not the case in the last few years. It is distressing to see that despite the millions of dollars poured into this country's continuous education and training infrastructure and programmes, millions of dollars to give&nbsp;highly skilled workers an up-to-date workforce, Singaporeans and PRs' productivity has declined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One can only conclude that it is a result of employers' much-stated preference for foreign workers over locals.&nbsp; Let us state categorically&nbsp;&ndash; do not get me wrong&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I am of the view that foreign workers are vital to our economy, especially in the sectors where locals are few and hard to find, where they bring valuable skills and talent to grow our industries and where they can transfer their expertise to our locals too. But when cheap foreign labour, as an immediate panacea to&nbsp;our employers'&nbsp;labour concerns, supersedes the upgrading the skills of&nbsp;our workforce, it becomes a real concern.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low-cost production hubs like China and India have been investing in capital and improving labour productivity.&nbsp; So, can Singaporean employers afford to simply sit still and depend on cheap foreign labour?&nbsp; I would encourage them to take the opportunity to go back to basics to improve productivity&nbsp;and at the same time&nbsp;hire local workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, the CDCs and the NTUC have been heartened to work with companies in many areas from even foot reflexology, pest controllers and those in the security sector, which have been receptive to going local.&nbsp; Increasingly, the F&amp;B, healthcare, conservancy and secu-<p align=left>Column: 1683<p>rity sectors are also willing to give older workers a shot.&nbsp; A few of these key players who do this are Singapore Power, Rentokil and Watsons.&nbsp; But just as there are exemplary employers, there have been some with unreasonable demands. These include employers who are only willing to hire people between 20 to 30 years old for jobs like cashiers, kitchen helpers, waitresses, jobs which older workers have shown time and time again that they can excel in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to Singaporean workers young and old, I say: "Your time has come; time to make use of the current climate to improve yourselves. Don't be discouraged by the gloomy outlook. There are always, and will always be&nbsp;opportunities, even at the worst of times".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do see how difficult times have become.&nbsp; At my CDC, there has been a surge in the number of people seeking help to find work.&nbsp; In the last&nbsp;two months of 2008, the CDC saw a larger than&nbsp;20% increase in the number of job seekers.&nbsp; From an average of 400 a month, the number has leapt to 520 a month.&nbsp; In January this year, it jumped another 17%, to 610 job seekers.&nbsp; In December, about a third asking for help were PMETs&nbsp;&ndash; professionals, managers, executives and technicians.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Usually, they make up 20% of the job seekers.&nbsp; So that is&nbsp;a 50% increase!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding people a job is one thing, persuading them to take it is another.&nbsp; First and foremost, they have to ask themselves: how adventurous am I? Am I open to new experiences? Am I willing to try a new line, a new career?&nbsp; In the CDC, we have seen too many people who do not&nbsp;have a <I>gungho</I> spirit.&nbsp; At least 75 people a month refuse to take up good jobs.&nbsp; And their excuses? Here&nbsp;are some of the reasons we&nbsp;have heard: I do not want&nbsp;to work shifts; cannot, too far from <p align=left>Column: 1684<p>my home; I do not want to serve people;&nbsp;I only want to work in an office.&nbsp; Then there are the ones who ask for a salary beyond what they can realistically demand, given their work experience and qualifications.&nbsp; And those who once held middle managerial or senior managerial positions&nbsp;insist on similar jobs with similar pay, despite the current situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is that with every recession, manufacturing plants and offices shed jobs.&nbsp; Singapore is now a service and knowledge economy.&nbsp; There is no shame in providing service.&nbsp; Surely, the greatest dignity is in earning your own keep. &nbsp;And change is possible.&nbsp; Let me tell you about two people who embraced change:&nbsp;One is Ms Ngan Chin Shia. She has a double degree and used to work in the financial sector.<br> When she approached the CDC in November last year, she had been unemployed for more than a year. Our career consultant suggested she explore opportunities beyond the financial sector, and within two months, she had landed a job as a customer coordinator in a nursing home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is Mr Roy Tan.&nbsp; He spent many years in the IT industry.&nbsp; He was very adamant about finding an IT-related job when he was retrenched.&nbsp; But two years later, he was still unemployed.&nbsp; He was withdrawn and had lost confidence in himself.&nbsp; We asked him to CLICK! This is the CDC's name for sessions where professionals like him get together and talk about their situation, their feelings, and how they have handled things and overcome their difficulties.&nbsp; They learn that they are not alone in being retrenched.&nbsp; Basically, they support each other.&nbsp; He came out of his shell, and now he is working in sales.&nbsp; He also has a side job&nbsp;&ndash; he is a TV extra in drama serials!&nbsp; And now he shares his transformation with others at CLICK!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you see, today, having a job is about having a great attitude, of having <p align=left>Column: 1685<p>the skills that employers want.&nbsp; And if you do not&nbsp;have the skills, we will help you get them.&nbsp; You can, for example, tap on SPUR (Skills Programme for Upgrading Resilience), and also go to e2i where your skills can be upgraded.&nbsp; I must warn though, that the programme can only help with skills.&nbsp; When it comes to attitude, only you can determine that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Central Singapore CDC, we&nbsp;will do more to help retrenched professionals like Roy and Chin Shia. We will run workshops where they can brush up on their interview skills, resume writing, and all&nbsp;others&nbsp;that will allow them&nbsp;in their hunt for a job.&nbsp; We will also run more CLICK! sessions, which have been proving very successful in motivating retrenched PMETs.&nbsp; We will also explore working with headhunters and recruitment agencies to find suitable jobs for this group of people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;</I> <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2009/20090204/20090204VS_114834.pdf""><I>Appendix A</I></a> <I>*.</I> ]&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I like to encourage the workers to continue upgrading their knowledge and skills.&nbsp; In these hard times, we should use this opportunity to improve our own workers&rsquo; situation so that they will be able to get jobs.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA and NTUC have set up e2i to help the workers to upgrade their skill.&nbsp; At the e2i, there&nbsp;are a lot of new training and new job opportunities available.&nbsp; At the e2i institute, workers who lost their jobs will be guided closely and given counselling on their own abilities and skills that can be nurtured.&nbsp; With the e2i, more workers will be helped to go into growth areas and industries, which still needs workers who are suitable and, more importantly, having in-demand skills.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The message I wish to put across to our workers is that they must continue to open up their mind so that they can venture into new jobs, and be able to upgrade their lifelong skills and <p align=left>Column: 1686<p>opportunities.&nbsp; Go to e2i if they have not understood what they can do and help will always be given.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; For the needy and the low income, we have seen that the number seeking financial help has increased by 20%, from 800 to about 950 per month, since November 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, last year, Central Singapore CDC spent $17.6 million through national and local schemes&nbsp;to help some 12,000 low-income households.&nbsp; Just let me reiterate what the&nbsp;12,000 low-income households means.&nbsp; It is equivalent to a single Member constituency.&nbsp; To spread out the network of help, we will&nbsp;work with our 23 grassroots divisions to tap on their ComCare funds, and all our VWOs and social services organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we are going to need to give more help in these extraordinary times. We need to assure our citizens and residents that they will be assisted if they are in real trouble.&nbsp; But at the end, no matter how much help is extended, people have to help themselves too.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we have&nbsp;seen a fair share of those who do not&nbsp;seem to want to do that, they just want money and assistance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I give&nbsp;Members an example.&nbsp; One man claimed he was unfit for work, but could not produce a medical certificate to explain what was wrong with him.&nbsp; We could also&nbsp;not see any physical problem or&nbsp;disability.&nbsp; Another woman, a housewife, said she could&nbsp;not&nbsp;go out and work because someone had to stay at&nbsp;home to look after the children.&nbsp; But after further investigation, we discovered that the&nbsp;children are already in secondary school&nbsp;and junior college.&nbsp; This sort of attitude will not do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another concern of mine, Sir, is about the credit&nbsp;card culture in Singapore.&nbsp; Let <p align=left>Column: 1687<p>me touch on the credit card situation in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp;young persons, it does not matter whether they are males or females, unless&nbsp;they are the grandsons or granddaughters of a multi-millionaire, it is ridiculous to chalk up credit card debts of multi-thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me illustrate with an example.&nbsp; If you owe&nbsp;$75,000 &ndash;&nbsp;which is a common thing now with the young people &ndash;&nbsp;the interest rate repayment alone on a monthly basis at 2% is $1,500.&nbsp; The very people who are in this situation, would be able to get out of the debt situation not, at least for another&nbsp;10 years.&nbsp; The credit card and rollover credit in Singapore has reached absurd proportion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at the&nbsp;end of&nbsp;2007, the total amount of credit card rollover was a staggering $600 million. This amount would be able to provide a monthly stipend of $1,000 for a whole year benefiting 50,000 low-income families.&nbsp; The same amount could buy about&nbsp;four million 5 kg Thai Jasmine rice.&nbsp; While our population base grew at only 15% from year 2000 to 2007, the amount of credit card in circulation grew from 2.45 million in 2000 to 5.6 million in 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Credit cards&nbsp;are too easily available.&nbsp; It is a phenomenon that is global in nature.&nbsp; In the US, the Foreign Policy magazine survey showed that there are&nbsp;five credit cards for every person.&nbsp; In China, there is only one card for every 33 person.&nbsp; It is therefore little wonder, in this financial crisis, the United States is the cause and the People's Republic of China&nbsp;could possibly be the saviour.&nbsp; In fact, China is one of the biggest buyers of American treasuries at US$681.9 billion.&nbsp; So let me ask the House: how many credit cards do Members have in&nbsp;their wallets?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1688<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, before we go the route of the Americans, being known as a nation of spenders rather than&nbsp;savers, something needs to be done about the easy availability of credit cards in Singapore.&nbsp; I know of a case of a foot masseur, earning less than $4,000 a month having&nbsp;six gold and platinum credit cards and the same amount of credit line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is worthwhile for us to re-look at the values that we impart to our children. Parents need to give more guidance to the young. Similarly, we need to educate youths on the value of thrift and frugality.&nbsp; Just look at how and why our&nbsp;Government has always been prudent and it is able to save and grow our reserves so that we are in a&nbsp;better position to use during extremely difficult times. We do not accumulate debts, but we accumulate reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me conclude.&nbsp; This is time for us to take a step back and re-evaluate our mindset, our skills and values.&nbsp; Develop true value and real substance that would be able to sustain us&nbsp;through thick and thin&nbsp;and not just superficials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we are small, we can make a difference by leading and showing the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Government should help to lower the cost of doing business in whatever way possible. We should incentivise companies and employers who are willing to recruit local workers via CDC, NTUC and other Government-initiated job placement programmes.&nbsp; This would give our unemployed Singaporeans a fair shot at landing jobs, jobs and jobs.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1845-1846.<BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>2.13 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Budget Statement.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several phrases and adjectives have been used to describe this year&rsquo;s Budget.<p align=left>Column: 1689<p> "Bold", "Decisive", "A Big Bang Budget" are but a few.&nbsp; I agree with all these descriptions.&nbsp; I think that this year&rsquo;s Budget has gone beyond what the Government has done in previous years and rightly so, because the state of the economy calls for it.&nbsp; Hence, I cannot understand why Mr Low Thia Khiang and Ms Sylvia Lim appear to question the dipping into our reserves.&nbsp; If ever there was a time to do so, I believe that time is now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is in an economic downturn, the likes of which have not been seen in a very long time.&nbsp; Some even say that we have never seen anything like this before.&nbsp; As the Minister for Finance himself said, there is a simultaneous recession in all major regions of the world.&nbsp; In this present age where the economies of the world are so inter-connected, every country has been affected.&nbsp; A country like Singapore, with an export-driven economy, cannot help but feel the impact, and&nbsp; acutely so.&nbsp; We rely on other countries to buy the goods that we produce and the services that we provide to&nbsp;them.&nbsp; This is how we make our living. As a result of this global financial crisis, demand for our goods and services has fallen drastically.&nbsp; This is likely to continue to be the case for some time to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes this global downturn distinctive is not merely its depth and breadth but the speed at which it has metastasized and continues to advance.&nbsp; The situation changes on a weekly, if not daily, basis.&nbsp; This is illustrated by the fact that our growth forecast for this year had to be revised downwards from -2% to 1%, to -2% to -5%, all in the space of less than a month.&nbsp; Even from the beginning of the year to the time of the Budget Statement, the economic situation had changed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the global financial crisis is so mercurial and unpredictable, I think that <p align=left>Column: 1690<p>we must accept that this Big Bang Budget may not be the definitive "bang".&nbsp; In fact, it may only be the first "bang".&nbsp; We should not expect this Budget to be the panacea or magic pill for all the problems we are facing now.&nbsp; In fact, this Budget may only be one of the many analgesics required to help us along the road to recovery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister has said that this year&rsquo;s Budget is a supply-side Budget.&nbsp; It addresses the fundamental concern of saving jobs or holding off retrenchment for as long as possible.&nbsp; Many critics of the Budget have said that the Budget is too business-centric&nbsp;&ndash; that most of the measures are for the benefit of the companies and that there is too little for the individual.&nbsp; I disagree.&nbsp; In my view, the overall aim of the Budget is clear &ndash; to save as many jobs as possible so that individual workers and their families will not suffer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that on the face of it, the Jobs Credit Scheme and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative (SRI) appear to be for the benefit of companies as opposed to individuals.&nbsp; So too are&nbsp;the property tax rebates for industrial and commercial property.&nbsp; However, one must look at the bigger picture.&nbsp; One of the fundamental requirements, both for our long-term survival and to ensure that all Singaporeans pull through this crisis, is to make sure that our workers stay employed.&nbsp; If they have a job, they will have an income and will be able to provide food and a home for their families.&nbsp; It is with this in mind that measures like the Jobs Credit Scheme have been put in place.&nbsp; The cost of labour is one of the largest cost components for many companies.&nbsp; The Jobs Credit Scheme helps to make a worker more affordable to employ.&nbsp; A direct cash handout might provide more immediate relief, but that relief would be too temporary to make any long-term impact if the worker loses his job as the crisis deepens.&nbsp; Better that <p align=left>Column: 1691<p>we help to keep him employed so that he can continue to provide for his family.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the SRI, the Government is answering the call of many companies who have had great difficulty obtaining loans from banks as the banks have become far more conservative in their lending policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of the banks, the SRI will allow companies to obtain the much-needed trade financing, thereby allowing them to remain in operation and to&nbsp;continue employing our workers. Again, the ultimate effect of such a measure is the continued employment of our workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted with interest that in his Budget Speech, the Minister mentioned that positive feedback on the SRI scheme had been obtained from the banks, and that the Government expected the banks to take advantage of the SRI scheme.&nbsp; This augurs well for the scheme achieving its intended effect.&nbsp; But there is still some reluctance on the part of banks to lend, and when they are willing to make the loan, I have heard from some companies that there is considerably more "red tape" and paperwork, because the Government is now guaranteeing the loan. &nbsp;I hope that we do not lose the intended effect of the SRI scheme in the course of its implementation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the 40% rebate on property tax for industrial and commercial property, the position is not as clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention behind the rebate is to lower a major cost item for a business&nbsp;&ndash; the cost of renting its premises.&nbsp; Such rental could be for office space, shop space or factory space.&nbsp; The complaint from tenants of shop and office space over the last&nbsp;one or two years has been the escalating cost of rent.&nbsp; While rental rates have gradually come down over the last few months, they have not decreased to a level that corresponds with the state of the <p align=left>Column: 1692<p>economy.&nbsp; Businesses are finding it hard to cope with the cost of rental at the rates that landlords are continuing to ask for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government hopes that savings garnered from the 40% rebate in property tax will be passed on by landlords to their tenants, perhaps in the form of rental rebates.&nbsp; JTC, HDB and SLA have committed to a 15% rental rebate as a result of the property tax savings. &nbsp;This is to be commended.&nbsp; But what of private-sector landlords?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read with interest the comments of some developers in an article in&nbsp;the <I>Straits Times</I> yesterday.&nbsp; These comments were made on the sidelines of the Real Estate Developers Association of Singapore <i>lo-hei</i> lunch. The message to the tenants appeared to be that while developers would pass some savings on to the tenants, the tenants had to be realistic and the total savings that would result from the tax rebate would be far less than the 40% property tax rebate.&nbsp; It remains to be seen how much of these savings will, in fact, translate into benefits for the tenants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget, a lot is being done to "stop the bleeding".&nbsp; My question is whether the Budget has gone far enough in order to "start the healing".&nbsp; Yes, this Budget has broken new ground in its measures to ease the burden for viable companies and to save jobs.&nbsp; Provisions have also been made to retrain workers and invest in research and development so that we have a head start when the next economic upturn comes.&nbsp; One question that I would ask is whether enough provision has been made to at least generate consumption demand in Singapore. &nbsp;I accept that the demand for our goods and services from other countries has fallen.&nbsp; I also accept that there may be little that we can do about that for now because the world is in a downturn.&nbsp; But I would urge the Govern-<p align=left>Column: 1693<p>ment to consider whether more can be done to generate consumption demand in our local economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortage of doom and gloom in the local media about the global financial crisis and the difficulties that we must be prepared to face in Singapore.&nbsp; Every time one turns on the radio or television and listens to the news, or reads the newspapers, the message comes across clearly.&nbsp; I fully support the fact that we must be kept informed about the true state of affairs.&nbsp; We should not pretend that everything is all right or going to be all right when there are tougher times ahead.&nbsp; Nevertheless, all this bad news has a psychological effect on the consumer and discourages spending.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking to one of my grassroots leaders the other day.&nbsp; He runs his own business and he is fortunate as he tells me that his business has not really been affected by the economic downturn thus far. Yet, he tells me that every time he reads the newspapers or listens to the news, he feels the need to stop spending and to cut costs, notwithstanding that his business is still flourishing.&nbsp; Other people have expressed similar sentiments to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is important that Singaporeans are prepared for these hard times, I believe that we should not allow consumption demand to dwindle. Our shops, restaurants and the service industry all need to survive. With the number of tourists visiting Singapore on the decline, we cannot afford for local demand to drastically drop as well.&nbsp; How then can we stimulate local demand?&nbsp; I thought about this question long and hard.&nbsp; I&nbsp;realise that it is&nbsp;not as easy as managing the supply side, because you cannot just give a rebate or money to lower the cost of an item.&nbsp; It involves changing people&rsquo;s minds and convincing them that while they should not over-spend, they should not stop spending altogether.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1694<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that there must be a combination of measures.&nbsp; These measures must be bold so as to have the necessary psychological effect on the local consumer.&nbsp;One possible measure that has been suggested&nbsp;is the temporary reduction of GST.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government&rsquo;s position has always been that it will provide targeted assistance to those that need help to cope with GST and GST increases.&nbsp; In fact, in this Budget, the GST credits that each household will receive this year has been doubled.&nbsp; This will be paid in two tranches, in March and July this year. Lower-income families will receive more credits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While GST credits will help families, particularly lower-income families, to cope with likely reduction in earnings this year, I do not believe that it will do much to stimulate spending.&nbsp; A large proportion of GST credits will go to lower-income families.&nbsp; It is likely that they will spend this on essential items.&nbsp; Those with higher incomes may or may not spend the amount.&nbsp; But even if they do, it is only paid in two tranches and therefore will have a momentary effect on the spending as and when it is paid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government were to lower GST temporarily, I believe that this would create the impact needed to stimulate more spending.&nbsp; If we do this, we will not be the first country to do so. &nbsp;In December last year, the UK announced a 2.5% reduction in their GST equivalent of VAT.&nbsp; The primary purpose of the reduction was to boost consumer spending.&nbsp; If we were to temporarily lower GST by, say, 2%, that would be tantamount to a 28.5% reduction in our GST. &nbsp;In my view, that would have a considerable impact on the consumer psychology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask the Government to consider a temporary suspension of GST on a basket of essential items.&nbsp; This, I <p align=left>Column: 1695<p>believe, would have a two-fold effect.&nbsp; First, it would further relieve pressure on the&nbsp;lower-income families and make essential items more affordable for them.&nbsp; Secondly, it would have a similar psychological impact as the reduction in the rate of GST.&nbsp; As to what to include in the basket of items, perhaps we can consider the items that other countries, like Australia, the UK, Canada and some European countries, have exempted such as healthcare, education, basic foodstuffs, clothing and footwear for children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grave times call for bold measures.&nbsp; Just like the Jobs Credit Scheme and the decision to delve into our reserves, I would urge the Government to consider a temporary reduction in GST and a temporary suspension of GST on essential items as possible off-Budget measures to stimulate consumption demand.&nbsp;While I realise there is justification to maintain GST at the current level, I would ask the Minister to waive that justification against the benefits that may be reaped from boosting demand.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said earlier, because stimulating consumption demand is very much a battle of the mind, I&nbsp;believe that, concurrently, there must be steps taken to promote local industry.&nbsp; One example of a good push for local shops and restaurants is the Great Singapore Sale.&nbsp; Of course, we cannot be having a sale every other month.&nbsp; But I would encourage the Government to find ways to get the message across that consumers must play their part in the effort to revive the economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think that we should sit and wait for the rest of the world to recover and come to us.&nbsp; We should take our own steps to drive up demand and initiate our own road to recovery. Even though local demand may be small compared to our export sales, I <p align=left>Column: 1696<p>feel that we must begin our own healing process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with that I declare my support for the Budget Statement.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me first publicly thank the many ground inputs that were given to me when I polled a network of bankers, lawyers, grassroots leaders, residents, hoteliers, MNC and SME business operators.&nbsp; Majority of the ground feedback has been highly favourable. The Resilience Package covered many bases from businesses to individuals to even the charity sector. Some even deem this Budget as one of the most progressive Government intervention packages in the world. For that, I thank our competent Finance Minister and his team.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will touch on four specific topics: On national reserves; the Jobs Credit Scheme; the SRI and the need for assessment and recalibration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the drawing down of the national reserves is a significant decision and has silenced the many proponents whom I am very sure did not expect this.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a youth dialogue held last week and chaired by my colleague, hon. Member Christopher&nbsp;de&nbsp;Souza, two key concerns stood out.&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the fear of our young people who worry that they will be jobless upon graduation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, the young people also expressed concerns over the impact of the unprecedented step of dipping into national reserves on future generations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much has been said that these are extraordinary times and drawing down our reserves is the way to go to avoid irreparable damage to our economy. But, Sir, it has been largely projected that the current crisis will last at least two to three years. Bill Gates has just sent out his 2009 Annual Letter with the message that the impact of the current economic crisis will be felt for a long time, and he is <p align=left>Column: 1697<p>optimistic that the problems we face today will be behind us if we take a longer timeframe, such as five to 10 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if things are going to get worse before they get better, will we be further drawing down our reserves for the next several years? I would like to ask the Minister to shed some light on the specific criteria by which recommendations to the President to draw down our reserves are made. I would ask him to also consider and maybe report to us the necessary post-recession steps to systematically top up the reserves that were drawn down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, the million-dollar question that even the MOF team could not answer as at now is&nbsp;&ndash; will Jobs Credit be translated to save jobs or would some companies retrench anyway, just like Chartered Semiconductor in the face of its massive losses?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a no-strings-attached generous scheme like this, how can we avoid the scenario of what happened in the US where some of the public bailout money found its way to funding up to US$18 billion in Wall Street bonuses or fancy corporate parties? Even the US Congress has introduced legislation just last week to cap compensation for employees of any company that accepts Federal bailout money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same token, Sir, there should be accountability too on the part of recipients of the Jobs Credit Scheme to ensure that our precious reserves are not simply fattening the pockets of shareholders and top executives who are paid broadly on the basis of profit sharing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a need to inflate the coffers of healthy enterprises that are not at risk of losing their employees? Would a broad-based blunt Jobs Credit Scheme simply means moving our reserves into the wrong pockets and creating windfalls for some; at the expense of taxpayers and at <p align=left>Column: 1698<p>the expense of target recipients especially those who are vulnerable&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the elderly, the disabled and the needy retrenched?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, one of my young married residents who is hearing impaired (deaf) was laid off last December by a bank, not DBS, I might add.&nbsp; Even after my appealing to the CDC, the NTUC and several other banks for help, she is unfortunately still jobless. Her mobile phone (because she is deaf) which is her main form of communication, was disconnected because of unpaid bills.&nbsp; She updated me through a borrowed phone and this is what her SMS read, "My past experience in my job search made me feel hopeless due to (my) deafness.&nbsp; Hearing bosses will not employ deaf people who need jobs badly. Walk-in interviews make deaf people feel depressed cos we are rejected due to lack of communication.&nbsp; I mailed many times and there is still no response or response saying no available jobs." She ended off "Sigh &hellip;"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when I sent in a Lunar New Year gift to help her husband (who is mute) and her young son, the couple was reluctant and they felt bad receiving the gift. All the couple wants is dignity through a paying job!&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely there is some room in our bonanza budget of $20.5 billion to help genuinely vulnerable workers to keep their jobs and sustain them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have four suggestions, Sir, to sharpen some of the blunt edges of the Jobs Credit Scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggestion 1:&nbsp;Refine the Jobs Credit Scheme to attach strings so that there is a partial refund should retrenchments still occur.</p></P></span></div>    <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Suggestion 2: Set up a Task Force to innovatively address the potentially explosive situation of the thousands of job seekers who would be graduating from our universities, the polytechnics and the <p align=left>Column: 1699<p>ITEs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe include them in a modified SPUR programme; or create ways by which they can make a living such as creating contract teams and deploying them for specific tasks in the public sector or, better still, the people sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggestion 3: Tier the Jobs Credit Scheme so that companies who retain the elderly and the disabled get a higher quantum than the current 12%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggestion 4: Introduce a total solution for the needy retrenched.&nbsp; I use the term "needy retrenched" because I know of retrenched employees who had been accorded very generous severance packages that will last them a few years.&nbsp; Again, we cannot afford to be too blunt in the way we design help and a form of maybe "means testing" will be necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the needy retrenched, I ask the Minister to consider the following:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Provide a grant of up to $300 per month per eligible Singaporean for as long as the employers' Jobs Credit Scheme is running or when a job is found, whichever is earlier;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure an integrated package from the HDB, Town Councils and&nbsp;Singapore Power to institute measures, such as housing loan restructuring, deferments or payment by instalments for this target group;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deploy career coaches and placement officers at career help desks at all community clubs and through a centralised portal;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Make public in multiple channels an updated list of available jobs through the various media;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Conduct a systems study to reduce the overlaps and inefficiency in the macro <p align=left>Column: 1700<p>amazing maze of CDCs, ethnic-based self-help groups,&nbsp;grassroots organisations, VWOs, family service centres and&nbsp;charity bodies.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we being hopeful that the SRI will translate to more loans for companies?&nbsp; Sir, financial institutions and the Governments do not answer to the same drumbeat or mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;As poet Rudyard Kipling said in 1892,&nbsp;"Oh East is East, West is West, and never the twain shall meet."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A respected&nbsp;banker told me this, "Banks are not in the business of saving failing companies nor is it their objective to save jobs, as what governments are expected to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the most, banks can identify viable but perhaps mismanaged or marginal companies and help them restructure and turn around so that the banks can get their money back."&nbsp; This banker also said, "Government&rsquo;s consideration is not purely commercial, of&nbsp;course,&nbsp;and it remains to be seen if the SRI in its current form will reap any results."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is borne by the painful experiences of some of the SME operators I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;An&nbsp;entrepreneur I know in retail shared with me&nbsp;his experience since October last year.&nbsp; He said this, "Despite an 80% increase in our business turnover and more than two times increase in net profit, our main bank cut our facility by 70%.&nbsp; Another bank also removed our OD line."&nbsp; This SME owner further said, "We approached a number of banks for new financing but none agreed to extend the line.&nbsp; The reasons quoted were unfavourable market conditions, low cash liquidity in our balance sheet and tighter control by the banks&rsquo; credit departments."&nbsp; He further lamented, "Even though we have a good business model and already secured a number of big firm orders in hand, the credit departments still refused to grant a new line. They fail to appreciate our business operations &hellip; and even after the <p align=left>Column: 1701<p>Budget announcement, bank managers&nbsp;still seem&nbsp;hesitant to review our (application)."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are these quotes anecdotal?&nbsp; I do not think so.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a Parliament sitting last November, Finance Minister Tharman himself pointed out, and I quote:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will be inappropriate for the Government to direct banks to lend, or to get involved in who they should lend to.&nbsp; These are commercial decisions which the banks themselves have to make, based on their assessment of the risks as well as the relationships that they maintain with their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our banks make these assessments carefully, and take into account both the short-term risks and their long-term interests in keeping their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should continue to leave these decisions to them.&nbsp; However, what Government can and will do&nbsp;is&nbsp;to enhance the various Government schemes that are in place to help our SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) retain access to credit."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I totally agree with the&nbsp;Minister&rsquo;s comments and it pays to hone and be more targeted at saving our&nbsp;SMEs and go further and nurture the promising ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it has been widely acknowledged that SMEs are an integral and significant part of Singapore&rsquo;s economy.&nbsp; I have worked and consulted with&nbsp;both multi-national firms and the local conglomerates before and I can testify that there is inherently much deeper management and technical bench depth in successful MNCs. &nbsp;Besides the need for deeper management and technical bench depth, SMEs usually lack the ability to achieve economies of scale and expand beyond the domestic markets. &nbsp;There is often an under-utilisation of technology in these firms and they face difficulties in competing with the Government, GLCs and the bigger private sector players in attracting talents. &nbsp;Some of them do have promising business models,&nbsp;good dare and savvy, worth more than a second look.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1702<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the days of solely counting on MNC investments to Singapore as a major weapon in our survival toolkit is over.&nbsp; Markets like India and China are attractive destinations today for MNCs because of their large domestic markets and bigger talent pools from which to select.&nbsp; Neighbouring countries, known to admire Singapore, had for many years, adopted the same fiscal and other measures&nbsp;not just to attract but seduce&nbsp;the MNCs to their countries. &nbsp;To run ahead of the pack, it pays for us to be contrarian and develop higher resilience for our economy through more aggressive&nbsp;Government efforts to nurture promising SMEs so that they&nbsp;can become MNCs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Sir, my key suggestions to Government are to redirect some resources to nurture the SME sector.&nbsp; Groom as many of them as possible to become MNCs! &nbsp;Move from defence to aggressively help them prepare&nbsp;for&nbsp;attack when the economy rebounds!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a start, as in the alleged mis-selling of structured products, the Ministry should consider similar measures, such as the appointment of independent persons to expediently oversee the complaints handling and resolution process in each financial institution for unsuccessful loan application by SMEs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, develop a special task force with the sole purpose of nurturing promising SMEs to multinational firms.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of SMEs like the Promising Brand Award winners like Mr Bean, with injection of capital, expertise and technology, can&nbsp;be scaled and become the Asian version of Starbucks globally.&nbsp; I think of organisations such as the NTUC Childcare of which I am a board member, and I wonder why we would choose to invest in ABC, the failed Australian chain of childcare centres with&nbsp;its charismatic owner.&nbsp; For NTUC Childcare, which is&nbsp;the largest childcare operator in Singapore, an injection of <p align=left>Column: 1703<p>investments in strategic areas,&nbsp;such as curriculum portals or e-learning for&nbsp;students or web-based teacher training packages, would take it to a different league.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Sir, I say we go aggressive and turn the initials&nbsp;of&nbsp;SMEs to our very own MNCs!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I applaud the Minister for being decisive and swift in releasing the Resilience Package, and I will be the first to admit that hindsight vision is always 20/20 and it is always easier to critique than to construct.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I believe that there&nbsp;is some bluntness in this Budget&nbsp;that can be sharpened so that we can ensure that precious resources are effectively and efficiently applied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at today, very few can forecast the actual impact of the various initiatives to stall the crisis.&nbsp; Sir, there ought to be a clearer line of sight between the funds that we are investing with the outcomes that we desire. &nbsp;I urge the Minister to conduct a regular assessment of the impact of the schemes which should be further honed or&nbsp;abandoned if any initiative does not serve the objective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I would also ask the House and the rest of Singapore to appreciate Government's&nbsp;need to be bold and swift in moments like these and cheer rather than just&nbsp;jeer the team.&nbsp; Let us unite and support the Finance&nbsp;team so that they can test and learn quickly what works best and turn the blunt <I>parang</I> to a surgical scalpel to hasten the healing of any wounds sustained in this crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, if we stay united as a people and stop thinking&nbsp;of&nbsp;"What&rsquo;s in it for me?".&nbsp;&nbsp;If we single mindedly march toward a common aspiration to emerge as a stronger Singapore when this tsunami is over, we can&nbsp;say, like John&nbsp;Keynes in his <p align=left>Column: 1704<p>essay "The Great Slump of 1930" that, "This is a nightmare, which will pass away in the morning."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.40 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join the debate on the Budget Statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many medical analogies produced in the course of today's debate.&nbsp; I am afraid I am about to add to them.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways I would describe this Budget is,&nbsp;I see it as the vitamin C budget but with a touch of traditional Chinese medicine.&nbsp; And the reason why I say that is this &ndash; vitamin C, as&nbsp;Members know, is a powerful antioxidant.&nbsp; It helps boost resistance to fight infections, flu and cold.&nbsp; This global financial crisis was triggered by events in the US.&nbsp; The US sneezed and everybody else is catching the flu, and we are not immune.&nbsp; The question is, what can&nbsp;we do to defend against it, and I think that the Jobs Credit Scheme, the SRI and many of the other measures that have been taken are very much like a shot of vitamin C.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How vitamin C actually works on&nbsp;a person&nbsp;depends a lot on&nbsp;his inherent constitution.&nbsp; If&nbsp;&nbsp;his resistance is low, it is not going to save him;&nbsp;he is&nbsp;going to catch the flu anyway.&nbsp; If&nbsp;his resistance is just about all right but&nbsp;he could be affected, vitamin C will make quite a lot of difference.&nbsp; And if&nbsp;his resistance is really high, well, it may not make a big difference but there is still a lot&nbsp;he can do with it in the system.&nbsp; So, similarly, Jobs Credit is not going to save companies which are fundamentally unsound.&nbsp; They are going to go under anyway, and it is not right that they should ultimately have taxpayers' monies to prop up companies which are unsound and not viable.&nbsp; But there are many other companies which are viable but for them cashflow is an <p align=left>Column: 1705<p>issue and some injection of&nbsp;funds or subsidy,&nbsp;like the Jobs Credit Scheme, will make a big difference and will help to save jobs.&nbsp; For businesses that are doing all right, it is not to say that the Jobs Credit would&nbsp;not help them because every business at the start of its year does its projections for its budget.&nbsp; If it feels that it can still make a profit but has to trim, it may take the decision to trim and cut jobs in order to maintain a certain level of profit.&nbsp; But if it knows there is assistance coming by way of Jobs Credit, it may actually make a difference in their decision to keep some of the jobs, retain those jobs and help workers.&nbsp; So that is why I say that it is like a shot of vitamin C.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also considered the suggestion that was in the newspapers today&nbsp;&ndash; that instead of having something like Jobs Credit, I want to put wage subsidies directly into the workers' CPF account and reduce the employers' CPF contribution correspondingly.&nbsp; But having thought about it, I would not agree with that suggestion.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we reduce the CPF rate, then there is no need to pay that portion that has been reduced; so why would the Government be paying that portion?&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the other hand, if&nbsp;we retain the rate and then&nbsp;we say the Government should&nbsp;pay a certain portion of it, what&nbsp;we are really doing is that we are transferring the responsibility to paying CPF to the Government&nbsp;instead of the employer, which is again not right.&nbsp; And it absolves the employer from the responsibility of paying CPF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought that it is actually important that the employer remains part of the solution to saving jobs because, in Singapore, we have the unique tripartite relationship of Government, employer, employee.&nbsp; If we just do it straight as a subsidy from the Government into the employee's CPF account, that leaves the employer out of the equation, and it is just too easy.&nbsp; This challenge that we face <p align=left>Column: 1706<p>is a challenge that has to be met by every segment of Singapore&nbsp;&ndash; Government, employer, employee.&nbsp; Government provides the subsidy.&nbsp; Employers should be creative and thoughtful about the way that they use the money from the Jobs Credit.&nbsp; Employees should be willing to accept either flexible working hours or&nbsp;perhaps wage freeze.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their expectation should not be as high as they were before.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the important thing&nbsp;is that for us,&nbsp;as Singaporeans, we meet this challenge together, each one playing a role, just like&nbsp;the banks have a role to play as well because they should ease up on giving credit.&nbsp; One cannot expect that they&nbsp;abandon&nbsp;the principles of risk assessment, but they&nbsp;too have a part to play.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

One question I have for the Minister is how the Ministry of Finance may deal with abuse&nbsp;of the Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp; Last night, I was having a Chinese New Year dinner with my grassroots leaders and I asked them what was the feedback on the ground, particularly with respect to this scheme.&nbsp; One of them said that someone had asked him this question, "Supposing I have two companies, and I have one employee who is paid $4,000.&nbsp; Then maybe if I split his job and I put him in one company and pay him $2,500.&nbsp; Then I give him another job in the other company and I pay him $1,500.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I then get two Jobs Credit?"&nbsp; I &nbsp;was thinking, at least, we have not lost our sense of creativity in these times.&nbsp; So, things like that may crop up. &nbsp;I want to ask the Minister how the Ministry of Finance will actually view a situation like this and other possible abuses of the Jobs Credit Scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now also touch on why I say there is a touch of traditional Chinese medicine in this year's Budget.&nbsp; It is because of the way the debate has been presented.&nbsp; The criticisms of the Jobs Credit Scheme which have come from Mr<p align=left>Column: 1707<p> Low, Ms Lim and yesterday, Mr Siew Kum Hong,&nbsp;are that they believe the objective is not met because demand is not stimulated.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Jobs Credit and some of the other schemes stimulate or help&nbsp;the supply part,&nbsp;but helping the supply will not make a difference if&nbsp;we do not boost the demand.&nbsp; And I thought that was not entirely accurate or fair, because this Budget does look at demand.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;the expansion and&nbsp;acceleration of public sector infrastructure spending.&nbsp; That is boosting demand.&nbsp; There is development of the neighbourhoods and suburban nodes.&nbsp; That is boosting demand because&nbsp;we are creating a demand for services.&nbsp; Education, healthcare and the fact that the Government is actually doing recruitment for about 18,000 jobs,&nbsp; that helps with demand.&nbsp; I do not think that we can expect&nbsp;the Government&nbsp;to provide all of the demands that&nbsp;are necessary, but there is a balance.&nbsp; And that is why I think it is a bit of a <I>ying-yang</I> Budget, because&nbsp;we have the part that helps the supply, but&nbsp;we also have aspects of the Budget that helps with demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I would like to commend the Government on this Budget because it has been a very thoughtful Budget&nbsp;and, obviously, a great deal of care has been taken into it.&nbsp; It is not a Budget where it is a one-sided thing where one party,&nbsp; the Government, is supposed to pump everything in.&nbsp; It is a Budget that recognises&nbsp;different segments of Singapore have different responsibilities, and this is a challenge that needs the required effort of all segments of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

People are aware that global demand has come down with the biggest market, the US economy in the doldrums, and that it would be difficult for the Singapore economy to recover if the rest of the world does not.&nbsp; For that, there is nothing much&nbsp;we can do about it but I think we could look at ways of how we could stimulate the domestic economy.&nbsp; Through the various initiatives to keep jobs, stimulate bank lending and enhance business cashflow, people are wondering whether the benefits will filter down to the people and consumers.&nbsp; It will be a pity that when the Government is tapping on its reserves, businesses are keeping the savings from rental rebates, Jobs Credit and tax reductions to build up their own reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy that the public transport operators will be reducing their fares, which I believe is the&nbsp;first time in&nbsp;history.&nbsp; Other businesses should follow suit.&nbsp; The Singapore Flyer, the Zoo and Night Safari should offer more discounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Government-run facilities like museums, the Science Centre and activities, like maybe <I>Chingay</I>, should also lower their ticket prices.&nbsp; Retailers should run sales to push their inventory.&nbsp; Even our food hawkers should cut their prices.&nbsp; Perhaps we can even slash ERP rates and TV licence fees just for&nbsp;this year.&nbsp; We can leave it to the market forces.&nbsp; We can still stand by the policies to regulate traffic, but during these&nbsp;times, the Government can send a strong signal that such a stimulus will encourage spending and make people feel happy. &nbsp;Let us have a Great Singapore Resilience Sale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1709<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides enterprises, consumers should also do their part.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;comments that we should take a leaf from the Taiwanese way to stimulate spending by issuing shopping vouchers to everybody.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;just psychology at play here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vouchers are physical things that people can see and hold and so people treat it&nbsp;like a windfall and there is euphoria to spend it.&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, the GST Credits, S&amp;CC rebates, additional CPF housing grants are also windfalls, and designed such that more support will go towards the needy.&nbsp; Shopping vouchers are given to everybody regardless of income, age and needs.&nbsp; I heard even a new-born baby in Taiwan also&nbsp;receives the&nbsp;shopping vouchers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, because most of us get these benefits GIRO-ed into our bank accounts, or in lieu of would-be expenses, people do not really see or feel it.&nbsp; Although a credit note in the bank statement does not feel the same as hard cash or vouchers in our hands, I do hope people will recognise the intended benefits of the package and put the extra cash to good use, whether to tide over a difficult patch, to save it for a rainy day or to churn it through the local economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are different ways of using and stretching the dollar and&nbsp;we may need to moderate our own expectations.&nbsp; I have residents who come and complain to me about high utility costs.&nbsp; There was one who lives in a five-room flat and lamented that he has to pay $400 for his monthly electricity bills.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;asked further, he admitted&nbsp;that his children would switch&nbsp;on the air-conditioning whenever they are at home.&nbsp; So I have to explain to such residents that we have to pay for what we use.&nbsp; If we are suffering a drop in income, if we want to cut our expenses, we must be also prepared to make adjustments in our lifestyle.&nbsp; We cannot just look to the Government for handouts&nbsp;so that we can maintain a certain lifestyle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1710<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My three children like to draw.&nbsp; So, at home, we always keep a stock of used printed paper, bill statements, letters, flyers and the like, which still have a blank page to it so that they can&nbsp;express their creativity.&nbsp; We do not, of course, keep every drawing and it is also a pity to throw those&nbsp;away.&nbsp; So what my&nbsp;wife would do is to use these drawings as wrapping paper for presents.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the same piece of paper is used three times&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;in the original print, as&nbsp;drawing paper for my kids and finally as&nbsp;wrapping paper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also a recent feature in the <I>Straits Times</I> on DIYs, with brilliant ideas of how we can&nbsp;achieve the same results using minimal resources.&nbsp; During these difficult times, every person and every business should look at ways to better optimise limited resources.&nbsp; And I think this should also apply to the&nbsp;Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Budget debate last year, I mentioned that while it is important that each Ministry and Government agency has its clear responsibility, it should not become a situation where our Government bodies are doing only what is clearly within their respective mandate, with no one wanting to take responsibility for the grey areas.&nbsp; Or, worse still, we must be&nbsp;faced with multi-party bureaucracy when the situation becomes complicated and no one wants or dares to take ownership.&nbsp; I hope we do not lose the bigger picture that every Ministry, agency and department is part of the same&nbsp;Government providing a public service to the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;the way resources are allocated to each Ministry&nbsp;is very well demarcated with a fixed set of key performance indicators (KPIs) and the&nbsp;agency also needs to be accountable on how it uses its resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe resources under each Ministry are well utilised.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as the saying goes, the total is greater than the sum of&nbsp;its parts.&nbsp; I am not sure if the resources of the whole Government could <p align=left>Column: 1711<p>have been better and more optimally utilised to offer a total and better service to the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are common facilities and assets held by different agencies.&nbsp; For example, a classroom is a classroom, whether it is used by MOE for school children, by the&nbsp;People's Association (PA) for&nbsp;community courses in a CC, or by WDA for&nbsp;skill upgrading courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we already maximising the use of such a classroom?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April last year, the National Parks Board and Singapore Land Authority embarked on a tree bank project.&nbsp; This joint initiative created tree banks to effectively optimise the use of vacant state land and, at the same time, beautify them and provide green lungs for the community.&nbsp; On the other hand, this collaboration provides NParks a supply of trees for landscaping needs in Singapore.&nbsp; So here we have two Government agencies tapping on each other's resources and expertise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is the opening up of school fields and indoor sports halls for public usage.&nbsp; During weekends when the school facilities are not utilised, the Singapore Sports Council will manage them to allow access to the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now share some other examples in Mandarin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2009/20090204/20090204VS_115001.pdf"">Appendix A</a> *.</I>]&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, recently I was in Hong Kong where I attended the rehearsal by the Perry Chiu Experimental Theatre which was rehearsing the musical "<I>Wild Wild Rose</I>" for its performance in Singapore. I discovered that the venue for its rehearsal was, in fact, the conference room of one of the district offices of the Hong Kong&nbsp;Leisure and Cultural Services Department.&nbsp; In the day, the room is used by a <p align=left>Column: 1712<p>government department for its meetings and conferences.&nbsp; At night, it is used by the theatre group to rehearse its play.&nbsp; I think this is a very creative arrangement.&nbsp; Both the government department and the theatre group need a place to operate, but at different times.&nbsp; There is no conflict and it is very well coordinated.&nbsp; It is an office in the day and holds theatre rehearsals in the night.&nbsp; A public facility is thus put to optimal use.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, the Singapore Chinese Opera Institute's&nbsp;premises in Middle Road was acquired and they have to move out by the end of this month.&nbsp; The National Arts Council (NAC) has arranged for the Chinese Opera Institute to move to the Telok Ayer Performing Arts Centre, but the new venue is much smaller than the original premises.&nbsp; After putting in all the stage costumes, there is no space left to conduct classes.&nbsp; The Institute's Director, Dr Chua Soo Pong, approached me for help to get some venues in the Community Centres in the Queenstown area for them to conduct their classes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we spoke&nbsp;about charges, I discovered that the NAC's arts housing scheme has actually provided very good rental subsidies for the arts groups.&nbsp; For the three-storey clubhouse in Middle Road, the Singapore Chinese Opera Institute was paying&nbsp;about $300 a month in rental.&nbsp; In comparison, even with the concessionary rates for community organisations,&nbsp;$300 would&nbsp;barely be enough to pay for use of a classroom for six lessons.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; certainly not affordable.&nbsp; I understand that PA's primary objective is not to&nbsp;promote the&nbsp;arts&nbsp;&ndash; there is no grudge about it, but I am sure there are some vacant spaces in the more than 100 Community Centres all over Singapore.&nbsp; Can NAC borrow them for arts facilities?&nbsp; In what way can the facilities of PA be used to support the arts in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I> ):&nbsp; Sir, I would like to propose the creation of a Budget with <p align=left>Column: 1713<p>pseudo-dollars for a Ministry to pay for the use of another Ministry's resources.&nbsp; For example, in my constituency, there is a precinct at Lengkok Bahru with a severe shortage of parking lots for the residents due to the configuration and terrain.&nbsp; There are limited parking lots in the immediate vicinity and most season parking permit holders have to walk 10 minutes to a nearby carpark.&nbsp; However, just across the road, two minutes away is a huge carpark belonging to a school cluster building, which is always empty after office hours.&nbsp; Evening and overnight are exactly the periods when the residents would come home and need to park their vehicles.&nbsp; So the&nbsp;residents see that as Government resources that could be much better utilised.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, we will have to set up security measures in the school compound and arrangements&nbsp;so that&nbsp;drivers can&nbsp;remove to their cars before the school cluster starts operations the next morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe such matters can be resolved quite easily by our administrators.&nbsp; But we must understand that it is not the mandate of MOE to provide parking for residents.&nbsp; This is where I think the pseudo-dollars will come in useful.&nbsp; MND or HDB could pay MOE for this additional resource that would help them fulfil their responsibility towards the residents and, of course, solve my problem as a local MP.&nbsp; The pseudo-dollars will also be a good indication of how well inter-Ministry cooperation is working, and this could also ultimately save Government some money too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if the National Arts Council is able to use pseudo-dollars to support arts groups to be housed in CCs or for rehearsals to be conducted in the school auditoriums and Government buildings after office hours,&nbsp; NAC may need less resources to develop and maintain arts housing.&nbsp; Besides the arts, CCs can also be used for economic <p align=left>Column: 1714<p>activities.&nbsp; I have two CCs in Queenstown.&nbsp; The rooms are only 40% utilised</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1847-1848.<BR></div></P></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

I am sure if we put our minds to it, we will find many other cases where resources of one Government body can be leveraged upon to serve the needs of another department and ultimately the needs of the country and our people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all, it will be a tighter and better usage of our&nbsp;resources and better integration of Government services for Singapore and Singaporeans.&nbsp; The pseudo-dollars will also expand the reach and effect of the Budget.&nbsp; $20.5 billion could well have a value and impact of $30 billion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member):</B> &nbsp;Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Budget Statement of the Finance Minister.&nbsp; Indeed these are extraordinary times.&nbsp; While the world hopes that President Obama will do enough to stabilise the situation, there is no clear light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; This crisis may yet turn into global financial meltdown and a global depression.&nbsp; The only comfort Singaporeans can have is that our accumulated reserves will stand us in good stead.&nbsp; I also do not believe that&nbsp;this is the end of civilisation as we know it.&nbsp; It is true that recovery is not yet in sight and when it comes, it is likely to be a prolonged weak recovery, but I am confident that&nbsp;the global economy will recover at some stage.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a people, we need to rally around the Government, close ranks and help each other to survive this turmoil.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1715<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I applaud the Government&rsquo;s decisive and timely action to present the Resilience Package and obtain the President&rsquo;s agreement to dip into our reserves.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jobs Credit Scheme in the Resilience Package is novel and helpful.&nbsp; Many marginally profitable businesses, especially SMEs, would benefit from the job credits.&nbsp; This is a very direct response to private sector&rsquo;s plea for the Government to help lower business cost.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also agree that this scheme is better than cutting employers&rsquo; CPF contributions as a CPF cut will reduce wages of workers, their earnings and thereby reduce their ability to service their housing loans. Besides, this crisis is brought on by shrinking global demand and not because of our uncompetitive labour costs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Jobs Credit will also enable businesses to better hold on to their Singaporean workers.&nbsp; In a way, the job credit has helped to make the Singaporean worker more competitive <I>vis-a-vis</I> foreign workers.&nbsp; I&nbsp;believe this is a move in the right direction. This is a commendable way to cut costs and save jobs.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also take comfort in the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that whilst this is a temporary measure, the Government is prepared to extend this measure in some form in accordance with the state of the economy.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many Singaporeans, I am appreciative of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to save jobs, especially when it is difficult in this environment to create new jobs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have done well these last 40 years.&nbsp; Very few people in this House know what it is&nbsp;like to want work and not be able to get work.&nbsp; But I remember <p align=left>Column: 1716<p>when I was a young boy in the 1950s, jobs were so scarce that when someone was called up for interview after scores of applications, the whole <I>kampong</I> waited with bated breath for the outcome. When the kampong boy,&nbsp;"tua kow" (big dog), his name, that was what his mother called him, got a job as a salesman in a sports shop, the whole <I>kampong</I> celebrated. It was like striking 4D!&nbsp; That was a long time ago.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members may remember&nbsp;the 1963-1965 period when there was "Confrontasi" and Singapore&rsquo;s entrepot trade with Indonesia fell through the bottom. I remember&nbsp;"<I>Ba&nbsp;Wang Che</I> "&nbsp;or unlicensed taxi mushrooming overnight.&nbsp; Anyone who could lay his hands on a vehicle will be plying North Bridge Road and Victoria Street, picking up loose passengers for 20&nbsp;to 30 cents each.&nbsp; Others would do whatever was needed, lawful or otherwise, to eke out a living to put rice on the table.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having grown up in a very different Singapore and having personally experienced those conditions, I deeply understand the importance of saving jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Because if joblessness is allowed to spread and becomes widespread, when every Singaporean has got&nbsp;a few relatives unemployed, Singaporeans&rsquo; morale will sag, despondency will creep in and soon lawlessness will spread.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;sure the Government will do everything it can to prevent such a nightmarish scenario.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a society we can give Jobs Credit and Workfare.&nbsp; We rather do that&nbsp;than welfare for the&nbsp;unemployed.&nbsp; This is right, as Workfare and Jobs Credit come with the dignity of one earning one's keep and not receiving handouts.&nbsp; The dignity of his labour and hence his self-esteem is preserved.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning, I read press reports of the debates in this House yesterday.&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 1717<p>understand some of my hon. colleagues have misgivings about the Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp; May I shed some light from an employer&rsquo;s perspective?&nbsp;My company employs 1,200 staff, not counting the doctors, and so on.&nbsp; The 12% Jobs Credit will enable us to create another 100 jobs and be cost neutral.&nbsp; We have not had to retrench staff.&nbsp; We are still growing and we are still recruiting staff for growth.&nbsp; The additional 100 jobs will enable us to send other staff for training, upgrading and&nbsp;fill positions that we could not have&nbsp;filled previously.&nbsp; 100 additional jobs may not be much, but it also means 100 more families will have another source of income, to help put food on the table.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister has informed us that 18,000 jobs will be created in the public sector, that is good.&nbsp; And the jobs is supposed to be for&nbsp;teaching positions, teaching support staff, in healthcare, the&nbsp;Home Team, MINDEF and the rest of public service.&nbsp; I suspect some of these positions have not been easy to fill in times when the economy was buoyant. While I welcome these new jobs, I call on the Government to ensure that these "extra hands" must not be converted into permanent establishment, as people get used to "extra hands". Our attempt at Keynesian economics must not be allowed to lead to a bloated bureaucracy.&nbsp; It will undo many years of gallant efforts to keep our Government lean, trim and efficient.&nbsp; I also hope the Minister would ensure that the increased funds will be used to employ new staff, and not used to pay more bonuses or higher salaries to a few <I>prima donnas</I> or high-flyers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also other more meaningful ways we can create jobs for Singaporeans. Would the Minister not seriously consider outsourcing some of the tasks to be carried out by these 18,000 new public servants to the private sector?&nbsp; The Minister has said the current crisis is the result of shrinking worldwide <p align=left>Column: 1718<p>demand for goods and services&nbsp; I agree with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I believe if some of these tasks&nbsp;were to be&nbsp;outsourced to the private sector, more Singapore companies and SMEs will with the additional demand survive better.&nbsp; Those businesses which are doing well, will do even better with some outsourced work.&nbsp; This will enable them to be better able to compete and perhaps even expand into the region when conditions are more favourable.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure quite a few of the tasks waiting to be done by the 18,000 public sector employees can be&nbsp;easily&nbsp;outsourced to Singapore companies.&nbsp; Sir, at this point, I&nbsp;must declare my interests as Chairman of Raffles Medical Group, a local healthcare company.&nbsp; Sir, look at the jobs.&nbsp; 7,500 jobs&nbsp;in teaching and teaching support.&nbsp; Can we not outsource the teaching support jobs?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we not let whole schools be managed by suitable private companies and hold them accountable for performance, standards, quality and outcome?&nbsp; 4,500 jobs&nbsp;for healthcare professionals and administrative staff for<br> our hospitals&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;can we not outsource some of these tasks and even patient treatment?&nbsp; 1,400 jobs for Home Team. &nbsp;MHA has successfully outsourced the imposition and collection of fines for traffic offences. Can we not go further?<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is actually quite an efficient market and there are many companies happy to provide various services to the Government.&nbsp; Sir, let us also speculate why we are not doing enough outsourcing when we have the opportunity to.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it has to do with our instincts for control. We rather employ than buy services.&nbsp; Or perhaps it is an article of faith, somewhere which says,&nbsp;&nbsp;"that the public sector is the most<br>efficient provider of goods and services".&nbsp; I do not have the answer.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some may say that the public sector jobs require security clearance.&nbsp; Hence it <p align=left>Column: 1719<p>is not easy to outsource them.&nbsp; I am quite&nbsp;sure not all the 18,000 jobs are security-related.&nbsp; Even where there is security element we have appropriate private sector firms like CISCO, Aetos, which can undertake these jobs, without compromising security.&nbsp; Whatever the reason or reasons, I strongly urge the Minister to thoughtfully consider this proposal, as not only will the outsourced tasks also result in job creation, but&nbsp;it will also result in marginal companies being kept afloat, keeping their current staff employed.&nbsp; With luck, we may even help thriving local enterprises bloom and become strong, big companies contributing to Singapore economy in a bigger way.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many local companies are still feeling the credit squeeze.&nbsp; I am sure you have heard a lot about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising to find foreign banks using their governmental bailout&nbsp;&ndash; not our Government but their&nbsp;governmental bailout funds to ensure their own survival, rather than to lend to their clients.&nbsp; Our local banks do not receive any bailout funds, but they naturally have to look after their own balance sheet first, just like my colleague Denise has said.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Special Risk-sharing Initiative (SRI), the new Bridging Loan Programme (BLP), together with the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) and Micro Loan Programme (MLP) should help stimulate bank lending theoretically.&nbsp; With the Government underwriting 80% of the risks, the risk-reward ratio is actually&nbsp;five times for the bank.&nbsp; It sounds like our local banks should be rushing to extend credit to our businesses on such terms.&nbsp; It is comforting to hear at least one local bank stating that&nbsp;it is processing increased&nbsp; number of&nbsp; applications and&nbsp;it is&nbsp;processing them as quickly as&nbsp;it can.&nbsp; But to date, the business community is still lamenting the poor credit availability and that banks are still not keen to lend.&nbsp; You <p align=left>Column: 1720<p>have heard Ms Denise Phua&nbsp;elaborating on this.&nbsp; These people who complain and lament&nbsp;&ndash; they cannot possibly all be unworthy borrowers!<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As credit is the lifeline of business, I urge the Minister to monitor the situation very closely and to explore with our local banks how beyond these schemes they can help support our businesses better.&nbsp; I am very sure borrowers who are supported in this period would be quite grateful to their bankers and become loyal customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the event that there are real structural and institutional obstacles to stimulating bank lending, I urge the Minister to seriously consider the setting up of some form of financial institution to meet this need. A new financial institution with a clean balance sheet may be able to do more for businesses in line with SRI framework.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have been involved with ACE (Action Community for Entrepreneurship)&nbsp;which promotes entrepreneurship and start-ups and have seen SPRING&rsquo;s work supporting SMEs.&nbsp; Successful enterprises and businesses are not easy to start or sustain. Most start-ups fail.&nbsp; But when they have been around&nbsp;a few years, they confer value to our society, they provide goods and services, jobs, pay taxes and many even contribute to social causes.&nbsp; Some of the start-ups and SMEs do grow into solid companies contributing even more to Singapore.&nbsp; Therefore, it is in our collective interests to nurture and support our enterprises and businesses through this crisis.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me not be misunderstood.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not arguing for propping up failing companies blindly.&nbsp; The Darwinian law of "survival of the fittest" must apply to businesses as well.&nbsp; But if erstwhile viable companies succumb to this sudden and unexpected crisis, we should extend a hand.&nbsp; When an enterprise goes under, it <p align=left>Column: 1721<p>is not just that jobs are lost, but also knowledge, business networks, brands&nbsp;that&nbsp;can evaporate overnight.&nbsp; There is the knock-on effect on suppliers, service providers, creditors, etc.&nbsp; These suppliers, providers and creditors may also fail in time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chronically unfit companies will go down sooner or later and they should be allowed to go down. We must not throw good money after bad.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our local enterprises often under lobby the Government. We are too polite.&nbsp; Look at the situation in America.&nbsp; The banks, insurance companies, automobile industry, steel industry&nbsp;&ndash; they&nbsp;do not hesitate to use whatever clout they have to cajole, demand or sometimes threaten their government for bailout packages or financial injection.</p></P></span></div>    <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, in spite of the private sector's very measured feedback, the Government has heeded their plea to reduce business costs and help make credit more readily available.&nbsp; Together, these measures should help most businesses see through this tough period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the various SPUR initiatives to&nbsp;use this downturn to retrain our workers and prepare for the recovery. When the recovery comes, we want to charge ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But besides retraining and upgrading our workers' skills and competency, I believe we need to also develop our psychological resilience. We need to strengthen our collective resolve to stare the crisis in the eye and prevail.&nbsp; With&nbsp;the news media broadcasting doom and gloom stories daily, it is understandable that the more senior workers, the sole breadwinners are worried and their spirits are down.&nbsp; This is especially so if there is a retrenchment exercise in their companies, even though they are still in jobs.&nbsp; But we must not allow them to <p align=left>Column: 1722<p>become immobilised by depression or fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a community, if we rally around each other, the going gets easier because they will not feel they are facing this crisis by themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, whilst I worry about the sagging morale of older workers, I have a slightly different concern about our&nbsp;younger workers.&nbsp; Perhaps this recession may be long enough to re-educate younger Singaporeans on the need for a true work-life balance.&nbsp; Old and conservative as I am, I am also&nbsp;for work-life balance.&nbsp; But I notice that we now have "all life" and "very little work".&nbsp; Younger Singaporeans view work as something they have to do&nbsp;&ndash; they do not like it but they&nbsp; have to do&nbsp;&ndash; just to justify the pay they get.&nbsp; Often, they attend to their jobs grudgingly.&nbsp; This attitude has even penetrated the ranks of younger doctors and nurses who are professionals who ought to be committed to&nbsp;compassion, service and sacrifice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what worries me is that, over this period, I have detected a serious erosion of our work ethics.&nbsp; In December these past years,&nbsp;the <I>Straits Times</I>, without fail, will publish a list of public holidays with advisory and colourful calendar on how to maximise one's leave. For&nbsp;example, how&nbsp;one could take three days' leave and be away from&nbsp;workplace for nine days between&nbsp; 24th January and 1st February. No one is thinking of their shop in that nine days.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have nothing against our young Singaporeans having fun and partying.&nbsp; But I hope they will work as hard as they play hard. That work-life balance is about the right measure of work with a right measure of play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to keep things in perspective and not to let our collective work ethics be eroded and lose our competitiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am quite concerned with what my colleague, Mr Nordin, said about&nbsp;our productivity going down. Sir,&nbsp;in 2004,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1723<p>when the public service went into five-day week, we also hope that our procreation ability will improve. Private sector soon followed.&nbsp; By reviewing the total births,&nbsp;37,485 in 2003&nbsp;to&nbsp;39,490 in 2007 and Total Fertility Rate (TFR) was 1.27 in 2003 to 1.29 in 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say&nbsp;the effect has been feeble at most. We might as well accept that as a people, our procreation talent is not our forte -&nbsp;nothing to crow about!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in view of the fact that a&nbsp;five-day week has not helped us&nbsp;get the babies we hoped for, and in view of the progressive erosion of our work ethics, I urge the Government to take steps to determine whether our productivity and competitiveness have been affected by the five-day week and to review the policy if necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, I hope the&nbsp;Government, unions and employers will take steps to prevent&nbsp;the further erosion of our work ethics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we spend more on infrastructure projects, recruit more public servants, I urge the Government not to relax its discipline to stay trim and fit.&nbsp; In particular, I urge the Government to continue to reduce wastages in the public sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, Mr Baey Yam Keng, has mentioned a lot of examples.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, the cost of public sector services has to be passed on to businesses and taxpayers.&nbsp; One sees wastages in&nbsp;allocation and utilisation of resources especially during bountiful years.&nbsp; I hope in this recession, we&nbsp;will be more vigilant&nbsp;to reduce wastages in the public sector as much as possible because every bit counts and every bit will improve our competitiveness. Wastages help no one.&nbsp; I wonder what has happened to our&nbsp;Cut Waste Panel, whether it still exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am glad to see us supporting families to the tune of $2.6 billion and <p align=left>Column: 1724<p>also provide targeted help&nbsp;for vulnerable groups, whilst we do much to reduce business costs and to keep people in&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to commend the Government on its prudent fiscal policy over these past few years.&nbsp; Saving for&nbsp;a rainy day&nbsp;has&nbsp;always been&nbsp;its <I>mantra</I>.&nbsp; I remember last year, when&nbsp;we had a bountiful year, there were many calls from both sides of this House for more spending.&nbsp; In retrospect, we now see how keeping some of the surpluses in reserve for the rainy days makes sense. We do not know how long this recession will last and how deep it will go. Having some reserves tucked&nbsp;away gives us the reassurance and confidence that we will survive this financial tsunami.&nbsp; I support the drawing of $4.5 billion from our past reserves for this Budget and for the purposes set out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one other grave and serious concern I have is that of the exposure, known or unknown, that Government agencies and Government-Linked Companies may have to the market place. The basis for my concern is the fact that Iceland, a small country of 300,000 tough and hard working people have gone bankrupt overnight. In our region and even at home, supposedly well-managed companies have been caught out with hundreds of millions and billions of dollar losses on currency, and equity hedges.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard that even very savvy, well-regarded and respected investors have been caught out. When one looks at the list of people who have lost money in the Madoff Ponzi scheme, one sees established banks and previously credible fund managers and wealthy individuals&nbsp;losing money.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now well-known that many financial derivative products and credit default swaps are created in such&nbsp;a complicated&nbsp;manner, that nobody other than the creator, who is usually an <p align=left>Column: 1725<p>engineer, understands how they work. Most sales people do not understand the product and many buyers, individuals, CFOs, CIOs, CEOs do not fully know what they are buying, and are too shy to ask! After all, so many other companies are buying also&nbsp;&ndash; they think!<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My concern is with investments that may be open positioned when the losses are not capped and not even quantifiable at the time of entering into the investment.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the old days when we were a smaller economy, old guard Ministers and senior civil servants like Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr Hon Sui Sen, Mr Howe Yoong Chong and Mr Sim Kee Boon would guard the monies entrusted to them with an eagle eye,&nbsp;often more carefully than they guard their own. Today, we are bigger, we have more money to manage and we are more spread out. We employ fund managers to look after our monies. They are paid salaries and bonuses. But it is the bonuses, which are performance-based that makes a lot of money for them. The basis of their compensation follows that of Wall Street banks. Hence, it is in their interests to take risks on behalf of the owner. Their own risk is only their jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One particular group of products called "the accumulator", which is meant to provide equity or currency hedge, requires the investor to double up when the hedge goes against him. Many such "investors" have been burnt.&nbsp; They lose more than their principal, that means, if you invest $1 million, you may end up losing $10 million or more, in this turbulent market.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in current market conditions, even well-managed and well-diversified portfolios will be under-performing. So I am not&nbsp;worried about paper loses at this point of time. If the portfolio is not too leveraged, it should recover when financial markets recover. I am not alleging any <p align=left>Column: 1726<p>misconduct on anyone's part. Neither am I saying there is anything amiss. But looking at what is happening to other institutions around us, I am urging caution.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Minister of Finance to exercise greater oversight on all the Government agencies and Government entities. The current risk management framework may not be sufficient. Many global banks and insurance companies are still not able to ascertain the extent of their exposure and liabilities. That is why they are asking for more and more billions of dollars of bailout funds.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, the hon.&nbsp;Senior Minister of State for Finance answered my question on contingent liabilities in the best way she could. I thank her gallant efforts. We have all learned by now that question time is not the place to debate real issues so today is my chance! I accept that there are controls and oversights over the issue of guarantees. But what about other exposures?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; External auditors do their auditing and reporting based on representation by management&nbsp;or letters of representation. Board directors&nbsp;rely on these reports. Internal auditors with access to the Chairman of Audit Committee may help reduce these risks, but they may also not know or understand the exposures the CFO, CIO, or CEO have undertaken.&nbsp; This is a new situation.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adherence to FRS39 itself may not be adequate. FRS39 only requires reporting at the closing of accounts and at a fair value. Often,&nbsp;fair value&nbsp;is difficult to ascertain if there is no ready market.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is quite plausible that these gaps exist in some of our Government agencies and Government-Linked Companies. Annual audit and reports may not be adequate. The whole world has turned topsy-turvy in the last&nbsp;three months. In <p align=left>Column: 1727<p>this new dynamic and evolving situation, one month is an eternity.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I urge the Minister to require improvement to the overall risk management process. And if we have such exposures, we should take appropriate steps to reduce or mitigate our exposure while it is&nbsp; manageable. Why?&nbsp; Because our past, present and future reserves and hence, the future of our children and grandchildren are at stake. So there is&nbsp;little room for politeness.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally I would like to commend the Minister for Finance on his Budget statement. It is clear, thoughtful, bold and decisive. It balances our short-term needs with our longer term goals.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I am sure that the team had to consider all possible options and more without any past experiences to fall back on, to come out with what I consider an innovative and bold Budget to tackle this unparalleled <p align=left>Column: 1728<p>global economic tsunami.&nbsp; I therefore applaud Minister Tharman and his team for this&nbsp;FY 2009 Budget which still allows for possible off-Budget measures if the situation warrants it in the months ahead.&nbsp; I therefore support the Budget and the decision of the Minister to tap into our reserves.&nbsp; Extreme circumstances call for extreme measures and solutions.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before I move on to my subject of focus, I would just like to voice my concern, like many in this House, about the difficulty of SMEs getting credits from banks.&nbsp; Without credit and cash flow, our SMEs will find it nearly impossible to do business and survive.&nbsp; I would like, therefore, to ask the Minister to consider increasing the Government's risk portion to 100% for a short period of, say, 12 months to kickstart the Bridging Loan Programme (BLP).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, to my subject of focus which affects the environment and our health.&nbsp; This refers to the extension of the special tax exemption for compressed natural gas for CNG vehicles.&nbsp; Sir, the Singapore Government introduced the special tax exemption for CNG vehicles in 2001 to promote the use of green vehicles, which includes CNG vehicles.&nbsp; I took some trouble to trace the history of CNG in Singapore and I found that between 2001 and 2006, the incentives introduced for CNG vehicles did not attract much attention.&nbsp; Referring to NEA and LTA websites on clean air, it was obvious that the promotion of green vehicles and CNG in Singapore was to improve our air quality, particularly to reduce particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5).&nbsp; PM2.5 is&nbsp;a fine pollutant, 2.5 micron in size, that is linked to asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory problems, including premature death in people with heart and lung diseases.&nbsp; The average level of PM2.5 for Singapore was 19 micrograms per m3 in 2003 and 21 micrograms per m3 in 2005, exceeding the international accepted standard of 15 micrograms per m3 set by <p align=left>Column: 1729<p>the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).&nbsp; There has been no public figure released for PM2.5 after 2005.&nbsp; I can only assume that it has been increasing from 2003 to 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty percent&nbsp;of this invisible pollutant is contributed by diesel vehicles.&nbsp; Petrol-driven cars also contribute to PM2.5 but at a lower level.&nbsp; However, CNG cars&nbsp;make negligible amounts of particulate matter as well as lower levels of other pollutants&nbsp;like CO2 compared to petrol-driven vehicles.&nbsp; I therefore assume and conclude that the incentives for special tax exemption for CNG vehicles was introduced to encourage the import of&nbsp;or conversion&nbsp;to CNG vehicles in order to improve Singapore's air quality to meet acceptable and international standards of 15 micrograms per&nbsp;m3 mainly for health reasons.&nbsp; Why then are we giving these incentives for a two-year period?&nbsp; Are we expecting that the take-up rate for CNG vehicles will be such that in two years, we would meet the 15 micrograms per m3 levels?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, very briefly, I would like to provide the House with the history of CNG in Singapore.&nbsp; Tax rebates for new registration for CNG vehicles were introduced by the Government in October 2001 and then extended twice to September 2006.&nbsp; There was very little response and sweeteners were announced by the Government for CNG taxis to be exempted from the special tax until December 2007.&nbsp; In addition, the "green" vehicle rebate was increased from 20% to 40% for private vehicles which was extended to December 2009.&nbsp; At the end of 2007, there were only 250 private CNG cars on our roads, including 220 CNG taxis.&nbsp; In 2008, LTA registered an additional 2,196 private CNG cars and 757 CNG taxis.&nbsp; I suspect it is because of the large differential prices between CNG and petrol and diesel.&nbsp; Two CNG stations were opened and two more were&nbsp;scheduled for 2009.&nbsp; However, in the last three months of 2008, because of <p align=left>Column: 1730<p>negative press coverage putting doubts whether Government would extend the special tax incentives, the sale of&nbsp;and conversion&nbsp;to CNG vehicles dropped as there was no clarity from the Government.&nbsp; Two other factors accelerated the process&nbsp;&ndash; not enough CNG stations and the smaller disparity between cost of petrol and CNG because of the weakening the price of oil, over and above the uncertainty about the special tax and CNG tax.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to date, this has caused the closure of 10 or 20&nbsp;workshops converting petrol and diesel vehicles into CNG vehicles and a loss of approximately 100 skilled jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore suggest that if the main reason for promoting CNG vehicles is to protect our environment and our health,&nbsp;the Minister should then consider (1) extending the green vehicle rebate for the next five to 10 years and to include this incentive to cover the conversion of petrol and diesel vehicles, biofuel vehicles&nbsp;for fleet owners of taxis, buses and trucks.&nbsp; They basically own diesel-run vehicles.&nbsp; (2) To remove the tax levy on CNG up to 2015.&nbsp; This is to allow sufficient time for the infrastructure to develop in Singapore and to compensate those with CNG vehicles for the inconvenience of having&nbsp;to travel distances and&nbsp;to wait in line at the two CNG stations that are currently available.&nbsp; I was told that Germany has announced a tax free regime for CNG until 2018 to promote and allow an investment&nbsp;for good infrastructure to be built up for CNG by the private sector.&nbsp; Looking at the Minister's proposed 20 cents per kilogram tax, I was told that over the last 12 months, 3.5 million kilograms of gas were consumed out of our two CNG stations.&nbsp; This works out to approximately $700,000 per year in terms of tax.&nbsp; To me, it is relatively a small amount.&nbsp; (3) To provide special incentives for those who invest in more CNG stations so as to encourage more of these stations to be built.&nbsp; The development of the LNG facility <p align=left>Column: 1731<p>would ensure fuel security to supply to these gas stations.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>    <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me to participate in this Budget debate.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing to participate in this Budget debate.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, every year after the Budget announcement, parliamentarians always receive a large brown envelope containing the Budget speech and annexes.&nbsp; This year, it was not a brown envelope but a black cloth bag.&nbsp; Either to match our suits or to suit the mood, I remember saying at that time, or it was obviously a save-the-environment initiative.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, Sir, there were also far more important changes about this year's Budget.&nbsp; The economic outlook for Singapore has changed.&nbsp; And the Budget reflects that, with its $20.5 billion Resilience Package.&nbsp; In response, I would like to do two things in my speech: to talk about resilience as a nation; and to offer my humble ideas as we face possibly the deepest recession in our history.&nbsp; I say humble ideas&nbsp;because the best economic minds around the world have been hard at work already, trying to resuscitate their&nbsp;respective economies, and it is proving to <p align=left>Column: 1732<p>be a massive task.&nbsp; But if every idea counts, if every Singaporean matters, then&nbsp;I humbly speak from a citizen's point of view.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Jobs Credit Scheme, certainly a better way of cutting costs than the practice in past recessions of cutting CPF contributions.&nbsp; However, the big question we are all wondering, the question for which the answer will only be known later this year is whether it can save enough jobs.&nbsp; The Minister pointed out that the problem we face this time is not one of wage competitiveness.&nbsp; Unlike in the 1980s, for example, the problem we face this time is a slump in global demand.&nbsp; Even low-cost China, as the Minister pointed out, is suffering job losses.&nbsp; Even profitable companies such as Microsoft are saying they have to streamline.&nbsp; In Singapore, it has already happened with DBS, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jobs Credit does not change market realities.&nbsp; These are the reasons why some are wondering if the scheme is enough of an incentive for companies to save jobs.&nbsp; In the US, the proposal was shelved because of fears that it could be abused by businesses, especially profitable businesses which do not need to have their payroll subsidised.&nbsp; It is quite clear that if we can improve the Jobs Credit Scheme, we should do it.&nbsp; If we can make it more effective, more bang-for-the-buck, we should do it.&nbsp; If we can mitigate abuse, we should do it.&nbsp; So why not reduce the payout for companies that accept the Credits and then retrench?&nbsp; Axe 5% percent of your headcount, then Government only gives 9%, instead of 12% of the wages of the remaining employees.&nbsp; Layoff 10%? Government gives 6% and so on.&nbsp; If, as the Minister said, the intent is to provide a significant incentive for companies to retain existing workers, then surely this sounds more like an incentive.&nbsp; In its existing form, the Jobs Credit is all carrot without the condition&nbsp;&ndash; which is to save jobs.&nbsp; No <p align=left>Column: 1733<p>wonder some say that this is pro-business more than pro-worker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be that as it may, I also see the intent to help businesses with their cash flow.&nbsp; And I think we can do more in this regard.&nbsp; Since the Government is giving residents who lose their jobs more time to pay their income taxes from 12 months to 24 months.&nbsp; Why not do the same for companies and their taxable income?&nbsp; Perhaps this will help the very companies we want, to weather the storm.&nbsp; Perhaps this gives us another tool to save jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, I do not doubt that Jobs Credit will save some jobs. In fact, I was pleased to hear that the scheme would be extended to VWOs.&nbsp; I was pleased, in general, about the support for charitable giving, eg, tax reductions of 250% for donations in 2009 to IPCs will definitely encourage donations.&nbsp; Could&nbsp;I just add one suggestion, one clarification and one comment?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the suggestion&nbsp;&ndash; since we know how important families are, since we know how important the social service sector is in propping up our families, especially the less fortunate ones, and since we know that manpower is an issue for VWOs&nbsp;&ndash; all of which the Minister acknowledged in his Budget delivery&nbsp;&ndash; is it possible to give extra Jobs Credit to the social service sector?&nbsp; Is it possible, at a time when families are going to come under increasing strain because of the deepening recession, to give social service employers 15% or even 20% of the first $2,500 of the wages of their employees, so that VWOs can not only retain their social workers, but to hire new ones, to hire good ones to cope with the expected demand for their services.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know policymakers like to keep policies clean, simple and as uniform as possible, but is it possible to exercise some flexibility, rather than rigidity, and do this in the name of our families?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1734<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, a request for clarifications&nbsp;&ndash; an additional $15 million will be given to Government-funded VWOs, bringing the total to about $220 million a year.&nbsp; What will the money be used for?&nbsp; How much is going towards training social workers?&nbsp; For example, is there a professional conversion programme under the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience, or will there be other courses under SPUR, in the university or otherwise, for social work?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, my comment&nbsp;&ndash; besides the need to professionalise our charities for capacity building, the Government needs to take a look at whether there&nbsp;are duplication of resources within the charity sector.&nbsp; Here, I would like to acknowledge the views of my colleague, Ms Irene Ng, with whom I agree.&nbsp; It is one thing to have a "many helping hands approach", it is another to have too many helping hands, resulting in less than satisfactory delivery of social schemes.&nbsp; We need to be more structured in this area so that those in need of help will be less confused about who to turn to for help and what help is available.&nbsp; And it is time Government took the lead.&nbsp; MCYS and the CDCs should really be the starting point for the needy.&nbsp; Government agencies are the ones which help fund the VWOs and their programmes.&nbsp; Government agencies work with the VWOs so if the agencies can get a better sense of the needs on the ground, they will be better placed to ensure a more efficient needs-based social support system, instead of MPs and Meet-the-People sessions as a default starting point for social assistance.&nbsp; Judging from the way the ComCare Fund is not being fully tapped, as the <I>TODAY</I> newspaper reported yesterday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, now that I have touched on the volunteer sector, let me move on to the rest of the Budget.&nbsp; The Minister for Finance&nbsp;said that keeping jobs will provide more support and confidence for the domestic sector of the economy than <p align=left>Column: 1735<p>efforts to stimulate consumption demand directly.&nbsp; But why not do both?&nbsp; There is one school of thought among economists that, if governments really want to put the brakes on the current economic decline, they need to act early,&nbsp;pre-emptively and to spare no effort at all.&nbsp; So, why not consider spending vouchers for citizens, such as in Taiwan where each person received US$170?&nbsp; Shopping coupons which cannot kept in the bank or spent on the likes of cigarettes and gambling, unlike GST Credits.&nbsp;A voucher that is guaranteed to be spent on goods and services provided by retailers, wholesalers and food and beverage establishments in Singapore, before a certain date or it will expire.&nbsp; Since plummeting demand is a threat to jobs.&nbsp; Why not add this to our toolbox and do even more to save jobs?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Singaporeans are wondering if there are sacred cows the Government is not willing to touch.&nbsp; I do not think vouchers are one of them, but certainly many think that GST would be one.&nbsp; In the UK, there had been a temporary reduction in the sales tax or the VAT, from 17.5% to 15%.&nbsp; It is a move which will last until the end of this year, 13 months in all, in order to stimulate growth by making goods and services cheaper.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister has said that the direct benefits to households this year exceed what they would have gained if the GST had been cut by 2% instead.&nbsp; But what if the recession gets worse?&nbsp; I join my colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, in asking if the Minister would consider bringing GST back to 5% for a year at least, or until Singapore bounces back from the recession.&nbsp; I know the Minister has said before, that higher-income Singaporeans who spend more would save more from a GST cut than lower income Singaporeans.&nbsp; That is in absolute dollars.&nbsp; But because lower-income <p align=left>Column: 1736<p>Singaporeans are not in a position to save as much and have to spend a higher proportion of their income, they pay more proportionately of their income to GST.&nbsp; A GST cut works in their favour too.&nbsp; Plus, the GST was raised at a time when the economy was booming and, judging from the sentiment on the ground and the fact that it is hardly common in Singapore for prices to come down, the psychological impact of reducing it for a period of time now could perhaps work better to boost the economy than GST Credits.&nbsp; Just look at what happens during the Great Singapore Sale.&nbsp; So if it is just a temporary measure, during an unprecedented recession,&nbsp; why not give it a go?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I suppose the question to ask is what approach is the Government taking with this Budget in response to this recession?&nbsp; Is this the approach that is better to go all out at the first of asking, as some economists would urge, and perhaps do more than what might eventually turn out to be necessary.&nbsp; Or is the approach that it will be wiser to spread out the measures with the risk that some of these may be less effective later.&nbsp; I ask this, because on the one hand, the Minister has said that the Resilience Package aims to save jobs to the maximum extend possible, and at the same time, the Government is keeping its savings built up during this term of office to "respond as the situation requires".&nbsp; The debate about whether we really need to dip into the reserves, I think, hinges on a better understanding of the Government's approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, I think there needs to be clarity in the Budget and whether it achieves its goals.&nbsp; The Government is providing unprecedented support from banks by sharing the risks of lending.&nbsp; But how will we know whether the banks are playing their part?&nbsp; How will we know whether they will make the $11 billion of loans estimates they will make this year?&nbsp; How will we know if the banks are <p align=left>Column: 1737<p>profiteering by setting interest rates that do not commensurate with the lower level of risks they will be assuming under the Government's Special Risk-Sharing Initiative?&nbsp; Will the Minister give us regular updates and assessments?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, if there is going to be a 40% property tax rebate for industrial and commercial properties, and landlords are being strongly urged to pass on the benefits to their tenants, can the Ministry for Finance update the public on the extent to which everyone did the "right thing"?&nbsp; Other measures the Government should take the initiative to report back on is the Public Transport Fund&nbsp;&ndash; whether the $10 million was sufficient this year and did it include transport for the disabled, as well as on how many people qualified for the Workfare Income Supplement Special Payment and how much was paid?&nbsp; In fact, why is the work eligibility criteria not also relaxed for the regular WIS programme, if we are expecting more disruptions to employment this year?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of all, however, I think this Budget needs to do more for the jobless.&nbsp; The Government has expended a lot of focus to save jobs but what happens when someone is retrenched?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One a long-term basis, the jobs retraining they get, the skills upgrading they go for is a good policy.&nbsp; What about the short term?&nbsp; Will the training allowance they get be enough, especially if they have a family to feed, mortgage to pay, old parents to look after and if the PCP takes more than a year?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there should be a moratorium on housing loan payments to the HDB for those who are retrenched longer than six months.&nbsp; Perhaps it could even kick in after the person has been retrenched for three months.&nbsp; Likewise, for those in public rental flats, they should be given the moratorium on rental payments.&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 1738<p>length of the deferment could be perhaps up to a year.&nbsp; Sir, I am aware the HDB is flexible in restructuring loans and arranging instalments for arrears and that can be done in the first few months after a job loss, but there is no reason not to provide Singaporeans with&nbsp;an extra layer of security from the fallout of&nbsp;a financial crisis.&nbsp; A&nbsp;financial crisis that they had no control over,&nbsp;&nbsp;and should their situation get worse if this global recession becomes long drawn.&nbsp; There could also be an additional month of S&amp;CC rebates for every six months of unemployment if the person has gone for training under SPUR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is good that we want to have a resilient Singapore. But what makes a resilient people? I have found myself wondering about that since the Budget announcement.&nbsp; Firstly, it helps if we are prepared for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago, as we were listening to the Minister about how we are likely to experience the deepest recession in the Singapore economy since our independence, I remembered how one year ago, Government leaders were saying that we will be able to weather the market turmoil and we would continue to do well economically that even though we could not be sheltered by the world economy if the US goes into a recession, we were in a good position to face the economic storm, that we are now not overly dependent on the US economy and the growth in Asia will keep us on track,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

We were told in the middle of last year that we were entering a golden period.&nbsp; It was no wonder that a 28-year-old told me recently that he was surprised how everything was great before the&nbsp;F1 race in September, or at least that was the impression he got.&nbsp; With recent reports about the growing credit debt of Singaporeans, I wonder if Singaporeans <p align=left>Column: 1739<p>were prepared for the downturn.&nbsp; Resilience comes from knowing what to expect and it is important for the Government to share as much as possible, as early on as possible, about what is in store.&nbsp; The Finance Minister said in his Budget speech that "we had known and had highlighted the downside risks of a US recession and a worsening global credit crunch" but did not anticipate the "speed and scale of the deterioration in the global economy".&nbsp; With all due respect, Sir, Singaporeans have been told they have a world-class Government.&nbsp; It is why they accept high market salaries for public servants.&nbsp; It is natural that they expect better from their leaders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singaporeans also expect consistency.&nbsp; In an recent interview with Bloomberg, the Finance Minister said we should not be less susceptible to global markets because that is our future, that is where our fortunes are tied to.&nbsp; And that the key is to learn how to come out leaner and smarter.&nbsp; This has certainly become apparent.&nbsp; This should have been communicated from the start and this is what builds resilience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, if there is one message that has been consistent from the Government, it is that we should not have a crutch mentality.&nbsp; Sir, at a time when Singapore is facing its deepest recession, in an economy whose fortunes depend so greatly on others, for a people who have always worked hard and sacrificed, I would say that this is not the time to bring this up again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we face the first truly global recession in the post-war period, what will build resilience in Singapore is a Government that inspires.&nbsp; This Budget, for example, has many good schemes.&nbsp; But is there an over-arching vision?&nbsp; What does it stand for?&nbsp; I have heard this Government stress that it wants to build <p align=left>Column: 1740<p>the best home for Singaporeans.&nbsp; The Minister said in his speech that the "best home for Singaporeans must be the best place to start families, to help them nurture their young and to look after their old".&nbsp; On the other hand, this Government has also stressed how it wants to be a global city.&nbsp; But we are not just a city.&nbsp; We are a country as well.&nbsp; What about those who cannot plug into the global city?&nbsp; There is no hinterland to embrace them.&nbsp; I read the <I>Straits Times</I> interview today with architect William Lim, who said, "Singapore is quite cosmopolitan, but that does not automatically make a city vibrant.&nbsp; Melbourne is not a global city, but Melbourne is very vibrant."&nbsp; Sir, who are we trying to be a global city for&nbsp;&ndash; is it for Singaporeans?&nbsp; Can we be a best home at the same time when a global city is going to be the subject of the vicissitudes of global ups and downs?&nbsp; The notion of "home" evokes security.&nbsp; There needs to be more assurance for those that need it, such as those who will be retrenched during Singapore's deepest recession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what does a best home mean?&nbsp; Singaporeans should all have their say and this is mine.&nbsp; A home where:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>H is for Hope, A home that gives its people hope for a better life no matter how bleak the situation may seem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>O is for a home that is One of a kind.&nbsp; We do it the <I>zai</I> (Hokkien word) Singapore way&nbsp;&ndash; honest and hardworking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>M is for Motivation.&nbsp; A home where Singaporeans feel motivated and inspired to achieve their dreams and aspirations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>E is for Equal&nbsp;&ndash; where every citizen will know that they have an equal shot in life regardless of background or ability and a home that will facilitate for this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Government has always rolled up its sleeves and got its hands dirty to get <p align=left>Column: 1741<p>the job done, so to speak.&nbsp; We have focused on the nuts and bolts, and we have built a sturdy house.&nbsp; Now it is time to build resilience inside the house.&nbsp; Now&nbsp;is a good time to work on making Singaporeans feel good about the home they live in.&nbsp; I remember how Singapore took the lead when the Boxing Day tsunami struck in 2004.&nbsp; I remember how we set off the spark that brought world leaders together in an unprecedented global commitment of aid.&nbsp; I remember how all levels of society made their mark, in their own small way, in the region.&nbsp; Then I look at the $30 increase for those on Public Assistance.&nbsp; Someone pointed out in the media that is $81,000 for 2,700 people out of&nbsp;the $20.5-billion Budget and he said, "Are we saying that we are a compassionate society?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are small, but we are more than the sum of parts.&nbsp; We need to feel that way more.&nbsp; We may be an improbable nation, but we are a nation nonetheless.&nbsp; And like every nation, we need to strengthen our identity, with each passing day, every single year, and indeed, after every Budget.&nbsp; I hope future Budgets can engender that goal.&nbsp; Sir, I say this for the sake of younger Singaporeans.&nbsp; I was nominated as an MP to represent the youth, and I have learnt that our youth are very diverse.&nbsp; They have many interests.&nbsp; But they are all looking for inspiration and identity, and I truly hope they find it in Singapore.&nbsp; I think they want to find it in Singapore.&nbsp; Trivial though it may seem, but I think the phenomenon that was "The Little Nonya", a show which remarkably cut across young and old, Chinese-Singaporean, Peranakan Singaporean or minority Singaporean, spoke of a harkening to a Singapore of yore, to a shared history despite our diversity, as if to say: This is what we were.&nbsp; This is us.&nbsp; And this is why there is so much angst when buildings such as the National Library are torn down.&nbsp; Because this is what we lose.&nbsp; So, when I look at the Budget, as I have for the past five years, I <p align=left>Column: 1742<p>have always asked what does this say about who we are, and what does this say about us?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, I support the Budget Statement announced by the Minister for Finance on 22nd January 2009.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long ago, many Singaporeans were worried about the rising costs of rice, fuel and other basic necessities.&nbsp; Today, our concerns have changed as we witness the collapse of big name financial institutions and manufacturing companies.&nbsp; All over the world, there are massive job losses and industrial output has fallen drastically.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MTI recently projected that the Singapore economy would shrink by between -2%&nbsp;and -5%.&nbsp; It was reported in the <I>Straits Times</I> that this would be the sharpest, deepest and longest recession in Singapore's history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in such times of uncertainty, it is imperative for businesses to cut costs in order to remain competitive and to survive.&nbsp; I, therefore, support the Government's initiative for the Jobs Credit Scheme which would help businesses cut their costs of labour or manpower.&nbsp; The proposal for the Government to bear 12% of the wage bill of businesses would go a long way&nbsp;in helping businesses cope with the recession.&nbsp; At the same time, it would assist them to keep their Singaporean workforce.&nbsp; Likewise, Sir, I support the 40% rebate in property tax as this will lower the costs of operating businesses in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the entire thrust of the Jobs Credit Scheme should be to help Singaporeans to remain employed and allow them to have recurrent income whilst contributing to economic growth.&nbsp; I prefer any attempt by the Government to help Singaporeans <p align=left>Column: 1743<p>remain employed rather than a simple cash handout to Singaporeans who are unemployed.&nbsp; A cash handout would help a family cope with the recession for a short while and thereafter, when the cash has been used up, they will be back in the same situation, ie, no job, no money.&nbsp; Helping Singaporeans remain employed would provide a longer term solution for any financial difficulties that Singaporeans may face.&nbsp; In addition, it will give Singaporeans a sense of dignity, a sense that they do not have to rely on handouts for their existence.&nbsp; The objective is for each adult Singaporean to have confidence that they are able to provide for themselves and their families.&nbsp; If you ask any of these workers, they will prefer to be gainfully employed rather than receiving handouts from the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I recognise that the Jobs Credit Scheme may not work for every business.&nbsp; It is not a magic bullet which will solve all the problems of a business that has no demand or sales.&nbsp; What the Government is trying to do is to reduce the operating costs for the business so that these businesses can have a fighting chance to continue its operations without having to retrench its staff.&nbsp; Sir, I cannot understand why would some Members of this House think that the Jobs Credit Scheme would not work.&nbsp; Just to take a simple example.&nbsp; Suppose a company has 100 workers and need to reduce its manpower costs by 20%.&nbsp; The HR Department has the option of retrenching 20 workers so as to meet the cost reduction.&nbsp; However, if the Government provides the company with a 12% reduction in manpower costs from Jobs Credit, then the company can reduce the number of workers that they have to retrench.&nbsp; Better still, they can take advantage of the SPUR Programme to send the other eight workers for training.&nbsp; In this way, the workforce in the company would appreciate the efforts to keep the workforce employed.&nbsp; It may be that the <p align=left>Column: 1744<p>20 workers who remain employed may be a small statistic, but for these workers who can keep their jobs, they will heave a sigh of relief, so would their spouses and their children who are their dependants.&nbsp; And the rest of the workers in the company will remember that their employer is benevolent at heart.&nbsp; They will not be thinking of leaving the company when the economy recovers because they know that their employer cares for them.&nbsp; If the company HR chooses to retrench the workers without any effort or attempt to retain these workers, I am sure the rest of the employees who are working for the company will remember the lack of compassion shown by their employers during this time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the end of the day, Sir, whatever the Government does, there will still be businesses which, for whatever reasons, would have to retrench their workers despite the Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp; For those Singaporeans who may be retrenched and cannot find similar paying jobs for a while, I urge the Government to consider doing more to help them find jobs.&nbsp; We need dedicated counsellors to encourage them, to urge them to persevere in their job search.&nbsp; They may also need help to learn how to adjust their lifestyles and to cut their expenses not just for themselves but also for their families.&nbsp; A counsellor could also teach them to moderate their expectations to be prepared to accept a lower paying job with a lower title.&nbsp; For those who have no savings to rely on, we should find some way to assist them to cope with the loss of income until they find another job.&nbsp; Sir, the Government should not wait until these people are flat broke before we extend our help to them.&nbsp; They should be allowed to preserve their sense of dignity and not&nbsp;have to beg for financial help.&nbsp; A dedicated counsellor would be able to recommend such persons for help if these retrenched workers have tried their utmost best to find jobs but remained unsuccessful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1745<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the longer term, it is important for the Government to consider how to have a more equal distribution of income.&nbsp; The current system in USA and other parts of the world where the rich and powerful are highly rewarded has led to greediness and a bankrupt system.&nbsp; We need to ensure that Singapore never go down that path of greediness and deceit which is not sustainable.&nbsp; Singaporeans who are less educated or working in less economically important areas should be paid in a fair manner such that they will always have financial incentives to remain employed.&nbsp; Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is a step in the right direction and I think more can be done to re-distribute the wealth within the system using WIS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am glad to see the Government responding decisively to tackle this unprecedented recession.&nbsp; There are some Singaporeans who questioned whether we should be going into our reserves at this moment.&nbsp; In my mind, there is no doubt that we would only dig into the reserves because we have reason to believe that there is a need to do so.&nbsp; In the light of the worldwide recession, there is an urgent need to do so now.&nbsp; I would support the Government's move to ask the President for approval to use $4.5 billion from the reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jobs Credit Scheme is not the only fiscal measure where the Government is helping Singaporeans cope with the downturn.&nbsp; I applaud the Government for the other schemes like the additional GST Credits, the S&amp;CC rebates, the income tax rebate, the property tax rebate and the increase in the additional CPF housing grant.&nbsp; I would, however, ask whether it is possible for the Government to consider being a bit more generous in the Public Assistance rate for those Singaporeans on Public Assistance.&nbsp; Sir, I subscribe to the many helping hands approach but my concern is that during a recession, the number of helping hands <p align=left>Column: 1746<p>would decrease as each helping hand would seek to take care of their own financial needs first.&nbsp; In such instance, the rate for citizens on Public Assistance would clearly be inadequate.&nbsp; Would the Government consider an increase to $400 for single person household and corresponding increase for families on Public Assistance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are a few other questions on the Budget which I would like the Minister for Finance to clarify.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has said that it has obtained the "in principle" approval from the President for permission to use $4.5 billion from the reserves to fund the Jobs Credit and SRI for bank lending.&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify the process by which the President grants his "in principle" approval?&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for Singaporeans to understand how does the second key to the reserves work since this is the first time that we have asked the President to actually allow the Government to use the reserves.&nbsp; How is the President advised on this matter?&nbsp; Is he acting on the advice of Cabinet or does he have independent advice?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, for the Financial Year 2009, the Government has estimated the corporate income tax collections at $8.2 billion and personal income tax collections at $6.1 billion.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister how robust is the Government's estimates of its revenue stream?&nbsp; I am concerned, Sir, because for FY 2007, the Government had estimated a budget deficit of $0.6 billion and we ended up with a surplus of $6.4 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;And last year for FY 2008, the Government had estimated Vehicle Quota Premiums at $0.89 billion whereas the revised estimates are now $0.38 billion, a difference of 57.4%.&nbsp; Likewise, the estimated revenue from stamp duty is off target by 39.6%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the current economic climate where the worldwide recession is unpre-<p align=left>Column: 1747<p>cedented, what are the probabilities that our revenue estimates may be grossly off-target and we would have to dig deeper into our reserves to fund the Government expenditure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Government then consider scaling down on its development expenses if the projected revenue stream of $33.43 billion is not to expectation?</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, despite the 4.9 billion available in Jobs Credit Scheme, there is still massive retrenchment. Does the Government have a Plan B or contingency plan to deal with such massive unemployment? Sir, the Jobs Credit Scheme is quite blunt too. Many of my colleagues in Parliament have spoken about this, that all active employers are eligible for the payment regardless of whether the business is in such need of financial aid. Thus, even employers who are doing very well in their businesses will still receive the Jobs Credit of 12% grant. How will the Government ensure that this sum of money, which is essentially taxpayers' money, will not be used to reward the personal coffers of the employers? Will the top management use this money to go for spa retreat, just like the senior management of AIG who spent US$440,000 in California? &nbsp;Does the Government intend to impose any restrictions on the use of the money from this Jobs Credit Scheme?&nbsp; Sir, I believe the answers to these queries will help Singaporeans understand the rationale for the Budget better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this Sir, I support the Resilience Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</B> Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to join in this debate. This year's Budget Statement is a fair one. Both business people as well as our workers benefit from this Budget. In past years, when the economy was bad, the nature of the Government was to <p align=left>Column: 1748<p>cut costs. When the CPF contribution rates were cut, and there were widespread layoffs. This time round, no such thing happened. Instead the Government's priority were to preserve jobs and building for the future. The Budget speech sounded like the first manifesto of the PAP in 1954, whereby it stated that the wages shall not be cut as a solution to the recession of the day.<p>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Ms Indranee Rajah) in the Chair]</b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="left">&nbsp;</p><p>4.32 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would urge the Government to encourage companies to train their workers to be more productive and competitive. Now that their CPF rate are not cut.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the WIS programme, incentive programme given to low-paid workers is a reasonable one, provided that the workers are in good health. I wish the Minister would amend this programme to reflect that should the worker fall sick, some financial assistance be given to him until he gets well and recover to be able to work again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support Mr Inderjit Singh's call for foreign workers to be reduced. In times of economic slowdown, jobs are difficult to come by. The interests of local workers must come first. The Government must be seen to protect the&nbsp;interests of the local workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as I sat in my seat yesterday, I was amazed by the way&nbsp;many MPs spoke with conviction and passion. Ms Irene Ng, especially sounded very Churchillian. We will all remember that in 1939, Churchill gave a rousing speech. He said that, "We will fight against the Germans. We will fight in the beaches. We will fight in the fields. We will fight in the wills. We will fight in the villages. We shall never surrender."&nbsp; Sir, Singapore is like that. We <p align=left>Column: 1749<p>will never give in to the onslaught of the recession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will we come through? &nbsp;I think so. &nbsp;Singapore will survive. But will we become stronger? I have my doubts. Because the&nbsp;programmes contains in the Budget are welfare in nature. Some people prefer to have a recession, so that they can get more welfare, free money from somewhere. This time round, the Government even take out from the vaults, the surpluses, to pay, to keep jobs. Sir, I wonder if this could have negative effects. Since money is given to firms and workers, let us all see that this recession prolongs, we can get free money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think one thing is necessary and that is to train workers to be productive and competitive.&nbsp; I think, if we have that spirit, maybe this will be all right, despite the free money that is given out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the scheme for direct&nbsp;assistance to households, help should be given for transport with regard to education, to help middle-income group. There is a sharp difference of fares that are paid by junior&nbsp;college students and Polytechnic students. Students&nbsp;purchase the same concession passes which have the symptoms of use. I urge the Government to overlook and to establish a fairer system of&nbsp; charging concession passes for all students by adjusting the prices for&nbsp;concession passes for Polytechnic students and we will be able to relieve the heavy financial burden of families, of all middle-income with at least one child in Polytechnic. Relieving costs at a time of&nbsp;belt-tightening in expenditure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my last point is the distribution of $4.5 billion, which is a lot of money. It must be completely transparent in its distribution. Is the Government going to form a corporate body to supervise the pay out of this large sum of money to the party's concerned and&nbsp;look&nbsp;into the worst-<p align=left>Column: 1750<p>case scenarios who are in dire need of help? The system must never be abused.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Madam.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Heng Chee How)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Heng Chee How):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker.&nbsp;Thank you for allowing me to join this debate. This year's Government Budget is indeed a&nbsp;very big and expansionary one,&nbsp;12% over FY2008.&nbsp; It is also earlier than normal and proposes to use the National Reserves for the first time. What does this show us? It shows us how seriously this Government is taking the situation. But more that, it shows&nbsp;this Government cares, cares so much that it would do something that it has always resisted, that is to draw on the reserves in order to help the people in ways that are real, in ways that are practical, helping people to relieve their anxiety, relieve the pain. But most of all, giving people the ability to continue to fish, rather than just to rely on fish given. I think it is important that we always remember this.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Budget is also about leadership. It is about leadership that does not quit, that does not run away in the face of difficulty. It is about leadership that looks the challenge in the eye and will lead this people forward into safety, not a leadership that will only speak with insight, based on hindsight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam See Tong earlier referred to Churchill, who said, never, never surrender. I think in another speech Churchill also said, never, never quit and I think that is the spirit by which we should all tackle this recession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, clearly this Budget is a response to a very bad global situation, with the evaporation of wealth and demand, and a sharp drop in our performance indicators, in tourist arrivals, and so on. One headline on 22nd January summarised the world situation as 'job cuts everywhere' and it was <p align=left>Column: 1751<p>describing a situation of 82,000 jobs slashed by major companies in the world in a single day. Singapore, we make our living through exports and by providing services that facilitate and add value to the flow of commerce and wealth. When these go into difficulties or stall, then we are in serious difficulties, which we are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the papers, our tourists arrivals have fallen again. The Purchasing Manager's Index is still below 50 and just now, I received an SMS update that Panasonic Japan has just decided to slash another 15,000 jobs worldwide and close 27 companies or factories around the world. This is the kind of situation that we are facing. So, if you ask me, is this the right time to draw on our reserves, one small part of it and use it in a very purposeful way to lead this country forward, I say yes. Of course, we must make sure that it will be money well-spent. Of course, we must make sure that when the economy recovers, we build it back as soon as possible. And I also support the call to explain the process of approval more clearly, in more detail to our people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, for society as a whole,&nbsp;the biggest threat to us all, to Singapore is a fast-growing pool of the unemployed. So saving jobs is paramount. There is consensus in this House, in the whole country about this. As the Chinese saying goes,&nbsp; "&#30041;&#24471;&#38738;&#23665;&#22312;&#65292;&#19981;&#24597;&#27809;&#26612;&#28903;".&nbsp; To do that, we have to keep companies afloat because they are the receptacles for jobs.&nbsp;They are threatened by loss of demand, by cashflow and credit woes, and by a total lack of visibility as to when the upturn will come. For these companies to hold on longer and for the workers in them to hold on to their jobs longer, then the companies need to reduce cost fast and significantly.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the Jobs Credit and Special Risk-Sharing Schemes are targeted that <p align=left>Column: 1752<p>way.&nbsp;The SPUR Programme on its part, increases companies' short-term cashflow if they have excess workers and also improves&nbsp;the companies'&nbsp;competitiveness through upskilling.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And PMETs, in particular, get extra $150 million allocation that will&nbsp;bring SPUR funding to $750 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the ground feedback about the Jobs Credit has been very good.&nbsp; I have discussed with the management of companies and associations in the following industries:&nbsp; construction, waste management, hotels and food manufacturing.&nbsp; They have confirmed that the Jobs Credit Scheme and the Jobs Credits will be most helpful in lightening their payroll pressure and that this will&nbsp;improve job security in their sectors.&nbsp; For companies that perform better, they say that their workers will certainly receive a fair share of the rewards.&nbsp; If they have KPIs, then&nbsp;through KPI gain-sharing or if not, then through negotiations by the unions. Workers and the labour movement are certainly glad and grateful to the&nbsp;Government for having chosen&nbsp;the Jobs Credit instead of a nine-point CPF cut to reduce&nbsp;cost for companies and to save jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recognising that it is total cost and not only wage costs that companies struggle with at this point, the&nbsp;Government, through&nbsp;HDB, JTC and SLA, are also going to cut&nbsp; by 15% while&nbsp;freezing all fees&nbsp;for the year.&nbsp; Property tax rebates will also help companies if the landlords pass them on to tenants.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Energy cost is another big cost item for certain industries, and the feedback I get is that companies that they would greatly appreciate additional help in this area.&nbsp; If the rates are internationally determined and cannot be varied, then they hope some improvement to the current quarterly formula can also be found to improve the ability to budget in a more stable way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1753<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dollar saved anywhere is a dollar saved.&nbsp; We must monitor that very closely to see if these savings are getting to the targets and whether they are achieving the intended impact and to make the necessary adjustments to ensure they do.&nbsp; We must avoid a situation where money stood by for a purpose remains relatively untapped while the damage occurs on the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, for these measures to be effective, the challenge is swift implementation, so that the water gets to the crops.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear feedback that if there is no visibility of an upturn by mid-year, then shareholders of many SMEs may opt to preserve their capital and cut losses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hear talk that acquisition of vulnerable companies by stronger ones may rise significantly in the second half of the year, and if that should happen, triggering more consolidation and rationalisation of manpower.&nbsp;What this all means is that we must move fast to relieve pressure from companies so as to delay and minimise job cuts.&nbsp; Even though&nbsp;this is the Year of the Ox, we must not wait "till the cows come home".<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The labour movement understands the urgency of the situation.&nbsp; This is why we not only support these measures wholeheartedly, but we are going&nbsp;all out, pulling out all stops within our means and influence to get it flowing as quickly as possible.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;e2i, in driving SPUR,&nbsp;already has&nbsp;54 unionised companies who together have committed 7,200 workers to retraining under the&nbsp;SPUR Programme, with another 44&nbsp;companies in the pipeline. The e2i's&nbsp;job gallery has now 11,000 jobs, up from 5,500 a month ago. If you say that how come the jobs have grown, it is to reflect the kind of effort <p align=left>Column: 1754<p>that is being put in to source for those jobs that are already in the economy, and put them together so as to offer practical help to the displaced workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly have to&nbsp;step up our efforts to help displaced workers retrain and to be emplaced into new jobs, so as to forestall structural unemployment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier, you heard the Member, Ms Cham Hui Fong's&nbsp;data on shorter work-weeks and retrenchment within the unionised sector.&nbsp; Madam, our unions are working very closely with companies using the Tripartite Guidelines on Managing Excess Manpower as well as the latest NWC wage guidelines to make sure that as many unionised companies as possible stay afloat and the jobs of their workers preserved and prolonged.</p><p><br> <I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every sector can and must do something useful.&nbsp; We hear examples from many sectors under stress, for example, electronics.&nbsp; But even&nbsp;sectors that are not under direct stress,&nbsp;the construction sector, which most of us will agree is so far deemed to be one of the least impacted, is also taking action.&nbsp; I have met with the Singapore Contractors Association (SCAL), and the&nbsp;council of that organisation&nbsp;have agreed to work closely with the construction union&nbsp;in order to aggregate and pass&nbsp;information of jobs at&nbsp;all levels from their member companies through the union to e2i, to work with&nbsp;the e2i to help construction companies take advantage of skilled manpower within the sector that becomes available as one company completes a contract while another is about to begin one, and to help the truly excess local manpower retrain for placement into other sectors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SCAL also sees the current situation as an opportunity to further upgrade the skills and image of the sector.&nbsp; Hence, it will be encouraging its member companies to tap SPUR and also to work with WDA <p align=left>Column: 1755<p>to consider accrediting its training institute's&nbsp; industry-recognised courses under SPUR.&nbsp; Together with Tripartite partners,&nbsp;we will do out utmost to help upturn the downturn&nbsp;&ndash; in spirit and in practical action.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;a key point raised in the debate yesterday and today is that measures like Jobs Credit, SPUR and SRSS are supply side measures.&nbsp; They are enablers and they&nbsp;help companies last longer and to be more competitive.&nbsp; When these measures are complemented with demand, then the&nbsp;effectiveness is maximised.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is a small, open economy. The bad news is that we cannot escape being hit. Furthermore, our openness means that an expansionary budget has a larger leakage factor than less open economies.&nbsp; Our small domestic market also means stimulating consumption would not&nbsp;give the same bang for buck as in some other places.&nbsp; That said, the better news is that our smallness means that the demand we need to bounce back is not as big as that needed by huge economies.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am heartened by the measures in this Budget to reinforce Singapore's attraction as a business hub in all aspect, ie,&nbsp;to allow us to&nbsp;attract demand. But I am not very clear, listening to the Budget, what proactive measures the Government agencies will be undertaking directly, or indirectly with chambers of commerce, industry bodies and so on,&nbsp;to go out and seek out demand.&nbsp; I hope that there could be reassurance on this, and elaboration on the details of these aspects in the COS of the relevant Ministries.&nbsp; We need active measures and not just passive ones that depend on the outside world to respond to our Budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With global demand dropping off a cliff, every country is impacted.&nbsp; Every <p align=left>Column: 1756<p>country is hungry for investments, for exports and every country will do everything to get them.&nbsp; In this process, we must also expect that more countries may turn protectionist in an attempt to help their own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Singapore will not go the protectionist way, our ability to source for a sacred cow and defend demand is an essential part of tiding through this difficult period.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;when banks&nbsp;consider loan applications from businesses, they will&nbsp;look at demand for those goods and services in assessing the risks.&nbsp; We must examine what we can do to maximise our effectiveness in securing demand.&nbsp; We must examine&nbsp;the roles of the agencies, the chambers and&nbsp;the companies.&nbsp;How can we best coordinate and energise these efforts, and leave as little to luck as possible?&nbsp; How can we exemplify our&nbsp;vaunted Singapore Inc. approach in this time of real need?&nbsp; For example, I understand that within the MICE sector, the conventions part continue to present opportunities that Singapore can tap on, leveraging on our advantages of safety, service quality, connectivity and even favourable weather. What it means is that we&nbsp;must not sit tight&nbsp;&ndash; there is still business and demand and we have to go out of there&nbsp;to grab it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the sharp drop in global aggregate demand has caused inflation to moderate.&nbsp; The good news is that the projected inflation rate for 2009 is somewhere between flat to being slightly negative.&nbsp; Transport companies are bringing down fares and&nbsp;housing prices and rentals have moderated.&nbsp; Despite this, we must not let down our guard, because retrenchments and unemployment will rise and pay fall in this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has stepped up help in this Budget&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;more GST Credits, higher Workfare payouts and&nbsp;various rebates.&nbsp; These will directly help households, particularly the lower income households,<p align=left>Column: 1757<p> cope better with the cost of living. The labour movement has also announced our plans to step up our assistance to members.&nbsp; But at the same time, and I agree with several Members who spoke before me, households and individuals must also do&nbsp;their part.&nbsp; In a previous speech before this House, I spoke of the advantages of simple living.&nbsp; We must be prepared to adjust our expenditure patterns and live within our means.&nbsp;I am not saying that those who can afford to spend should also not&nbsp;stop spending.&nbsp; But I am&nbsp;also very concerned, just as the&nbsp;Member, Mr Zainudin Nordin, that there would be many who would continue to spend beyond their means and get into serious difficulties. That we must watch out.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the concluding paragraph of many recent speeches, mine included, tended to say that after we get through this storm, we will be stronger for it.&nbsp; It is important to not just make these statements our hope and aim, but to also carefully consider how we can make it happen.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many things are uncertain at present. Yet, there are also truths and trends that are certain to outlast this crisis, and we must not blindsided by surprises or complacency on those known fronts.&nbsp;And here, I would like to highlight four areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly,&nbsp;the ageing of population is recession-proof.&nbsp; Thus, all the preparation for that reality&nbsp;&ndash; making working longer desirable and possible even in these times, healthy and active ageing, retirement funding, housing for the elderly, disability care, and so on. It is important to continue to prod along these areas and not to&nbsp;slow down just because there is a&nbsp;recession.&nbsp; Yes, we must expect that it will be harder to get attention for these subjects in an economic crisis, but if we lose our focus,&nbsp;we will pay that price and suffer the consequences not <p align=left>Column: 1758<p>very far in&nbsp;the future.&nbsp;We must not lose focus.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp;productivity improvement makes for better living standards.&nbsp; Again, this will also not change.&nbsp; There have been instances, for example, the&nbsp;dotcom boom, and the financial wizardry and mesmerising marketing more recently which led many to forget, with painful consequences, that at the end of the day, it is fundamentals that&nbsp;count.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NWC has noted in its more recent sittings that productivity has not risen as fast as it should.&nbsp; While this was rightly explained by a very strong employment growth during the boom, it still begs the important question of how businesses increase the value and productivity of their operations.&nbsp; This is more critical than just using productivity figures as an indicator for wage bargaining.&nbsp; Without productivity gains, our exports will not be internationally competitive.&nbsp; For social cohesion reasons, we do not want to achieve high productivity by&nbsp;lowering employment.&nbsp; We also do not want to see a slide in overall living standards through a growing pool of low-value, low-pay jobs.&nbsp; So if we do not want those things, then how do you get your productivity up?&nbsp; It is job value creation.&nbsp;And the Budget has specific items aimed at encouraging innovation.&nbsp; This is good.&nbsp; The challenge is not&nbsp;just to leave it to the companies to respond or just aim for a few peaks.&nbsp; I think we must systematically enrol companies of all sizes and in all industries into a mindset and a practice of productivity improvement.&nbsp; If we succeed, the outcome for the economy and our job market will be amazing.&nbsp; I am therefore most encouraged that the Government is re-energising the GEMS programme with a $100 million injection.&nbsp; This is an example for many other industries.<br>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, at last year's Budget debate, I called attention to the importance of getting our community organisations <p align=left>Column: 1759<p>ready for a more complex landscape brought about by a more diverse population profile.&nbsp; At work and in the community,&nbsp;as Singapore gets more cosmopolitan, these interfaces get more sensitive.&nbsp; For example, Singaporeans always thought that the foreigners who work here&nbsp;as talent or as&nbsp;buffer or as supplementary manpower&nbsp;&ndash; to do things locals cannot do, would not do or not have enough people to do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent cases of abandoned workers or large numbers of workers left stranded without work and pay for months&nbsp;&ndash; opens up many questions in the minds of locals. Why are these people still here for months when there is no work for them?&nbsp; Fairness for these workers is one key question.&nbsp; Then, related questions of how they would be making ends meet,&nbsp;if they are allowed to find work, staying here longer than they should, then they would be competing with locals beyond what the system was designed to do.&nbsp; I understand such comparisons are also&nbsp;taking place now not only among lower skills workers, but increasingly across the ranks, including&nbsp;PMETs who see themselves competing with those&nbsp;on&nbsp;"S" passes and on Employment passes.&nbsp; We have to make sure that we tackle these issues correctly, focusing on building in our local workforce competitive skill sets, strong confidence and adaptability, rather than to shield ourselves away from competition.&nbsp; At the same time, we must focus our efforts and machinery to help retrenched Singaporeans at all levels&nbsp;regain work as quickly as possible.</p></span></div>     <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

For Singapore to be competitive in the future, a key ingredient is to make it an attractive cosmopolitan city.&nbsp; How we manage our social development during this serious <p align=left>Column: 1760<p>recession will affect Singapore&rsquo;s standing as a global city.&nbsp; To do this well, the interaction between locals and foreigners at work, live and play levels must be systematically promoted and nurtured.&nbsp; Handle this well, and Singapore will come out ahead in a very strategic way.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth area is that a&nbsp;violent and sick world&nbsp;demands constant vigilance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism, dengue and a bird flu attack are three concrete, possible scenarios that we have to continue to confront, recession or not.&nbsp; The latest news coming out of Malaysia on dengue and from China about bird flu tell us how close and serious these threats are.&nbsp; Given the very serious economic difficulties we have to tackle, we certainly do not want to be wrong-footed in these areas.&nbsp; So I am disagreeing with Members who said that we can go slow or go easy on our defence.&nbsp; To guard against Murphy&rsquo;s Law, we must not neglect these areas during the downturn.&nbsp; Natural and man made plagues can sneak up upon us without warning and devastate our economy and our lives.&nbsp; As we deal with the economic storm, let us "watch our backs" for these threats and make sure we do not compromise on security.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, although Singapore did not cause this global recession, we cannot escape its impact.&nbsp; That being the case, the most practical thing to do is to stay focused, keep our chins up and work together to overcome the crisis with fortitude and determination.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we are only a little dot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the crisis is a gigantic one.&nbsp; But let us not be paralysed with fear and haplessness.&nbsp; Just as David was able to take down Goliath with faith, confidence, strategy and skill, Singapore can do likewise to ride out this storm and bounce back.&nbsp; In terms of our resources, programmes and response mechanisms, we certainly have much more than a slingshot to work with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1761<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>5.03 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, my colleagues have spoken on the big picture and the pragmatic nature of this year's Budget.&nbsp; So I would like to take a more philosophical approach and focus on the small portions of Singaporeans, the very poor among us whom we usually think we are helping by offering them food, water and roof over their heads.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will start, first, with a story about Zen Buddhism since I&nbsp;am talking about philosophy.&nbsp; The story is about an apprentice monk who has been learning and practising Zen Buddhism from a Zen master for some years.&nbsp; One day, the apprentice monk told the master that he had learnt enough and would like to leave the monastery to see the world.&nbsp; Upon hearing this, the master took out a glass bowl and put a lot of stones into the bowl until the bowl was filled with stones and could take no more.&nbsp; The master asked his apprentice, "Is this enough?"&nbsp; The apprentice answered, "It's enough."&nbsp; The master then poured some fine sand into the holes between the stones and filled the gaps.&nbsp; The bowl was filled to the brim and could take no more.&nbsp; Then the master asked again, "Is this enough?"&nbsp; The apprentice answered, "It's enough, Sir."&nbsp; The master than added some ashes into the bowl.&nbsp; The powder slipped in among the sand until the bowl was full and could take no more.&nbsp; The master then asked again, "Is this enough?"&nbsp; The student by this time could nearly take no more too.&nbsp; He gritted his teeth and answered, "It's enough, Sir."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the true spirit of Zen, the master poured a few glasses of water into the bowl.&nbsp; So it was full and could take no <p align=left>Column: 1762<p>more.&nbsp; The master asked again, "Is this enough?"&nbsp; The apprentice was stumped and could not answer.&nbsp; I think he must have given up the idea of leaving the monastery by now.&nbsp; Putting down the bowl, the Zen master told his apprentice, "There is always something that we can do if we wish to do something more."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the Government has done a superb job with this Resilience Package to help Singaporeans save jobs.&nbsp; The Government is filling the bowl with the stones through this Budget.&nbsp; However, there remains something more that Singaporeans can do, ie, to add the sand, the ashes and the water, whichever is available within our reach and means.&nbsp; To fill the bowl completely, the Government has started with the stones as the basic foundation.&nbsp; And the community, the corporate and the individuals can each add in the sand, the ashes and the water to fill up the Singapore bowl at every level.&nbsp; Only the collective effort of the public, private and the people sectors can ensure that the Singapore bowl is fully filled.&nbsp; Only then will we be able to say that it is enough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that when we talk about the resilience of&nbsp;our society, it just cannot be the Government's sole responsibility to build resilience into the Singapore society.&nbsp; All of us should respond to this call of resilience to clearly strengthen our resolve to swim against the current economic tsunami.&nbsp; There is a Chinese proverb that says everyone has a responsibility towards the rise and fall of the country&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<I>gua chia sin wang, pi chi u che.</I>&nbsp; To me, this Budget is just not about the Government's responsibility and duty.&nbsp; It is just not about who gets what.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a good idea to dig into the reserves.&nbsp; Of course, these are very important issues.&nbsp; But, more importantly, the Budget is about the people.&nbsp; It is whether Singaporeans can close rank, put aside partisan interests and work together to <p align=left>Column: 1763<p>add the stones, the sand, the ashes and the water to fill up the Singapore&nbsp;bowl.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, to me, there are four elements to build resilience.&nbsp; I will start with the first element, ie, the stones.&nbsp; I thank the Government for helping Singaporeans save jobs, particularly for increasing the allowance for the people on Public Assistance.&nbsp; This is like having a few more stones in the PA recipient's bowl.&nbsp; But is this enough?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two months ago, I conducted a survey among the residents who are PA recipients in my ward.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are close to about 120 of them.&nbsp; We spoke to more than 100.&nbsp; I will say more about this in my cut on MCYS, but please allow me to make a general point here.&nbsp; Madam, I believe it is&nbsp;our responsibility and duty not just to provide them with the basic necessities but also to give them a reasonable quality of life if we are trying to advance to a gracious society.&nbsp; It is often said that for doctors who take care of a terminally ill patient, life is not measured just in years but in the quality of those years.&nbsp; The same can be said about looking after our old folks on the Public Assistance Scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that it goes against what the Government has been advocating for many years.&nbsp; I would like the Government to consider helping more the people on Public Assistance just beyond feeding the mouth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, from the survey, we can see that the recipients use up all the money, even the small <I>ang pows</I> they receive occasionally from temples and VWOs.&nbsp; I will say more about the average spending for each category of their expenditure in my cut in the Committee of Supply.&nbsp; This is the only cut that I have submitted this year because I feel that I ought to concentrate my energies on getting one small thing done for the group who needs it most.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1764<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to ask more money for the very poor because as I speak to these people on Public Assistance, I can smell their fear from their breath.&nbsp; They are afraid that the kindness of donors from temples and VWOs may dry up in the coming months, especially in a major economic crisis like now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I have two other points to make on this issue.&nbsp; First, can the Government assure us that the PA allowances are reviewed in a systematic and on regular basis.&nbsp; Second, from the survey, we can see that&nbsp;food is the main item of expenditure.&nbsp; I agree with the view that the general inflation rate may not be a proxy to work out the PA allowance quantum.&nbsp; But can we at least have a composite food index taking into consideration the PA allowance so that we are sensitive to the most basic needs of the very poor?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second element is about the sand which symbolises our community.&nbsp; I would like to say a little about the people who conducted the survey with me.&nbsp; The survey actually was the idea of a 21-year-old young man who is now serving his National Service.&nbsp; This young man, Mr David Ang, is a son of two medical doctors and he is no stranger to the good life.&nbsp; He could have spent his time in country clubs, holidaying away or playing computer games with his friends.&nbsp; Yet, he wants to know how he can help the poor.&nbsp; He wants to know more about the most needy and the vulnerable people in our society.&nbsp; And he asked me very pointedly&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;do I think that $330 is enough for them?&nbsp; I said, "Let's ask the PA recipients themselves because they know best."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they decided to devise a survey and round up some friends to help out.&nbsp; I also rounded up some grassroots leaders and RC members.&nbsp; And over&nbsp;the course of a few weeks, we spoke to almost all the people on Public Assistance in my ward.&nbsp; In many wards across the island, this kind <p align=left>Column: 1765<p>of social initiative is also taking place.&nbsp; And one of the main drivers of this in getting young people from different social classes to mix together and to see how the poor and the needy among us live is the CIP or Community Involvement Programme in schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I applaud this CIP programme.&nbsp; David has shown me the success stories in exposing our young people to different circumstances in the society.&nbsp; We need more people like David and we need the community organisations to also open the doors and to welcome young people who want to make a difference.&nbsp; So the community is just like the sand which fills up any holes that the Government may have left out.&nbsp; Like David Ang, if you have questions that you cannot get answers to, and if you want to improve things and no one else is doing, pick up the shovel and do it yourself.&nbsp; Whether you are young or old, you will find that once you make a start in helping others, you will find enough sand in yourself to carry on to fill up the bowl.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I would like to come to the third element, the ash which symbolises&nbsp;a family.&nbsp; Madam, I would like to continue to speak about the family and the care for the elderly.&nbsp; I have spoken&nbsp;on this issue before in this House, sounding a cautionary note and asking the Government to be aware of the political pressures.&nbsp; But this year, I would like to take a policy approach.&nbsp; I would like to ask what kind of strategies and new ideas to ensure that the retirement savings, the healthcare cost and the weakening family ties are taken care of.&nbsp; Is there a family-centric approach to help families take care of their aged and to help them to age in the right place?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember that ageing issues were at one point top of the policy agenda, and now they appear to have taken a back seat in the current situation.&nbsp; I admit that it is difficult to put our attention on social <p align=left>Column: 1766<p>matters when financial hardship and economic crisis are staring us in our faces.&nbsp; But family is an important building block of the society, and we need to strengthen the family resilience so that the family can, in return, strengthen the societal resilience.&nbsp; The current economic crisis will severely test the family's unity and resilience, especially when the breadwinners lost their jobs and the children are asking for the fees to be paid and so on.&nbsp; So I hope that the Government could also pay more attention on maintaining family resilience while it implements the Resilience Package.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the family is the fine ash that fills up the little holes that the community may need, and there is another fine crack line.&nbsp; There are some elderly people living alone who do not have a family.&nbsp; And as they get older, this is a secret worry which they do not voice out openly, ie, who will take care of their funeral when they go?&nbsp; Many of them believe that they need paper houses and some paper money to be burnt when they die.&nbsp; So that when they go to the other world, they would have some standing and not wonder about homeless and poor.&nbsp; Now, for the poor elderly who do not have savings and no family, many times, they would just be buried with a minimum of fuss and for a fee of about $1,500 or less as&nbsp;I was told by a funeral undertaker.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the bare minimum with no rites,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

Madam, what can&nbsp;we do to give these elderly peace of mind?&nbsp; There is no glory in it.&nbsp; It would&nbsp;be very difficult indeed to raise money for paper houses and hell money to be burnt, but can we give these old people&nbsp;peace of mind?&nbsp; I do not think the Government is best placed to do this.&nbsp; But can the people in the community,<p align=left>Column: 1767<p> who are as close as family, set aside some money to give them a good send-off?&nbsp; A decent&nbsp;funeral under these lights will cost about $3,000, as told by the same funeral&nbsp;director.&nbsp; I know this is a cry in the wilderness but perhaps some kind social leaders and philanthropists will hear this cry and set up a fund for this little-known but very essential service to a small group of old people.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;I would&nbsp;like to now come to the last element that is water.&nbsp; Madam, are all the pieces in place when the Government, the community and the family work together?&nbsp; Can we make a real difference?&nbsp; I believe we can but&nbsp;only if the man we are trying to help wants to help himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;When all is said and done, what remains but the spirit of a man?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have visited&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong in hospital a few times.&nbsp; He is an incredible man with burns on his face but fire in his heart.&nbsp; When I visited him, he stood up to speak with me, and told me that when he was brought to the hospital into the ward, he was not fully conscious but he knew that his spirit must be strong if he was to pull through.&nbsp; "Keep strong, keep positive," he told me, grimacing as he tried to turn his head to make sure that the new skin grew out to be supple.&nbsp; And he told me, "Doctors say if I do not do this, the skin will turn hard.&nbsp; So I better do it!".&nbsp; He said this and then he grinned from ear to ear.&nbsp; I could see his eyes through the lens of his new pair of glasses&nbsp;&ndash; they were shining with mischief and a sense of adventure.&nbsp; For a man who was brought to the hospital with severe burns on his head, body and hands,&nbsp; even a turn of the head is a new revelation and a true adventure.&nbsp; And he is still very upbeat and positive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, that was a long preamble to an important point that I want to make <p align=left>Column: 1768<p>passionately.&nbsp; All the efforts that we have made will come to nothing if the men for which we work is not strong in spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the workers who have lost their jobs, for the parents who are struggling with their children's educational expenses,&nbsp;for the businessman who has just lost a key contract, for the engineer or professional&nbsp;who just had his pay cut&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;we must try to be upbeat like Han Thong.&nbsp; Otherwise, we will be self-defeated, and no amount of Resilience Package can save us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, there are many criticisms that we can make about the implementation of the policies.&nbsp; One grassroots leader asked me&nbsp;why does the Government give Job Credits to employers?&nbsp; Why not give the money to us, the employees?&nbsp; In fact, there is an argument of "strategic mistake" made by a former Permanent Secretary who is a well-respected commentator on policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we give the money to workers or to employers, to me, is a matter of policy implementation choice&nbsp;&ndash; whether we think jobs can be best preserved by one or the other.&nbsp; It is all about choice and judgment.&nbsp; I am sure that the Finance Minister will be able to give a much better justification when he sums up the Budget debate.&nbsp; So I will just leave it here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for those of us in the workforce, I think rather than arguing about whether you should have the money instead of your boss, we&nbsp;should all take a leaf from Han Thong&rsquo;s advice&nbsp;&ndash; "keep our spirits strong, continue to do well in your job if you have one, look for new opportunities if you do not".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it is a mix of Government, community, family and personal effort that helps fill up this country.&nbsp; I have argued for more help for the most vulnerable and also have argued for more to be put&nbsp;in from all parties.&nbsp; If the Singapore Bowl is filled to overflowing with confidence and compassion, then we can all sit back, celebrate, and perhaps <p align=left>Column: 1769<p>finally, leave the monastery together with the apprentice monk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, on this note,&nbsp;I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Swee Say)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Swee Say):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to share my perspective on Budget 2009 as a union leader and as an active practitioner&nbsp;of tripartism.&nbsp; I would like to touch on three areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, how far should we go to save jobs.&nbsp; Secondly, how to save jobs.&nbsp; And, thirdly, how to help those who lose their jobs.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, how far should we go to save jobs?&nbsp; Yesterday, Mr Low Thia Khiang said that he was against&nbsp;CPF cut.&nbsp; I agree with him, I am also against&nbsp;CPF cut.&nbsp; However, Mr Low said that he would not implement&nbsp;Jobs Credit either.&nbsp; He said&nbsp;there are other better ways of saving jobs.&nbsp; But yesterday he did not offer any specific suggestions.&nbsp; I was looking forward to the speech by Ms Sylvia Lim.&nbsp; I was hoping that she will offer some suggestions but all I got was the proposal to introduce the Job Seekers Allowance of up to $500 per month.&nbsp; I fail to see how the Job Seekers Allowance of $500 per month&nbsp;can help us to save jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang ended his speech yesterday, and I quote, "There is light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; The optimistic side of me believe this will not be a long tunnel."&nbsp; His optimism took me by surprise.&nbsp; I would like to believe that he is right but I think he is more likely to be wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is wrong, and if we in this House act too slowly and indecisively, who will pay the price, who will bear the pain?&nbsp; Many workers will be retrenched, unemployment will go up rapidly; to act by then&nbsp;will be too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is the reason why the labour movement&nbsp;welcomes this fast and decisive Budget announced by the Minister for Finance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, as a union leader, I walk the ground all the time.&nbsp; I talk to union leaders, workers, bankers, hoteliers, retailers,<p align=left>Column: 1770<p> manufacturers, and&nbsp;many of them told me they have never seen such a situation in all their working lives.&nbsp; What workers are worried about?&nbsp; Their&nbsp;three top concerns are:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, can I keep my job?&nbsp; The latest forecast by IMF said the global economy is projected to grow at only 0.5%.&nbsp; This will be the lowest in 60 years.&nbsp; The latest forecast by&nbsp;International Labour Organisation (ILO) is that unemployment all over the world will go up.&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is so uncertain that this time round, the ILO came up with not one&nbsp;but three forecasts.&nbsp; ILO said that the best scenario, the most optimistic scenario, is that unemployment would rise from 6% last year to 6.1% this year.&nbsp; And with that, about 18 million people of the world will become the new unemployed.&nbsp; A realistic scenario will be for the unemployment of the world to go up to 6.5%, and with that, 30 million new unemployed.&nbsp; And the most pessimistic scenario is 7.1% global unemployment rate with 51 million new unemployed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, many Singaporean workers are worried that as we go through this crisis, will retrenchment continue to rise rapidly?&nbsp; In Singapore, already we saw in the first three quarters of last year, 6,000 workers were retrenched.&nbsp; By the fourth-quarter, in one quarter alone, it went up to 7,000.&nbsp; Many workers are asking will retrenchment exceed 10,000 in the first quarter of this year.&nbsp; Many workers are also worried.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they be one of these 10,000 to be retrenched?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they be one of the 51 million globally to join the ranks of the unemployed?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, many workers are concerned, "Even if I keep my job, will I be able to keep my CPF?"&nbsp; Employers' contribution to CPF has declined over the years from 25% to 20%, to now 14.5%.&nbsp; Many workers' take-home pay have already been affected.&nbsp; There is no overtime.&nbsp; They now work on shorter work-week.&nbsp; So any significant cut in CPF <p align=left>Column: 1771<p>this time round will hurt the workers even more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, workers are concerned, "If I cannot keep my job, if I am retrenched, will I be able to find another job?"&nbsp; And these workers I am talking about are not just the low-skilled workers, not just the casual and contract workers, but also the rank-and-file workers, the back-to-work women, the older workers, as well as the PMETs.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;if you ask me, how far should we go to try to save jobs as we go through this downturn, the realistic side of me say, "Let us go as far as we can".&nbsp; And this is the reason why the labour movement supports the decision by this Government to draw on the past reserves, because it is important that the Government sends a clear message that the Government is putting in its best effort.&nbsp; And in response, the labour movement, the business community, the workers, likewise, we must put in our best efforts as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, having decided that we should go as far as possible to save jobs, the next question is how best to save jobs.&nbsp; Over the last two days, there was much debate about&nbsp;Jobs Credit.&nbsp; Some Members expressed their concerns, they said Jobs Credit is untested, may not be effective, probably will not work.&nbsp; For example, some will say that, "If I keep a worker through Jobs Credit, I&nbsp;save $300 per month.&nbsp; But if I retrench a worker, I&nbsp;save $2,500 per month.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Jobs Credit will not work".&nbsp; Some will say that, "Even with the announcement of Jobs Credit, there are still announcements of retrenchment.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp;there is clear evidence that Jobs Credit does not work".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the Members of this House, many of us here, we are not familiar with Jobs Credit.&nbsp; This is the first time that we introduce Jobs Credit.&nbsp; But all of us, I am sure, are familiar with CPF cuts because <p align=left>Column: 1772<p>we have done that a few times before.&nbsp; So if I were to make a comparison between Jobs Credit and CPF cut,&nbsp;are they the same?&nbsp; Are they different?&nbsp; And my conclusion is, it is "same-same" but different.&nbsp; On the one hand, Jobs Credit and CPF cut are the same, same in the sense that both schemes aimed to create the same pro-business effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was cheered by the illustrations highlighted by NMP Ms Cham Hui Fong earlier this afternoon.&nbsp; She illustrated that with Jobs Credit,&nbsp;many companies on the ground have managed to improve&nbsp;cashflow.&nbsp; As a result, some companies, as illustrated by her, have decided to pass the cost savings to their customers, so that they are more competitive and better able to keep their customers.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;decided to use&nbsp;Jobs Credit&nbsp;to upgrade their workers, so that they can be more competitive versus their competitors.&nbsp; Some&nbsp; decided to share the Jobs Credit with their workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of a wage cut or a wage freeze, they give a small increase to their workers.&nbsp; Some companies, after the announcement of Jobs Credit, decided to defer retrenchment; in some cases, decided to reduce the number of workers being retrenched; in some cases, they decided to let go the foreign workers upon the expiration of work permit because the Jobs Credit together with SPUR have made Singaporean workers more attractive.&nbsp; Companies that are profitable have decided to make full use of Jobs Credit to strengthen their bottom line.&nbsp; In some cases, they will expand and grow to create more jobs.&nbsp; In other cases, Jobs Credit has enhanced the bottom line, as a result, strengthened the job securities for workers in these companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are positive illustrations on how Jobs Credit can actually work on the ground to help us to save jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members expressed their concerns that&nbsp;there&nbsp;are no strings attached to Jobs Credit.&nbsp; Some say that,<p align=left>Column: 1773<p> "Look, why not give Jobs Credit only if the company promises not to retrench?".&nbsp; This means&nbsp;any company that retrenches workers should&nbsp;not be given Jobs Credit.&nbsp; I do not understand the logic.&nbsp; If a company is doing so badly that it has to retrench workers, and&nbsp;we deprive them of Jobs Credit, are we not pushing them further towards the downturn, thereby speeding up more retrenchment and resulting in more workers losing their jobs?&nbsp; So I do not understand the logic.</p></P></span></div>     <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

Some said that Jobs Credit should only be given to companies that are not profitable.&nbsp; So, if you are still&nbsp; making money&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;no Jobs Credit for you. Again, I do not understand the logic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we better off&nbsp;seeing more and more of these profitable companies turn unprofitable?&nbsp; What do we have to&nbsp;gain out of this?&nbsp;At the end of the day, let us recognise that&nbsp;there is no guarantee that profitable companies will not retrench workers.&nbsp; But more importantly, if we want to truly succeed in saving jobs, we need the support and the participation of all companies&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;big and small, local and multinational, profitable and non-profitable. Therefore, I am in full support of this&nbsp;approach of "no strings attached" because at the end of the day, if you want&nbsp;the Jobs Credit Scheme to be as effective and as pro-business as a CPF cut,&nbsp;we must accept and recognise that a dollar is a dollar to any company. It does not matter whether the dollar comes to the company through a CPF cut or through Jobs Credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, can we save all jobs?&nbsp; With Jobs Credit, can we hope to have zero retrenchment?&nbsp; If there is any announcement of retrenchment, does it mean that the Jobs Credit Scheme is a failure?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, let us cast our minds back to 1998.&nbsp; In 1998, we cut CPF not by 9% but by 10-percentage points. Even so, 30,000 workers were retrenched.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we say that the 10-percentage point cut in CPF in 1998&nbsp;was a failure?&nbsp; I do not think <p align=left>Column: 1774<p>so.&nbsp;&nbsp;If not for that 10% CPF cut, the level of retrenchment could be much higher.&nbsp; Just like a&nbsp;CPF cut, Jobs Credit likewise is not a wonder drug. Jobs Credit is meant to help to save jobs but it cannot aim to save all jobs.&nbsp; It is like a group of people caught in a thunderstorm. Some would come down with a cold; some with a flu; some with bronchitis and some may end up having pneumonia.&nbsp;Therefore, it is not possible to have one drug that can cure all illnesses.&nbsp; Some companies are in better shape and&nbsp;some are in worse shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are trying to do&nbsp;with Jobs Credit must be to help those who are healthy&nbsp;to stay healthy; those who are not so healthy, hopefully, to ease some of their pain and hope that they will recover.&nbsp; For&nbsp;those&nbsp;who are in very bad shape, they may have no choice but to downsize.&nbsp; But even in the process of downsizing, we hope they will minimise the number of retrenched workers, defer retrenchment as long as possible and finally,&nbsp;to make sure that, hopefully, Singaporeans will be more attractive for them to retain as compared to foreign workers as it goes through the downsizing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;some Members of this House are concerned that since&nbsp;$4.5 billion is a lot of money, would we succeed and how many jobs would we save?&nbsp; All I can say is that the best way to save jobs, as we go through this downturn, is to make sure that Singapore is not only pro-business during good times, but even more pro-business during a downturn.&nbsp; In other words, the $4.5 billion Jobs Credit is pro-business, but we cannot rely on Jobs Credit alone to save all the jobs that we want to save.&nbsp; It requires everyone of us to play our part so that, hopefully, Singapore will be one of the most pro-business countries in the world, if not the most.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having described the "same-same"&nbsp;aspects of Jobs Credit and CPF cut, I will now&nbsp;highlight the big difference between Jobs Credit and CPF cuts.&nbsp; Some Members <p align=left>Column: 1775<p>said that $4.5 billion, even if we can save&nbsp;50,000 jobs, it would still work out to $90,000 per job.&nbsp; Therefore, it is too expensive&nbsp;and not worth it.&nbsp; Madam, I feel they have missed a very important point because this is the wrong way to look at Jobs Credit.&nbsp; Jobs Credit is not just to save jobs, but&nbsp;also to protect workers' CPF which is one of the top three concerns of workers on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to look at Jobs Credit is to imagine that we announced a cut of 9% in the CPF's employer contribution rate in order to make Singaporeans more cost-competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, at the same time, the Government tops up the CPF account of all Singaporeans and PRs with the same 9%.&nbsp; Simply put,&nbsp;the aim of Jobs Credit is to create the same effect of a CPF cut, but without having to cut workers' CPF.&nbsp; If you look at it this way, Jobs Credit, to the workers of Singapore, is a much better scheme,&nbsp;much better than&nbsp;CPF cut in 1998.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jobs Credit is not only pro-business, as&nbsp;it creates the same effect of a CPF cut in supporting businesses.&nbsp; But more importantly, Jobs Credit is also pro-worker because it protects the CPF of the workers. That is the reason why all my brothers and sisters in the labour movement fully support drawing down&nbsp;past reserves for the first time to help Singaporeans, not only to keep their jobs, but also to keep their CPF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the third point is: what do we do to help the retrenched and the unemployed?&nbsp; Some Members said that&nbsp;this Budget is one-sided, focusing a lot on job saving but there was no assistance for workers who lose their jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Siew Kum Hong called for&nbsp;unemployment insurance.&nbsp; Madam, I have a lot of reservations to this idea of unemployment insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, over a dinner with a&nbsp;Manpower Minister from an Asian economy that offers&nbsp;unemployment insurance,&nbsp;I asked him, "What is the cost of this unemployment insurance?"&nbsp; He <p align=left>Column: 1776<p>said, "6% of the payroll."&nbsp; It costs them 6% of their payroll to support this unemployment insurance.&nbsp; I did&nbsp;a very simple calculation. Under the Jobs Credit Scheme, 12% of the first $2,500 of wages would&nbsp;add up to $4.5 billion.&nbsp; This means&nbsp;every percentage point would work out to $375 million.&nbsp; In other words, if we, assuming that we are able to cut back on the unemployment benefits, instead of costing us 6% of payroll to implement the unemployment insurance as this particular Manpower Minister mentioned, assuming we do it&nbsp;at a cost of 3% of payroll, 3% at $375 million per percentage point would work out to $1 billion a year.&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp; who would pay for this $1 billion a year of premium for unemployment insurance?&nbsp; Do we expect the Government to tap into the past reserves and make&nbsp;this a permanent drawdown of our past reserves every year?&nbsp; I think the answer is no.&nbsp; Do we expect the employers to pay for this unemployment insurance?&nbsp; I do not think so.&nbsp; If employers can afford to pay for the $1 billion unemployment insurance during a downturn, they do not need our Jobs Credit.&nbsp; Can workers afford to pay for their own unemployment insurance?&nbsp;&nbsp;Many workers will find it illogical to do so.&nbsp; What this means is that workers who are more hardworking, workers who are more adaptable, will be subsidising those who are less adaptable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I want to emphasise time and time again as a union leader that jobs are available in Singapore. Therefore, instead of focusing our minds on strengthening and enhancing unemployment benefits for the jobless, I urge everyone to focus our minds more on how we can overcome the mismatch between the skilled and expectations between jobs and job-seekers because it is better for Singaporean workers to earn lower salaries during a downturn than to count on our unemployment benefits.&nbsp; Of course, we will help the hardship cases through the many-helping-hands approach&nbsp;but not <p align=left>Column: 1777<p>through a formalised unemployment scheme.&nbsp; I would like to illustrate with a real life example. Recently,&nbsp;a major corporation retrenched some of their workers and quite a number of them were PMETs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The union reached out to these PMETs&nbsp;&ndash; whether they were members does not matter. We reached out to them. We brought them to e2i. Twenty-seven of them accepted the assistance offered by e2i.&nbsp; Of these 27, six of them, about one-quarter, with the help of e2i, managed to find the same type of jobs in different companies.&nbsp; Eight of them, another one-quarter, managed to find different types of jobs in different industries.&nbsp; Thirteen of them, half of them, have decided to go through professional conversion.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now attending training offered under the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP).&nbsp; These 27 PMETs demonstrated to us that, yes, they have to take a pay cut of about 15% to 40% compared to their last drawn salary, but they believe that it is better for them to go through the training and retraining, and if need be, change profession in order to be self-reliant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, Madam, I would say that there is no truth at all to say that as a country, we offer no assistance&nbsp;to the jobless.&nbsp; Just come to e2i and you see what we are doing&nbsp;for the many jobless.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you walk into e2i, firstly, you see many workers going through up-skilling and re-skilling. There are 54 companies supporting 7,192 workers to re-skill and upskill at e2i.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty-eight more companies are on their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number is growing.&nbsp; But more importantly, the jobless, workers who were retrenched,&nbsp;are also receiving tremendous support at e2i.&nbsp; My sister in the labour movement, Mrs Josephine Teo,&nbsp;was at e2i just two days ago because a garment company retrenched about 500 to 600 workers.&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo, together with union leaders, brought them, batches by batches, to e2i and sent them through employability camps. Why?&nbsp; Because many <p align=left>Column: 1778<p>do not speak a single word of English.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&nbsp;need to go for retraining&nbsp;and it&nbsp;could be very difficult for them to change jobs.&nbsp; So Mrs Josephine Teo and her colleagues said,&nbsp;"Not to worry.&nbsp; If you do not speak English, we would run the training for you in Mandarin."&nbsp; Right now, they are going through a six-day employability camp in Mandarin followed by six weeks of skills upgrading and re-skilling.&nbsp; For these workers, they can receive up to $30 per day, up to $600 per month. So by the time they complete their training at e2i, not only will they receive the $600 per month of training allowances, they will have a new&nbsp;skill.&nbsp; But most importantly, we&nbsp;believe that many of them will be able to secure&nbsp;new jobs.&nbsp; In other words, this is much better than the Job Seekers Allowance Scheme as proposed by Ms Sylvia Lim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier, Mdm Ho Geok Choo also expressed the concern that for many of the PMETs, helping them&nbsp;to re-train is necessary but it is only half the solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other half of the solution is to help them find jobs. We fully agree.&nbsp; If you come to the e2i today, there are 11,695 jobs immediately available and these jobs are from industry services and the public sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is that the number is still growing. For example, Marina Bay Sands Resort has just decided to work with the e2i to offer 2,000 jobs which are suitable for the PMETs. At the same time, the Government agencies&nbsp;&ndash; EDB, the Singapore Tourism Board and IE Singapore&nbsp;&ndash; are&nbsp;also working with e2i to channel&nbsp;job opportunities&nbsp;that are suitable for PMETs through the e2i.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this close collaboration between WDA and the NTUC, and with the&nbsp;support of companies and agencies, we believe that we are doing a lot for the unemployed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, let me conclude.&nbsp; I started my&nbsp;address&nbsp;saying that I do not believe that&nbsp;the current downturn&nbsp;would&nbsp;be a&nbsp;short tunnel.&nbsp; But I agree with Mr Low Thia Khiang that there will be light at the end <p align=left>Column: 1779<p>of the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is:&nbsp; what kind of light are we going to see?&nbsp; Would this be broad day light?&nbsp; Or would this be headlight of an on-coming train?&nbsp; We must keep reminding ourselves to&nbsp;do the right things during this downturn.&nbsp; Many countries have decided to cut jobs to save costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;They believe that it is better off for them to let some workers bear all the pain. In Singapore, we have decided to do it differently. We have decided to cut costs to save jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that it is better for all of us&nbsp;to bear some of the pain together so that we can avoid&nbsp;massive retrenchment and a rapid rise in unemployment. We must never hope for "no pain" solution because there is no painless way out of a global recession.&nbsp; Just like the story of&nbsp;cat and&nbsp;mouse.&nbsp; There used to be a kingdom of mice. They lived their lives very peacefully&nbsp;until one day, a cat migrated to this kingdom of mice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;mice all lived in fear. So they held a&nbsp;parliament meeting. They discussed what they should&nbsp;do to overcome this fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;One Member of Parliament proposed and said, "Mdm Deputy Speaker, a very simple solution is for us to hang a big bell on the neck of this cat so wherever the cat goes, before the cat can&nbsp;see us, we can hear the cat first&nbsp;&ndash; <I>ting, ting, ting</I>."</p></span></div>			   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another MP said, "Very good idea. Why don't we make this bell as big as possible, as heavy as possible so that by the time the cat sees us, the bell&nbsp;is so heavy, so big that the cat cannot catch&nbsp;us." So they all&nbsp;supported it. The Speaker asked those in support said yes. They all agreed. It became a national policy. The next thing is implementation. They needed a mouse to carry this bell to hang on the cat. And guess what? There was no volunteer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, this story has a happy ending.&nbsp; Since the idea did not work,&nbsp;the cat&nbsp;walked around freely and&nbsp;the mice continued to live in fear. One day, a mother mouse and her baby mouse went <p align=left>Column: 1780<p>out hunting for food. Unfortunately, they came to a confrontation with this cat. And the cat cornered this mother mouse and&nbsp;baby mouse into a corner. There was no way out. At the most dangerous moment, the mother mouse did something unexpectedly.

[<I>Laughter</I>]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;this is the most severe recession of our lifetime.&nbsp; It is important that we do our best together.&nbsp; The Government is adopting a 'whole of Government' approach to&nbsp;save as many jobs as&nbsp; we can.&nbsp; The labour movement, together with the Singapore National Employer's Federation&nbsp;are adopting a "whole of tripartism" approach, stand in unity to do the best that we can for businesses and for workers. I&nbsp;urge this House,&nbsp;by the time the debate is over, I hope&nbsp;we will all work together, mobilise the "whole of Singapore", let us go out there to save as many jobs as we can, to create as much&nbsp;growth as we can, so that together, we can walk out of this tunnel towards the daylight, as the most pro-business economy and the most pro-worker country in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I thank you.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> Madam,&nbsp;not since the Great Depression of the 1930s, have we seen the global economy go into such a rapid, synchronous contraction. Britain is in a recession, technically, its first in 30 years, and Germany, the largest economy in Europe reported its steepest contraction in post-war economic growth. In Singapore, we are indeed worried, not just because we are in a recession but because we do not know how long and how deep this recession is going to be. We hear, on a <p align=left>Column: 1781<p>daily basis of retrenchments and of lower profit estimates across industries.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this broad canvas of doom and gloom, Singaporeans look to the Budget with much anticipation that our fiscal spending in the coming year will not only provide relief in this current crisis, but will create the possibility for a new and better tomorrow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what the Resilience Package promises. An unusual Budget for unusual times. Not only is the amount of deficit spending unprecedented, but this Government is also drawing into the reserves to give Singaporeans the assurance of a helping hand in times of need. However, these measures are decisive measures for the short-term. My central concern relates to whether we should do something differently if this downturn drags out longer than expected, and beyond the measures announced in 2009. We should, perhaps, start to think about using this crisis as an opportunity to make some key decisions in economic policies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three themes, which relate to the Budget that I thought we could make some basic adjustments to. First, enhancing the social safety net for the lower income families; secondly, saving jobs and providing opportunities, and thirdly, helping businesses stay viable and building new capabilities during this period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, enhancing the social safety net. Madam, this Budget recognises that people are going to lose their jobs. Cash flow constraints and a rising cost of living will put tremendous stress on the family budgets on the account of lower spending or loss of income. The GST credits and rebates can provide some measures of relief for many Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty with providing cash relief has always been the question of how far the Government should go. In a <p align=left>Column: 1782<p>recent sitting of Parliament, there was a heated debate of how much the Government should give before it is considered sufficient. However, this recession will have a far deeper impact on lower middle-class Singaporeans than one can imagine.&nbsp; For those who are at the bottom 10% of our socio-economic strata, I believe our present schemes and programs will largely be adequate and will continue to assist them. However, the bigger issue is what can be done with the lower-middle and middle-income Singaporeans who are affected by this downturn&nbsp;&ndash; groups that are most at risk of job losses but who may not benefit entirely from the increase in GST Credits and Workfare Income Supplements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the typical profile of one such person. In the United States, they have Joe the plumber. Here,&nbsp;we have Mr Tan the manager. Mr Tan, (not his real name) 49 years of age, is a retrenched executive of a building managing agent company. He was earning $2,800, while his wife, an accounts officer earns about $1,200 a month. He is living in a five-room HDB flat with his son, aged 9, and an aged mother who is 78 years old. Mr Tan has been retrenched for five months. He is actively seeking employment, having sent out 30 to 40 applications. Out of the applications sent, Mr Tan only received about three to four calls back. Both Mr Tan and his mother are suffering from hypertension and diabetes. They visit the polyclinic every three months and the SGH twice a year. Mr Tan is unable to downgrade his flat or sell his car because these sales will not result in a&nbsp;positive outcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tan is in financial difficulty. He needs a job. He may have to retrain. However, at 49 years of age, Mr Tan is not confident that he will be able to find another similar job that will pay just as much. How should we expect Mr Tan to make of the current situation, and what should his expectations of help reasonably <p align=left>Column: 1783<p>be, before the Government can properly be said to have discharged its duty to its people? This is not an easy question to answer and the clue lies in whether we should expect Mr Tan to give up all but the basic necessities during this downturn. Certainly, for Mr Tan and his family, they will have to adjust to a lower quality and standard of living. He may let go of his car, forgo their annual vacations overseas, or perhaps eat out less often. We hope these are things the Tan family will be able to do without too much adjustment pains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, will Mr Tan be prepared to give up the extra spending on his children's education&nbsp;&ndash; the tuition and enrichment classes for his children or for that matter, give up his broadband connection, his mobile phone and the other daily necessary&nbsp;expenses, such as a quality healthcare plan? In addition to dealing with the indignity and pain of retrenchment, Mr Tan worries about an uncertain future. Mr Tan will also have to dip into his savings and this is not to mention that there is a good chance that his flat will be taken away from him if he starts to persistently default on his mortgage payments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, the measures by the Government in giving GST Credits to Singaporeans to improve on their cash flow, demonstrates the Government's efforts in mitigating the consequences of an economic recession. However, the bigger worry at the back of most Singaporeans' minds is whether such measures are sufficient in the longer term and whether or not more could be given to allow a softer landing for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Government is doing as much it can to ease the current pain, if we do not cast a wider net, I believe there will be much anxiety that will be built up amongst unemployed Singaporeans. The <p align=left>Column: 1784<p>question, Madam, is whether we can do more for Mr Tan, the ex-manager, now unemployed, if the recession continues to bite. Do we need more comprehensive safety nets for middle-income earners such as Mr Tan, who do not benefit from Workfare? Arguably, a prolonged recession can reveal the relatively <I>ad hoc</I> and, therefore, inadequate nature of our social assistance programs as well as the limitations of Workfare for middle-income Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is an opportune time to go beyond the temporary measures announced in the Budget 2009. This crisis offers an opportunity for us to make some key changes in economic and social policies, to engender new capabilities,&nbsp;recalibrate how we define our programs, reduce our dependency on foreign labour and review our position towards social safety nets. Singaporeans are grateful for the measures taken at this time. However, we must pause now to assess the severity of the situation and ask ourselves if it is timely to institute a more permanent safety net for our workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has said that, when circumstances change, help schemes will change accordingly. When times are good, they should be withdrawn.&nbsp; Yet there is the counter argument, precisely because everything is always new, makeshift and fiendishly complicated, few understand what schemes are available or how they work. Instead of feeling reassured, many like Mr Tan will continue to feel stressed out, unable to plan for the future. There is a lot to be said for a simple-to-understand, permanent social safety net. For example, a more comprehensive safety net for middle-income Singaporeans can be made possible by considering&nbsp;an unemployment insurance programme. These can be means-tested and covering basic needs or may compensate the lost pay somewhat proportionally to the previous earned salary. More importantly, the programme <p align=left>Column: 1785<p>would compensate the recently unemployed on a bi-monthly or monthly basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second theme of the Budget is on saving jobs and providing opportunities. I applaud the Government for its ingenuity in introducing the Jobs Credit Scheme. By most accounts, this will provide some cost relief to employers who are faced with declining revenue and a deteriorating business outlook. A question underlying the Jobs Credit Scheme is whether it will be sufficient to save jobs in the longer term if the recession continues to bite. It is likely that the scheme may not be adequate to save jobs even if the employers would like to. A scenario where excess production capacity can result in plants being mothballed and staff being made redundant is highly likely, given our export-oriented economy and exposure to the global market. The Jobs Credit Scheme would not deter employers from retrenching in this scenario.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public sector has announced increases in the number of jobs available. Unfortunately, 16,000 jobs were lost last year, bringing the unemployment numbers in 2007 to 62,900 residents. More jobs are expected to be lost if the current economic malaise does not improve. While I appreciate the expansion of public- sector employment, it would be difficult to see how the public sector increases in hiring, can effectively mitigate against the massive extent of job losses. In the circumstances, more need to be done to deal with the increasing number of unemployed Singaporeans. While there are several approaches to deal with the problem, I would like to suggest two for now.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there are jobs that are shunned by Singaporeans because either the work conditions are not conducive or that the pay is not sufficient. Last year alone, 227,200 jobs were created. Of these about 70,400 jobs went to locals and 156,900 jobs went to foreigners, who <p align=left>Column: 1786<p>took these jobs because the locals were not available. The foreign employees cover the entire spectrum of jobs that are available; from white-collar professionals and managers, to blue-collar workers and manual workers. It is often mentioned, even in this House that jobs for Singaporeans can be created easily by sending these foreign employees home. The problem really is whether Singaporeans are willing or able to step up to fill these vacancies. I was in Australia, in the middle of last year, and noticed that in many of the road construction sites, it is the local Australians who do the work and direct traffic. I was fairly impressed by Australia's ability to encourage its local people to take up employment in industries that traditionally, in our case, was taken up by foreign workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the longer term, we should find ways to enable more Singaporeans to take up employment in blue-collar jobs that have been increasingly taken up by foreign workers. If we can carry this out, it would help to reduce our dependency on foreign labour for certain industries. To do this, we should ensure that the wages that Singaporeans can earn in this sector should be sufficiently attractive to incentivise them. Currently, foreign workers earn just slightly above $1,000 a month and a little more if they work overtime. If we are able to perhaps increase the average take home pay by as much as 60% more, it may be sufficient to encourage more Singaporeans to move into such occupations, particularly in the construction sector, that is, at the moment, being dominated by foreigners. This could perhaps be achieved by improving the productivity of the workers through higher level of automation and training, which to some extent can be subsidised by Government funding. More importantly, our Government could perhaps tweak our Workfare regime by increasing the amount of payout in sectors that we wish to see more participation&nbsp;by Singaporeans. This would <p align=left>Column: 1787<p> help to increase the total salary reclaiming for Singaporeans in&nbsp;sectors that have traditionally been taken up by foreign workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this year's Budget is a little short of doing something more to help Singaporeans to go into business. Now, in a full employment situation of the earlier years, Singaporeans may not find going into business to be such an attractive proposition. However, in an economic downturn, we could assist Singaporeans who have the inclination to go into business, go into business. This should also include those who still have jobs, but who may consider switching to improve prospects. We want to encourage and promote a culture of enterprise amongst Singaporeans. This is important for us as a small country, where we need to depend much on our people's own ingenuity and initiative to survive. Currently, our economy is perhaps too dependent on foreign investments to provide employment opportunities for Singaporeans. By encouraging more Singaporeans to start their own businesses, we also help to reduce our vulnerability to job losses when these foreign investors pack up and leave when the going gets rough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, we are beginning to see the emergence of an informal economy during these troubled times. The 31st January 2009 edition of the <I>Straits Times</I> reported a big jump in the number of illegal hawkers in the last year. 1,623 were caught illegally hawking. This is twice the number of people who were caught hawking in 2006. The <I>Straits Times</I> attributes this burgeoning underground trade as a side effect of the economic downturn.&nbsp;The report went on to indicate the difficulty that these vendors have in getting a licence. Of the 122 people who applied for a street hawker licence, only 26 or about one in five got one. This is <p align=left>Column: 1788<p>after meeting the stringent requirements that the applicant need, in order to qualify&nbsp;for one. For example, he has to be a Singapore citizen or a permanent resident, aged 45 and above or is unemployed or who has financial difficulty.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- 	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  		  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="			 </span></div> 									--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, while I understand the Government's policy stance on regulating street hawkers, I wonder whether the time has now come for the country to be more relaxed on our policy on the informal sector.&nbsp; Have strict hygiene requirements by all means, but go with the philosophy to facilitate rather than restrict if we truly want to help Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I raised the example of illegal street hawking to illustrate the point that the Government could perhaps do more to help nourish the entrepreneurial spirit of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I know that, at all levels, the Government is trying.&nbsp; At the CDC, for instance, there is seed money available for budding entrepreneurs to kick-start their business. &nbsp;There are also various programmes to train people in retail business and business management.&nbsp; However, the question is whether more can be done.&nbsp; The answer is yes, and I would like to suggest two approaches that I hope the Government will consider&nbsp;&ndash; enablement and facilitation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, enablement&nbsp;&ndash; while the Government has various schemes to train Singaporeans in running businesses, it should review the current programmes to see whether more training could be provided across constituencies to make it easier for people to sign up.&nbsp; Would the Government provide counselling sessions to help those interested to see if they are suitable for such undertakings or if they are taking excessive risks by going into business?&nbsp; Will there be advisors who can help interested entrepreneurs to undertake a thorough and rigorous analysis, including SWOT analysis of the business proposal, before embarking on the venture?&nbsp; I believe that much of the <p align=left>Column: 1789<p>business risk will be mitigated if entrepreneurs are guided and are given the opportunity to go through thorough training, analysis and guidance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, facilitation&nbsp;&ndash; business is about competition. To survive in a tough business environment, care and nurture must be given to start-ups to ensure its chances of survival.&nbsp; In this regard, more should perhaps be done to help start-ups.&nbsp; This could perhaps be extensive incubation zones across constituencies which are set aside for such undertakings.&nbsp; There could be the&nbsp;form of providing more rebates&nbsp;to start-ups to settle down or setting up of the physical infrastructure, such as pushcart shops at malls and MRT stations.&nbsp; Additionally, facilitation can also be provided by&nbsp;giving&nbsp;a more simplified set of rules on starting and running small enterprises, with limited compliance requirements to reduce costs, or in the case of street hawkers, to make more licences readily available and to reduce the impediment to doing business for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third comment relates to the Government helping businesses to stay viable during this difficult period.&nbsp; Madam, this year's Budget seeks to help businesses by, among other things, reducing the cost of hiring local labour and easing up on the credit pipelines with the financial institutions, making it relatively easier to get access to credit, which is the main casualty of this credit crunch.&nbsp; This is an innovative approach in helping businesses during this time, save that it would at best provide short-term relief, rather than long-term solution to the current crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two reasons for this.&nbsp; First, by providing relief on the first $2,500 in each worker's wages would help to provide relief in the short term.&nbsp; This addresses the supply-side of the equation, but not the demand-side.&nbsp; The question <p align=left>Column: 1790<p>that confronts most businesses today is whether they will be able to sustain decent volumes in their order books to maintain the present level of staffing.&nbsp; If there are insufficient orders to sustain business hires, then no amount of subsidy will be sufficient to keep jobs in the longer term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, in the initial <I>melee</I> following the financial crisis, keeping a healthy pipeline of credit is absolutely crucial to business.&nbsp; However, six months on, one must be clear in ascertaining what we want the loans for.&nbsp; The common complaint now is that the banks are still not lending.&nbsp; And there are valid reasons for this as, for instance, they may not be convinced that there is sufficient cash flow from underlying business to sustain the loan.&nbsp; The last thing we want to see happening is to commit the folly of lending to sustain&nbsp;businesses when the orders are just not there.&nbsp; What we are seeing now is a successive deflation of the world economy. We need to ensure that the stimulus packages across the world work to revive the economy.&nbsp; Until then, as an export-oriented economy, we may just have to hunker down and not expect too much until recovery comes round.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, to the extent that businesses can justifiably use the credit to maintain and keep its business going, the Government should do all it can to ensure that the necessary credit is given. &nbsp;Here, I would like to urge MAS to play a more active role in monitoring and, perhaps, assuming the mediatory role in helping to resolve any issue that may arise in this regard.&nbsp; While I am not advocating that MAS should substitute its judgment for the financial institutions, we need to ensure that in this climate, all parties are treated equitably and that financial institutions are not using the economic crisis as an excuse rather than a reason for the withdrawal of credit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1791<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which leads me to my final point about the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore.&nbsp; SMEs come up regularly in this House for mention, not least because there are those among us in this House who strongly believe that the SMEs are the salt of the Singapore's earth, whose success and vibrancy are equally important to a successful and a vibrant Singapore economy.&nbsp; In this crisis, we see how vulnerable and important the SMEs are&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;vulnerable because a significant number of SMEs are export dependent.&nbsp; A contraction in export markets elsewhere would necessarily lead to the SMEs operation and revenue being affected, and importantly, because SMEs are homegrown and&nbsp;rooted in Singapore.&nbsp; I believe that in a crisis, the SMEs are not going to take flight.&nbsp; Where can they fly too?&nbsp; This is their home and the land which gave them the opportunity to succeed.&nbsp; The SMEs, being seen as Singaporeans, will be more likely than not, to fly the national flag by keeping as many jobs as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US is facing considerable pressure in this crisis when implementing the stimulus package to give preference to the local industries through a series of rather innovative and unconventional conditions such as imposing local content in the steel sector. &nbsp;In the same vein, we should examine whether more can be done to assist the SMEs during this difficult period.&nbsp; I believe we can.&nbsp; We can do better by persuading our people, whether they are doing business here or&nbsp;elsewhere to adopt the "Sourcing from&nbsp;Singapore" approach, if given a choice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House has heard of similar proposals before this, but have been turned&nbsp;down because of our policies favouring the lowest bidder, or FTA and WTO obligations.&nbsp; While all these are true, we must start somewhere, and be prepared to jettison old sacred cows <p align=left>Column: 1792<p>regarding unfettered competitions and not giving preferences to SMEs in government purchases, if we want to develop a robust local economy.&nbsp; We want to be like the Japanese or the Koreans who are in the habit of bringing their SMEs along whenever they invest overseas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Government could use this period to help our SMEs build capabilities by improving on their store of intellectual property through massive funding and support in research and development.&nbsp; I have always maintained, both in this House and outside it, that it is only through intellectual property that we, as a small country, can compete well in the global economy.&nbsp; With intellectual property that is commercially viable, our SMEs can be price-setters rather than price-takers.&nbsp; It will help to boost our exports and soften the impact of a global recession.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, this crisis has renewed the call once again for the Government to seriously consider whether they should&nbsp;allow for the setting up an SME bank to&nbsp;avoid the effects of a credit crunch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, this global economic recession has been seen by many to be the worst that the world has seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.&nbsp; In response, the Government has taken a counter-cyclical fiscal policy.&nbsp; This Budget has demonstrated the willingness of the Government to dip into reserves to fund a budget deficit.&nbsp; However, with an expansionary fiscal policy, one has to be careful in ensuring that the people will not be too dependent on public spending such that cutting back, when the economy improves, may pose major problems.&nbsp; For now, I believe the Government is keenly aware of the delicate balance that is required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Madam, I support our Government's financial policy for FY 2009.</p></span></div>							<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      					<!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS--><p align=left>Column: 1793<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:EXEMPTED BUSINESS:::1793--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This year's Budget is indeed shocking to many people, making our people realise how serious the present situation is.&nbsp; It also shows the determination of the Government to deal with the problem. The Government not only insists that employers should endeavour to retain the jobs of their employees, but also makes history by opening up the coffer to draw into our past reserves, and goes even further to introduce the unprecedented Jobs Credit, Special Risk-Sharing Initiatives and other packages to help employers who are not doing well to cut costs and save the rice bowls of their employees so that they can keep their flats, or at least delay the possibility of losing their jobs.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among all the commentators who are making waves all over the world, my deepest admiration is for the <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I> commentator, former Member of Parliament, Mr Goh Choon Kang.&nbsp; In his article, "<I>Conscientious Economics</I> ", he described the Government as a clever housewife.&nbsp; This is an apt analogy&nbsp;&ndash; "There are good housewives, there are also not so good housewives.&nbsp; A clever housewife or daughter-in-law is well loved by her parents-in-law. A clever housewife will make use of her wisdom, her virtue, her clever thoughts, her decisiveness and <p align=left>Column: 1794<p>unite the old, the middle-aged and the young in the family.&nbsp; Enhance the family cohesiveness and collectively overcome adversities, making it one big happy family."</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this occasion, our ordinary folks would look at the Government as though it is their young daughter-in-law.&nbsp; If she does well, it is to be expected, and even then there are things that she could have done even better, and if she does not do well, then, of course, she will be subjected to very severe criticisms.&nbsp; It is very difficult to please everybody.&nbsp; Fortunately, our Government's style is not to be deterred&nbsp;just because some people may have other ideas.&nbsp; Otherwise, we would not get to enjoy the new lease of life brought about by this unique Budget.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from thoroughly resolving the problems affecting the daily lives of the people, the Government should also care for the present mood and spiritual condition of the ordinary folks.&nbsp; Every day, every night, we keep hearing depressing economic news that would hurt our fighting spirit and undermine our confidence.&nbsp; It would make our people worry, disheartened and following that, it may even lead to family discord, bankruptcy and marriage breakdown.&nbsp; Therefore, I support the Prime Minister's call that we should help our people through our grassroots leaders, our grassroots organisations, our community organisations, so that all our people will feel that there is warmth and care in the society, so that they will be able to pick themselves up and try to ride over these difficult times.&nbsp; Even for those who do not go for medical treatment because of financial difficulties, we should encourage them to go for treatment so that they would recover sooner.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):&nbsp; The Government has set aside $3.7 billion towards healthcare and a chunk of the monies will be used towards promoting mental well-being.&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 1795<p>strongly support and applaud this move as we are already seeing a rising number of people seeking treatment for some milder forms of mental illnesses, such as depression or anxiety to more serious forms which border on insanity and unsoundness of mind.

Despite much of the reported efforts of many governments around the world to stave off its damaging and gloomy effects on their economies, there is very little evidence that blue skies lie ahead in the near upcoming months. Our fortunes being tied to the global economy, puts us in a similar dire situation.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am optimistic&nbsp;about our future. The Resilience Package commensurates with our nation&rsquo;s forward-looking approach to nation-building and also touches the heart of the matter for Singaporeans.&nbsp; I believe that this is a Budget crafted by the people, for the people with the true Singaporean spirit and heartbeat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;I believe that as much as we could inject billions of funds to mitigate the effects of this downturn, the spirit,&nbsp;resilience of the country that normally characterises Singaporeans is equally needed at this time. To overcome this crisis, I call upon all Singaporeans to 'take the bull by the horns' in this year of the Ox and work together as Team Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this crisis requires a many 'hands, feet and minds' approach to resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires us as Singaporeans from all walks of life to do our part.&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-off can donate in kind and support meaningful initiatives; the educated to support the less educated through volunteerism while those from the low-income to persevere, upgrade their skills and stay employed. Support groups could provide emotional support while schools can play a more proactive role in reaching out to families affected by the downturn.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to continue my speech in Malay.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I> ):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2009/20090204/20090204VS_115332.pdf"">Appendix A</a>*.</I>]&nbsp; Madam, as <p align=left>Column: 1798<p>the name of the Budget suggests, the Resilience Package also aims to increase the resilience of&nbsp;Singaporeans when going through these difficult times.&nbsp; To help the people, the Government gives various handouts, including cash through the GST Credits, as well as rebates&nbsp;on other monthly bills.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans must be smart in using the additional cash so that they can use the different handouts for as long possible and not to spend it in a short time, for example by buying expensive goods.</p><p align="justify"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of finance, I really hope our citizens will have the resilience with regard to their money.&nbsp; This includes having sufficient savings and saving regularly so that their savings will increase.&nbsp; As the saying goes, "Look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves."&nbsp; Each dollar saved every month will result in a higher savings amount for the future.</p><p align="justify"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good example is the saving habits of our Government.&nbsp; Savings are made during good times with the budget surpluses being kept in the national reserves.&nbsp; Eventually, these reserves will accumulate and become an important source, especially during these difficult times. In facing the weak economy now, the Government has to spend a huge amount and any deficiency in the national budget can be overcome by careful use of the national reserves.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This practice must be followed by our citizens.&nbsp; The reserves accumulated by each family will become an important source when they face hardship like the one now, with the risk of pay cuts or, even worse, retrenchments.&nbsp; In this matter, our people must continue to improve their knowledge and skills in financial planning.&nbsp; They need to know the basics of financial planning, including setting aside part of their income to build <p align=left>Column: 1799<p>individual and family savings.&nbsp; More people are increasingly aware of this practice but it needs to be actively instilled among our citizens.</p><p align="justify"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial planning is not only for the high income earners but it is more important for those with middle or low income.&nbsp; They face higher risks in the current weak economic climate with the possibility of wage cuts or retrenchment, and therefore they need sufficient savings in case something unexpected happens.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admittedly, some organisations do have financial planning workshops.&nbsp; I applaud their effort and urge that such efforts be increased in order to give more benefits to more people.&nbsp; Financial planning not only involves regular savings but is also required when we buy expensive goods and services.&nbsp; This includes house and car purchases, where we need to know financial planning so that the payments and other expenses will not exceed our income.&nbsp; Let us not follow the Malay saying&nbsp;&ndash; being stylish to the extent of finishing all our money&nbsp;&ndash; but let us spend within our means.</p><p align="justify"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, I would like to see our community continue their journey towards excellence.&nbsp; Do not let the current economic downturn hinder our objectives.&nbsp; In this regard, excellence can be achieved by improving the quality of our work. Besides this, we have to upgrade our knowledge and skills until we become a high value-added worker to our employers.&nbsp; This will turn us into an important asset to our companies.&nbsp; The journey towards excellence must not stop even in these difficult times so that our community will be more ready to take advantage of the opportunities when the global and local economy recovers.&nbsp; Let us continue to pursue excellence during this downturn.</p><p align="justify"><br><p align=left>Column: 1800<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to continue my speech in English.<br></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I> ): Madam, besides the cheers from the initiatives of the recent Budget, there are still concerns among Singaporeans. Though many Singaporeans are striving to be self-reliant, if one does&nbsp;not have a job, the situation may still be challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to continue to fine-tune our systems to facilitate the process of securing jobs for Singaporeans. I am concerned that many present workers will become ex-workers who will be desperately trying to find a job to feed their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I have met a few groups who are very concerned about the economic downturn. These include Singaporeans who are 40 years and above, and unable to find a job, as well as those who cannot be employed like the elderly, disabled and mentally incapacitated.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these considerations in mind, we need to invest in more social workers and counsellors to support Singaporeans proactively and devise a holistic approach to help families in need.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also&nbsp;like to urge the Ministries, Government agencies and privately-run organisations to adopt a more compassionate approach in addressing the problems of Singaporeans who are having difficulties during this downturn, particularly, those who have lost their jobs and have many dependents to support.&nbsp; For example, due to job losses, many may have difficulties to pay their housing mortgage loans and other bills, which will certainly add to their distress.&nbsp;&nbsp;While ensuring that Singaporeans are responsible for their spending, we need to empathise with their anxiety as well as the complex circumstances faced by them.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in our pursuit to survive this economic downturn and prepare for the upturn, I feel we need to be bolder and continue our effort in enhancing innovation and creativity in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1801<p>Through the Budget and other avenues, we need to provide the platforms and opportunities for Singaporeans and companies to be creative and innovative in facing the challenges of the downturn so that we can ride on the opportunities and reap benefits in better times to come.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen how the Government through its ministries and agencies, as well as private organisations, such as the Meritus Mandarin, have been creative and innovative in saving jobs for its people and employees.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, many MPs who spoke before me have called for job saving and job creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe among other measures, we need to be bolder in our effort in building creativity and innovation in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will give us a long-term job creation sustainability and contribute towards the creation of a new economic eco-system.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to note that the Government will spend $130 million on enhancing grants and training schemes to encourage enterprises across various sectors to refresh and develop new capabilities as part of the programme "making innovation pervasive".&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to this, I would like to ask the Minister how our local start-ups are doing with regard to innovation and bringing their innovation to the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current credit crunch, small start-ups may be driven out of the market even before reaching the mature stage of the innovation process. While the future lies in innovation, I find that many of these enterprises constantly face financial challenges in keeping afloat as well as struggle to attain market penetration. I believe the Government can do more to support the growth of these innovative enterprises and start-ups that have the potential to develop into massive multi-national corporations in the future. For example, companies like Google, Apple <p align=left>Column: 1802<p>and Facebook were once start-up companies but have today become a tremendous force in job creation and innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The true economic benefit is far from the measurable number of jobs each of these companies creates. When Intel created its first micro-processor in early 1970s, who could have predicted or imagined that the Intel of today would become the world&rsquo;s largest chip manufacturer. While the current recession poses threatening economic challenges, it also presents an excellent opportunity for us to be bold in our drive towards innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when people at established companies may be losing their jobs, we need to provide a decisive approach to support job creation within knowledge-based enterprises, which also includes our start-ups.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has described the&nbsp;Resilience Package as a 'very decisive Budget' that aims to help&nbsp;Singaporeans through the difficult economic times ahead. On this, let me share with you in the House about a note which was received from Mr Robert Yang, Senior Vice-President of DFS (Duty Free Shop) Worldwide, where Robert shared an exchange between DFS President for Worldwide Operations, Michael Sheever, with the Chairman and CEO, Edward Brennen about Budget 2009.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1851-1854.<BR></div></P></div>    <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Michael wrote, I quote, "This will certainly help.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is a part of me that thinks&nbsp;we would need it.&nbsp; You have to admire the Singapore Government.&nbsp; They are tough to deal with but decisive and fast when it is necessary.&nbsp; What a great idea on their part to protect their tax-paying citizens.&nbsp; Someone should send this to Obama."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, here we see how a non-Singaporean corporate leader&nbsp;think of Singapore and our political leadership.&nbsp; It is an endorsement&nbsp;for Government's effort in this Budget to save jobs and business.&nbsp; In the&nbsp;words of Robert, he said, "I am proud to be a Singaporean."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1803<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, using an imagery which I have used before at a Convention, where each country or nation is represented by people climbing the different peaks in a mountainous area, the current economic crisis will cause people from many countries to slow down or perhaps retreat from their climb towards the higher peaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may even fall down from their higher peaks. However, as we slow down in our climb towards the different peaks of excellence, it is important to continue to invest in our base-camps to provide the appropriate infrastructure to face the current crisis and facilitate the progression towards the higher peaks even during this current&nbsp;downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we should continue to invest in our people to enhance our skills and expertise so that we can be effective in our pursuit of excellence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;my key message today is:&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans need to have the perseverance and creativity to brave this difficult period as One People, One Nation and One&nbsp;Singapore.&nbsp; While this downturn is different in its form and magnitude, I believe we will pull through together with the Singapore spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> We live in capricious times.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days into the New Year the Government was forced to cut its growth forecast for 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers keep on changing; current estimates for 2009 are -5 to -2 %, about 6,400 people lost their jobs in the last nine months of 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there is wide speculation that the figure will surpass 30,000, dwarfing the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, Budget 2009, delivered early, gave needed reprieve to Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;It injected a sense of confidence in the Government&nbsp;&ndash; this confidence derived principally, from Singaporeans realising <p align=left>Column: 1804<p>that the Government knows the cause of the problem, and, equally important, has the wherewithal to address it. That the Government is able to do so without borrowing, unlike many economies in the world, sets it apart.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were also the sentiments of the P65 Singaporeans with whom I had a Budget dialogue on 30th January.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the dialogue was to analyse the Budget, from a P65 Singaporean&rsquo;s perspective. While fully supporting the watershed Jobs Credit and SRI Bank Lending stimulus (both schemes using past reserves), and the business cash flow and direct assistance to households initiatives, the discussion veered to four further concrete ways of how to alleviate the hardships of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I would like to discuss these four today.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to reconsider the treatment of contract and casual workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Two reasons:&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, because the people who hire contract workers often do not contribute CPF for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This lack of CPF means that the contract worker, who is likely a low-wage worker, does not grow his retirement nest egg.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also means that he has less to pay towards his housing asset, which gives him more incentive to rent. This goes against the principle of Home Ownership, which is a "key pillar" of our economy. Importantly, for the purposes of Budget 2009, a worker would need to (a) contribute CPF, and (b) contribute towards his Medisave account to receive the knock-on effects of Jobs Credit and the WIS and its special payments.&nbsp; Contract workers, often a highly vulnerable group of Singaporeans, will therefore not benefit from either.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several solutions to this:</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, to step up education of employers to ensure that they are aware that they must pay CPF for contract workers who receive more than $50 a month.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1805<p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, to embark on a major increase in enforcement measures and impose hefty penalties on recalcitrant employers.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, to educate and empower the contract workers themselves so that they are aware of their rights and are not afraid to report employers who fail to pay CPF.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These measures are necessary because employment contracts often see the employer in a strong bargaining position; and the potential employee or worker in a weak position.&nbsp;&nbsp;This especially applies to our Singaporean contract workers, such as contract cleaners, who lack formal education, speak dialect, are elderly, and are in desperate need of a job.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such inequality of bargaining power, a principle recognised in contract law, becomes more acute when the workers know that 30,000 people may lose their jobs. If their employer refuses to pay CPF, they may be afraid to speak up, because they worry about the fact that they may lose their job.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, we need to do more to ensure that these vulnerable workers receive CPF contributions, have a retirement income, and are able to purchase a home.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that the Government seriously considers ramping up these measures. With growing numbers of workers hired on a contract or casual basis, this problem must be quickly addressed.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason for changing the treatment of contract workers is because without CPF contributions into their Medisave account, the contract worker will not get the benefits of WIS or the WIS special payments envisioned under Budget 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this WIS (the fourth pillar of our social security system), to quote Budget Debate 2008, is not available to the contract worker.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the matching employer&rsquo;s contribution, the <p align=left>Column: 1806<p>contract worker is unlikely to voluntarily put a portion of his limited wage into Medisave.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the job security which Jobs Credit is envisioned to bring is unavailable to the contract worker&nbsp;&ndash; if he is not on the employer&rsquo;s CPF payroll.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in order that this Budget well and truly achieves its aim of giving (a) job security to Singaporeans and, (b) targeted assistance to vulnerable workers, surely the Government should first ensure that as many people qualify for the Jobs Credit and WIS as possible. Since the qualifying mechanism is CPF contributions, I urge the Government to embark on major efforts to ensure that all workers who qualify for CPF are in fact receiving&nbsp;it from their employers.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, as a temporary stop-gap measure, would the Government consider removing the requirement to contribute to Medisave in order to receive WIS payments?&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully understand that WIS is meant to be "Workfare not Welfare", but is not the worker already helping himself by working?&nbsp; Hence, as a worker, he should be legitimately qualified to receive Workfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will encourage people to work. For the sake of clarity, I am in support of tying Jobs Credit to the&nbsp;CPF payroll, since this will give employers added incentive to pay their workers CPF. But WIS is different&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it is meant to incentivise the worker not the employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, given the worker has taken the step to work, he should be given WIS regardless of any contribution to Medisave.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two more suggestions for how the Government can alleviate the plight of contract workers and other vulnerable low wage workers.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first suggestion is based on the fact that the Government provides jobs to <p align=left>Column: 1807<p>many Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion is that the Government, together with GLCs and Town Councils, should lead the way in ensuring that all workers who provide the Government with services, such as cleaning services, receive matching employer-employee CPF contributions. This will also ensure that they can receive WIS and the job security that Jobs Credit seeks to achieve.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second suggestion is for the CDCs. When CDCs give financial assistance to residents, the CDCs should also automatically deposit a portion of the financial assistance into the residents' Medisave Accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, if the resident is working he will receive the WIS component from the Government. This could also incentivise residents who are not working to work so that they can receive WIS.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the second suggestion about what more we can do to help Singaporeans in these difficult times, arising from the Budget dialogue I had with P65 Singaporeans, has to do with the foreigner-Singaporean worker ratio. We have heard how a foreign workforce adds value to our economy and, in fact, creates more job opportunities for Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I do supermarket shopping with my wife, we observe that most of the check-out counters are manned by Indonesians, Filipinas or Malaysians.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems very few staff in the supermarket are Singaporeans. The same is happening in hawker centres&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;many stall assistants or coffee-shop assistants are PRC Chinese nationals. English is being spoken less in the retail and service industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;In restaurants, waiters and waitresses come from around the region&nbsp;&ndash; Indonesia, China and so on.&nbsp; The feel and environment in these places is changing and changing rapidly. Because these places are in the heartlands, the environment in our heartlands is changing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1808<p>I ask:&nbsp; Is&nbsp;it the Government&rsquo;s intention to have the service industry, such as waiting tables, check-out counter staff, manned by foreigners?&nbsp; How does this benefit Singaporeans who would be willing to take on these jobs? Given the flourishing numbers of foreigners in service industry jobs, would the Government consider tweaking the quota system to ensure that the minimum number of Singaporeans employed by a company at any one time is increased, and the number of foreigners decreased?&nbsp; This is not to question the service standards of foreigners&nbsp;&ndash; my main concerns are two-fold:&nbsp; (i) whether Singaporeans who want and need these jobs are unable to get them due to the large number of foreigners, and (ii) whether the Government has given serious thought to the rapidly changing cultural dynamic, feel and environment in our heartlands? A more strict Singaporean-foreigner worker ratio could make these changes less rapid, and more manageable.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third proposed area where we can help Singaporeans in these difficult times is by giving more power to FIDReC.&nbsp; Presently,&nbsp;FIDReC has been the authority of choice for Singaporeans seeking redress for mis-sold financial instruments. FIDReC is a lot cheaper than seeking independent legal advice and pursuing litigation. However, FIDReC&rsquo;s jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes between banks and consumers only goes up to $50,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;A resident in my constituency who lost a considerable amount of his life savings informed me that consumers could appeal for adjudication up to $100,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is only an avenue of appeal, which if unsuccessful means that the consumer has recourse to adjudication for up to $50,000 of mis-sold products.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is too low a cap. Why not create parity between FIDReC&rsquo;s jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the Subordinate Courts&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that is,&nbsp;allow FIDReC to adjudicate matters involving sums of up to <p align=left>Column: 1809<p>S$250,000? This will allow many Singaporeans caught out by the Lehman minibonds, and other structured products, to take benefit of an adjudication without expensive legal redress. I give two real examples from my constituency of why FIDReC&rsquo;s limit is too low. First, when I went for a recent market visit in my constituency, a wet market stall holder informed me that his wife had invested their life savings in Lehman-linked mini bonds&nbsp;&ndash; $200,000. They worked day in, day out. They saved about $1,000 per month and&nbsp;they have been working for about fifteen years. The money was meant for their children's education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should my resident have to pay substantial legal fees for representation in Court just because FIDReC cannot adjudicate matters beyond $50,000?&nbsp; It does not make sense. The second example is an elderly couple who live in my constituency. The lady invested her life savings as an assistant nurse in Lehman-linked products&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;over $200,000. She informed that she had parked her money in POSB for the longest time before putting her money in Fixed Deposits. She told me that the&nbsp;only reason she&nbsp;moved her money from Fixed Deposits to the Lehman product was because a Relationship Manager came to her home and persuaded her by saying that the principal would be secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;She did so very reluctantly.&nbsp; Her investment is now worth next to nothing.&nbsp; She went to FIDReC only to be told that it handles claims up to $50,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;My resident&rsquo;s only option is to pay legal fees out of the little left she has to trial her chances against the bank.&nbsp; In light of examples such as these, which I am sure are repeated in many of the Members&rsquo; constituencies, would the Government consider increasing FIDReC&rsquo;s jurisdiction to the Subordinate Courts' limit of up to $250,000?</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth point I wish to make is not so much a suggestion but a strong endorsement on behalf of the P65 <p align=left>Column: 1810<p>Singaporeans I had a dialogue with, of the Government&rsquo;s concerted effort to employ up to 18,000 workers in the uniformed and civil services.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the main concerns of the P65ers was job prospects for those graduating from ITE, University and Polytechnics in 2009, and those who graduated last year.&nbsp; I strongly support the Government's strong recruitment drive, and urge the Government to continue to create more of these useful employment prospects.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, no doubt, gauging from the responses of the P65 Singaporeans at the dialogue, that these recruitment drives have created a significant sense of comfort among the younger Singaporeans.&nbsp; The sense of comfort comes in knowing that the Government is actively and innovatively creating new jobs.&nbsp; I note that the Government's recruitment is also targeted at workers seeking jobs in project management, IT, accounting and urban planning, therefore offering a wide selection to graduating classes.&nbsp; This form of job creation will tide young Singaporeans over the difficult near future.&nbsp; They will also benefit from learning about the mission, vision and values of our first class armed forces&nbsp;&nbsp;and civil service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Madam,&nbsp;I support the Budget, not only because of its generosity towards Singaporeans, but because it essentially displays the Government's resolve to&nbsp;secure jobs, keep its promise that each student will be given a first rate education and shepherd the economy through a tumultuous time. To have the wherewithal to put Singapore on such a track at a time like this is admirable.

They are serious and they are many."</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it is serious enough that we have to respond in an extraordinary way with a calculated risk at implementing the well-thought and researched Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp; The Member Mr Low Thia Khiang yesterday wanted evidence that it will work well as a pilot, as an original.&nbsp; There will be no prior data and no statistics to analyse for now.&nbsp; It may or may not be statistically significant, in terms of saving jobs,&nbsp;we have to see.&nbsp; But to help him see this clearly, let us consider the following hypothetical scenario.&nbsp; Company A has 200 employees with Jobs Credit Scheme at 12% for the first $2,500 per employee per month, this would mean $300 per employee per month saved by the company.&nbsp; Thus, for the 200 employees that Company A has, it would get about $60,000 per month from the Government.&nbsp; This can be used to pay for at least 20 workers if we consider each of them earning about $3,000 per month.&nbsp; This is equivalent to Company A not having to formally pay the salary of about 10% of its workforce as the Government is already doing it.&nbsp; These 20 people could have lost their jobs without the Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp; But we will have to&nbsp;monitor the scheme and follow through.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low was also not supportive of the scheme as he said the companies which are doing better will also benefit from the scheme.&nbsp; I asked him&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but he is not here<p align=left>Column: 1812<p>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;so what?&nbsp; In a crisis as this, everyone and every company will be affected by the tsunami people effect,&nbsp;no&nbsp;matter how deep their pockets are.&nbsp; Anyway, such companies can share their benefits with their employees&nbsp;&ndash; sharing bonuses and goodwill during good times and of course taking pay cuts and tightening their belts during tough times.&nbsp; If the Member can come up with something more practical and creative, I am sure everybody will be more than willing to listen to him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Member Sylvia Lim also suggested earlier today by giving out money to retrenched workers.&nbsp; She suggested giving out 50% of their last drawn salary for six months which she said should be ceiling about $500 per month.&nbsp; I am not sure we want to support this, instead of making sure people have jobs like&nbsp;the Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp; Because I would also caution the Government against taking on&nbsp;her suggestion,&nbsp;as it may lead us down the slippery slope of unemployment benefits, welfarism and of course something like what we call the dole scheme in the West.&nbsp;So imagine what this would do to our&nbsp;workers, in terms of their mentality and psyche as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globally, this crisis is the consequence of&nbsp; an era of easy credit, indebtedness, instant gratification and living beyond one's means.&nbsp; For example, the sub-prime crisis and the&nbsp;Ninja loans in the US.&nbsp; But this crunch actually stems from a deeper moral and spiritual matter.&nbsp; At stake, is a virtue&nbsp;which capitalism depends on, that is thrift.&nbsp; The main reason we are in this situation&nbsp; is that people have lost their sense of&nbsp;thrift.&nbsp; In Samuel Smiles book titled "Thrift", it is mentioned that thrift is the daughter of prudence, the sister of temperance and the mother of liberty.&nbsp; From the economic perspective, thrift begets capital, which begets prosperity</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has mentioned that,&nbsp;"this Budget is not ungenerous,&nbsp; nor overly generous".&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1813<p>Indeed, it is a natural law, you cannot both overspend and save at the same time.&nbsp; We would not have been able to afford this Budget if the Government had not been prudent and frugal.&nbsp; Financial prudence and thrift are part and parcel of our&nbsp;public expenditure. &nbsp;Frugality will prevail in public finance far into our future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of why we have to dip into our past reserves brought up by Member Mr Low Thia Khiang again, I feel that Mr Low should be happy that we do have reserves to dip into.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;the result of a hardworking and honest Government that has seen us through many previous recessions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the Budget package has been announced and the monies are about to be disbursed, it calls on everyone, every family and&nbsp; every company to do the right thing,&nbsp;ie, the practice of thrift and prudence, compassion and empathy.&nbsp; This encompasses the ideals of hard work, financial prudence and generosity. Thrift leads us to use all we have in the wisest way to promote thriving.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget will test Singaporeans' adaptability, how companies can negotiate changes and innovate, how professionals can learn from conversion courses. It calls on us to reflect on what our wants and&nbsp;needs are.&nbsp; Strict financial planning for yourself and your families.&nbsp; Live within your means.&nbsp; Waste not, want not and always put something aside for a rainy day.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these seem so familiar to me.&nbsp; Coming from a family with very modest background, I did voluntary community work&nbsp;during school breaks to fend my restless teenage energy, whilst my friends went on overseas holidays&nbsp;and on shopping sprees.&nbsp; In fact, this service to the community sparked my involvement in humanitarian work, serving humanity on a global scale today.&nbsp; Indeed serving humanity is the best work of my life and <p align=left>Column: 1814<p>thrift is not a brake on your dreams, excellence, ambition, promotion, success and reaching out to others.&nbsp; Ignite your imagination and creativity and learn to think out of the box during these challenging times.&nbsp; Do not be negative and do not feel down.&nbsp; It is not how badly things turn out for you so much as how you respond to them that is important.&nbsp; We can use this period of crisis to come out more into the community.&nbsp; Spare some time to volunteer your services, build your networks and for those who have lost their jobs, we may be able to help put you&nbsp; in touch with our community outreach programmes and job placement programmes.&nbsp; You may just find a job through networking with others.&nbsp; The positive influence you create on people is something which cannot be measured in dollar and cents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCBC has done a survey on the top dreams and wishes of Singaporeans.&nbsp; Last year, the top three dreams and wishes were: (1)&nbsp;seeing the world; (2)&nbsp;self improvement; and (3)&nbsp;making money.&nbsp; Not surprising.&nbsp; This year, the top three wishes are: (1) starting families; (2) settling down; and&nbsp;(3) buying a home.&nbsp; It certainly highlights the return to core values of family, kinship and human relationship.&nbsp; How these have changed in a span of just a year!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this Budget, Madam, the question we have to ask ourselves is not whether our Government is too big or too small but ask whether it works, whether it helps families, whether it helps create and fund jobs, whether it cares and whether it helps citizens plan a retirement which is dignified.&nbsp; The small red dot has a strong brand name and a big heart, and at its core will be&nbsp;the ethos of thrift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>In Malay</i>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2009/20090204/20090204VS_115424.pdf"">Appendix A</a>*.</I>]&nbsp;&nbsp;This year&rsquo;s Budget is the biggest ever. It requires Singapore to dip into the national reserves. This shows that Singapore is in <p align=left>Column: 1815<p>a good position to overcome the economic crisis, and we have enough savings that we can give away.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wisdom of making preparations for difficult times, for example through the practice of frugality and savings, is an approach that is often emphasized by the Government. &nbsp;Hence, for the Malay/Muslim community, I would like to ask them to always instil in themselves the habit of being frugal, and to be flexible during this economic downturn.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to use this period of downturn to attend "Smart Spending" programmes, and learn ways to reduce unnecessary spending.

The era of the iron rice bowl is over.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Budget focuses on workers and jobs, although there are those who hope for more cash handouts. The Government&rsquo;s thrust to save jobs is the correct action because without jobs, how will the families support themselves? With jobs, these families can pay for their daily expenses and livelihood.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1816<p>The investment on children&rsquo;s education cannot be compromised, and for those who cannot afford it, the Government has many schemes to help them with regard to their children&rsquo;s education.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government also gave assurances that those in need will receive help, including the low-income, elderly, the sick and those unable to work, through the programmes that were announced.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help is also given to those retrenched, including through training programmes that will prepare them for other jobs.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, no matter how much is done by the Government, it is up to the individual to work hard and stay committed to overcome this crisis. Our community has overcome many challenges before this, and is able to move forward. I believe that they possess a lot of resilience in facing this economic crisis.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1855-1858.<BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I have&nbsp;often read such curt replies.&nbsp; Some seem to imply that the agencies believe&nbsp;that Singaporeans are lying unless they can prove otherwise.&nbsp; It need not be so.&nbsp; Why not give the benefit of the doubt for the offence?&nbsp; In such instances, the agency <p align=left>Column: 1818<p>can be more sympathetic because a stiff fine definitely hurts, even worse, a licence revoked&nbsp;&ndash; all affecting&nbsp;incomes and livelihood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not take a leaf from ComCare support?&nbsp; ComCare works on the principle that the grassroots know the ground situation better.&nbsp; Without direct contact and communication, Government officers sitting in their offices may not be able to fully appreciate the circumstances and needs of the families and individuals.&nbsp; As such, in instances when officers have to make a judgment call, why not be generous in compassion or set up a system where people closer to the situation can be relied upon for an additional view or judgment, just like the roles the grassroots leaders play in the delivery of ComCare support.&nbsp; In these difficult economic times, we can perhaps be more forgiving and try to go out of our way to be more understanding and sympathetic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time to bring more heart to policies and manuals.&nbsp; Our civil servants are known to be smart, tackling issues in a logical fashion.&nbsp; Brain power is never lacking.&nbsp; But it is often said that in any campaign, you need to win the hearts and minds of individuals if you want to succeed.&nbsp; So, I think that this is the time to go about one's responsibilities&nbsp;with a heart.&nbsp; Even if you have been burnt before, go about doing things with a heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jobs Credit Scheme is an ingenuous arrangement that preserves the CPF contributions which many Singaporeans depend on for their mortgage payments while, at the same time, saves costs and conserves cash flow for the employers.&nbsp; It helps keep more people in their jobs, with experience and tenure intact, ready for the time when demand returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another uniquely Singapore scheme is the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme, which encourages workers to find and stay at work while, at <p align=left>Column: 1819<p>the same time, helping them to save for their longer term needs.&nbsp; However, the good intentions of these two schemes may be negated somewhat, if we continue to rely entirely on the tender system and outsourcing of work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the example of cleaning contracts.&nbsp; Every time it is tendered, the price drops.&nbsp; Even as the new contractor takes over the workers, he needs to find ways to reduce his costs as he has invariably tendered a lower price to win the contract.&nbsp; Guess what gives?&nbsp; The worker gets paid a lower salary to do the same work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has set a good example with the Job Redesign so that certain work could command a higher pay.&nbsp; But more needs to be done.&nbsp; Here, the Government has opportunities to set a leading example.&nbsp; I know this is but one example.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are, without doubt, merits in outsourcing and the tender system, but the evaluation must be more sophisticated, taking into consideration whether succumbing to the allure of short-term cost savings would lead to longer term problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us face it.&nbsp; Value creation is with the businesses.&nbsp; Job creation is with the businesses.&nbsp; The Administration must make it easier for businesses to operate.&nbsp; Having bonuses pegged to GDP growth is already an indication that our leaders believe that growth is one key indicator of performance.&nbsp; However, many in the civil service may still not fully appreciate this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to give you an example.&nbsp; But&nbsp;let first me declare a conflict as it concerns&nbsp;one of the companies that I have responsibility for.&nbsp; I only heard the details after&nbsp;the dust has settled.&nbsp; We were merrily operating from land owned and leased from one Government agency.&nbsp; Then the land was transferred to another Government agency.&nbsp; With that stroke of <p align=left>Column: 1820<p>the pen, costs increased.&nbsp; Moreover, we were told that we should consider ourselves lucky as, in normal circumstances, we would have to vacate the land, make good to original conditions and then re-establish ourselves once the ownership changes between the two Government agencies have taken effect.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality, what has happened?&nbsp; The land title changed from one agency to another and costs to the businesses increased.&nbsp; In this instance, where has value been created?&nbsp; At the end of the day, the company was practically "bullied" into complying.&nbsp; I used the word "bullied" figuratively as I do not, for a moment, believe that it was the leaders' intent but the execution has gone awry.&nbsp; Here, straightforward, single-minded adherence to manuals and policies would not suffice.&nbsp; It is to be infused with a strong dose of the appropriate culture and spirit.&nbsp; It is the entire mindset that people bring along while executing their work that counts.&nbsp; It is the awareness of what is&nbsp;the end game that counts.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not&nbsp;one agency showing better performance, regardless of its impact on others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are more examples but bear with me with just one more.&nbsp; Another area for more Government support is the social service sector.&nbsp; SILRA Home is in my ward.&nbsp; As part of urban renewal, they move from a sprawling one-storey complex to a modern high-rise building sited on a land footprint a fraction of the land it vacated.&nbsp; Expenses increased due to maintenance of elevators and all other costs associated with a high-rise building.&nbsp; However, their grant has remained stagnant.&nbsp; The officers overseeing SILRA have turned a deaf ear to their entreaties in the face of these increased costs.&nbsp; How stout a heart&nbsp;these volunteers have, before they throw in the towel?&nbsp; My message&nbsp;&ndash; please administer with a heart.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families must pull together.&nbsp; Families are the foundation stones of our society.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1821<p>There are many schemes to encourage family togetherness.&nbsp; Examples include the grant to encourage children to stay closer to parents and financial incentives to children who top up their parents and siblings' CPF accounts.&nbsp; We can do more.&nbsp; Give incentives for three-generation housing needs, for example, priority in flat application, selection queue or give a one-time incentive bonus to be used for renovation or furnishing the selected HDB flats.&nbsp; I know we have just increased the additional housing grant.&nbsp; We can enhance it some more to further nurture family cohesiveness.&nbsp; In good times and in bad, we expect families to pull together and look after one another.&nbsp; True kinship sees everyone through thick and thin.&nbsp; However, we all know that there are able but irresponsible children who neglect their parents.&nbsp; We must act for these neglected parents or this will be a further and unnecessary load on society.&nbsp; One can even argue that some parents deserve to be neglected.&nbsp; But if they are infirm and aged, should society be made to shoulder&nbsp;a disproportionate burden?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From previous debates, progress has been made.&nbsp; Leeway has been made for children who are genuinely unable to provide for their parents financially.&nbsp; But there are many who can make adjustments to their lifestyles and accommodate parent care within their means.&nbsp; They are just not willing to.&nbsp; As such, we should consider enhancing the Maintenance of Parents Act to go after these children and adjudicate that they provide not only sustenance, in terms of money, but also a roof and emotional support.&nbsp; Filial piety and caring for our&nbsp;elders is well entrenched in the value system of Asian societies.&nbsp; By no way should we allow individuals in our midst to persist in abrogating this responsibility.&nbsp; We should encourage and regulate as necessary families to take responsibility and care for their aged parents and relatives.&nbsp; This is even more important as <p align=left>Column: 1822<p>our society ages.&nbsp; This is a value that should be perpetuated, so that the young generation know that in the autumn and winter years of their lives, care is also&nbsp;readily at hand for them as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still on the subject of families, the support for single-parent families is woefully inadequate.&nbsp; While we fear that proactively reaching out to support single parents may send the wrong signal to society, this group of people do need help, especially the single mothers struggling to look after young children.&nbsp; We are probably not totally sympathetic to whatever may have led them to their circumstances, but the problem at hand still needs solutions.&nbsp; I hope we could devote a portion of the Budget and reach out to them.&nbsp; Could we provide more support for single-parent families?&nbsp; For instance, give priority for childcare application.&nbsp; Provide subsidy for childcare services and Government-operated tuition and day care centres.&nbsp; In this instance, every Singaporean counts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many helping hands in our community&nbsp;&ndash; VWOs, self-help organisations and&nbsp;charities.&nbsp; There is a great reliance on these non-profit organisations, as they play active roles in making a difference in our community.&nbsp; The Government, too, has led the way by increasing the tax benefits for donations to IPCs.&nbsp; However, these NGOs can benefit from further Government support.&nbsp; For example, the Government can help provide limited rent-free period for facilities.&nbsp; The Government can allocate or second some human resources at no charge to help kick-start an initiative or simply be the extra hands to get through the day-to-day operations.&nbsp; This will not only help reduce operating costs of these NGOs but also indirectly help the Government "supervise" and understand the activities of the organisations and enhance management.&nbsp; We really need not only send in the cavalry only when there are problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1823<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping people employed is the key tenet of the Jobs Credit Scheme.&nbsp; However, we know that we cannot avoid retrenchments as decreasing demand will impact some companies.&nbsp; There will be hardships and we need to expedite whatever help we can.&nbsp; The solution is, of course, training and new jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the short run, easing the cash flow for people affected adversely by job dislocations would be a great relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I hope that there is no additional hardship imposed by agencies withholding services, for example,&nbsp;utilities.&nbsp; In such difficult financial times, every bit of help counts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am confident that Singapore will come out of this recession stronger.&nbsp; This is because Singaporeans would have rallied and supported each other through this crisis.&nbsp; We are benefitting from the hard work and prudence of prior generations in that we now have reserves that will tide us through.&nbsp; And dipping into it now, actually places the responsibility on us to work even harder so that we can contribute towards replenishing it.&nbsp; Let us work together, support each other and face this challenge confidently as a mature and gracious nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7.12 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, it is late and I will be brief.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 2,000 years ago, a great Chinese philosopher said, "In calamity lies good fortune, and in good fortune lies calamity".&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a shrewd observation of human enterprise and fallibility.&nbsp; We are now witnessing the calamity lurking in the economic run which started some years back&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a run driven in large part by greed, complacency and ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are <p align=left>Column: 1824<p>mistakes people have made many times in the past, and are condemned to repeat again in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experts continue to debate about when this mess started,&nbsp;or who or what was responsible.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it does not change the fact that the world faces its most serious economic challenge in 60 years.&nbsp; This $20.5 billion package is a significant response.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in reality, what it does, or hopes to do, is to help us tread water until the situation becomes clearer.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows for&nbsp;sure&nbsp;how long this situation will last, how bad it will&nbsp;be and how much more it will cost the Government to keep our heads above water.&nbsp; Many predict that the Government will have to inject more funds&nbsp;in the future.&nbsp; If anything, this Budget is a sobering testimony of how vulnerable we are and the difficult times we face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as time goes on, there will be increasing calls on the Government to do more for different groups, sectors or industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen examples of this around the world.&nbsp; In the United States, different industries have argued forcefully for a share of the bailout fund, including the pornographic industry! &nbsp;But our means are not unlimited.&nbsp; The solution cannot be to throw money at every problem but to pick the right battles and the right weapons to deploy.&nbsp; In that regard, I would like to touch on one issue which the Budget does not address and that is helping Singaporeans keep their homes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me say that I support the Government's focus on helping companies and businesses stay afloat by addressing their cash flow and credit issues and, thereby, save jobs.&nbsp; Few would disagree with these objectives.&nbsp; But make no mistake, we will all face a stressful time in the coming months to hold on to our jobs.&nbsp; No industry will be immune.&nbsp; It will also not matter how senior or experienced you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am often told by&nbsp;clients that <p align=left>Column: 1825<p>this is a good time to be a lawyer,&nbsp;because when&nbsp;businesses fail, there&nbsp;is more&nbsp;legal work.&nbsp; That may have been true in previous recessions,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

Over the last few weeks, the news coming out of&nbsp;the United States and United Kingdom, including major international law firms, have been the&nbsp;thousands of redundancies of lawyers,&nbsp;including senior lawyers and even partners of major law firms.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the reality is that despite the measures being taken in Singapore and the billions of dollars other governments are injecting into their own systems, the world economy will be in decline for some time, businesses will go under and Singaporeans will lose jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More will need help.&nbsp; The Government has increased financial assistance payments to PA recipients, CCCs&rsquo; Comcare fund, GST Credits and such.&nbsp; Every bit helps and is welcome.&nbsp; Incentivising companies to retrain and retool are also important.&nbsp; But with limited opportunities, it may take time for those who have lost their jobs to find employment.&nbsp; Stress levels will go up.&nbsp; Now more than ever, we need to ease the pressure off Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, hope the Government will have plans to deal with other likely points of stress,&nbsp;and one of these will be the ability of Singaporeans to keep their homes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp;a large&nbsp;extent, we are fortunate that most Singaporeans live in HDB flats and I know from my MPS experience that HDB exercises considerable flexibility to help families that are unable to meet their loan payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But over the last few years, because of regulations, many have had to finance their purchases through commercial banks.&nbsp; We also cannot ignore the large numbers who live in private properties.&nbsp; They may not have the option <p align=left>Column: 1826<p>of downgrading because their loans exceed the value of their homes or they may not be able to get a loan to&nbsp;buy an alternative home.&nbsp; If they are retrenched and unable to service their mortgage, foreclosure is a serious risk.&nbsp; And a spate of foreclosures and&nbsp;forced sales will only&nbsp;depress the property markets, put more loans at risk and therefore more homes at risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of ways the Government can help.&nbsp; For example, easing the current restrictions on obtaining HDB loans, allow those with commercial bank loans to refinance with the HDB, impose a moratorium period on foreclosures, require banks to restructure default loans, including offering interest-only payments for a specified period of time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other countries have&nbsp;and are planning schemes &ndash; the HOPE for Homeowners programme in the US; the Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme in the UK.&nbsp; These programmes are calibrated to meet the challenges in their&nbsp;own&nbsp;countries, but the objectives are largely&nbsp;the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Government to come up with and announce concrete plans as soon as possible so that&nbsp;they can be implemented quickly if needed, and Singaporeans will&nbsp;know sooner&nbsp;what the conditions are to qualify for help.&nbsp; It would be a major source of stress relief to know that the Government will help and it keep a roof over our heads until the storm passes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not suggesting that the Government bails out everyone who defaults on a mortgage.&nbsp; There should of course be restrictions.&nbsp; For example, it should only be for those with one home; the inability to pay should be on account of the current economic downturn; it should not apply to those who still have the ability to downgrade, albeit at a loss.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1827<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also accept that we cannot ignore the "moral hazard" arguments, and that public funds should not be used to bail out bad decisions or risky behaviour.&nbsp; So the Government's role should not be just to hand-out money but to clearly articulate, its principles and philosophy and to ensure that the measures it implements&nbsp; is consistently these.&nbsp; One important message that must be convey is that this exercise is a two-way process.&nbsp; While it is the Government's duty to offer assistance where it is needed those who ask for or receive help must also take positive steps to get themselves back on their feet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My concern is that some, despite losing their jobs, will not see the need to get back quickly into the market, preferring to wait for work which is similar or equivalent to the one they have&nbsp;lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time they could be in for a very long wait.&nbsp; I have encountered too many cases like these in my MPS, it is a real problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also those who are able to work, but are not inclined to because they are able to just get by on the assistance they receive.&nbsp; I understand from the CDCs that a large number of job seekers are classified as "not job-ready" or "near job-ready", meaning that, in some cases, they are not prepared to accept work that is offered them because&nbsp;of inconveniences like shift work.&nbsp; One CDC officer told me that one out of every 10 job seekers it helps,&nbsp;only&nbsp;one is "job-ready".&nbsp; The overwhelming majority are not.&nbsp; And some live in rental flats, which means they receive large subsidies.&nbsp; I understand that although they reject suitable job opportunities, they continue to enjoy these subsidies.&nbsp; So this connect does not make any sense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to send a strong message that we cannot afford the luxury of being <p align=left>Column: 1828<p>selective, not in these times.&nbsp; We need all hands&nbsp;to the pump to keep our&nbsp;economy afloat even if it means making&nbsp;or compromise or personal sacrifices in the short- or medium-term.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, urge the Government to re-examine the way it gives assistance.&nbsp; It is important to incentivise people to find work with programmes like WIS.&nbsp; It is equally important to address those who ask for or get assistance but refuse to help themselves for no good reason.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, there is one significant difference between our fiscal measures and those announced by some of the major developed nations.&nbsp; We are in a position to call on reserves, while they intend to fund programs by borrowing and make future generations pick up the tab.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As times get tougher there will be more pressure on the Government to spend.&nbsp; Many economic experts and lay persons alike will have different ideas on how much to spend, what to spend it on and where to get the money from.&nbsp; The Government may have to take tough unpopular measures.&nbsp; But being tough alone does not mean that you are right.&nbsp;&nbsp; That takes intelligence, experience and mature judgment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our reserves are there because of the hard work of earlier generations of Singaporeans, coupled with sound and prudent management and leadership.&nbsp; Now, more than ever we need the Government to exhibit those qualities.&nbsp; The problems we and other countries faced are exceeding volatile, exceeding complex.&nbsp; They will not be solved by spending some money here&nbsp;or&nbsp;some money there.&nbsp; We are in this for the long haul.&nbsp; The measures we implement have to be sound and steady.&nbsp; They also have to be flexible to meet new and unexpected challenges.&nbsp; This budget is evidence of that measured, mature approach.&nbsp; Hopefully it will put us on the <p align=left>Column: 1829<p>path to find good fortune in these times of calamity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support it.</p></span></div><!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS--><!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE--><p align=left>Column: 1829<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE:::1830--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
