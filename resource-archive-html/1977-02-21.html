<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>ILLEGAL TRAWLING IN SERANGOON RIVER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND THE JOHORE STRAITS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and Communications whether he is aware of

illegal  trawling  with  boats  powered  by  outboard

motors  in the Serangoon River and the Johore Straits

which  is  seriously  affecting  the  livelihood   of

fishermen in the area, and what steps he proposes  to

take to safeguard the livelihood of those fishermen.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Primary Production Department is aware  of

the  illegal  trawling activities  in  the  Serangoon

River  and  Johore  Straits. The  Primary  Production

Department with the assistance of the Marine  Police,

have been conducting enforcement action in this area.

In  1976, the  Department conducted a  total  of  55

operations.  Four persons were arrested  for  illegal

trawling  along the Straits of Johore over  the  last

three   months,  and  legal  proceedings  are   being

instituted against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a deterrent measure, the Fisheries Act was

amended  in  1973 to provide mandatory jail  sentence

for illegal trawlers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department will continue to operate enforcement

patrols against the illegal trawlers.

<div align="center"><b>OTTER TRAWLING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Expansion of)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and Communications what measures  he

proposes to take to encourage the expansion of otter

trawling and if his Ministry will consult with the

Ministry  of Defence with a view to stepping  up

patrols by the Republic of Singapore Navy to protect

our otter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



trawling fleet from harassment by pirates on the high

seas in the vicinity of Horsburgh Lighthouse.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, otter trawling

is  one  of  the  methods  of  fishing  used  by  our

fishermen. The Primary Production Department is  also

encouraging  the  fishermen to use other  methods  of

fishing. However, the expansion of otter trawling  is

limited  due  to the lack of fishing ground  and  the

lack  of interest among our youths to take up fishing

as they do not like the difficult life at sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department used to run a

Fisheries Training School with UNDP assistance.  From

a survey conducted on more than 100 trainees who have

completed  a one-year training course, only  8%  were

found  to  be employed on board fishing vessels.  The

Training  School  has  been discontinued  since  June

1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department maintains close

liaison  with the Republic of Singapore Navy and  the

Marine  Police  on  the  protection  of  our  fishing

vessels  against  piracy.  Naval  vessels  have  been

deployed  to  conduct  anti-piracy  patrols  in   the

vicinity  of Horsburgh Lighthouse. This has  resulted

in  a reduction in the number of piracy incidents  in

the  area. In 1975, there were 25 reported harassment

cases. In 1976, only seven cases were reported.

<div align="center"><b>KANGKAR FISH MARKET</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Expansion of)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and Communications what are the plans for

the expansion of the Kangkar fish market.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the expansion

and  development plan of the Kangkar Fish  Market  is

affected  by  a proposal to widen and lengthen  Upper

Serangoon Road across Sungei Serangoon to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



link up with the realigned Tampines Road. Because  of

this,   the   Primary   Production   Department    is

considering long term plans to resite the fish market

to another locality in Punggol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, what are the long

term plans, and when will such resiting take place?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the long term plans have not

really  been drawn up yet at this stage. It is merely

a  plan to resite the existing fish market, and  this

is likely to take place in or after 1980.

<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Fourth Day)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [14th February, 1977].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the Speech of

the President be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express  our thanks to the President for  the  Speech

which he delivered on behalf of the Government at the

opening  of  the First Session Of this Parliament.".'-[Dr

Chiang Hai Ding].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have the dubious honour of bridging the years of  the

Dragon and the Snake. Fortunately, being a Dragon.  I

have no reason to be afraid of Snakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we last adjourned I was speaking about the

economic  difficulties in the advanced countries.  To

recapitulate  briefly, there seems to  be  a  slowing

down  of  technological innovations  which  fuel  the

engine  of  economic  growth.  Secondly,  the   aging

population structure in the industrial countries  has

altered  the pattern of demand, necessitating  rather

painful and difficult changes in production patterns.

Thirdly, there is the energy crisis which will  bring

about  escalating costs of energy resulting in  lower

standards of living and contributing to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



inflation.  I might add two other important  factors.

One was raised by the President in his Address and by

the  Prime  Minister's Addendum. This refers  to  the

excessive  cushioning of life by state  subsidies  to

the  point  where incentives for work and  enterprise

are seriously eroded, with disastrous consequences in

terms   of   unemployment,  inflation   and   falling

standards of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth factor contributing to the economic

malaise of the industrial countries is that of  over-education,  referred to by the hon.  Member  for  Ulu

Pandan.  Over  half  the 18-year  old  males  in  the

advanced  countries are receiving college  education.

And college graduates usually look for administrative

and  managerial jobs. Rapid economic growth up to the

end  of the sixties brought the job opportunities and

the  incentives for higher education. But the era  of

rapid  growth is over unless new cheap energy sources

are    discovered.   Consequently,   executives   and

managerial positions are difficult to come by. At the

same   time,  blue-collar  jobs  go  a-begging.  This

naturally  creates further problems of adjustment  in

the industrial countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessons for us are painfully clear. Our

educational   system  must  be  geared  to   economic

realities. In an era of sluggish economic growth,  we

shall  only  be  creating  more  frustrations  if  we

produce graduates for whom few jobs are available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, President Carter has announced a fiscal

stimulation   package   of  US$31   billion   to   be

implemented over two years. At the same time,  he  is

urging the Japanese and the West Germans to stimulate

their  economies  simultaneously. Unfortunately,  the

severe winter in America has disrupted production and

increased  fuel bills, thereby diluting the  economic

stimulus  of the tax cut. Moreover, in my  view,  the

fiscal measures will stimulate more consumption  than

investment.  Hon.  Members may  know  that  Keynesian

economists  believe that a tax cut  and/or  increased

government   expenditure  will  produce  growth   and

employment. A tax cut,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



for   example,   makes   more  money   available   to

individuals  who will spend some of it and  save  the

rest.  Their spending will stimulate more production,

both  directly and via a multiplier effect. Factories

therefore can utilize more of their capacity  and  at

the  same  time  employ more people. Those  factories

operating  at  full  capacity are  supposed  to  have

incentive   for  expanding  their  operations,   thus

providing  more  jobs.  But  I  do  not  believe   in

Keynesian  economics. The main stimulus to investment

comes  from technological innovations which  open  up

new    frontiers    of   profitable    opportunities.

Investments  in  these new areas  in  turn  stimulate

investments in the established industries through the

input-output relationship where one factory buys  its

requirements from other factories and in  turn  sells

to others. Unfortunately we know too little about the

processes    of    technological   innovations    and

governments  of the advanced countries have  not  yet

identified  this to be a priority area of  attention.

Consequently,  I expect that, while growth  rates  in

the  industrial countries can be marginally improved,

unemployment and inflation will continue to be severe

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems in store for us are threefold. First of

all,  it will be harder for us to attract new foreign

investments   as  unemployment  conditions   in   the

advanced   countries  will  deter  capital   outflow,

witnessed already by the vast volume of literature on

multinational    corporations,    especially    those

emanating  from  the  trade unions  in  the  advanced

countries  where they are very much against  the  so-called  export  of jobs and technology to  developing

countries  while  we  can  expect  the  pressures  to

increase. Secondly, we may find it more difficult  to

export our goods if industrial countries raise  their

trade  barriers  to  protect  their  own  employment.

Already  we  have seen the imposition of barriers  by

the   European   Common  Market  on  our   electronic

calculators. This is a harbinger of things  to  come.

Thirdly, higher   energy   costs    mean    higher

transportation  costs. Our imports  and  our  exports

incur  transportation  charges.  Therefore,  for  all

three  reasons, we  must expect to  work  harder  to

maintain and, if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



possible, to improve our standards of living.  Either

we   take   the   question  of  raising  productivity

seriously  and  urgently or we may find  unemployment

and erosion in our standards of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the imperative of raising

productivity  we  need  greater  efforts  in   export

promotion.  Export  financing is being  provided  but

other  areas  like  marketing,  product  development,

advertising and more importantly, after-sales service

should  be carefully studied. Further diversification

into  new  markets  like West Asia and  expansion  of

markets in the ASEAN region will be helpful to reduce

our  vulnerability. However, we can only maintain our

competitive  edge by producing products and  services

of high quality at low cost and with the proper after-sales  service. But if our manufacturers have only  a

very  limited time horizon and are interested in one-shot  deals  and one-shot sales, then of course  they

will  continue to market goods which are inferior  in

quality  and  will  not  bother  to  look  after  the

consumers once they have sold their products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage greater investment in manufacturing we

should  examine  the  incentives  for  expansion  and

diversification of existing industries. Since we  are

going  to  find it harder to attract new  industries,

this  seems  to  be  a logical thing  to  look  into.

Furthermore,  we  need  to  examine  what  additional

technical   and   supporting  facilities   Government

agencies  can offer to stimulate private development,

especially in those areas of industry where they find

it  very  expensive  to buy and  maintain  their  own

testing equipment and calibration equipment.  But  if

such  equipment can be provided by Government it will

certainly help to stimulate such industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance emphasized further

development  of  manufacturing  but  perhaps  in  the

protectionist  era  that we are entering,  we  should

examine  the feasibility of developing other  service

industries  to  ensure  reasonable  growth  and  full

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Ministries usually inform this

House of new programmes but we hear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



too  little by way of progress reports and  objective

evaluation  of  the  success  or  failure   of   such

programmes,  for  the  Annual  Reports  submitted  by

Ministries and Statutory Boards are not of much  help

as  they  usually  present glowing accounts  and  not

critical  analyses of work done by their agencies.  I

submit  that what we need is more critical monitoring

of what goes on.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the President in his

policy  speech  delivered  at  the  opening  of  this

Parliament said that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Government has the highest number of votes.

This    vote   of   confidence   imposes   a    heavy

responsibility  on  my Ministers to  act  fairly  but

firmly. My Government will exercise its authority  to

govern with circumspection and moderation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple message has alleviated the fears of the

people,  because  during the General  Elections  they

heard  a lot of empty promises made by the Opposition

parties and a lot of criticisms have been levelled at

the  People's  Action Party. Yet the  electorate  was

intelligent enough to decide to support the  People's

Action  Party.  However, there are  some  people  who

worry  about  the eventuality that once  the  PAP  is

elected  with full backing of the voters and  with  a

higher  percentage of votes this might result in  the

PAP  Government  being complacent and will  therefore

neglect the wishes, and needs of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from the policy speech delivered by the

President,  it is clear that the PAP Government  will

strive for excellence and will not be complacent over

its  achievements, nor will it abandon or neglect the

people. The President also gave a piece of advice  to

the  Government that the authority of the  Government

derives from the people and the Government should  be

concerned with the people's welfare and interests and

that  in exercising its power it should see that  the

people's  interests are placed above  all  else.  The

greater  the  support  given to the  Government,  the

greater will be the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



responsibility of the Government. Therefore,  whether

they be Ministers or Members of Parliament are in the

service  of  the Government, they must set  the  good

example  of  doing their best and in utilising  their

talent  and  attributes  to  carry  out  Government's

policies,  they  should  always  be  mindful  of  the

interests  and wishes of the people. They should  try

to  understand  the difficulties  and  needs  of  the

people. A Minister should not only be concerned  with

his  own Ministry or Constituency but should also  be

concerned  with the well being of all the  people  of

Singapore.  As  soon as any anomaly or aberration  is

discovered,  he  must  see that  the  civil  servants

rectify it as soon as possible. For the sake  of  the

nation  and  the  people,  the  Ministers  must   not

hesitate to admit their errors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a Member representing the

rural  areas.  It is therefore my duty to  voice  the

opinions,  the problems and the needs  of  the  rural

people. In the last few years the people in the rural

areas  faced various problems. Their needs also  have

to  be satisfied. Our country is a rapidly developing

one, attaching great importance to major problems  of

improvement  and  development. This has  resulted  in

neglecting  the problems in the rural  areas  or  its

importance lessened. A lot of problems in  the  rural

areas  have  therefore been shelved resulting  in  an

increase  in  the  number  of  problems  rather  than

reducing  it  because  of the need  for  development.

Therefore,  when  Members of Parliament  representing

the  rural  areas raise the same problems and  needs,

they  are  regarded  as being conservative  in  their

thinking.  This is because the problems in the  rural

areas  have not been solved, and not because the  MPs

are stubborn and conservative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last few years, there were

developments  and  modernisation  in  many   spheres.

According  to my observation, there must  be  special

development programmes to institute modern  amenities

in   the   rural  areas  to  compensate   for   their

backwardness and to bridge the gap between the  urban

areas and the rural areas. The Government should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



consider  the early implementation of this scheme.  I

feel that in order to effectively tackle the problems

of  the rural areas a Rural Affairs Bureau should  be

set  up  by  the  Government  to  help  tackle  their

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to say that in the

various  Addenda  there  is no  mention  of  any  new

programmes  or  any  projects for  the  provision  of

modern amenities for the rural areas. Our rural areas

are   still  quite  extensive  and  quite   a   large

proportion of our population live in the rural areas.

So  it  is the duty of the Government to do something

for the people in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some suggestions to make for the

consideration  of  the Government.  Firstly,  in  the

field  of  education, schools in the rural areas  are

very  small and poorly equipped. The teaching of  the

second  language cannot reach the required  standard.

If  this situation is not rectified, then the  pupils

from  the  rural schools who receive unequal training

will not be able to compete fairly with children from

the urban schools in future. Why does the Ministry of

Education  not  consider this and try to  solve  this

problem?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is the problem of public transport.

Most  of the rural people live in areas quite removed

from  the major roads, some three or four miles away.

They do not possess their own transport. They are  in

dire  need of public transport service in their daily

travel. If we approach this question fairly, we  will

see  that the rural people have the greatest need for

a  public transport service. However, the Ministry of

Communications has not done anything about it. Why is

this so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the field of public construction, most

of  the  rural  people are engaged in farming  for  a

livelihood. They have to carry their farm produce  to

the city and elsewhere and bring back fertilisers and

other  supplies. They are therefore in pressing  need

of  good  public roads to facilitate their  transport

needs.  With good roads, they will be able  to  raise

the price of their produce and reduce their cost.  As

it  is  the  maintenance of roads in the rural  areas

depends only on the very meagre annual allocation  of

funds by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



Urban  and Rural Services Committee. If the  Ministry

of National Development does not amend the scheme,  I

would  ask  when  will  road  construction  works  be

completed in the rural areas?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, primary production. Many farmers in the

Republic  have been affected by resettlement schemes.

They  are  asked to leave their farm land  which  the

Government intends to develop. But the Government has

not  been able to help them in a satisfactory way and

so  they have to give up their farming activities  in

which  they  are good at in search of  new  means  of

livelihood. No doubt, the Government has allocated  a

piece  of  land in the Punggol area for pig  rearing,

but  it  is  to be operated on a large scale.  Small-scale farmers would not therefore have any chance  to

participate in the pig-rearing enterprise. Thus, they

have to give up and look for other outlet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to vegetable farmers, the Government has

not  been able to give them alternative land, and  so

they  are forced to give up their farming occupation.

For  example,  in  my  Constituency, many  vegetable

gardeners  have  been asked to leave.  They  will  be

evicted  and they are worried about their  future.  I

feel that vegetable gardeners have contributed a  lot

to  the food supplies of our people. The Ministry  of

National  Development should help them and give  them

alternative land so that they can continue with their

usual  vegetable gardening. I am sorry to  note  that

the Ministry of National Development does not seem to

think so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, on the relationship between the civil

servants  and the rural people. Rural people  lack  a

knowledge  of Government administration or the  setup

of  Government Departments. They are straightforward.

honest, practical and pragmatic. Therefore, they  are

quite   ignorant  of  and  worried  about  Government

processes  and the notices which are given  to  them.

They are at a loss over these matters. Civil servants

also  lack an understanding of the rural people. They

do things by the rule and they follow instructions to

the letter. Therefore, there exist a lot of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



misunderstanding  and  dissatisfaction  between   the

rural  people  and certain civil servants.  In  fact,

civil servants should exercise certain flexibility in

implementing Government policies or measures so as to

achieve  greater  effectiveness.  According   to   my

observation   over  the  years,  in  their   official

dealings  with the people in the rural  areas,  civil

servants have been very rigid in their attitude, very

lacking  in  humane sentiment. Therefore,  the  rural

people find it difficult to take and are disappointed

with  the Government. The crux of the problem is that

the  civil  servants  lack an  understanding  of  the

problems of rural areas and special training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the problems which I have mentioned

above have not been satisfactorily solved for a  long

time  neither  has there been a systematic  plan  for

solution.  I  feel that this is because  the  various

Ministries are busy with their own important business

and  therefore neglecting the minor problems  of  the

rural  areas. I therefore feel that if the Government

can  establish a special department to  give  special

assistance  to  the various departments  in  tackling

rural problems, greater achievement will te obtained.

Sir, I support the motion thanking the President.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Song):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the motion thanking the President for

the speech he delivered on 8th February on behalf  of

the  Government. It was an excellent speech with  the

message  loud and clear; an instructive address  with

lots  of  punch and purpose, caution and exhortation.

Aptly.  Singaporeans expected no less. This is  after

all  a  no-nonsense  political  leadership  that  has

enjoyed and continues to enjoy the fullest confidence

of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the President's Address and the

various  Addenda. I must confess that  I  found  very

little  to quarrel with. The plan of action  for  the

various  Ministries for the next five years takes  us

further on the road of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



nation-building to make Singapore a more just  and  a

more  equal  society. I have no doubts that,  barring

developments beyond our control, we shall succeed  if

we  continue  as a nation to show grit,  stamina  and

hard work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Prime Minister's Office

emphasised  the  philosophy of the  Government:  that

rewards must be correlated with work, that excellence

should be rewarded and honoured in order that all can

benefit from the exceptional talents of the few, that

the  talented few should not be punished  to  satisfy

the doctrinal follies of the even fewer. We hold true

the  traditional Asian precept, "From each his  best,

to  each  his worth". It follows therefore  that  any

flirtation with unrealistic doctrines is an  exercise

to kill human motivation and genius. At the same time

the  Government  declared that it commits  itself  to

help the needy through better education and health so

that  all  men  and  women are equal  in  health  and

opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our philosophy reflects a deep understanding of the

human nature, the id and the ego. We seek to motivate

man  to  better himself to work hard,  to  reach  for

excellence in return for what he is worth, We see  no

virtue in dogma or doctrinaire politics, and we  find

the  heavy-handed  practice  in  some  countries   to

methodically    destroy   man   and   his    familiar

surroundings  to recreate a new man, an  unacceptable

and unnecessarily expensive exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP, I am sure, shall continue to govern with

circumspection and moderation, to jealously guard our

national  interests,  to reject unhealthy  influences

that do us no good. To progress and to move ahead  we

must  continue to selectively imbibe relevant factors

of  other societies, Western, Japanese or Chinese and

"incorporate  these factors into our  system  without

damage to ourselves".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note with great interest the amount of debate and

discussion  the President's address has generated  in

this  House  over the last week. I am also  extremely

encouraged  by the favourable response of the  public

to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



first  session  of the fourth Parliament.  Obviously,

Sir,  MPs have taken note of the President's  clarion

call "to ensure that all shades of opinion out in the

constituencies are vigorously voiced in Parliamentary

questions and debates. No major policy or legislation

should  be  passed without the closest scrutiny,  and

passed after the most thorough debate".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear to me as if Chairman Mao's call:

"Let  a  hundred  flowers  blossom,  and  a  thousand

schools of thought contend" has come to town at last.

This  time we are happily reassured by the Leader  of

the House that no heads will roll as a consequence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you know, unaccustomed as I am to scratching

another's back, I must however give due credit to Dr Toh Chin Chye, Minister for Health and -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Ong, I wish you would refer to the

hon. Member by his designation rather than his name.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Yes, Sir, I must give due credit

to  the  hon.  Member for Rochore  and  Minister  for

Health  who  first  spoke  out  for  more  debate  in

23rd December, 1976

his press interview after winning the Elections. That

night,  I  think the hon. Member spoke his mind.  The

rest, as you know, is now history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It was in the morning of 24th

December.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, we are a one-party

Parliament  through no fault of the PAP.  As  one  of

many    nations    with   constitutionally    elected

governments, Singapore is unique in having  a  first-rate  Government but an appalling collection of  non-viable  opposition  parties outside  Parliament  that

wake  up every fifth year. The real opposition walked

out  of  this House in 1963 and took to the  streets.

And  lest  they  be forgotten, we are constantly  and

painstakingly  reminded  that  they  are  very   much

around. And indeed they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAP Backbenchers are now expected to assume the role

of the Parliamentary opposition: to debate issues, to

air



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



grievances, to check and balance government action or

inaction, to provide the forum for the government  to

explain and justify its policies and implementations.

This,  of course, presupposes that Ministers will  co

operate  in the right spirit: to invite comments,  to

accept criticisms, to concede when necessary and,  of

course,  to  take praise graciously where  credit  is

due.  The intention here should not be for one  party

to score points over the other, but to complement the

functions of each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, let conscience be our guide. The task ahead is

not  exactly  an easy one, and it is not likely  that

all  MPs  can  fulfil  this  role  successfully.  The

outspoken  Backbencher  will  certainly  not  win   a

popularity  poll  amongst Ministers and,  conversely,

the  aggressive,  short-tempered,  arrogant  Minister

will  find  himself  sipping  coffee  alone  in   the

Members' Room next door. The challenge, as I see  it,

is  to  develop  the art of Minister-bashing  without

tears  and to do it in such a way that Ministers  ask

for more of the same!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone to some length on this subject because I

feel  that this is an extremely important matter that

demands  the  attention of all. I salute the  leaders

who  call  for  greater debate so that different  and

indeed divergent views can contend. I think it  would

be  suicidal  for the PAP and for this Government  to

continue  to  think that Singaporeans  would  readily

accept  as gospel truth without question, any  action

or policy of the Government, however well-intentioned

it  may be; and that every five years the same  party

would be returned full-house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore prospers, as more and more people are

educated  with  increasing  political  awareness  and

sophistication,  and as the basic  needs  like  food,

shelter,  jobs  and education are  attended  to,  the

battle  for  people's hearts and  allegiance  is  won

through   the   minds;  using   reason,   logic   and

persuasion.  In  the  words  of  Shakespeare,   "Your

gentleness  will move me more than force move  me  to

gentleness".  It  shall,  I  feel,  better   insulate

Singapore against attempts to subvert government  and

people  and  I  think this new approach  would  be  a

better bet than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



no  political opportunists or gamblers come to  power

by default.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have good reasons to believe that the call for

greater  parliamentary debate is sincere,  and  well-intentioned. It is timely and it is necessary too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, therefore suggest that these same leaders now

call  for  debate  to be extended outside  Parliament

with  similar exhortations. This is a logical sequel.

We  must surely agree that there is a near total lack

of  public  debate.  People  fight  shy  of  uttering

opinions,  shun controversy for a variety of  reasons

and  I  do not propose to go into these reasons here.

They  act  as  if politics and affairs of  state  are

taboo, the prerogative of Government leaders and  MPs

alone,  The  newspapers,  radio  and  television  are

devoid  of opinions on political issues or Government

policies.  No,  it  is  not  their  business  to  get

involved in such matters. Who knows what will  happen

if  you  utter the wrong words or espouse  the  wrong

things?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems clear to me that this Government has

declared that it will not even put communists and pro-communists  behind bars if only they  will  "denounce

the CPM's use of force to seize power, and themselves

forswear    the   use   of   force   to   unseat    a

constitutionally elected government." If this is  so,

what is there to worry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, Sir, I must congratulate the hon.

Member  for Kampong Chai Chee for starting a  monthly

Meet-the-People  Forum so that his  constituents  can

raise  and thrash out any issues on Government policy

or   implementations.  Likewise   the   mass   media,

including  radio and television, civic  organisations

and  community centres can similarly serve  as  forum

for   public   debate.  MPs  and   Ministers   should

participate if invited. It would be a welcome  change

if   the  Chairman  of  the  Public  Utilities  Board

participates  in  a TV forum on PUB  charges  or  the

Minister  of  Defence arguing the case  for  national

service  for  women  on TV against  anxious  parents,

husbands  or  lovers, or indeed the hon.  Member  for

Telok Blangah



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



discussing the case for Daylight Saving in  Singapore

against  those  who  think it utterly  irrelevant  to

Singapore.



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Song):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to join hon. Members of the  House

in their support of the President's Address delivered

at  the  opening of the First Session of  the  Fourth

Tuesday, 8th February, 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President pointed out that our

Government  has a mandate to reject the  soft-headed,

pernicious policies that all the good things in life,

from bus rides to PUB charges, can be given for free,

or  otherwise to reduce the fares or charges when the

costs  are  going  up.  This applies  to  our  social

policies  which have been formulated with a  view  to

giving  a better life to our people. Whatever  social

policies  we  formulate must perforce be governed  by

our  tradition of enterprise, industry and desire for

excellence,   We   have  to  avoid   the   idealistic

philosophy   of  the  welfare  state   in   supplying

everything free to everybody who wants it from cradle

to  grave,  and  in giving a cushion  to  people  who

suffer   hardships  or  difficulties   arising   from

personal    inadequacies   irrespective   of    their

capability  or  willingness  to  make  an  effort  in

overcoming  them. No one, not even the  poor,  should

expect  to  be carried for free, expecting others  to

shoulder the burden while they sit back as passengers

unwilling to make a contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of social services, the basic social

amenities  and  services  have  already  been   well-established. Even recipients of public assistance are

being  encouraged, trained and helped along to  work,

wherever possible. The Social Welfare Department  has

already  intensified its efforts to place the  Public

Assistance  recipients, their spouses or children  in

gainful  employment. This is in  line  with  the  new

policy  of  offering  suitable  employment  to  those

Public  Assistance  recipients  who  can  work,   and

placing  those who are untrained on training schemes.

A Self-Employment Assistance Scheme to help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



Public  Assistance recipients and other poor  persons

to  be self-supporting has recently been, introduced.

Under  the  scheme, interest-free loans are  made  to

persons in need who require money as capital  to  set

themselves  up  in  their own small  businesses.  The

loans could be used, for example, to buy equipment to

set  up  a hawker stall or to buy sewing machines  so

that  tailoring orders could be accepted. The  Scheme

will  help  needy persons by instilling in  them  the

desire  for  independence and productive  living.  In

this  way,  they  will not have to  be  dependent  on

public aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the destitutes will soon be placed on a new

programme  of  work and training. The Government  has

already  approved funds to construct a  new  home  at

Chia  Keng  I for destitutes for their rehabilitative

training. The trainable destitutes will be encouraged

to acquire the work discipline and skills in order to

fit themselves into the world of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care of the aged is a problem which requires urgent

attention.  The tradition in Asian countries  is  for

the  aged to be looked after by their children,  This

is  a  laudable tradition which should be  encouraged

and   preserved.  In  Western  countries  it  is  not

uncommon to find old folks being isolated from  their

families. Some are sent to old people's homes; others

live on their own. When we visit these countries,  we

often see lonely old people sitting in the park  with

dogs  or cats as their constant companions. We should

learn  a lesson from the social experiences of  these

countries.   We  should  strengthen  our  traditional

values  of filial piety and respect for elders  which

would  preserve the kinship ties and  thus  keep  the

extended family intact. Through the granting  of  tax

relief  for  dependent parents and grandparents,  the

Government  already recognises the need to  encourage

people  to  look  after their dependent  parents  and

grand-parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much more important is social education to reduce

the   generation  gap.  The  young  must   learn   to

understand  those who are older. Children must  learn

to  understand their parents so as to build  a  close

relationship with them. Parents in turn must learn to

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



reasonable with their children, to be close  to  them

and  provide  the best possible climate at  home  for

their  individual growth. In this way,  many  of  the

social   problems  we  have  been  facing  could   be

prevented or at least minimised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy for those who merely want to govern by

gaining   popularity  to  beguile  the  public   with

promises to provide everything for free. We cannot be

like  some  Western countries which  adopt  what  the

Americans   call  the  "pork  barrel"   approach   of

government  by  making use of public money  for  vote

catching  purposes.  Instead of  encouraging  private

initiative  to work out solutions for the  community,

they  move in under one pretext or another to provide

for  services  whether or not they are really  wanted

and  whether  or not they do any good.  Even  in  the

field of social services, welfare state concepts have

brought difficulties to many Western countries. There

are  dangers of evolving such a system for it  breeds

laziness  and indifference. It leads to the erroneous

belief  that  the  good things in  life  can  be  got

without sustained effort, and that it is the duty  of

the government to act as the "universal provider".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of the socialist ideology, coupled with

the  great  work done by social workers in the  slums

and  ravages  of the second world war, brought  about

many  changes  in the philosophy of social  services.

The present thinking is that people must be helped to

help  themselves. Welfare should not be  just  doling

out   reliefs   and  benefits.  It   must   be   more

developmental. This in fact strikes the key  note  of

our social policy. Social services in the future will

be  geared  towards  the  development  of  individual

initiative, creativity, and the will and  ability  to

do  productive work. Social measures will be aimed at

the  creation  of  renewed economic independence  and

productive living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, before I speak, in this

festive season, let me wish you, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  and  all hon. Members a Happy  Chinese  New

Year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion

moved  by  the  Member  for Ulu Pandan  thanking  the

President  for  his  speech  delivered  on  the   8th

February, outlining the Government's policy.  In  the

Presidential  Address, three important  aspects  have

been   highlighted.  First,  in  promoting   national

consciousness,  we  should  strive  to   instil   the

precept,  namely, "From each his best;  To  each  his

worth." This will alienate the social parasites. This

correct  directive will make for diligence and  self-reliance.  Secondly, we should select  what  is  best

from  the  West  and  fit it  into  our  context  and

realistic  situations  so as  to  promote  all  round

development. Unlike some other countries, we  do  not

blindly  ape  foreign  examples  or  regard  anything

foreign as golden rules. For by so doing we will only

succeed  in driving the country to the dogs. Thirdly,

we  must  learn  the experience of the  Japanese  and

understand  how  Japan was able to transform  herself

into  a  modern  industrial nation in less  than  100

years  since the Meiji Restoration of 1868. No doubt,

for a country like ours, devoid of natural resources,

we have no other choice but to utilise the hard work,

industry,  intelligence  and  the  spirit  of   self-reliance of our people and to adopt certain pragmatic

measures  in our development, in addition to adopting

all practical constructive policy so as to assure our

future and our development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech also emphasised that we have to

face  the  fact of a slower economic growth rate  and

that we should adjust our spending habits, both as  a

government  and as individuals. This  means  that  we

have  to be pragmatic and realistic and that we  have

to  lead a simple and austere life. In fact, a frugal

life style is a traditional oriental virtue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech also indicates that we should

learn  from the experience of the Japanese.  I  share

the  same sentiments, because the Japanese people are

not only hardworking and self-disciplined but also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



imbued  with the spirit of patriotism and a love  for

their  national products. Of course, our  people  are

also imbued with a high sense of patriotism, so, that

we  are  able  to achieve much in a short  period  of

time.  However,  there  is a  shortcoming  among  our

people,  that  is, a lack of confidence  in  our  own

local products. Let me give an example. According  to

a  newspaper report, certain jeans made in  Singapore

were  shipped  to a foreign country and chopped  with

the  words,  "Made  in  -(the  name  of  the  foreign

country)", and then they were sent back to  Singapore

and  sold  at  a  price  four  or  five  times  above

Singapore made jeans. In other words, the jeans  made

in Singapore costing only $9 to $11 a piece, had gone

up  to  $30-$5O if they were chopped with  the  words

"Made  in  -", a  foreign  country.  Yet  our  local

consumers do not mind spending so much money for such

jeans.  There  are  a lot of examples  of  a  similar

nature.   What   does  this  show?   It   shows   the

manifestation of the xenophilous psychology,  feeling

that local ginger is not hot enough and that the moon

in  foreign  countries is rounder than  the  moon  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from embarking on industrialisation and

manufacturing  industries and  expanding  our  export

markets,  we  have  also to take  positive  steps  to

convince  and persuade our local people  to  buy  our

local  products. This will not only save us a lot  of

foreign  exchange but also earns for us  an  expanded

market  for  our products. It is also to be  stressed

that this is an act of patriotism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no doubt that in the last 10 years,

because  of economic prosperity and increased incomes

of  the  people, certain portion of our  people  have

taken  to  some unwholesome habits. They are obsessed

by  an  urge to seek material comforts and  enjoyment

without working. This is a bad phenomenon. We have to

rekindle  the love and respect for labour  among  our

people.  How are we going to do that? I believe  that

we should adopt certain measures or policies. One, we

should  shorten the wage differentials, for instance,

between an engineer earning from $1,200 to $1,500 and

an  ordinary construction worker earning only $200 to

$300 per month. Of course, this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



results  in  a shortage of labour in the construction

industry,  and therefore need to recruit labour  from

foreign  countries. Our Minister for  Labour  has  on

many  occasions  emphasised the need  to  adjust  the

wages between the managerial grade and that of manual

workers. I welcome such constructive policy  and  its

early  implementation. Secondly, we must  foster  the

social  vogue  of respect for labour and  accord  the

diligent  worker  with adequate  reward  and  honour,

because   workers  and  labourers  have  made   great

contributions to our national construction. Annually,

on  National  Day we award all classes of  medals  to

people who have rendered meritorious services to  our

country;  but  we have yet to find a  labourer  or  a

worker   among   those  awarded  by  the   President.

Therefore.  I  think we should institute  an  honours

list   for  our  workers  in  recognition  of   their

meritorious  contributions to our  country.  Thirdly,

every year the Government awards many scholarships to

students who excel in their studies, yet we have  not

`given any scholarship to workers who are capable and

intelligent. Such awards will enable them to  further

their  studies.  I therefore suggest that  we  should

consider  the  institution of a scholarship  for  the

workers  in order to nurture a pool of elite workers.

Such a step will help to promote a spirit of love for

labour among the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember in last June, under the

auspices  of  the Prime Minister, we  carried  out  a

nation-wide campaign on "Use Your Hands". This  is  a

campaign  rich in education significance.  I  believe

that we should frequently carry out such an educative

campaign.  Not only all the MPs should take  part  in

this  educational campaign, civil servants  from  the

top  echelon  to the middle grades should  also  take

part  in  labour, so as to enable them to  experience

the  significance of labour and help promote the good

vogue of respect for labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on certain problems in the

Addenda.  In  the  various Addenda,  I  paid  special

attention  to the problems faced by the  hawkers,  in

particular the raising of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



hawker licence fees. This will mean an increased cost

to  the  hawkers. According to my knowledge,  licence

fees  at certain food centres are already high. Apart

from  paying the licence fees they have  to  pay  PUB

charges.  If  licence fees are revised upwards,  this

will  mean  a greater burden to them, and  they  will

pass  on  such increased cost to the consumers.  This

will lead to another bout of inflation, Therefore, Mr

Speaker, Sir, before the Government does anything  to

increase  the  hawker licence fees,  it  should  give

careful  consideration  and try  to  abolish  it.  It

should review the matter of taxes and see what  could

be  increased and what could not be increased. It  is

very  easy  to  increase taxes. The  race  course  is

crowded  with bettors and gamblers. If the Turf  Club

increases  its  admission fee by, say,  $5  then  the

Government  will  collect  millions  of  dollars   in

revenue. But the people who patronise the food stalls

come  mostly from the middle and lower income groups,

such  as office workers, taxi drivers, civil servants

and  trishaw-riders. They are able to get cheap meals

at these centres and this indirectly helps to lighten

their  cost of living. Mr Speaker, Sir, if  you  will

remember,  it  is  the policy of  the  Government  to

resite  the  hawkers at the various food  centres  to

enable  them  to  make a living and also  to  provide

cheap meals. It also aims to stabilise and reduce the

cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another authority which contemplates raising tariffs

is the PUB. This has caused concern among the people,

especially those in the lower income group. A lot  of

people  have  found  these  yearly  increase  in  PUB

charges very burdensome. I agree that nothing is  for

free  in this world, If you want something, you  must

pay  for  it.  However,  water  and  electricity  are

essential commodites. They are not luxuries  and  the

charges are already high. So as a trusted Government,

I  believe it is the Government's duty to offer  such

services  to  the people as conducive to their  well-being.  The  PUB  should not be run as  a  commercial

enterprise  which  only thinks in  terms  of  profit-making.   Furthermore,  the   PUB   has   accumulated

considerable  surpluses  over  the  years.  In  other

words, the Government should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



consider subsidising certain services provided by the

PUB just as the President has said in his speech that

the  Government  is  subsidising  education,  medical

services, and housing. Whilst our economy is still in

the  midst  of  recovery, I  do  not  agree  to  such

increase in PUB charges. I also agree with the Member

for  Leng  Kee who suggested in this `House  on  14th

February 1977 that all those surcharges to PUB  bills

should be abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received numerous complaints from my

constituents  that their PUB bills have  unexpectedly

increased,  by sometimes more than 100%. Payment  for

the  previous month's bill was $50, this month it has

risen to $120. It is like a rising tide. However,  in

the  matter  of  PUB charges, they never  come  down.

After  investigation, such amounts are  found  to  be

based on estimates and not because of their increased

consumption;  the excess could be deducted  from  the

next  bill.  My  constituents  asked  why  are  these

estimates not based on figures of the previous month.

Such  complaints  are quite common. I  believe,  Sir,

even  among  your constituents you have  come  across

such  complaints. Whose fault is this?  I  think  the

General  Manager of PUB should be blamed, because  he

has  not  directed his subordinate officers to  carry

out  their  work properly, thus causing inconvenience

to  the  people  and  their  discontent  against  the

Government. I appeal to the Chairman of the PUB,  who

is   none   other  than  the  Minister  for  National

Development  and  Communications, to  restructure  or

reorganise the administrative set-up of the PUB so as

to render satisfactory service to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the Addendum on the Ministry of

Culture.  The  Addendum advocates the policy  of  the

Government  to  develop  Singapore's  rich   cultural

heritage derived from the Malay, Chinese, Indian  and

Western  civilisations,  and,  through  their  cross-fertilisation,   to   evolve  a   national   cultural

identity.  The Ministry of Culture will  continue  to

organise  a  wide range of activities  to  promote  a

better appreciation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



our  cultural heritage. Of course, such a  policy  is

entirely  correct. But in practice, do we drive  home

this  spirit in our actual work? I think there  is  a

gap between what we advocate and what we really do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our TV programmes are imported. Locally

produced programmes are few in number. For example, a

certain marketing consultancy company has carried out

a  survey of TV viewers and found that there  are  10

most popular programmes like "The Heroes" and "Beauty

of  an Era", Among them only one is locally produced,

namely,  "Musical Showcase", But 80% of the  artistes

appearing   in   that  programme  are  from   abroad.

Therefore,   we   can  see  that   locally   produced

programmes are few in number and the standard is also

rather low. This is a matter for regret. Therefore, I

suggest that the Ministry concerned should go all out

to  nurture our artistic talents and to produce  more

local  TV  programmes befitting  local  situation  in

order  to  meet  the  demands of  the  people  for  a

cultural life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum on the Ministry of National

Development it says that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In addition to the provision of HDB flats for

residential cases, there will be alternative premises

or  cash  payments  in  lieu for shops,  resettlement

facilities for specific trades ...`



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all these measures and facilities will

alleviate   the   hardship  of  those   affected   by

resettlement. They have to understand that the aim of

resettlement  is  in the long-term interests  of  the

nation,  If they can, they will give further  support

to the policies of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my constituency, certain areas

of  land  have been requisitioned by the  Government.

The  areas  affected are: a portion of  Jalan  Pasar,

Sembawang, a portion of Andrews Avenue at the  1  5th

mile, and  certain portion of the land near  Tanjong

Irau  at  the  15th  mile.  About  100  families  aye

affected  by the resettlement scheme, among them  are

seven  shop premises. These people came several times

to  ask me concerning resettlement matters, and  also

about how long they could continue to reside in those

places or how long they could carry on with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



their  business  there,  As the  MP  for  this  rural

constituency,  of  course,  it  is  my  duty  to   be

concerned  about  their welfare.  Therefore.  I  made

enquiries  from  the  Ministry concerned,  The  reply

given  was that it might take a few years more before

actual enforcement of the resettlement. In fact, they

were  also  not very clear about the situation,  Such

vague  answers  are not satisfactory, For  the  well-being of my constituents, to alleviate their hardship

and  to allay their worries I would urge the Minister

to  pay  particular  attention to  the  work  of  the

Resettlement  Department.  He  should  instruct   the

officers  in the Resettlement Department to abide  by

the Government's policy of caring for the welfare  of

the people, and not cause unnecessary trouble or loss

to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring two valid complaints to the

attention   of  the  relevant  authorities,   In   my

constituency, there is a school which is known as Hwa

Kwang  School,  whose land has been acquired  by  the

Housing and Development Board. They have come  to  an

agreement  on  the quantum of compensation.  However,

the  rental for the land has been increased by  800%,

namely,  the  school used to pay $10 a  year  to  the

former   landlord,  but  now  the  rental  has   been

increased by the HDB to $80 per month. Such a measure

is  highly irrational. Firstly, the School Management

Committee  was  responsible for the building  of  the

school,  and it has been in existence for  more  than

ten  years. The Housing and Development Board has not

spent  a  single  cent on the school.  Secondly, the

school is a place for the education of our young  and

not  a  profit-making enterprise. In the  President's

policy  speech  it is stated that  it  is  still  the

Government's  policy to subsidise education,  medical

and  housing  services. This school is an educational

institution.  Therefore, it is right and  proper  for

this school to get a subsidy from the Government. The

HDB's  action is a departure from Government  policy.

Therefore, it is unreasonable for the HDB to increase

the  rental  for the land. I would urge the  Minister

concerned to consider rescinding such an act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly seven shopkeepers who are voters have

complained to me that they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



received  notices from the HDB telling  them  not  to

continue  with  their businesses  because  they  were

considered  illegal. However, these  people  told  me

that  they  have been carrying on such businesses  in

those  areas  for more than ten years,  Although  the

premises originally were meant for dwelling purposes,

they had converted them into shop premises. Some  ten

years  ago, in the rural areas there were hardly  any

shops, because neither the Government nor the private

developers would be interested in building shophouses

there.  Therefore, it is only natural for  the  rural

dwellers  to make use of their premises as  shops  to

provide  a service for the rural people, Can  we  say

that  they  have done wrong? However, ever since  the

HDB  acquired such areas, they were branded as people

who were doing, illegal business and were required to

stop such activities immediately. Is it reasonable to

do  so? I would like the Senior Minister of State  to

investigate into these circumstances in order to give

these  people a fair deal. Sir, I support the  motion

of thanks on behalf of my constituents,



<br><br>3.50 pm.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since last week

during the debate on the President's Address to  this

House,  many of my colleagues on the Backbench,  both

new  and  old, have stated their views on  Government

policies for the next five years,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am going to state may be a repetition of some

of the issues and problems already raised; however  I

believe  such repetitions are sometimes necessary  if

we are to get results,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have read the Addenda to the Presidential

Address   which   cover  the  entire   framework   of

Government policies for the next five years. In fact.

all   the   policies  pertaining   to   the   various

Ministries, in  my view, can be  summed  up  in  the

President's statement that "we have to formulate  our

way  of  life, taking what is best from the West  and

fitting  it  into  the Singapore context".  In  other

words, we must build up our national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



identity  based  on the multi-racial,  multicultural,

multi-lingual and multi-religious characteristics  of

our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, the Prime Minister's statement "we are

Singaporeans" best sums up the national identity that

Singapore  must eventually evolve, Hence, since  1959

when   the   PAP  swept  into  power,  the  political

leadership headed by our Prime Minister have  brought

Singapore  out of near bankruptcy into an independent

sovereign country in which the people are better-fed,

better-clothed,  better-educated   and   enjoying   a

standard  of  living  second  only  to  Japan.   Such

dedication and the will to succeed despite  all  odds

did  not come about that easily. Pragmatic leadership

and  practical  measures and the cooperation  of  the

people  through sheer hard work and their indomitable

spirit  to  survive have made Singapore  what  it  is

today,  Therefore, Sir, a tribute  to  them  must  be

placed on record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore all the more imperative and

necessary that our young be constantly reminded  that

the good things in life they enjoy today did not come

about just by pure chance but as a result of the hard

work   put  in  over  the  last  17 1/2  years  by   the

enlightened PAP leadership and the people,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end I would like to make some comments on

the  proposals  of the Education Ministry.  Whilst  I

applaud some of the good work done, I must hasten  to

add that education is a life-long process for it does

not  end  with merely a certificate, a diploma  or  a

degree,  I  am  no educationist but I would  like  to

submit  that  the education system must  be  reviewed

from time to time. On the question of moral and civic

education,  I would like to see that our  pupils  are

taught  the concept of what I can do for the  society

and  not what I can get from the society. The Chinese

aphorism of (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) should be imbued deep in

their minds in their early years of their education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will disagree that the education system has

to  be  reviewed from time to time for it is  in  our

national interests. The various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



measures listed in the Addendum are not new. In fact,

the  so-called  revision of  the  system  of  primary

education  is  not  an improvement,  it  is  a  clear

admission  that  automatic  promotion  has   been   a

failure.  I  am not setting out on a witch-hunt.  Now

the  Ministry has to fall back onto the  old  system.

that  is,  promotion  based on  passing  examinations

though the term annual assessments has been used  but

it means just the same, Therefore automatic promotion

has brought about a social problem - pupils unable to

cope  up with their lessons leave school with a half-baked  education,  some  are not  articulate  in  any

language  and  are  thus  unable  to  fit  into   the

employment  market.  The  result,  they  laze  around

aimlessly,  cannot get proper jobs  and  easily  fall

prey  to decadent or evil influences. Also I fail  to

understand how the Basic Course for pupils who cannot

cope with the Standard Course will learn to read  and

write in one language, do simple arithmetic, as  well

as  become good citizens. Does the Education Ministry

seriously  think that by implementing such a  course,

these pupils can become good citizens? I do not  know

whether  the policy makers believe that this will  be

the result. In my view, they should be more realistic

and  practical.  I  do  not propose  to  recommend  a

Commission of Inquiry to look into the causes. I say.

they  should set up advisory committees which  should

comprise retired educationists and teachers who would

then  mount an in-depth study of the root causes  and

of  the shortcomings and then make recommendations to

improve upon the primary education system, I am quite

sure  many  of  these people would be  too  happy  to

respond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So also is the same with the system of secondary

education.  But I do not wish to go into the  details

as  I do not think this debate is on education alone.

I  have other issues to raise also and time is not my

own. I submit that an overall review of the education

system  is  necessary  and this  is  definitely  long

overdue.  It may well be that some thought  has  been

made towards enumerating the measures as contained in

the  Addendum. But I would like to know who are those

involved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



in this exercise. Have these policy makers sought the

counsel of those who have spent their entire lives in

teaching and those who are still alive today and  who

may   be   too  ready  to  impart  their  wealth   of

experience? May I remind the education policy  makers

that human resources is all Singapore has.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, if this approach is made, I am sure

that  the  pupils, over the years of their  education

would  be  better equipped to continue to ensure  our

long-term survival. I believe the Ministry of Culture

through its media of broadcasting and television  can

help  much  in  this  respect.  Its  programmes   and

productions  must be carefully planned, selected  and

thought  out.  In  short  what  is  relevant  to  our

national  cultural  evolution towards  the  Singapore

identity should be exploited to the optimum, and  not

those  of violence and the easy-going life-styles  of

the West. This certainly does us more harm than good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the hon. Member for Kampong Chai

Chee, both Ministries should not nullify each other's

actions  but  their  actions should  complement  each

other. The Chinese saying (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) should not

be  their  practice. Their actions should, therefore,

be complementary in nature (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to touch on is public

transportation. It is gratifying to note  that  there

has been great improvement made in the last two years

by  the Singapore Bus Service. However, since the SBS

will  be the mainstay of Singapore's public transport

system  pending  the introduction of the  Mass  Rapid

Transit  System, there is much still to  be  done  to

improve  this  system  to  meet  the  needs  of   the

thousands  of  commuters from all over Singapore  who

must  travel  to their places of work,  either  their

offices or factories.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ng, I propose to take a suspension at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S SPEECH</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was speaking on

the  public transport system and the need to  improve

further  the  Singapore Bus Service when this  debate

was  adjourned for a break. Sir, there should be  co-ordination  between  the  SBS  and  the  Housing  and

Development Board to provide services to the  various

estates  noting  the fact that some 1 50.000  housing

units will be completed by

1980. This service must be available to them. I would

like to believe that the commuters should not have to

wait  longer than necessary to catch a bus  from  one

point  to  another or to their place of work.  I  say

this  because complaints of lack of bus  services  in

the new HDB estates have been made. The residents  in

these  new  estates  rightly  deserve  such  service.

Therefore,  I hope my observation on this point  will

not fall on deaf ears. After all, an efficient public

transport system is not only a natural expectation of

the  residents in the HDB estates but also the public

as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about public transport. I cannot but refer

to  the Addenda on the Ministries of Home Affairs and

National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the statement of the Ministry of

Home  Affairs that roads must be made safer  for  all

road  users.  But  I  cannot  subscribe  to  the  two

proposals of the Ministry of Home Affairs. First,  in

any  collision between two vehicles of different size

and weight the driver of the larger vehicle will have

to  prove that he is not in the wrong, i.e, rebut the

presumption that he was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



at  fault. Second, in any fatal accident the  driver,

who  is to be charged in court for dangerous driving,

will  immediately have his driving licence  suspended

until his trial is completed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the sentiments expressed by the hon, Member

for  Kallang  when  he made reference  to  these  two

proposals.  But  commonsense  tells  me  that  it  is

against  the  principles of established law,  Let  us

assume  that a lorry, travelling in front of a  motor

car, stops at a traffic light and then the motor  car

travelling  behind  it hits the rear  of  the  lorry;

surely  to presume that the lorry driver is at  fault

and therefore should be penalised is too far-fetched,

Is  this not so? I can bring in other examples but  I

think have made my point clear enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, let us assume that a motorist is

driving  along  a  road where there  is  an  overhead

bridge for pedestrians. A pedestrian instead of using

the  bridge  suddenly  dashes across  the  road,  The

motorist  applies his brakes but alas, unfortunately,

the  pedestrian  is  knocked down,  and  subsequently

dies,  Is  it  therefore fair to suspend the  driving

licence of the motorist if he is charged in court for

dangerous driving? I would like to believe  that  the

legislative  proposals be carefully  reconsidered  in

the light of my observations because both drivers are

being unfairly discriminated against. Would not  such

action be against natural justice?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department builds roads and

maintains them. Some years ago roads that were  in  a

bad  state have been repaired. But a couple of  years

ago,  road  taxes and other forms of fees (ARF)  were

imposed with a view to restricting the growth of  the

car population. According to the Ministry of Finance,

this was not a revenue-raising exercise but was meant

to alleviate traffic jams. I believe that millions of

dollars have been collected by way of such taxes as a

result,  but  would it not be fair to  the  motorists

that  there  should be a massive campaign to  further

improve the conditions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



of  the  roads thereby alleviating traffic  jams  and

reducing transport problems?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about transport problems, I would like to

refer  to  the  numerous  so-called  farmways  in  my

constituency, They are the Lorong Buang Kok  Farmways

and  Lorong Cheng Lim Farmways, These so-called roads

have  been built in Punggol because of the pig  farms

that have come in to the areas. I must say that these

farmways  are narrow, pot-holed and of laterite.  The

pig  farmers as hon. Members will know, have been re-located   from  the  Kranji  area  for  environmental

reasons, Good road conditions are essential to  these

farmers,  Therefore, these farmways should have  been

metalled before the farmers moved in. But this is not

so,  and they are now asked to make requests  to  the

Urban   and   Rural   Services  Committee   for   its

consideration.  I  hope the Ministry  concerned  will

enlighten  this House as to the reasons  for  passing

the  buck to the URSC. Surely it is not too  much  to

ask for in this respect that services like good roads

and  brighter street lighting be installed before the

farmers  move in. One cannot deny the fact  that  the

pig  farmers  have cooperated and made sacrifices  in

the  national interest to move their farms to a  non-catchment area in Punggol and Jalan Kayu and to start

life  anew. This is not the first time that they have

been  moved. I have come across, in the course of  my

visits,  some  who have been moved four  times.  They

have  become bitter, Do we not treat them as pioneers

in  opening up new frontiers? Only minimum facilities

like   water  and  electricity  supplies,  inadequate

drainage  are provided for, whereas I was  told  that

many  facilities and services would be  available  to

them when they move in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more often than not, these farmers are left to

set up their farms again and even have to comply with

all  sorts  of rules and regulations of the  Building

Control   Division   and   the   Primary   Production

Department, not forgetting that the majority  of  the

farming families are very large. Let me just give  an

illustration on the question of compliance  with  the

requirements  of  the  Planning  Department  or   the

Building  Control Division. Any minor  alteration  to

their houses, say, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



have  the  kitchen sited outside the  house  requires

amendment plans and which very often take time to  be

approved.  These plans for alteration  and  amendment

are  subject to the close scrutiny of the departments

I  mentioned  just  now.. What is more  peculiar  and

difficult  to  understand  is  the  fact   that   the

Resettlement Department wants these farmers  to  move

in  quickly  to these areas and these farmers  cannot

put  up  their buildings unless they comply with  all

the   rules   and  regulations  laid  down   by   the

departments concerned. It is also the same  with  the

repairs  and extensions to the farm structures.  Sir,

it  may be my duty to assist them whenever they wish;

but  I  do not think that it is fair to these  people

that  they should be made to see the MP just  because

they  want to site their kitchen outside their  house

or  make  repairs  to their farm structures.  Already

they are busy with their farming activities. May I be

enlightened as to the duties of the field officers in

the  PPD or BCD with regard to the fact that they are

supposed  to assist the farmers in this respect,  and

in what way are they rendering assistance and advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge that henceforth a more humane

and  sympathetic approach be made when relocation  of

pig  farmers to Jalan Kayu and Punggol is carried out

in  subsequent  exercises. Sir, I make these  remarks

because  I  have  met the farmers and discussed  with

them their problems. I believe that as a result of my

meeting, some of the Government officials might  have

been over-enthusiastic in the course of carrying  out

their  duties and thus getting very poor  impression,

if not dislike, from the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also true in the case of resettlement and re-housing. This point has already been made by the

Member  for Changi and I do not wish to elaborate  on

this  except  to  say that I too have  received  many

complaints  of a similar nature. But in the  case  of

Punggol, I have resettlement both ways. Clearance and

resettlement  from  Punggol  to  Punggol  and   other

housing  estates  as  well as  farmers  relocated  to

Punggol.  Suffice it to say that those  affected  are

extremely bitter and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



dissatisfied  with the manner and approach  in  which

such policies are carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am gratified to note that for the improvement of

the  rural areas some $20 million has been set  aside

for  the next five years. The rural folks' needs  are

simple,  that  is, metalled kampong  roads,  brighter

street  lightings, public utilities, better drainage,

bridges and jetties. These needs are basic. I am sure

my  good friends who represent the rural areas  share

my  view.  There is still much to be  done  to  these

areas;  these  folks are willing to  wait  and  as  a

result  have overwhelmingly demonstrated their strong

support to the PAP in the last elections. For this we

are  all  grateful. We can assure them that we  shall

continue to strive to do as much as possible for them

even  though it takes time. However, they should  not

be  made  to wait for too long. Otherwise the  ground

will turn from sour to bitter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was elated when the hon. Member for Nee Soon (I am

afraid  he  is not here) lamented in this House  last

week  over  the  plight  of  his  constituency  which

constitutes  about 80% of rural folks. I fully  share

his  plea  that  more funds should be apportioned  to

meet the urgent needs of the rural constituencies. He

has  suggested  that  each rural constituency  should

have $100,000. I think his suggestion should be taken

and  be favourably considered by the Government.  But

as  far  as Punggol is concerned, let me not  be  too

generous  myself, we will go along with the norm.  My

question is, if the Government can spend millions  of

dollars  to provide more recreational facilities  for

the  public,  I  do not think the MPs for  the  rural

areas are not being fair when they make requests that

there  should be further improvements in their  rural

constituencies. On this note, Sir, I give my  support

to the Motion so moved.



<br><br>5.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Let me, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  say  a  few  words  in support  of  the  Motion

standing in the name of the Member for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address has dealt both with the

nature and scope of the security problem we faced and

the  premises underlying Government policies  in  the

context of the changing social and economic condition

of  Singapore.  It also dealt, in passing,  with  the

question of the social values that we should preserve

and  inculcate and asserted that more attention would

be  paid to "the cardinal precepts of our long proven

culture systems".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inculcation of these cardinal precepts; the

formulation and implementation of Government policies

relating  to  our  economic  requirements   and   the

isolation  of  the political aspects of the  security

problem are inter-related. In an important sense they

all  involve the question of the values that  are  to

govern our existence in society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference in the Address to "the cardinal

precepts"  has  disturbed some hon. Members  as  this

implied  a  fundamental difference between Asian  and

European values on the social plane and, as  life  in

Singapore  was already an amalgam in various  degrees

of  Asian and British values, the problem now  became

one  of  identification and selection. What were  the

cardinal  precepts of the Asian culture systems  that

should be preserved so that social and political life

remained  refined  and  certain  and  what  were  the

European  values that ought to be accepted by  us  in

the  interests of our economic progress. Hon. Members

would agree that, whether we like it or not, economic

progress and change, there must be in Singapore if we

were  to solve our continuing employment and security

problems on a relatively permanent basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the task of formulating our educational and

social  policies on such selection is, I  am  afraid,

not  going  to  be a simple one. We would  have  some

anxious  moments  and,  if we  are  to  preserve  our

rational balance and prevent violence in the process,

we  should  learn  from  the  "teachers  by  negative

example"  -  an attractive phrase. For non-communists

in Southeast Asia, the latest of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



such teachers is Indo-China, in particular Cambodia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marxist-Leninist dogma which is disrupting much of

Asia  is  a  crude  and  savage European  theory.  It

emerged  Out  of  certain  specific  conditions  that

obtained  in  European society more  than  a  hundred

years  ago. It is diametrically opposed to the  time-tested  values  of  the  Asian  culture-systems.  The

horrible  happenings  in Cambodia  demonstrated  once

again  the  fate  that inevitably befell  people  who

allowed a communist take-over of their society.  Non-communists   in  Southeast  Asia  must  now   address

themselves to the task of preventing such take-overs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent revelations in Singapore have once again high-lighted the nature and enormity of the problem we

faced.  It  involved  anti-national  activities   and

deceit.  It  also  involved  a  pernicious  form   of

intellectual   dishonesty  perpetrated   within   the

Socialist  International by  foreign  Marxist  groups

acting  in  concert  with  a pro-communist  group  in

Singapore.  We  have  collared this  group;  but  the

security problem as typified by it should be  grasped

in all its aspects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, of course, referring to the recent G. Raman

revelations that resulted in the arrest and detention

of  his  group of pro-communist collaborators.  These

gentlemen   were  associated,  in  their  clandestine

schemes  and  activities with foreign communists  and

pro-communists  like  Malcolm  CaIdwell, who  is   a

lecturer  in  economic  history  in  the  School   of

Oriental and African Studies. London; Amir Dastan,  a

Malaysian  communist  now living  in  the  salubrious

environment of Ireland and A. Balakrishnan  who  runs

the  Maoist Workers' Institute in London.  There  are

also other minor individuals teaching in universities

in  other countries. It is significant that all these

gentlemen,  including  the  Raman  group,  live   and

prosper in countries where parliamentary democracy is

an  active principle of political life. Not for  them

the  paradise  of  countries where communist  parties

have imposed their dictatorships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, post-1917 history has given the world vivid

illustrations of how all-powerful general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



secretaries of communist parties in power have  dealt

with  intellectuals of the stripe of these  gentlemen

after  they have outlived their usefulness. They  are

liquidated  or  banished  to concentration  camps  to

undergo  corrective thinking through hard  labour  or

put  away  in lunatic asylums. Marxists in opposition

in  democratic countries talk volumes about democracy

and  the  lack  of  it in parliamentary  democracies;

about equality and the lack of it in such democracies

and  about  exploitation and the fullness  of  it  in

these  democracies. Marxists in power, however, after

liquidating  non-marxist parties  and  intellectuals,

have ended up by killing off their erstwhile comrades

who  had  doctrinal differences with  the  clique  in

power.  It  should not be difficult for  a  political

analyst to abstract from post 1917 communist history,

a  universal  law  that governed the  development  of

communist  dictatorships. We already see in Cambodia,

the  incarnation of the ultimate barbarity that  Marx

had predicted for capitalist societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is of immediate relevance to us is that our

educational  system appears to have produced  in  the

Raman  group, men who were feeble enough in mind  and

character to succumb to Marxist mythology despite the

phenomenal  progress registered in Singapore  in  all

the  major fields of endeavour. In fact, there  is  a

school  of  thought which affirms that  the  rate  of

social  and  economic change registered in  Singapore

during  the  last decade was too rapid to enable  our

people to make necessary adjustments. This indeed  is

the   Singapore  that  Raman  had  thought   fit   to

characterize  in  a letter that he wrote  to  Malcolm

10th September, 1974

freak  created by British Imperialism. He went on  to

assert that British Imperialism was culpable for  the

sins  that its lap-dog was perpetrating. The sin that

Raman  was  concerned  about  was,  of  course,   the

Government's    consistent   policy   of    detaining

communists and pro-communists for so long as they did

not  denounce  and  disavow the violence  and  terror

employed  by  the CPM to achieve its political  ends.

The  Singapore  Government was said to be  repressive

because it repressed the pro-communists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



in  the  interests  of  the   people   of

Singapore. But the present regimes in Indo-China were

said   to   be   democratic  because  the  communists

repressed  and  liquidated everybody else.  This,  in

essence,  is  the  intellectual  dishonesty  that  we

should expect from Marxist groups. It is reflected in

21st May, 1975

by Raman to Malcolm CaIdwell in which he stated:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the Vietnamese people have given the world a gift

which  should  inspire us to greater  endeavour.  Our

salutes  go  to  all  those  who  are  fighting   the

oppressors.  It  was  a fitting  honour  to  see  the

portrait  of  Uncle Ho being carried  throughout  the

capitals of the world'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members would see how the question of  values,

ethical  values,  are  bound  up  with  our  security

problem. Raman and some of his colleagues had all the

benefits  of  education and progress  that  Singapore

society  could  give, but they repaid their  debt  by

turning against that same society and calling it  the

lap-dog of imperialism,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rehabilitation of such benighted individuals to

normal  life  is  going to be a  long  process.  They

appear to have abdicated their rational faculties and

we  would  need the help of psychiatrists to  restore

their mental balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic and social categories that we have used

in   planning  the  industrialisation  and   economic

development of Singapore are Western. Whilst we  have

achieved  full employment by using these  categories,

it  is also true that their impact on our traditional

Asian values has resulted in the progressive break-up

of  our time-tested family system which has been  the

foundation  for  our  social  ethics.  We  need  only

examine some of the assumptions behind our Income Tax

Act  and  the  family law provisions of  the  Women's

Charter  to  appreciate  how  they  are  helping   to

dissolve our family system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the implications of modernisation is

that  our traditional values have had to give way  to

the   new  essentially  materialist  values   of   an

industrial  society  and we have ourselves  told  our

people that the only measurable criterion that  could

be  employed  in ascertaining the worth  of  a  human

being in society is his economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



worth,  If  we  accept the inexorable logic  of  this

doctrine,  I  hasten to say that  we  would  find  it

extremely  difficult to preserve our desirable  Asian

values  in  the context of our democratic system.  We

may   have   to  evolve  a  more  authoritarian   and

patriarchal  form of society to achieve  the  desired

end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the ultimate dispensation, the time has

come  for  us  to begin laying stress on non-material

values  so  that  human life can  become  whole  once

again. I can see no other solvent that could dissolve

our   acute   drug-trafficking  and  other   criminal

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall, I am sure, have time enough during the

life  of  this  Parliament to discuss the  impact  of

Government's  policies  on  the  social   fabric   of

Singapore. If the basic unit of our society is to  be

the family and not the individual the Government must

rethink  its policies on the basis of the family  and

not the individual. A beginning could be made at once

in the practice of the Housing and Development Board,

which is unable under current policy to transfer  the

tenancies of flats from a tenant who dies to  another

member of the family - say from a dead husband  to  a

surviving  wife  or in the event of divorce  from  an

erring husband to a deserted wife. The consequence is

a  dispossessed family. Sir, I shall have more to say

of  this  and  related  social  problems  during  the

forthcoming Budget Sessions.



<br><br>5.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1973 when there

was  a 400% rise in the price of petroleum, the world

economy  has  run into a state of difficulties.  Many

economists  have long predicted that as a  result  of

the   uncontrolled  deficit  budgetting  adopted   by

western   countries   to  maintain   employment   and

stimulate   economic   growth,   cyclical    economic

recession is inevitable and will take place sooner or

later.  Coupled with the substantial increase in  the

price   of   oil,   economic   recession   has   been

precipitated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



much  earlier, enhancing the slowness and  difficulty

in economic recovery, This is somewhat unexpected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have noticed that over the past

two  centuries  there have been two breakthroughs  in

world civilisation and economy. Each time there was a

breakthrough, it was closely related to the discovery

of  a  source of energy. The first breakthrough  came

when  the  use  of coal led to the discovery  of  the

steam   engine.  This  in  turn  led  to  ,the  first

industrial  revolution, The second breakthrough  came

when  oil  was first utilised as a source of  energy.

This   led   to  the  rapid  development   in   world

civilisation and its economy over the last 100 years.

This  development has come to its complete  stage  in

1973 when oil ceased to be a cheap source of energy,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to experts the rate at which oil is being

consumed shows that the available sources of oil will

be  exhausted  in the next 25 years.  At  the  moment

world  energy  scientists  are  endeavouring  in  the

following  fields. First, to explore new  sources  of

oil.  Second, to improve nuclear generators  and  the

safe disposal of nuclear wastes. Third, to study  and

obtain  from sea water the heavy hydrogen as fuel  to

drive  the  nuclear  energy  generator.  Fourth, to

research  on  converting solar energy  into  electric

energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a country lacking in

natural resources. Unlike other countries, we do  not

have  hydro-power, coal mines, oil and  other  energy

resources. But what is important is that as a  result

of technological and scientific advancement there are

some  important natural resources which can  possibly

be made use of for man's continued existence, Obvious

examples  are  the ocean's resources  and  the  solar

energy  resources. Solar energy can  be  better  used

instead of going to waste. In my view I would suggest

that  the  Ministry of Science and Technology  should

perhaps undertake research on the conversion of solar

energy  into electric energy, thereby inventing  some

kind  of small scale solar energy electric generator.

I  lay  stress  on  solar energy, because  it  is  an

infinite source of energy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  is  so  geographically situated  near  the

Equator that out of 365 days per year it has over 300

days  of  sunshine, Compared with other countries  in

the  West which are not so favourably located, we are

much  better off in our geographical location to make

good  use  of  solar  energy, The small  scale  solar

energy electric generator I have in mind is in  terms

of  its  energy  capacity, Such a  generator  can  be

employed  on the basis of one generator to one  block

of  HDB  or urban flats, or you may have a  few  such

generators to serve a whole housing estate,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if such research is carried out

successfully  it  will  bring  about  the   following

advantages.  First, the electricity consumption  will

be  reduced year after year. Secondly, our main  form

of  transport, that is, the motor car, may resort  to

the  use of solar energy battery, Electric cars  have

one  disadvantage, and that is, they cannot run  over

long   distances  or  at  high  speed.  But  such   a

disadvantage is not felt in Singapore because of  the

limited  road space and the smallness of our  island.

There  is  no need for our motorists to go over  long

distances from one city to another or from one  state

to another. Therefore, electric cars in Singapore are

useful.  They  can  be used without the  disadvantage

that  may  be found in the larger countries, Thirdly,

with solar energy, electricity bill for lighting and'

air  conditioning  in  offices  and  hotels  will  be

greatly reduced. Fourthly, this will also reduce  our

consumption of oil. Some people may think that  I  am

making a fantastic proposal on the ground that  since

Western  scientists have not been successful in  this

field,  how can we ever hope to succeed? To  them,  I

will  say  that this is a manifestation of  defeatism

and that they possess the mentality of a WOG.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Ministry of Science

and  Technology  can collect data  and  mobilise  the

physicists   and   electrical   engineers   in    our

universities, and  in  our  Government  and   quasi-Government  bodies  for this  kind  of  research.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I am only making this suggestion  for

the   reference  of  the  Ministry  of  Science   and

Technology.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have already pointed out, the

fantastic  rise  in oil prices has  caused  not  only

economic  recession in the West but slowed  down  its

recovery.  Future trends will depend on the  recovery

of  the  economy in the United States. Japan and  the

nine countries in the EEC, As is generally known, the

rate  of  economic recovery in the United  States  is

rather slow, Coupled with the recent increase in  the

price  of  oil, the  slow economic  development  has

already  got a shadow cast over it. These are factors

which  will have great repercussions on our  economic

growth.  Mr Speaker, Sir, henceforth we have to  make

better  use of available economic structure  to  seek

development  on a broad basis, As the  President  has

stated  in  the Addendum on the Ministry of  Finance,

the  policy  is to give special help to manufacturing

industries  and, through  the  Economic  Development

Board  to  assist investors who set up new industries

or  expand  existing  factories  or  industries,  The

Government  is  also arranging with  the  Development

Bank  of  Singapore  to assist our ship-building  and

ship-repairing  and  labour intensive  industries  in

their development with better facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to be competitive we must achieve

better  quality  and lower costs in our  manufactured

products,  in order to secure a foothold  on  foreign

markets.  So  on a long-term basis, the  Ministry  of

Labour has to seriously study the success factors  of

the work system in Japan and South Korea, to find out

how   the  workers  there  have  contributed  to  the

development  of their countries. We must  learn  from

their  experience and fit into our context  the  best

points  and good factors so that we will be  able  to

formulate  a  suitable work system with  the  various

schemes  of  reward and incentive so as  to  increase

productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of economic pressure,

economic protectionism has more and more been adopted

in   many   Western  countries.  This   is   becoming

increasingly  clear. Such a trend is unfavourable  to

developing  countries.  Therefore,  closer   economic

cooperation  in  developing  countries,  particularly

among   ASEAN   countries,  is  most  important   and

necessary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



Recently, our country has come into an agreement with

the Philippines on an across-the-board 10% tariff cut

and a partial 10% tariff cut with Thailand, This is a

step  forward in the economic cooperation among ASEAN

countries,  It  is our hope that in the  near  future

similar  agreements can be extended  to  other  ASEAN

partners,  Mr Speaker, Sir, it is also our hope  that

there  will be more multilateral and bilateral  trade

agreements  among ASEAN countries in order  to  bring

about a break-through in the tariff barriers, thereby

extending  and  expanding trade on a  mutual  benefit

basis,  In  this way, the greater the  prosperity  of

ASEAN,  the greater the improvement on the livelihood

of  the people and thereby the greater the ability of

ASEAN countries to combat the threat of communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to deal with the question of

personal relief and earned income relief in  our  tax

system,  Several  Members have raised  this  question

earlier  and I do not want to repeat their  arguments

here,  I  have noted that the present rates of  $2000

for  personal  relief  and $1000  for  earned  income

relief  were  fixed  as  far  back  as  1948.  It  is

therefore my hope that the Minister for Finance would

ask his officers to calculate on this basis, that is,

using 1948 as the base year, what should be the  cost

of  living  index for 1977. Once this cost of  living

index  has  been worked out, then you will  know  how

unrealistic the present system of tax reliefs can be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the PAP Government is noted for its

hard  work, efficiency, farsightedness and  fairness.

The  so-called fairness means the fairness with which

the  Government accords to the people. When inflation

brought  about an increase in the cost of production,

the  Government raised various taxes and  rates.  The

people accepted this. Similarly, since inflation  has

brought about an increase in the cost of living,  the

Government should correspondingly raise the  personal

relief  and earned income relief. Otherwise, it  will

not  be  fair,  It will be "heads I  win,  tails  you

lose."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of taxation again, we have the

past  experience  of the right hand  giving  out  the

money only to be taken away by the left hand, We have

noted, Sir, that in the past when the NWC recommended

wage increases, they were immediately followed by tax

increases  of one kind or another. I am  not  against

taxation as such. But I am earnestly suggesting  that

when tax increases are being considered the interests

of the middle and lower income groups should be taken

care  of  so  that we will not give  the  people  the

impression  that we are giving away  money  with  the

right hand and taking it back with the left hand,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally. Sir, I would like to deal with the problem

of  assisting  old people. As a result of  scientific

research, there have been discoveries and inventions

in  the  fields of medicine in the form of new  drugs

and  clinical  instruments.  Besides  there  was  the

unprecedented economic development accompanied by  an

improvement in the livelihood of our people, and  the

life   span  of  our  people  in  general  has   also

increased, According to statistics, Sir, there are at

present  thousands of old people in  Singapore.  This

figure will increase from year to year. Those who are

fortunate may be taken care of by their children, But

those  who  are not so fortunate, being  forsaken  by

their  children or senile or widowed,  will  have  to

depend  on  public assistance provided by the  Social

Welfare Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Ministry of Health set up a Home

Nursing  Fund  to look after the poor and  needy  old

people,  but  this scheme is still  in  its  infancy.

Apart from this, every year we have this exercise  of

giving  out  ang pows or gifts to old people  in  the

various constituencies. This is all that we have done

and  are  doing for the old people or senior citizens

who  have  given their best lives to the country  and

the society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Sir, the question of old people has

aroused  the attention of the knowledgeables  of  our

society and discussions of their problems have become

more  and  more  frequent. But the  problems  of  old

people cannot be solved by mere



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



academic  discussions.  I feel  that  there  are  two

aspects  to  the problems of the aged.  First, apart

from  food,  there is the need for medical  care  and

healthy  recreation. Second, I think we  should  also

give  them  some meaning in their lives so that  they

may  feel  they are still capable of contributing  to

our nation and not be a burden to it. The Ministry of

Social  Affairs,  besides giving  assistance,  should

look into the question of what the old people can  do

to  contribute to society. No doubt, old  people  may

not   be  capable  of  high  productivity  but   some

productivity   is   definitely   better    than    no

productivity.  So we should not allow old  people  to

sit  down idling and doing nothing. We can find  some

kind  of  work to keep them occupied and to let  them

prove  that  they  can do something  useful  for  the

society and the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion moved by the Member for

Ulu Pandan to thank the President for his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. In

response to the appeal by the hon. Member for Geylang

East to the Ministry of Science and Technology to use

university  staff in solar energy research,  I  would

like to take this opportunity to inform him that  the

Faculty of Engineering is already actively engaged in

solar energy research.



<br><br>5.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, permit me to associate

myself with my colleagues in support of the Motion to

thank the President for his Speech in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electorate in the last elections has returned

all  of  us  to  this  Parliament.  This  proves  the

maturity of thinking and the political sophistication

of  the  people of Singapore. This victory is  not  a

personal  victory of the candidates  nor  is  it  the

result  of the promises we gave to the people  during

electioneering. They have given their mandate  to  us

on the basis of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



achievements  from the time we took over  control  of

the  Government. However, we should not be complacent

with what we have achieved if we are to preserve  our

record  in this House. We should work hard to achieve

further  success or at least to preserve  the  record

that  we have achieved, Although we are all from  one

party,  this  Parliament is not a  one-party  system.

This  is  the  choice  of  the  people  through   the

democratic process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentary democracy will not be available if the

communists were to take power, It is clear that the

communists and its allies are the principal enemy of

parliamentary democracy. We should recapitulate what

happened in our country in the past. The communists

had tried to take over the trade unions, the student

unions and also political parties, they failed in

the end, We must not forget that the communists, pro-communists and their allies are people who never

give up. They will continue to struggle until their
