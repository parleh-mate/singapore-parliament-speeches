<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX RELIEFS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOR AGED PARENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Finance   if   he  will  consider   introducing

amending   legislation  to  allow  income   tax

reliefs to tax-payers who are maintaining their

aged parents.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in Asian societies, the

support  of  aged  parents is  an  acknowledged

responsibility of all decent citizens.  Indeed,

Confucius  has  elevated  this  into  a   basic

ethical   principle,  and   Chinese   classical

literature   is   replete  with   examples   of

outstanding  acts  of filial  piety.  In  these

circumstances, it would be unworthy  of  us  to

introduce  mercenary  considerations  such   as

relief from income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this approach does not appeal to the

hon.  Member,  may I add a less  traditionalist

argument?   An   International  Monetary   Fund

mission  has recently examined our  tax  system

and   has  stated  that  our  tax  reliefs  are

overgenerous   and  could  with  advantage   be

reduced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PROPERTY TAX</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Notices for payment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether notices for payment of

property tax on attap or wooden houses are sent

annually  to  the house-owners so as  to  avoid

their having to pay accumulated arrears for  as

many as five years' tax in one payment; and (b)

whether he is aware that some such house-owners

who  had been ordered to demolish their  houses

have had to pay five years' arrears of property

tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, notices for payment of

property  tax  in  respect of  known  attap  or

wooden   houses   are  sent  out   half-yearly,

although, in law, property owners are  required

to   pay  property  tax  in  respect  of  their

property without demand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is known that there had been, cases

of  landlords  who,  with  a  view  to  evading

property  tax, had let out their  property  and

collected  rents  without  informing  the   tax

department  and  without paying  property  tax.

When   these   cases  were  discovered,   these

landlords  were  made to pay the  property  tax

due, notwithstanding the fact that the property

in question was under an order for demolition.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING LOANS TO CIVIL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SERVANTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  (a)  how many applications  have  been

received  from, civil servants  for  loans  to

purchase  houses  built by  private  developers

from  1st  January,  1964,  up  to  the  latest

convenient  date, and the total amount  of  the

loans   applied  for;  (b)  how  many  of   the

applications have been approved,  and  what  is

the total amount of the loans granted; (c) what

are  the  reasons or grounds for  rejecting  an

application;  and (d) whether he will  consider

relaxing  the rules governing applications  for

housing  loans  by  granting  loans  to   civil

servants  who are already living in  their  own

houses  and who wish to exchange their existing

houses for bigger ones.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Up to 30th September, 1969, 992

applications for loans amounting to $22,721,460

were received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A total of 771 applications for loans

amounting to $16,775,770 were approved.

Ninety-two applications for loans

amounting to $2,013,400 were withdrawn.

Thirty-five applications for loans

amounting to $810,180 are under consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Applications are rejected where the applicant

is  ineligible under the Government  Officers'

Housing  Loan Scheme, e.g. where the applicant

already owns a house, and has previously  been

granted a loan to purchase a house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Each case is considered on its merits. As a

general rule, because the interest rates  are

low  and  the  Scheme is intended  to  assist

those  who  do not own houses, the exchanging

of  houses  for bigger ones is  not  allowed,

unless there are exceptional circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, it is not a question of exchanging a house.

What  would be the answer in the case of an officer

who  having had a housing loan now sells the  house

with the intention of buying another?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> As I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, the interest rates

for  housing loans are very low. Also, these  loans

are primarily meant to help Government officers who

do  not  own  houses. If they already  had  housing

loans,  normally their applications  would  not  be

approved unless there were special circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, can the Parliamentary Secretary enlighten.

me  on  what the "special circumstances" are before

an officer is entitled to a second loan?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, each application will be

considered  on  its  merits. Unless  the  applicant

lists his special circumstances, I will not be able

to  tell  the Member whether or not the application

will  be  approved.  But if he has  any  particular

application in mind, perhaps he will send it to the

appropriate  authority who will no  doubt  consider

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Sir, can the Parliamentary Secretary inform the

House of any example of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



"special  circumstances" that has been  applied  in

such a case?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all cases will be considered on

their   merits.  Unless  the  Member  can  give   a

particular   case,  I  cannot  really  answer   his

question.  To  do  so would, in fact,  just  be  an

academic exercise.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, is there any discrimination between lowly-paid and highly-paid Government officers in the

consideration of housing loans?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I do not think so, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether free primary education  will  be

given  to children born in the Republic of  parents

who are non-citizens but are permanent residents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, children born in the Republic

prior  to  16th September, 1963, are  eligible  for

free  primary  education.  Children  born  in   the

Republic  on  or  after 16th September,  1963,  are

eligible  (in  accordance with the Constitution  of

the  Republic in respect of citizenship)  for  free

primary  education  only if at  least  one  of  the

parents is a Singapore citizen. However, those born

in  the Republic on or after 16th September,  1963,

of  non-citizen parents, at least one of  whom  has

been permanently residing in the Republic prior  to

1st  January, 1966, will be required to pay the old

rate of school fees, which is only $2.50 per month.

<div align="center"><b>UNIVERSITY NIGHT COURSES FOR WORKING CLASS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for

Education if he will examine the feasibility of the

running  of university courses at night  to  afford

young working-class people the opportunity to do  a

university course.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our university education has

expanded at a considerable speed recently, and with

the reorganisation that is taking place, it would

be desirable for our universities to consolidate

their existing commitments and to expand further

only in those areas which are to serve the more

urgent needs of the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though university resources are at present

limited   in  terms  of  finance  and  staff,   the

University Extra-mural Studies Department has  been

organising courses for the last six years to fulfil

the needs of persons who are already in employment.

The   Adult  Education  Board  also  runs   further

education  classes  to afford  young  working-class

people the opportunity of further education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, does the Government intend to

organise night courses at the universities to cater

for the young working-class people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just given two reasons why

it  is  not  feasible to run night courses  at  the

universities.

<div align="center"><b>DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST OFFICIALS AND TEAMS FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BAD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONDUCT IN TOURNAMENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for

Education  what action has been taken to deal  with

(i)  players and officials who beat up referees  at

tournaments  sponsored  by  the  Schools'   Sports

Council  at  both school and district levels;  and

(ii)  school teams which displayed bad  conduct  at

national  tournaments; and what measures have  been

taken to prevent similar occurrences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as

this Ministry is aware, there was only one incident

in  the Basketball National Championship Tournament

sponsored  by the Combined Schools' Sports  Council

this  year. The referee's decision during a keenly-contested  match between two schools was  not  well

received  by  some spectators. In  the  melee  that

ensued when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



spectators  invaded the court, a coach was  alleged

to  have  assaulted the referee. The  coach  denied

this   allegation  of  assault,  but   nevertheless

apologised to the referee concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basketball Convenors Committee has

recommended  to  the  Singapore Combined  Secondary

Schools' Sports Council that in future tournaments:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Officials and players must adhere strictly to

the  decision of the referee. A team  will  be

disqualified for the whole tournament  if  any

violence  breaks out as a result of  the  non-acceptance of the referee's decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Principals must place great emphasis on good

sportsmanship  and  discipline  among   their

teachers,  pupils and players throughout  the

tournament.



<br><br>These  recommendations were conveyed to all  school

principals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry takes a very serious view of any

misconduct  by  teachers and pupils  during  sports

competitions. In future, such misbehaviour will  be

dealt  with severely and any teacher or pupil found

guilty  may  be dismissed from service or  expelled

from school.

in  payments to school traffic wardens, and  if  he

will look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, school traffic wardens are paid

twice  monthly and the majority of the  claims  for

payment are sent to the Ministry by post on the 1st

and  16th  of  each  month.  Payment  is  made   to

principals  by  cheques sent  by  post.  Delays  in

payment  largely  arise  from  late  submission  of

claims  or  mistakes in claims  which  have  to  be

returned  to  the schools for rectification.  There

in  the  year  as  a  result  of  the  transfer  of

responsibility  to this Ministry from  the  Police,

when new arrangements had to be made for submission

and  processing of claim forms. However,  now  that

the  system has been in operation for some  months,

delays are minimal. For instance, this month, as of

the  10th,  there were only 15 late submissions  in

respect  of  151  claims for  the  second  half  of

September 1969.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, can the Minister ask his Ministry to prepare

the salaries for school traffic wardens a month  in

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I certainly will consider that suggestion from

the Member.

<div align="center"><b>(Luggage storage facilities and luggage clearance)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Communications (a) if consideration will  be  given

to providing luggage storage facilities for transit

passengers at the Paya Lebar International Airport;

and  (b)  if  he will look into ways and  means  to

speed  up  the clearance of luggage at the  arrival

channels.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, air passengers who remain

inside the Transit Lounge of our Paya Lebar Airport

do  not require luggage storage facilities as their

baggage  would  be  transferred directly  from  one

aircraft  to  another  by the  airlines  concerned.

However,  for  those  transit  passengers  who   go

through  the  arrival formalities,  there  are  two

rooms  in  the Arrival Block to keep their baggage.

If they do not wish to leave their baggage in these

rooms, they will have to make separate arrangements

with the airline offices concerned at the Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baggage of arriving passengers is, at

present,   being   handled   by   three   different

organisations. Our Department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



of  Civil  Aviation handles the  baggage  of  seven

airlines,  K.L.M. handles two (including  its  own)

and   Malaysia-Singapore  Airlines  14.   As   this

arrangement is unsatisfactory, a study is afoot for

the early formation of a separate company to handle

the   baggage   of  all  arriving   and   departing

passengers at Paya Lebar Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Department of Civil Aviation is also planning

to  install at least two more conveyor belts in the

Arrival Block (making a total of four) in order  to

speed  up the conveyance of baggage to the  Customs

examination area after they have been taken off the

aircraft. The work will be carried out as  soon  as

plans  for  certain modifications to  the  existing

terminal   building  have  been   finalised.   When

completed,  it  will be possible for passengers  to

claim  their  own baggage from the conveyor  belts,

thus  speeding  up the movement of baggage  at  the

arrival channels.

<div align="center"><b>DRIVING LICENCES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Communications if he will consider the issuing of a

more durable driving licence and including the date

of first issue in it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Our new driving licence is made of good quality

paper  (rag  paper)  which, if  carefully  handled,

should  easily last up to its renewal date,  be  it

one year or three years' time, as the case may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested, however, that our driving

licences  could perhaps be plasticized, as  in  the

case   of   our  identity  cards.  I   have   given

instructions  for such a feasibility  study  to  be

made.  One  problem  immediately  presents  itself.

Should  we  decide  to  issue plastic-type  driving

licences,  it  will be necessary  to  do  so  at  a

central   place  whereas,  at  present, for   the

convenience   of  the  public,  we   have   already

decentralised  the  renewal  of  driving   licences

whereby  a person can renew his driving licence  on

the spot at any of 15 specified post offices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another practical difficulty is that sometimes

particulars in the driving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



licence   have   to   be  altered;   for   example,

disqualification  of  the  driver  from  driving  a

certain  class of vehicle. With the plastic driving

licence,  it would be difficult to effect  such  an

amendment on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of the inclusion of the

date  of first issue in the driving licence,  there

are  certain practical difficulties which  must  be

pointed  out.  The  present driving  licence  is  a

composite  one authorising its holder,  if  he  has

passed  the  relevant test, to drive  a  number  of

classes  of vehicles such as motorcycle,  motorcar,

heavy  motorcar, motor tractor, etc. The  dates  of

authorisation for the driver to drive  the  various

classes of vehicles are likely to be different  and

it  is  not possible to record these dates  on  the

driving  licence  without  having  to  produce   an

oversized driving licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a person desire to know the date of

original  issue  for personal reasons  or  for  the

purpose  of  providing prospective  employers  with

references  as  to  his  driving  experience,  this

information,  if so required, may be obtained  from

the Registrar of Vehicles Department on payment  of

a nominal search fee of $2.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Rag paper, as its name implies, is not a good

paper. However, is the Minister aware that even  up

till  today some police constables do not recognise

this   new  licence?  Has  the  police  force  been

informed of the change?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We are responsible for issuing the driving

licences.  Perhaps my colleague, the  Minister  for

Defence,  will  follow up on what  the  Member  for

Mountbatten has said about the police force?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am unaware that members of

the  police force do not recognise the new licence.

Can the hon. Member mention any specific case?

Communications if he will consider (a) taking steps

to   enforce  more  strictly  and  effectively  the

regulation that no taxi-driver can refuse a fare on

the ground that the passenger's intended journey is

too  short;  and (b) issuing more taxi licences  in

order to provide more employment opportunities  and

also  to  discourage taxi-drivers from  refusing  a

passenger because of the shortness of the  intended

journey.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, up to 1959, an Enforcement

Section (comprising 51 inspectors) in the Registrar

of Vehicles Department was responsible for carrying

out  enforcement duties in respect of  recalcitrant

taxi-drivers,  etc.  However, because  of  frequent

allegations  of  corruption  and  high   handedness

against  this Enforcement Section, it was dissolved

in  that  year  -  ten years ago. Since  then,  the

enforcement functions in respect of public  service

vehicles  have  been placed in  the  hands  of  the

Traffic Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, taxi-drivers who refuse fares on the

ground that the passenger's intended journey is too

short  are  suspended from driving for a  specified

period, ranging from one week to one month, and the

Transport Advisory Board is currently looking  into

this  problem with a view to finding more effective

ways of dealing with such offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am waiting for the recommendations of the

Transport Advisory Board on the subject whether  or

not  it  is  desirable to issue more taxi licences,

and Government's decision will be made known at the

appropriate time.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the Enforcement

Section  was  closed down in 1959 as  a  result  of

allegations  against it. Is there  a  move  by  the

Ministry  to employ vehicle inspectors to see  that

taxi-drivers do not refuse a passenger's fare if he

wants to go only a short distance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I have already indicated in my answer that the

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister of Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the role of the Sports Division

This  includes assistance in obtaining  coaches  of

supplementary funds and finding suitable venues for

by  the Sports Division of my Ministry to train the

most  promising badminton players with  a  view  to

entering  for the Thomas Cup Championship  in  1969

and 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was a request for an open trial to

appointed full time specifically to train the  most

promising players for the Zone Finals in the Thomas

Cup  in  1969,  and that he had been  coaching  the

Thomas Cup Squad or the national Badminton Team for

well over a year, the final composition of the team

would best be left in his hands.

taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, not even one complaint of low

water  pressure  in Jalan Perisai or  St.  Joseph's

the   Public   Utilities  Board  other   than   the

representation made by the hon. Member on behalf of

the   residents  in  these  areas.  It   has   been

ascertained  that  the  water  pressure  in   Jalan

Perisai  was  and  still is satisfactory.  But  the

water  pressure  in  St.  Joseph's  Lane  and  Holy

Innocents  Lane was low due to inadequate sub-mains

and  consumers' service pipes. Remedial action  has

been  taken  by  the  Public  Utilities  Board   by

extending the existing two and a quarter inch  sub-main  at St. Joseph's Lane by about 500 feet  at  a

cost  of $1,000, and by laying a new six-inch  main

about 1,625 feet long at a cost of $19,000 in  Holy

Innocents  Lane. The water pressure in these  areas

is now satisfactory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am surprised that the

from  the  residents in the three areas  mentioned.

Would  he be interested to ascertain from the Board

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ng, perhaps you did not hear the first part

not think we need split hairs on this point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, it is true that the complaints were made

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am afraid I do not know of other complaints,

Sir.  The  Public  Utilities Board  supplies  water

of  Punggol.  But  if  there are  other  low  water

pressure  areas in Punggol, I hope the Member  will

bring them to the attention of the Public Utilities

Board or to me. There are always low water pressure

areas  in Singapore due either to repairs of  pipes

or  maintenance service of our filtration plants at

Woodlands  and Bukit Timah. But it is the  practice

of the Public Utilities Board to give notice of any

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Land Acquisition

Act,     1966,    Government    pays    reasonable

compensation  to owners of lands and  houses  when

their property is acquired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles for the determination of

compensation are provided in section 33 of the Act.

The  Member may recall that the provisions of  the

Act  were  considered  by a Select  Committee.  The

Committee  also  considered  representations   from

various quarters before the Bill was passed. Owners

of  lands  and  houses  to be  acquired  are  given

reasonable and just compensation in accordance with

the  Act.  Furthermore, under this Act, the  owners

concerned have the right to appeal if they are  not

satisfied with the compensation given to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, under this Act, if a person has a

temporary  house or fruit trees in somebody  else's

land,  he  too  would  get compensation  under  the

rehousing scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary in his explanation

mentioned  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1966.   Of

course,  I  dare  not  oppose  that  law.  But  the

Government should give reasonable compensation.  It

acquires  lands at a very low price but sells  them

at  a high price. There is no provision in the  Act

prohibiting  such practice of the  Government.  The

Government  does  not take into  consideration  the

present  market price of lands. There  is  a  great

difference in the present market price of  land  as

compared to that in 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lee, what is your supplementary

question, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I wanted to say that the law on acquisition of

lands should have provisions to the effect that the

Government must not pay compensation at a low



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



rate when the market price of the land is high. The

rate should be dependent upon the prevailing market

price of the land.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, you can question the Minister or the

Parliamentary  Secretary on the  administration  of

the  Land  Acquisition Act. But I do not think  you

can question them on the provisions in the Act. The

Parliamentary   Secretary's   answer    was    that

compensation is based on the provisions in the Act.

Is  your  supplementary question directed to  bring

about a change in the law or its administration?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what I meant was that the Government should

compensate   the   landowners  according   to   the

prevailing market price of lands.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in my answer to the Member for Ulu Pandan, I

mentioned that payment of compensation is based  on

section  33 of the Land Acquisition Act,  1966.  If

the  Member  has read section 33 (a), he  will  see

that it is clearly stated that in acquisition,  the

market value is one of the factors to be taken into

consideration in determining compensation.  So  how

can  he  say  that  the Government  disregards  the

market price?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to give an example. In the North

Bridge  Road vicinity, I was told that compensation

is  paid at the rate of $8 per square foot. But the

present  market price is $112 per square foot.  How

can  there  be such a big difference?  Perhaps  the

assessor  was wrong in determining the compensation

rate.  I  would  also  like  to  add  that  further

consideration should be given to improve  the  Land

Acquisition Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, will the compensation given when Government

acquires land be extended to tenants as well as sub-tenants of houses which are affected as a result of

acquisition by Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, compensation for acquisition is paid only to

owners of lands and houses.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, will the Ministry look into the possibility

of  extending  compensation  to  tenants  and  sub-tenants  as well, because they suffer just as  much

as, if not more than, the owners of the houses?

we  have  a  compensation scheme to deal  with  the

tenants and sub-tenants.

clinics;  and (b) whether he will consider  waiving

the  charges payable by a person on the  second  or

subsequent visit to a hospital or outpatient clinic

for  the  change or removal of dressing which  does

not entail any consultation with the doctor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



of   charges  for  medical  services  provided   in

Government  hospitals and outpatient clinics  would

be  too  long and complicated to detail.  They  are

recorded in a printed pamphlet entitled The  Scheme

of   Charges   for  Government  Hospital   Services

(including Outpatient Services) 1969. This pamphlet

may be purchased by any member of the public at  $1

a  copy, either from the Government Printer or from

the  Publications Bureau at Fullerton  Building.  A

copy  will be made available to the Member for  his

information if he so desires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very briefly and without going into detail, the

Scheme  of Charges prescribes the charges  for  the

various  services, and, in certain cases, sets  out

the  categories of persons eligible  for  exemption

from  charges for in-patient hospital services  and

for out-patient services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital in-patient charges are of two

categories,   namely,  ward  charges  and   service

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) These charges vary according to the type of

patients (medical, surgical or psychiatric) and the

class of ward into which he seeks admission. For

medical and surgical patients, the daily ward

charge is as follows: -



<pre>

     Class A  -  $45 per day

     Class B  -  $20 per day

     Class C  -  A token charge of $1 per day.

</pre>



<br>The charges for psychiatric patients are different,

being  $20  and  $10 per day for A  and  B  classes

respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Service charges may be taken as charges for

treatments, investigations and other services which

are charged according to the type of service given.

These services would be too long to describe here.

The service charge for delivery in the maternity

hospital, e.g., is $200 for A Class and $100 for B

Class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Charges for outpatients are made on the

basis of each attendance and vary according to the

outpatient services provided. At the travelling

dispensaries, the charge  is  20  cents  per

attendance; at the outpatient dispensaries, it is 80



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



cents  per  attendance on week days and  $1.50  per

attendance on Sundays and public holidays.  At  the

specialists clinics in the hospitals, the  rate  is

$1.50 per attendance.

The  attendance charge in each case  is  an  all-in

charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replying to the second part of the question, I

would  say  that the outpatient attendance  charge,

whether  at  specialist medical clinics, outpatient

dispensaries or travelling dispensaries, is  merely

a  nominal one. It does not come any way  near  the

total  cost of the services provided. It is only  a

consolidated   charge  for  the  various   services

provided,  which include the professional attention

of  doctors,  nurses,  laboratory  technicians  and

others, the provision of medicines and the carrying

out  of  investigations.  Thus,  it  will  not   be

possible  to  agree to a waiver  of  these  nominal

charges  merely because the patient  may  not  have

seen  the  doctor when attending the dispensary  to

have  his  dressing changed. There are still  costs

for  the  services provided by the nurse and  other

incidental expenses which could be accounted for in

the nominal charge levied.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Does the Minister consider the charges of 80

cents  and  $1.50 for the second and  third  visits

respectively merely to remove a dressing justified?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I repeat what I have just

said.  I  said that the charge of 80 cents  is, in

fact,  an  attendance charge.  Secondly, it  is  a

nominal charge and it is, in fact, not possible  to

work  out the cost of each attendance. As  I  have

said earlier, this is a consolidated charge and  we

have to make a flat rate charge.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, will the Minister at least consider the

waiving  of  these charges for cases which  are  in

receipt  of  public  assistance  from  the   Social

Welfare Department?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the charges are normally waived

in  cases  where  the persons are receiving  social

welfare assistance, if an application is made.

<div align="center"><b>ADVERTISING RATES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Payment by non-profit making institutions)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr

J. F. Conceicao -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. To ask the Minister for Culture why non-profit making institutions have now to pay for

advertisements  on Radio and TV at full  commercial

rates.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Conceicao.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Question No. 15.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, by non-profit making

institutions,  I presume the Member for  Katong  is

referring   to  Government  departments,  statutory

boards,   cultural  organisations  and   charitable

bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury has ruled that with effect from 1st

August,   1969,  all  Government  departments   and

statutory  boards have to pay for advertising  over

radio  and TV at rates currently applicable to  all

advertisers.    Consequently,   the    Broadcasting

Division  decided that an anomalous situation  will

arise  if  cultural  organisations  and  charitable

bodies were not charged advertising fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale behind Treasury's ruling is that

from  the cost effectiveness point of view,  it  is

essential that departments and statutory boards  be

able to show the results of its efforts in the true

light   of   costs.  This  rationale   is   equally

applicable to cultural organisations and  statutory

bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government departments now pay for their

advertising   by  journal  adjustments.   Statutory

boards  pay  by  cheque  or cash  along  commercial

lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that certain cultural

organisations  and  charitable bodies  may  not  be

financially  capable of paying  for  radio  and  TV

advertisements. Administratively, a  procedure  has

to  be  evolved  whereby such  bodies  with  worthy

objectives may apply to the Treasury for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



grant  for  such  advertising. In such  cases,  the

merits  of  each  effort  can  be  scrutinised  and

evaluated.

<div align="center"><b>AUDIENCE RATING SURVEY BY RTS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr

J. F. Conceicao -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. To ask the Minister for Culture whether RTS

will conduct a Television and Radio audience rating

survey for various programmes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Conceicao.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai:</b> Question No. 16.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to the Member for

Katong  is  "Yes". Indeed, Radio and T.V. Singapore

is extremely keen to have such a survey. It is only

on  the  basis  of reliable findings  from  such  a

survey   that  programme  planning  and  commercial

policy can be founded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Estimates, a sum of $30,000 has

been  provided for such a survey. RTS, in  planning

for  such  a survey, has liaised closely  with  the

Economic  Research  Centre  of  the  University  of

Singapore  and  the  Statistics Department  of  the

Government.  A paper has been prepared setting  out

proposals  on  the methods to be  used  in  such  a

survey.  This  paper  has  been  submitted  to  the

Commission  of  Inquiry on Statistical  Activities,

and   it  is  hoped  that  the  findings  of   this

Commission  will  support  Broadcasting  Division's

appeal for adequate funds for such a survey.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Question No. 17.

(Private) Limited is a limited company wholly owned

by Government and whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



this company also functions and does business as  a

travel agency.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Culture if RTS has become a Travel Agency, and why.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his

question   the  Member  for  Katong  is  presumably

referring  to  RTS  Enterprises (Private)  Ltd., a

wholly-owned subsidiary of RTS. RTS  itself  has not become a travel  agency. RTS Enterprises (Private) Ltd. has a travel  department

which  serves as a travel agency to Government  and

statutory bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong will appreciate that

Government  and statutory bodies have  to  incur  a

substantial amount for travel for their officers on

duty overseas. If the passages for such travel were

purchased by Government directly, the full price of

the passage has to be paid. As all airlines give  a

commission to travel agents, the establishment of a

travel  department within RTS Enterprises (Private)

Ltd, has enabled the Company to earn the commission

payable to travel agents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister for Culture

enlighten  the House on the difference in functions

between RTS Enterprises (Private) Ltd, and RTS?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, RTS, that is

the  Broadcasting Division, normally  performs  the

duties   of   the   Broadcasting  Department.   RTS

Enterprises  (Private) Ltd., which is  a  corporate

body but one fully owned by Government, enters into

the  production of records, promotion of shows  and

also acts as a travel agency for the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister for Culture

give  us  the  figures  of the  amount  of  savings

effected by performing this function for Government

and Government agencies?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



but in the case of the travel agency, since it

began business in November

1968, it has earned up to 30th June, 1969, a

commission of $15,612 from

airlines.

a Certificate of Urgency signed by the President in

respect  of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)

(Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are typed copies of

the Bill available for distribution to Members?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)

Ordinance, 1955,  which  will  lapse  on  the  20th

October,  1969, by extending its life for a  period

of another five years with effect from 1st October,

1969.  As hon. Members may be aware, this Ordinance

provides  primarily for the maintenance  of  public

safety, peace and good order, prevention of strikes

and  lock-outs in essential services, and detention

and   supervision   of  persons   associated   with

activities of a criminal nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its introduction, this Ordinance has been

of considerable value in curbing secret society

activities and the number of secret society

incidents has shown a downward trend as follows: -



<pre>

                   Number of secret

    Year          society  incidents

    1959                 416

    1967                  74

    1968                  74

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Members will appreciate that it

is necessary to rehabilitate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



and  re-educate secret society gangsters while they

are  under detention in order that when they return

to  society  on their release, we hope  they  would

become    law-abiding    and    useful    citizens.

Rehabilitation  takes  time  and  varies  with  the

individual.  Some  may  respond  quickly   to   the

rehabilitation  programme,  while  others  need   a

longer period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members are most probably aware that only the hard-core secret society members are put under

detention  orders.  The  others  are  placed  under

police  supervision  orders for  a  period  of  two

years.  This enables the less dangerous members  of

secret  societies to earn their livelihood and,  at

the same time, enables the police to keep track  of

their  movements  outside their  working  hours  in

order to curb their anti-social activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also interest Members to know that since

the implementation of the Ordinance on 15th August,

1958,  up  to  and  including  April  1969,  13,241

persons have been arrested under the provisions  of

section  55.  Out  of these, 762  persons  are  now

detained  under section 47 (a) and 642 persons  are

ordered to be placed under police supervision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the current situation with regard to

secret  societies in the Republic is under control,

there  is  still a need for constant  vigil  to  be

kept.   It   is   therefore  essential   that   the

suppression  of  secret societies in  the  Republic

should  go on relentlessly, especially in  view  of

the possible involvement in racial disturbances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Lim Kim San].

<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of

Supply [Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the First Supplementary Development

Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1st

January,  1969, to 31st March, 1970,  contained  in

Paper  Cmd. 24 of 1969. The summary is on the  last

page   of  the  Paper.  There  are  two  heads   of

expenditure and amendments in respect of both heads

stand on the Order Paper Supplement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 71 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 71 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 302.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is interesting to note from Paper Cmd. 24

of 1969 that,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In conjunction with the celebrations in

commemoration  of  the  150th  Anniversary  of  the

Founding of Singapore, stereophonic broadcasts have

been commenced in the Republic this year.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would, therefore, mean to me, Sir, that there

would  have  been  no  stereophonic  broadcasts  if

Singapore had not celebrated its 150th anniversary.

In fact, stereophonic music has been here for quite

some  time.  I  think  it  must  have  struck   the

ingenuity of someone in the Broadcasting Department

that  it  was  a  novel idea to  introduce  such  a

service.  It  means  buying  a  radio  set   or   a

transistor  radio set with an FM stereophonic  band

in  order to receive such broadcasts. Sir, I stress

on  the FM stereophonic band because I remember the

FM  station has already been in existence for quite

some   time.  If  a  listener  wishes  to   receive

stereophonic broadcasts, he must buy a set that has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



this  band,  otherwise he will continue to  receive

music  without stereophonic effects. Therefore,  my

conclusion is obvious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I shall be grateful to the Minister for

Culture  if  he will inform the House  whether  any

careful  consideration was given  in  all  respects

before  introducing such a service, and  whether  a

survey  has  been made to establish the  number  of

listeners tuning in to such a service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I would ask the Minister if a

$10  token  provision in the Development  Estimates

means the provision of a further sum of $50,000. If

savings  in  the current Development Estimates  can

warrant increased expenditure, I would like to  see

more   urgent  items  of  expenditure,   like   the

construction  of  abattoirs  in  the  rural  areas,

treated with the same priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek elucidation from the

Minister  regarding the actual  source  of  savings

amounting  to  $14,990.  Did  it  come   from   the

Development Estimates pertaining to his Ministry or

otherwise?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1967 Radio Singapore has

been  operating  four radio channels  on  frequency

modulation,  commonly known as FM.  These  channels

were  an  addition  to the four existing  amplitude

modulation, commonly called AM medium wave channel.

The  four channels were radiated without the device

called the encoder to enable a receiving set with a

decoder  to receive such broadcasts in stereophonic

sound. It was felt that the time had come for  such

FM  broadcasts  to be improved to the  level  where

stereophonic sounds can be radiated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for

Punggol  in connection with the source of  savings,

the  token  provision  of $10  in  the  Development

Estimates  for this year was made for the  purchase

of  stereophonic equipment. A sum  of  $14,990  was

found from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



savings   from   subhead   201,   Improvements   to

Television and Broadcasting Services. The House  is

now  asked for a supplementary provision of $50,000

to make a total of $65,000 needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other point, since

stereophonic broadcasts started only in  July  this

year,  it  is  too  soon to conduct  a  survey.  An

overall  survey of listeners and their  preferences

is   being   planned   and,   when   carried   out,

stereophonic broadcasts will certainly be included.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $50,000 for Head 71 ordered to stand

part   of   the   First  Supplementary  Development

Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1st

January, 1969, to 31st March, 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 102 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 102 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 205.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the explanatory note to this subhead clearly

stresses  the need for more vehicles  to  meet  the

increasing   demands   of  the   public   cleansing

services.  I would have thought that with assiduous

planning, the need of more vehicles for the  public

cleansing   services  would  have   received   high

priority  when the "Keep Singapore Clean"  campaign

was mounted last year. In other words, there should

have  been forward planning to enable the  Ministry

of Health to meet immediate requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence I would be grateful if the Minister for

Health  could enlighten the House on the date  when

such  vehicles  were ordered,  and  also  how  many

workers  are  manning them. I would  have  imagined

that   these  vehicles  would  have  already   been

purchased  and  are now on the road  serving  their

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I would like to suggest to the Minister to

look   into   the  possibility  of  introducing   a

cleansing service either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



at  night or in the early hours of the morning,  as

there is less traffic during, those hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister also look into the possibility

of   increasing  the  frequency  of  clearing  away

rubbish  and trade refuse from our bin centers?  To

illustrate, Sir, I notice that at two bin  centers

in  my  constituency, namely, at Punggol Road  8� m.s. and Upper Serangoon Road 6� m.s., the bins

are cleared in the morning, but by evening they are

full to the brim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first point that the Member

for Punggol made is the need for more public health

vehicles,   and  that  this  must  be  given   high

priority.  I cannot agree with him, more.  That  is

the  very  reason  why we are here  today  debating

these supplementary estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refuse load at present handled by the public

cleansing services is, approximately 1,200 tons per

day.  This is quite a marked increase compared with

800  tons  per day formerly handled, by the  Public

Health  Division.  I  am  glad  to  say  that  this

increase  in  refuse  removal  does  indicate   the

success  of  the  "Keep Singapore  Clean"  campaign

which  was  launched last year and  is, continuing

throughout this year as well. Although this  result

was  welcomed, it was quite unexpected  because  in

Government  planning you do not normally  expect  a

sudden  jump from 800 tons, to 1,200 tons per  day.

You  need additional equipment. As a result,  there

was, an  urgent  need  for  more  refuse  removal

vehicles.  The Member for Punggol also  asked  when

these  vehicles  were ordered.  They  were  ordered

immediately  after  the  Treasury  approved   their

purchase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which he made was, the request

for  greater frequency in the removal of refuse  in

Singapore. I do not know what he means by that.  At

the moment, we have daily removals, in other words,

once  every  day.  As a matter of fact,  since  the

enforcement  of the Employment Act,  we  have  been

able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



to  introduce refuse removal on Sundays and  public

holidays as well, resulting in an increase  in  the

number  of removals per week. I do not know if  the

Member  is  advocating that we should increase  the

number  of  removals from once to  twice  or  three

times a day. To put him in proper perspective,  may

I  bring to his attention the fact that in many big

cities  in  Europe  and America they  remove  their

refuse  only  three times a week, or  even  once  a

week. Even in the big city of New York, they remove

their refuse only three times a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Once a month!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> May I assure the Member for Punggol that with the

present provision, if it is approved by the  House,

the   number  of  refuse  vehicles  will  be  quite

adequate  to meet the needs of the Public Cleansing

Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was only suggesting to the

Minister to look into the possibility of a night or

early morning removal service. I was not advocating

that  it be made more frequently. However, in  view

of  the answers given by the Minister, I beg  leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 102 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 901.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the amount of $44,000 revoted for, a

further   sum  of  $37,460  is  required  for   the

construction  of Taman Jurong Market  I,  and  also

another  sum  of  $197,540  is  required  for   the

completion of Taman Jurong Market II.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a bit confused here. Perhaps the

Minister for Health can clear my confusion. Why are

two   markets   being  built   in   Taman   Jurong?

Approximately how many residents are there who will

benefit from the construction of these two markets?

Where are their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



exact  locations? Is it really necessary to put  up

two  markets in one area? How much revenue  can  be

collected  from them each year? Has the  Government

any  plans  to build one or more markets  in  other

constituencies?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In Punggol!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Not Punggol. It has one market which is adequate

for Punggol's purposes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that in the original

planning for the provision of markets in the Jurong

area,  especially in the proposed town  centre,  it

was  considered  that the provision  of  two  small

markets instead of one would render better and more

effective  service  for  the  expected  population.

There is not only the need to tie them in with  the

phases of development in Jurong Town, but there  is

also the need to allocate markets within convenient

distance  for  the residents of this  new  township

which  will  be more extensive in area when  it  is

fully developed. That indirectly answers the Member

for Punggol's point when he asked whether there was

any  need  for  two markets. As the  Member  knows,

Jurong  is going to be a big satellite town.  I  do

not  think  that  even these two  markets  will  be

sufficient   when   Jurong  is   eventually   fully

developed. But at the moment we consider  that  the

two markets are sufficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a few figures pertaining to the number of

stalls and the number of stalls occupied will  give

him an idea whether the two markets are going to be

fully  used.  In Taman Jurong Market I,  the  total

number  of  stalls  is 122; the  number  of  stalls

licensed  and taken up, up to date, is 95  and  the

number of stalls vacant is 27. In the market itself

there  are  a number of open pitches. These  number

112.  The number of pitches licensed and taken  up,

up  to date, is about 103 and the number vacant  is

nine.  This  does indicate that the  market  is  in

reasonable  use at the moment. But, of  course,  we

cannot expect it to be fully occupied because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



this  will depend on the occupation of the area  by

residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Taman Jurong Market II, the total number of

stalls  is about 122, and up to date the number  of

stalls licensed and taken up is 108. The number  of

vacant stalls is only 14. The total number of  open

pitches  is 65, and the number taken up is 56.  The

number vacant is nine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his general question about whether

the  Government  has any project to  construct  any

more new markets in the future, this is a point  of

considerable interest to the Ministry of Health. In

fact, the Ministry has always advocated that in the

long-term  plan, all hawkers should  conduct  their

business from within premises. In a count  made  in

December  last  year,  there  were  24,845   static

hawkers  in Singapore, of whom 15,135 were  engaged

in  the  sale of market produce. Only 7,711 hawkers

of  all  types  were accommodated within  premises,

such  as  markets and hawker centres. The remaining

17,000  hawkers were scattered all over the island,

particularly in the urban areas - in streets, foot-ways  and back-lanes. The resiting of hawkers  into

markets  and other premises is a project of mammoth

proportions, requiring careful planning and follow-through   action  by  the  planning  and   building

authorities   of   the  State.  The   location   of

appropriate  markets  and hawker  centres  must  be

considered  in the light of the overall development

planning for the island, and is not a matter within

the  sole  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Health.

Substantial capital cost will also be required. The

Ministry  of Health proposes to take the matter  up

with  the  appropriate agencies  and  is  presently

compiling the necessary data.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time.".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I wish to relieve the anxiety of

Members by saying that this Bill does not intend to

increase  the rates of stamp duty on the  heels  of

the  last  revision in January this year. It  deals

with  some  amendments  to the  provisions  of  the

existing Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, any change - however

minor - to the rate of stamp duty can only be  done

by  amending the Stamp Ordinance in Parliament. The

experience of the last revision of stamp duties  in

December  1968  has  proved  this  process  to   be

cumbersome  and unsatisfactory. Hon.  Members  will

remember  that the revision of the rates  of  stamp

duty  was  announced  by the Minister  for  Finance

during his Budget Statement, but the revision could

not  be effected until January 1969, because of the

need to amend the Stamp Ordinance. In the meantime,

there  was  a  rush to the Stamp Office  as  people

tried  to  jump the gun by getting their  documents

stamped  before the increased rates were  effected.

This  resulted not only in a loss of revenue,  but,

also  a  congestion  at  the  Stamp  Office,  which

prompted  an  hon.  Member to  ask  a  question  in

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this experience, it is now proposed to

add  a  new section to the Ordinance to enable  the

Minister  to  impose new duties or  to  revise  the

rates  of existing ones by an Order to be published

in  the  Gazette.  This amendment  will  bring  the

Ordinance in line

with  the  other revenue Ordinances,  such  as  the

Customs Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will remember that in my  answer  to

the question on the congestion at the Stamp Office,

I  said  that the Government was looking  into  the

question  of allowing more documents to be  stamped

by  franking machines so as to relieve the pressure

at  the counter of the Stamp Office. I am happy  to

say  that  the Government has now decided to  allow

insurance policies and contract notes to be stamped

by  postal franking machines. Clause 2 of the  Bill

seeks to effect this. At the same time, power  will

be given to the Minister to extend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



the number of instruments on which duty may be paid

by franking machines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fee for a Certificate to Practise for an

advocate   and   solicitor  has  been  specifically

provided  in  the Legal Profession Act,  this  duty

will  be removed from the Stamp Ordinance. This  is

stated in clause 14 (b) of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to clarify the position of

stamp  duty  in  relation to receipts,  letters  of

guarantee,  payment of stamp duties on  shares,  by

removing   the   ambiguities.   The   other   minor

amendments include deletion of rates from the  main

body  of  the  Ordinance,  renumbering  of  various

articles,   and   consequential  changes   to   the

Schedules of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr

Tang See Chim].

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the Bill as found in the

Explanatory   Statement  is  to   incorporate   the

National Sports Promotion Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has considered that the time has

come for sports to be organised and co-ordinated in

a  more  efficient way than hitherto if  it  is  to

fulfil  its  primary role of not  only  creating  a

physically rugged population



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



but   also  promoting  national  consciousness  and

identity in our multi-racial nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past ten years since the present

Government   came   to   power,   recognising   the

importance of sports and games as a unifying factor

of our nation made up of diverse races of immigrant

stock,  Government  has actively encouraged  sports

and  games as part of the activities of the network

of  community centres spread throughout the  island

and  of  the  extra-mural activities of  the  half-million school-going population. Other steps  taken

to   promote  sports  and  games  have   been   the

introduction since 1964 of the annual  Pesta  Sukan

when sporting teams from neighbouring countries are

invited to participate in the games around National

Day Week; the assistance given to the participation

of the Singapore contingent in international sports

events  such  as  the SEAP Games, the  Commonwealth

Games,  the Asian Games and the Olympic Games;  and

in  March  this year the launching of the  National

Fitness   Exercise   so   as   to   spread   sports

consciousness and physical well-being to a  greater

section of our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the active encouragement of sports and games,

Government   has  not  overlooked  the   need   for

increased facilities to be set up where sports  and

games    can   be   carried   out.   Besides    the

Extracurricular  Activity  Centre  built   by   the

Ministry of Education and the numerous school halls

and  fields  to cater for sports and games  amongst

the  school  children, Government,  realising  that

since  a  large percentage of our urban  population

are  residing  in  Housing  and  Development  Board

flats,  has  found  that it would  be  logical  for

sports  fields, swimming pools and other facilities

to  be  sited  in  the housing estates  themselves.

Plans  have therefore been made by the Housing  and

Development Board to construct sports stadiums  and

swimming  pools  in  its large housing  estates  of

Queenstown and Toa Payoh Housing Estate as well  as

its  other  large  housing estates.  But  the  main

centre of facilities for sports and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



games  which Government will be providing  for  our

population  is  the  National  Sports  Complex   at

Kallang which, besides the main open stadium to  be

completed  in early 1972, will also have a  covered

stadium  for  indoor games and swimming  pools  and

tennis courts to cater for all the major games in

international meets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the active support for sports and

games  by  Government and the  setting  up  of  the

Sports Division of the Ministry of Social Affair in

1966  to  provide  assistance for voluntary  sports

organisations  by  way  of getting  foreign  expert

coaches  and fund-raising, it has been  found  that

the  activities carried out by the voluntary sports

bodies had been greatly handicapped by the lack  of

adequate     finance    and    proper     executive

functionaries. It has also been found that the  co-ordinating   bodies   of   the   voluntary   sports

organisations, such as the Singapore Olympic Sports

Council,  the  Singapore  Sports  Council  and  the

Sports  Division of the Ministry of Social Affairs,

have  ill-defined functions which overlap  in  many

ways  and therefore have not provided the direction

and  impetus  for the planned growth of  sports  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the voluntary sports bodies and

other  organisations concerned  with  sports  could

better achieve the aims for which sports and  games

are  to be promoted in the Republic, Government has

seen  fit  that  a  statutory  body  whose  primary

function would be the promotion of sports should be

set up. In order that this statutory body should be

an effective one, it is intended that membership of

the  Board  would consist of persons who have  been

generally accepted in the sporting world for  their

proven  interest and knowledge of sports, and  also

of  representatives of the Ministry  of  Education,

the  People's  Association, and the  Armed  Forces,

since  all these institutions are actively involved

in    sports    promotion   in   their   respective

organisations,  and therefore can make  significant

contributions to meet the objectives of the  Board.

The  number of members on the Board is provided  in

clause 4 of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Board are spelt out in

clause 5 of the Bill. They are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to encourage, develop and promote sports for

competitive and recreational purposes;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to co-ordinate the activities of voluntary

sports organisations;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to organise, in consultation with national

sports  organisations, including the National

Olympic        Committee,       international

competitions and games;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to foster research and study in sports,

physical   education  and  the  training   of

instructors;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to manage and maintain facilities and sports

stadiums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is also made in clause 5 of the Bill

for    the   Board   to   receive   donations   and

contributions,  to raise funds and to  make  grants

and   contributions  to  any   person   or   sports

organisation  on such conditions as are  stipulated

by  the  Board.  The  Board is  also  empowered  to

prescribe  minimum standards for  participating  in

international  sports competitions and  games,  and

other  terms  and requirements for the  purpose  of

receiving  aid  from  the  Board,  and  to  promote

schemes   for   the  improvement  of   sports   and

recreational facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the Board should have sufficient

funds  for  its activities, clause 6  of  the  Bill

provides  for  the setting up of a National  Sports

Promotion  Fund, which will consist  of  grants  or

loans    made    by   Government,   donations    or

contributions by the public, and monies accruing to

the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent monies donated, contributed or

accruing  to  the Board from being used  for  other

purposes, clause 7 of the Bill requires that monies

of  the  Board shall be applied solely  for  making

payments in connection with the performance of  the

Board's functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is also made in clause 11 of the Bill

for the Board to employ staff and for it to set  up

pension  schemes,  gratuities  or  provident   fund

schemes for its employees.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage public donations and contributions

to  the  Board, provision is made in clause 16  for

the  National  Sports  Promotion  Board  to  be  an

institution of a public character so that gifts  to

the Board shall be exempted from income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that by setting up the National

Sports   Promotion   Board,  there   will   be   an

organisation  in the Republic made  up  of  persons

actively concerned with the promotion of sports and

games   in   the   various  institutions   and   of

individuals  who are knowledgeable and have  proven

their  interest  in sports. It is also  hoped  that

with  the  setting up of the Board, the overlapping

functions  of the various co-ordinating  bodies  in

sports  as  found at present in Singapore  will  be

resolved. This will be done by the modification  of

the objects of the Singapore Olympic Sports Council

to  be  renamed as the Singapore Olympic  Committee

and  concerned  only  with  the  participation   of

Singapore at international games, such as the  SEAP

Games, the Commonwealth Games, the Asian Games  and

the   Olympic  Games,  and  the  abolition  of  the

Singapore  Sports  Council, an  ad  hoc  Government

Sports  Council  set up by the Ministry  of  Social

Affairs,  and also the absorption of the  functions

of the Sports Division by the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I conclude by saying that whilst sports must

have  the  active recognition and encouragement  of

the   Government,   it  should  not   be   directly

controlled  and run by the Government and  be  just

another  portfolio  of  a  Government  Ministry  or

Department.  The interest in sports,  participation

in  it and support for it must come from the people

and  the  private sector to a large extent.  It  is

with this in view that the proposed National Sports

Promotion   Board,  in  motivation,   organisation,

objective and activity, is structured to perform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

support  this Bill. Undoubtedly it has  very  grand

objectives.  When it is implemented, I  believe  it

will  have  a very decisive effect on the promotion

of  sports in our country and on the raising of our

standard in sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill, as the Minister

has  already  described, is to set up the  National

Sports Promotion Board. Its tasks can be said to be

quite  comprehensive,  with such  functions  as  to

encourage, develop and promote sports on a national

basis   for   both  competitive  and   recreational

purposes;   to   co-ordinate  the   activities   of

voluntary  sports organisations;  to  organise,  in

consultation  with  national sports  organisations,

including the National Olympic Committee,  national

and  international competitions and games;  and  to

foster  research and study in sports  and  physical

education  and  to  provide  for  the  training  of

<br><br><div align="center"><B>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER in the Chair]</B></div>

<br><br>4.51 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these functions will ensure that this Board

plays  an important part in the promotion of sports

in  our  country. Because of the various  important

tasks  entrusted to the Board, it  will  have  very

great  responsibilities, such as co-ordinating  the

various   sports  organisations  and  raising   the

standard  of  the  various sports and  popularising

them. In carrying out these responsibilities, there

are  questions to look into and matters to be taken

care  of.  In  working  to achieve  the  objectives

envisaged   in   the  Bill,  the  National   Sports

Promotion Board will, I am confident, do  its  best

to live up to its expectations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe you will agree with me that in

promoting  sports, there are three main  objectives

which should be well recognised. They are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To train our people to have healthy and

strong  bodies so that our country will be able  to

shoulder the heavy task of nation building.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Through the various sports tournaments and

competitions, the people will be able to enjoy some

recreational activity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To raise the competitive standard of the

various kinds of sports, our national teams  should

be  sent abroad to take part in regional as well as

international tournaments in order to  gain  honour

as  well as publicity for our country. So these are

very  grand  objectives  and  high  ideals  in  the

promotion of sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now examine the progress of sports over

the past few years. Undoubtedly through the efforts

of the Ministry of Social Affairs and with the help

of  various  sports  circles,  we  have  had  great

achievements  in  many fields of  sports,  such  as

basketball,  badminton,  football,  table   tennis,

swimming,   and   weightlifting.   They   are   now

flourishing.  Now and then we see  many  youngsters

training  or taking part in tournaments  either  in

school  grounds  or  in  community  centres.  These

activities were never seen before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we are a small country, our standard of

sports is not far below that of other countries. We

can be said to be comparable to them. This has been

proved in the results we achieved at the last Asian

Games  and  the  SEAP  Games. But  we  should  also

recognise that in certain kinds of sports  we  have

not  done  as  well  as before. For  instance,  our

basketball  team brought back a "big zero"  in  the

last   international  competition.  Our   badminton

standard has dropped even further. A few years  ago

we  claimed  to be the champions of  the  world  in

badminton,   but  just  about  a   month   ago   we

unexpectedly lost to an unknown national team  from

New  Zealand. Is this not a pity? How did this come

about?  We  must  examine  the  reasons  for   this

dropping of standard and take remedial measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote sports, particularly to raise

the standard of our national teams, I would like to

make    four   suggestions   for   the   Minister's

consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To engage international coaches of repute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) All national team members should be given

certain  safeguards in respect of their employment,

so  that  they can have peace of mind while  taking

part in sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Once a year there should be a definite

programme for centralised group training. This will

help   the   team   members  to  attain   all-round

improvement,  in addition to improvement  in  their

physique, their  spirit and their  standards.  And

while they are taking part in group training,  they

should continue to draw their salaries if they  are

employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We should inculcate into them the spirit of

patriotism in order to win honour for our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of all these measures needs a

lot of money. But the Minister has pointed out that

there  is  provision  for the  setting  up  of  the

National Sports Promotion Fund to receive donations

from    various   sources,   such   as   commercial

organisations  and individuals, to  meet  expenses.

These donations will be tax free. I believe this is

a  good  measure, and with the setting up  of  this

Fund,  we will be able to have more funds to  carry

out  our  sports activities. Here I would  like  to

appeal  to  sports enthusiasts, particularly  those

who  are rich, to donate generously to help promote

sport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br>4.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I take part in sports

activities, and therefore I am concerned  with  all

matters connected with sports. I fully support this

Bill.   In   order  to  meet  our  future  economic

challenge, our people will undoubtedly have to have

strong physiques and better endurance. A strong and

healthy  physique  can  only  be  acquired  through

sports.  At the same time, through sports, we  will

also  acquire  a strong national consciousness  and

also   we  can,  indirectly,  fulfil  the  aim   of

achieving racial harmony.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, the introduction of

this  Bill  is  to  provide for  the  planning  and

promotion of national sports activities and  to  do

away  with whatever duplication there has  been  in

this   field.  The  result  is  that   all   sports

activities   will  be  planned,  co-ordinated   and

controlled  by  a  centralised body  consisting  of

representatives  of the Singapore National  Olympic

Committee, the Sports Division of the Ministry  of

Social  Affairs,  the Ministry  of  Education,  the

Armed   Forces,   the  police  and   the   People's

Association.  In this way, it is hoped  to  promote

sports  activities and raise the standard of sports

in  this  country. These are lofty and praiseworthy

aims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in order to raise the

standard  of  our  sports and  to  achieve  greater

prestige  for  our  country, the  following  points

should  not be overlooked. During the past  two  or

three  years, the various sports organisations  as

well  as  the  Singapore Sports Council  have  done

their  very best to obtain the services  of  expert

coaches  for the more popular sports activities  in

Singapore.  These  organisations  have  also  tried

their  very  best  to  look  out  for  talent   and

potential  sportsmen so that under a proper  system

of  training  they will be nurtured  and  developed

into State players. These are praiseworthy efforts.

However,  some doubts have been expressed  in  this

regard.  They  have  given  rise  to  the  question

whether  we  are  able to obtain the  sympathy  and

support of other countries in supplying the  first-class  coaches  that we require. If the  answer  to

this question is in the negative, the next question

will  arise. Are we prepared to accept second-  and

third-class  coaches to train  fourth-  and  fifth-class players? Perhaps the Minister will give  some

consideration to a more economical approach to this

problem  and plan an extensive programme  to  train

our  players  and  thus obtain the  instruction  by

cheaper  means.  One  of  the  ways  is  to  get  a

plentiful  supply of films showing how  first-class

coaches  train  sportsmen in order to  reach  international standards. By showing these films  to  our

trainees, we will be able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



indirectly  to  train  our  own  people,  short  of

getting  expert coaches from abroad.  Our  trainees

will  be  able to learn from watching these  films;

how  they should train and what are the points they

should bear in mind when they are in training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise is the extension

of  the  age  limit  for sports  training.  At  the

present  moment, most of the sports activities  are

confined  to our school-going population. In  order

to  raise  our  sports standard, we must  not  only

popularise  sports activities among  students,  but

also  extend  them outside the schools.  This  work

must be done by the various sports organisations in

conjunction  with  the  commercial  and  industrial

sectors. These sectors should also be encouraged to

make a contribution to sports. In other words,  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, it is our hope that they  will  at

least  shoulder some responsibility  by  taking  in

sportsmen who have graduated from schools and other

institutions of higher learning. They  should  also

allow  such  people to continue with  their  sports

activities  when  they are working.  In  this  way,

their  skill and standard will be maintained. There

are  people  who have to give up sports  activities

because  of their employment. We have lost a  large

reservoir  of  talent because of the hard  economic

facts  of  life.  When sportsmen leave  school  and

happen to be employed in a very small company which

is  not prepared to allow them to take time off for

training,  or  does  not provide  any  facility  or

encouragement  for them to carry  on  their  sports

activities, the loss of such talent to  sport  will

be  complete. In order to earn their living,  these

sportsmen  will  have to accept the  hard  economic

facts  of  life  at  the expense  of  their  sports

activities and the talent that they have developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I wish to stress that the present

training  facilities  for sportsmen  are  more  or

less  of  a  spontaneous and voluntary nature.  We

must  have  a centralised body, such as  a  sports

college, to shoulder the responsibility of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



training our sportsmen. In this way, we will have

better hopes of our sportsmen achieving higher

standards. Furthermore, the establishment of a

sports college will provide employment

opportunities for those who are active in sports.

In other words, those who are good in sports

activities will be able to find employment in the

sports college and they, in turn, will have the

responsibility of training other sportsmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, as the Member for Sembawang has just

said, State players should receive the attention of

the State. Perhaps the Minister's answer to this

question will be that, as the State is faced with

its economic problems, it does not have the

capacity or the ability to look after our sportsmen

in terms of finance. But it is my view that since

our Armed Forces and our Police Force have the

means and the ability to maintain brass bands,

which consist of more people and cost much more

money than, for example, a normal basketball team,

how is it that we find ourselves unable to maintain

a team of State players? Of course, it is not my

proposal to ask the State to feed the players. My

proposal is that the Government should do all it

can to absorb these sportsmen into the various

Government departments so that while in employment

they will also have the time to continue with .

their sports activities. Thus, in both ways they

serve the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if the Minister will bear all these

points in mind, he will surely find some solution

to the problems raised. It is my belief that just

as we have been able to raise our standard of

health and hygiene, we should be able to raise our

standard of sports. In view of the compactness of

our island Republic, I sincerely believe that we

will be able to achieve our aims. Let me reiterate

my full support of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I have just a brief comment to make on this Bill

which is now before the House for its Second

Reading. The Minister has mentioned that he will co-opt people from various organisations, such as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



army, the police, the Ministry of Education and the

People's  Association,  to serve  on  the  National

Sports  Promotion  Board. It  appears  to  me  that

colleges  and  universities have been omitted.  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, you are well  aware  that  in

advanced  countries college and university students

play a very prominent part in sports activities. In

fact,  most of the outstanding sportsmen have  come

from colleges and universities. In this respect,  I

would  urge the Minister for Social Affairs not  to

overlook   appointing  representatives   from   our

colleges  and  universities.  This  will  at  least

enable  our  college  and  university  students  to

participate actively in the promotion of sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will agree with me that our younger

generation  must not only be intelligent  but  they

must  also  be rugged and robust. It is, therefore,

important that our college and university  students

must  excel in all forms of sports and, in time  to

come, they will become outstanding sportsmen and be

able  to  make a name for the Republic of Singapore

in the world of sports. I support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.

However, I hope and I wish that the National Sports

Promotion  Board  will  never  finance  sports  and

recreation clubs, associations or bodies which  are

organised exclusively on a racial basis; nor should

the   players,  members  and  officials   of   such

organisations be allowed to represent the  Republic

at  the  expense  of  the  Board;  nor  should  the

officials  of such organisations ever he  appointed

to  the  Board by the Minister. I hope he can  give

this assurance.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



5.l5 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have nothing much to say

except  to thank Members for their support  of  the

Bill, particularly the Member for Sembawang who has

been repeating some of the points I have made in my

speech. I will consider all the points that he  has

raised  when the Bill is considered by  the  Select

Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point raised by the Member for Paya

Lebar,  whether  there is any  possibility  of  our

getting  first-class coaches from abroad  to  train

our  sportsmen and, if it is not possible,  whether

it  would  be possible for us to have some training

films  from abroad, I think this is not a difficult

matter. We can look into that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of sports training to be extended

not only to the school-going population but also to

persons  outside our schools, if I am not mistaken,

the   Pioneer  Industries  Union  have   a   sports

division. Many of our industries in Jurong as  well

as  business  houses  all over Singapore  have  got

their own sports teams



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of State players being maintained

by  the  State, I would like to inform  the  Member

that   there  are  quite  a  number  of  unemployed

sportsmen  and  sportswomen who have been  absorbed

into   some  Government  departments  as  well   as

business  houses  through the help  of  the  Sports

Division of the Ministry of Social Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has raised the point

that  members of the proposed Board do not  include

representatives from the colleges and  universities

in  Singapore.  He says that most of our  sportsmen

come  from the universities and colleges.  But,  in

fact,  I  am very sad to say that although this  is

true in other countries, it is not so in Singapore.

Very  few  sportsmen and sportswomen come from  the

universities.  Nevertheless, I  will  consider  his

proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Kallang, he

has my assurance that whatever help is given by the

National Sports Promotion Board will not  be  on  a

racial basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I call upon the Minister, I draw attention

to  an  oversight  in the Bill as  amended  by  the

Select  Committee. This error has to be  corrected.

It  is in clause 6, which appears in page 7 of  the

Report  of  Select Committee. In line  21,  "three"

should, in fact, read "four". This is a change that

makes no material difference and it will be done.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> I am much obliged. Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall that this Bill

was  referred to Select Committee on  the  22nd  of

May, 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, which is novel in concept and

potentially far-reaching in its social and economic

impact,  has  aroused  a  considerable  amount   of

interest  and it has been a subject of  much  well-informed comment. This interest is evident from the

number  of representations that were made to Select

Committee. In all, thirteen written representations

were received and the Committee heard oral evidence

from ten of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



the  representors. Representations  came  not  only

from  landlords,  tenants and developers  but  also

from    interested   professional   and    business

associations,  such as the Singapore Advocates  and

Solicitors  Society,  the  Singapore  Real   Estate

Valuers  Association,  the Singapore  Planning  and

Urban  Research  Group and the Chinese  Chamber  of

Commerce.  Apart  from the representations  of  the

Singapore  Advocates and Solicitors Society,  which

confined  itself to the technical legal aspects  of

the  Bill,  almost  all  the  representations  were

concerned  either with the scope of the legislation

or  with  the compensation formula that is proposed

in  the  Bill. There was much difference of opinion

in the representations on both these aspects of the

Bill.  Despite this, or maybe because of it, almost

all  the representations had something of value  to

contribute and gave the Select Committee much  food

for  thought. In the result, as Members may observe

from  the  Report,  many  of  the  suggestions  and

proposals in the representations have been  adopted

and are written into the Bill, and undoubtedly have

improved it

.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Bill as tabled does not provide the

perfect  solution  to some of the problems  raised,

and  although  it may in regard to the compensation

formula  lack the sort of legal precision to  which

legislators would aspire, I would suggest  it  does

provide  a  satisfactory  framework  in  which  the

policy  of  the Bill may be carried out  and  under

which   the  interests  of  landlords  and  tenants

affected by the Bill will be adequately protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's Report was presented on the 13th

of  June,  1969,  as Paper Parl.  3  of  1969.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Bill as now tabled  before  the

House  incorporates  the  recommendations  of   the

Select  Committee. Members will  observe  from  the

Report  that fairly detailed statements  are  given

therein  explaining the reasons for  accepting  all

the  major amendments. I need not burden the  House

by  repeating them. It may, however, be of interest

to Members if I refer to a basic provision in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



the  Bill upon which representations were  made  to

the  Select Committee and which the Committee  were

unable to accept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to clause 3 dealing with the application

of  the Bill. Certain representations, particularly

those  from developers, proposed that the whole  of

Singapore  should  be designated as  a  development

area  or, alternatively, that any landlord may make

an application for the area in which his controlled

premises  are situated to be declared a development

area. It is not difficult to see that the effect of

accepting either of these proposals would  be  that

the  Tenants' Compensation Board would  be  flooded

with  applications for possession of  premises  and

the  whole of the provisions of the Control of Rent

Ordinance  would be nullified, for  all  controlled

premises  in Singapore would potentially be  liable

to   decontrol.  This  was  not  the   purpose   of

Government in introducing this legislation. On  the

contrary,  if Government had decided  that  it  was

time  to nullify the effect of the Control of  Rent

Ordinance, it would not have adopted this  backdoor

method  of  doing  so.  It  was  precisely  because

Government considered that the time was not as  yet

opportune  for an outright repeal of this Ordinance

that it was considered that, in the general context

of  Government's policy to promote  development  in

the private sector, the approach in this Bill of  a

limited  and phased form of de-control with payment

of   compensation  to  dispossessed   tenants   was

adopted. If and when the time comes for the  repeal

of this Ordinance, it would by no means follow that

compensation would be paid to tenants who would  be

obliged to leave their premises because they  could

not pay the resulting increases in rent. The reason

being  that  if Government decided to  repeal  that

Ordinance,  it  would be because the  economic  and

housing  situation as it affected protected tenants

would  be  such as to persuade Government  that  no

further  control over rents was necessary. In  other

words, this category of persons would then be  able

to   pay   an  economic  rent  or  obtain  suitable

alternative accommodation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, the Control of Rent Ordinance

confers protection upon the poorer sections of  the

community,  and although Government is fully  aware

of   the  price  that  has  to  be  paid  for  this

protection in terms of unsightly buildings and slum

tenements   and  the  discrimination  against   one

section of the community at the expense of another,

which is inherent in the present system, Government

considers  that we have not yet reached  the  stage

when  this protection can be thrown overboard.  The

repeal  of this Ordinance would have the effect  of

rendering   homeless  thousands   of   persons   in

Singapore and, though much has been done to provide

low-cost housing for these poorer sections  of  the

community,  we  are not as yet  in  a  position  to

rehouse  all  the persons that would  be  affected.

However,  everyone is aware of Government's  policy

to  encourage home ownership, and there is no doubt

that the time will come when this Ordinance may  be

safely  repealed - at first in part and then  as  a

whole.  I can assure the House that Government  is,

in   fact,   giving   very  serious   and   careful

consideration   to  the  question  of   decontrol;-perhaps  commercial or business premises  could  be

decontrolled in about five to seven years' time and

residential premises in 10 to 12 years'  time,  but

there will be complications where premises are used

for  mixed purposes unless a just solution is found

or  some  equitable  formula arrived  at.  For  the

moment,  it  is Government's intention  to  advance

slowly and in an orderly manner in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  of this House will recall  that  in

November  1964, this House passed the  Cattle  Bill

which  subsequently  became the  Cattle  Ordinance,

1964  (No.  15  of 1964). The Cattle Ordinance  has

since  proven  to  be an extremely effective  legal

instrument  in attaining our objective  of  raising

our environmental standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, cows and buffaloes roaming unchecked on

our  arterial roads, traffic circuses and rampaging

private property are conspicuous by their absence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All cattle sheds are now licensed and are

situated  in  well-defined  and  demarcated   "non-restricted"  areas.  These measures  have  in  turn

solved all the outstanding problems caused by stray

cattle  in  respect of health and traffic  control.

The  cattle  nuisance has, once and for  all,  been

dealt with by the Ministry of Health armed with  an

effective piece of legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the rapid and intensive

urbanisation  and  physical  development  that  are

taking  place  around us today in Singapore,  other

sub-standard  environmental  health  conditions  in

certain  slum  and  squatter areas  have  now  been

brought  into focus. The unfavourable environmental

health conditions in such areas are intensified  by

the   rearing   of  domestic  animals,   the   most

outstanding  of which is the rearing  of  pigs,  or

what are legally termed "swine". These animals  are

often  to be found being reared in pockets of  slum

areas  in  insanitary pig-sties and these pigs  are

allowed  to  stray and roam at will. These  animals

defecate  all  over the place and create  appalling

insanitary  conditions  in  the  areas  and   their

surroundings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make matters worse, such places are usually

situated  just adjacent to newly-developed  housing

estates,  both public as well as private, and  even

in  the  immediate vicinity of the precinct of  our

Paya Lebar International Airport. The roaming about

of  these  animals from their insanitary  pig-sties

into the more developed and hygienic environment of

the neighbouring areas has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



in  the past brought numerous cries of protest  and

complaints from the public. It is now time  for  us

to  introduce more effective legislation  in  order

that  the  rearing of these pigs is  controlled  so

that  the  nuisances caused by them are eliminated,

just as it was in the case of the cattle nuisance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law governing the rearing of pigs,

which is in the form of by-laws, was made under the

repealed  Municipal Ordinance, as is  the  case  of

most of our old laws. The concepts embodied in this

law  are  now  outdated and have been overtaken  by

events around us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore propose to deal with this outstanding

environmental   health   problem   of    insanitary

piggeries  and  the roaming of pigs  in  a  similar

fashion  as in the case of cattle. This, in  short,

is the purpose of this Cattle (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is not aimed at any specific group of

people, nor is it intended to cause hardship to any

one. Let me make it clear that it is certainly  not

the purpose of the Bill to prohibit the rearing  of

pigs. Indeed, it seeks to ensure that farmers breed

pigs  in  well-defined areas and in as  sanitary  a

manner as it is possible to do and without creating

environmental health hazards, as well  as  being  a

nuisance to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the Bill seeks to extend the

existing  definition  of  "cattle"  in  the  Cattle

Ordinance  by  including swine as well.  This  will

enable  the authorities to apprehend the stray  pigs

that  are a public nuisance and turn them  over  to

the  slaughter-house  to be turned  into  meat  for

distribution   among   our  charitable   homes   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to institute effective enforcement

action  when necessary, a new section 5A is enacted

to  empower  the Commissioner of Public  Health  to

delegate his powers to any public officer and, with

the approval of the Minister, to any officer of any

statutory board to deal with the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain consequential changes are also made in

the  definition of "officers" so as  to  bring  the

Cattle  Ordinance  in line with  the  Environmental

Public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SUPPLY OF ARTIFICIAL LIMBS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TO INJURED WORKMEN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the matter of

artificial  aids  for persons who  are  unfortunate

enough  to suffer the loss of any portion of  their

limbs  through accident or otherwise, and  who  are

not  fortunate  enough to be able to purchase  such

aids  which  are necessary for them to  earn  their

livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any accident resulting in the injury to and

eventual  loss  of  a limb is  a  tragedy  for  any

person. The tragedy, however, is greater where  the

person  concerned  belongs to the  under-privileged

class  of manual workers whose very limbs  are  the

means of supporting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



themselves  and  their families. I may  safely  say

that  it  is not only a tragedy but also a calamity

for  a  worker  to have an accident to  his  limbs,

because  of  his low level of wages and because  of

his  invariably having little or no savings at all.

Added  to  the  physical agony  and  pain  of  his

injuries,  he has to suffer a great deal of  mental

agony and anxiety regarding his own future and  the

future of his wife, children, aged parents perhaps,

and  other dependants. His worries and fears  about

the   future   are   very  real  and   substantial,

particularly if he is the sole bread-winner.  Apart

from the productive use of his God-given limbs,  he

has  no  other means or savings to depend upon  for

his  livelihood. The plight of such an  unfortunate

victim  deserves not only compassion and  sympathy

but  also whatever help that can be given to enable

him  to  face the future with a certain  amount  of

hope and confidence

.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in bringing up this matter of

artificial aids for persons with amputated limbs, I

am  prompted by the need to rationalise  the  basis

for  determining the type of artificial aids to  be

supplied and the amount of charges to be levied, if

the  aids  are  so supplied. As an illustration,  I

refer  to  the  case of a Public  Works  Department

labourer who was admitted to hospital in  February

this  year for diabetic gangrene of the left  foot,

resulting in his left leg being amputated below the

knee.  The hospital decided to fit him with a pylon

or  a  wooden peg, and not with an artificial limb.

The  reason for this decision seemed to be  on  the

following  ground:  as  a Government  employee,  he

would  be fitted with a wooden peg free of  charge,

but if he wanted to have an artificial limb fitted,

he   would  have  to  pay  the  full  cost  of  the

artificial limb.



In  terms of money, it means that he would have  to

find $250 to pay for the cost of such an artificial

limb,  which is made locally. Knowing the financial

position  of  this  P.W.D. labourer,  I  need  not

elaborate on his difficulty in finding this sum  of

money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members in this House may want to know  what

is the difference



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



between  an  artificial limb and a wooden  peg.  An

artificial  limb  has  certain  advantages  over  a

wooden  peg,  namely,  a  patient  fitted  with  an

artificial limb will look in appearance  very  much

like  a normal person with natural limbs, and after

some  time  he  will be able to  move  about  quite

easily. But a patient fitted with a wooden  peg  is

likely to feel dejected perpetually because of  its

unnatural  appearance and will, in  addition,  find

greater  difficulty in moving about. An  artificial

limb is certainly far more superior to a wooden peg

in terms of function and appearance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A patient by reason of his being poor is not

likely  to be given a chance to be fitted  with  an

artificial  limb,  simply  because  there   is   in

existence   at   present   a   puzzling    hospital

regulation.  The paradox of the whole situation  is

that if his condition requires him to have a wheel-chair, he is entitled, as a Government employee, to

be supplied with one free of charge. I am sure hon.

Members  will  agree with me that it  is  extremely

paradoxical that, as a Government servant, while he

is  entitled to a free wooden peg which costs about

$100,  and  a wheel-chair which has to be  imported

from  the United Kingdom at a cost of $300,  he  is

not  entitled to an artificial limb which  is  made

locally and which costs $250.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for such a paradox is that there is a

hospital  regulation  which  classifies  artificial

limbs  under the heading "Prosthesis",  and  wooden

pegs    and   wheel-chairs   under   the    heading

"Appliances".  According  to  this  regulation   or

stipulation, items such as artificial  limbs  under

the heading "Prosthesis" can only be supplied to  a

third-class  patient if he pays the  full  cost  of

such items, irrespective of whether or not he is  a

Government employee. But such items as wooden  pegs

or  wheel-chairs under the heading "Appliances" can

be supplied to a third-class patient free of charge

if   he  is  a  Government  employee,  and   at   a

concessionary  rate of 20 per cent  of  the  actual

cost if he is not a Government employee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to follow the logic behind

such  a  stipulation.  To  a  layman  particularly,

artificial  limbs,  wooden pegs,  or  wheel-chairs,

prosthesis or appliances all mean one thing,  i.e.,

artificial aids for a patient who has had his limbs

amputated. To split hairs by classifying  one  item

under  the  heading "Prosthesis"  and  other  items

under  the heading "Appliances" might be convenient

for the purpose of administration, but certainly in

this  instance  it  is  not to  the  advantage  and

interest of a third-class patient who has  had  his

limbs amputated. This absurd stipulation deprives a

poor  patient  of  a chance to be  fitted  with  an

artificial  limb which, as I said earlier,  is  far

more superior to any other artificial aids in terms

of  function  and  appearance,  simply  because  he

cannot  find the money to pay the full cost  of  an

artificial limb that the hospital wants  to  charge

him.



Mr  Speaker, Sir, I hope you will allow me at this

juncture  to  mention in passing that, with  regard

to  this  P.W.D. labourer whose case  I  have  just

mentioned,  the  National  Trades  Union   Congress

decided  to pay for the cost of an artificial  limb

to  enable  him  to be fitted with one  instead  of

with a wooden peg. The decision of the N.T.U.C. is

only  a  symbolic gesture to ring out  the  cry  of

distress of this labourer and all those who  happen

to  suffer the same misfortune. However, this  must

not  be  taken  to mean that the N.T.U.C. has  now

been  turned into a philanthropic organisation.  It

just  does not have the financial resources to dole

out  assistance  to  all those who  need  help  and

charity -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> What about the hospitals?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> - especially at a time when it needs all its own

resources  to strengthen the Singapore trade  union

movement. The responsibility of giving all possible

care  and  assistance to the unfortunate must  rest

largely  upon  the State that has all the  national

resources   at   its  command,  and   not   on   an

organisation like the N.T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure hon. Members in this House will agree

with me that requiring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



third-class  patients, who are no more than  humble

and   poor  workers,  to  pay  the  full  cost   of

artificial limbs, if they wish to have these fitted

in  place  of  their natural limbs that  have  been

amputated, is both harsh and unnecessary. Fate  has

been cruel enough to them and, in addition to their

agony  and  the  pain of injury,  they  have  grave

worries  and nightmares about their own future  and

the  future  of  their loved ones  and  dependants.

Their plight and distress are often shared and felt

by well-meaning people who have shown and expressed

their  compassion and sympathy by  making  generous

donations to assist them to meet the future with  a

certain amount of courage and confidence. Dedicated

doctors  and  nurses have also done  their  bit  by

providing them with the best medical treatment  and

attention  possible. Let there be no hospital  rule

or  regulation  that is harsher than is  necessary.

Laws  and rules are made to serve mankind,  not  to

enslave them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister for Health to give his urgent

attention  and  sympathetic  consideration  to   my

proposal   to  rationalise  the  various   hospital

stipulations  governing the  supply  of  artificial

aids to orthopaedic patients, and to take steps  to

supply artificial limbs on the same basis as wooden

pegs  and  wheelchairs are supplied to patients  in

third-class wards, whose limbs have to be amputated

as  a  result of an accident or events beyond their

control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I sympathise with the Member for

Moulmein when he makes a request for the supply  of

artificial  limbs. This is a matter  of  aftercare,

because if a worker meets with an accident and  has

to  have one arm or leg amputated, he will have  to

fit  himself  with an artificial limb in  order  to

carry  on his daily activities so as to look  after

the livelihood of his family. This brings me to the

subject  of  better methods of safety in industrial

firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been serious cases recently of

industrial  accidents. According to the  statistics

of the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



Labour  for 1968, there was a total of 8,147 cases,

of  which  109 were fatal. A total of  195  persons

have become permanently disabled, and 1,343 persons

have  been  disabled to the extent  that  they  are

unable  to work further. From these statistics  you

can see the seriousness of the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is peaceful. We have no wars. However,

every  year, unfortunately, we find that more  than

100  people  lose their lives and  limbs.  This  is

really  a  very serious matter and is a problem  to

ponder on. So a more practical attitude is not just

to  discuss the supply of artificial limbs  but  to

adopt  better  effective  measures.  I  think   the

Ministry of Labour should engage more inspectors to

go  to  the factories and other places of  work  to

make routine or surprise inspections to see whether

the facilities there are safe and without hazards.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Teong, the

debate  is  on  the  question  of  the  supply   of

artificial  limbs to injured workmen. The  Minister

for  Health  will  be  in  no  position  to  answer

questions  such as increasing the strength  of  the

inspectorate, which should properly be directed  to

the  Minister  for Labour. Can you  please  confine

your  remarks to the supply of artificial limbs  to

injured workmen?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand your ruling, and I

will  cut short my speech. As I have said just now,

I  feel that artificial aids are very necessary for

these unfortunate people. But if the cost is to  be

borne  by  the  workers  themselves,  it  might  be

impossible for them to get artificial limbs because

they   draw   a   very   low  pay.   According   to

calculations,  an  artificial  limb   costs   about

$2,000.  If the worker happens to be working  in  a

Government  department, I feel that the authorities

concerned should look into the matter and try to do

all   they  can  to  enable  him  to  maintain  his

livelihood  and the livelihood of his family.  This

is what we,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



as a Government that looks after the welfare of the

people,  should  do  to  help  him  discharge   his

responsibility.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite understand the

unfortunate  plight of the victims  who  have  lost

their  limbs.  I personally do feel compassion  and

sympathy  for  them. But I would  like  to  clarify

certain  points which have been brought up  by  the

Member  for  Moulmein. He seemed to convey  to  the

House the impression that artificial limbs are  not

supplied  free  to the unfortunate victims  by  the

hospital    authorities   because   the    hospital

administrators  are splitting  hairs  and  want  to

distinguish  between a peg-leg  and  an  artificial

limb.  He  said  they  are  slaves  to  rules   and

regulations.  That is not the case. First  of  all,

rules  and regulations must be there and they  must

be  applied.  Obviously rules and regulations  have

been drawn up because there is a - and I underline it -

rationale on which they have been drawn up. Perhaps

if  I  may  just explain, it will clarify  matters.

What  is the difference between an artificial  limb

and  a peg-leg or a pylon? As far as these aids are

concerned, they are an artificial substitute for  a

lost limb. According to the experts, as far as peg-legs and pylons are concerned, they are the minimum

substitute  for a lost limb, whereas an  artificial

limb  is  something  much  more  sophisticated  and

elaborate.  Of course, the sophistication  and  the

elaboration of artificial limbs can vary from  type

to    type.   Some   artificial   limbs   can    be

electronically operated. But as far as the hospital

rules and regulations are concerned, they are based

on  the  policy  that  a  peg-leg  is  the  minimum

substitute  for a lost limb, and that is  what  the

hospitals  are  providing at  a  subsidised  price.

Artificial limbs are something more than a  minimum

substitute. Of course, in any case, we must draw  a

line  somewhere.  If  you say  that  a  patient  is

entitled  to  a free artificial limb, then  he  may

demand  an  artificial limb which is electronically

operated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter which I wish to point out

to  the  Member for Moulmein - if he has  not  been

aware of it, although he is a trade unionist. Under

section   15  (3)  of  the  Workmen's  Compensation

Ordinance, workmen who are injured are entitled  to

artificial limbs, but the price must be paid for by

the  employers. Why should the Government  be  held

responsible  for  supplying a free artificial  limb

when,  under the Workmen's Compensation  Ordinance,

it  is the employers who should be liable to supply

it?  After  all,  they are the people  who  make  a

profit,  whereas  the Government does  not  make  a

profit.  Of  course,  if  the  Government  is   the

employer, it is a different matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which hinges on policy is this. The

Member  for Moulmein said that in the case  of  the

P.W.D. labourer, the N.T.U.C. had contributed  some

funds  and, as a result, the labourer is now  in  a

position to have the artificial limb. He also added

that  the  N.T.U.C., although  it  helped  in  this

instance, was not indicating that it was  going  to

turn  itself into a philanthropic organisation.  On

the  same basis, I would say that a hospital is not

a philanthropic organisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> It is a State organisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> A State organisation is different from a

philanthropic  organisation. Is  the  Member   for

Moulmein  suggesting  that  a  hospital  should  be

turned  into a philanthropic organisation?  Perhaps

if  I  may bring up certain points, it may  clarify

the  matter. According to the regulations,  at  the

moment, a peg-leg or a pylon, which will cost about

$100, will be supplied to a "C" class patient  (who

pays $1 per day) at 20 per cent of the cost of  the

peg-leg; that is, he will have to pay $20. In other

words,  it is subsidised; whereas if an "A" or  "B"

class  patient wants a pylon or a peg-leg, he  pays

the  full  price of $100. However, I wish to  point

out  that  even  the $100 is an economic  cost. In

other words, no profit is being made by Government.

The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



$100  is the cost of the production of the peg-leg

or the pylon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister for

Health  has missed some of my points in his reply.

I  am  not  quarrelling over the fact  that  there

should be rules and regulations.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Sia, you are not entitled to make a second

speech.  But  if  you will briefly enumerate  your

points  without  introducing any new  argument,  I

will permit you to carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> I just want to tell the Minister that I am not

talking about rules and regulations, or that  they

should  not be there. What I am talking  about  is

the  rationale  of  the case. The  rationale  here

seems to be a bit cock-eyed simply because, on the

one  hand,  the  Government allows  a  wheel-chair

costing  $300 to be given free and, on  the  other

hand,  it does not allow an artificial limb  which

costs $250 to be given free. That is the rationale

that I am questioning, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Workmen's Compensation

Ordinance which was referred to by the Minister, I

just want to point out that I am not referring  to

the cases under that Ordinance. I am referring  to

those labourers who, outside their work, happen to

be knocked down by a car



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



and are not covered by the Workmen's Compensation

Ordinance. These are the two points I wish to

mention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the way the Member for Moulmein has explained his case, of course, the

rationale of it looks cock-eyed. But I think

that is not the rationale on which the rules and

regulations have been drawn up. I have made it

quite clear just now that the rationale behind

the rules and regulations is that, as far as the

hospitals are concerned, they will give an

artificial aid which will be the minimum

substitute for a lost limb. According to my

experts, the minimum substitute for a lost limb

is a peg-leg. But if a person wants something

more superior and sophisticated like an

artificial limb, then he will have to pay for

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just reply to the Member's other point? He

has mentioned car accidents and so on. If a person

involved  in a car accident was not negligent,  he

can easily claim compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.

Television  Singapore Enterprises  (Pte.)  Limited,

Chartered Industries of Singapore Limited,  Intraco

and  other similar enterprises wholly owned by  the

Government;  and  (b) how many civil  servants  are

administering those enterprises, and how are  they

paid and from what sources.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> (a) Since Government is the

sole  owner  of  these  enterprises,  it  has  full

control  over  them. The Government, however,  does

not  exercise  control in detail in the  day-to-day

affairs of  these enterprises. Such  matters  are

left   to   the   management  of  the   enterprise.

Government's  control  is  exercised  over   policy

through the Board of Directors. These are appointed

by the Government and, in the main, they consist of

civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Civil servants, i.e. employees in the

Government  Service,  are not responsible  for  the

administration of these enterprises,  as  they  are

not   members   of  the  management  team,   unless

specifically  seconded to these  enterprises.  Such

secondment occurs rarely, and, when they  do,  they

are   on   usual  terms  governing  conditions   of

secondment.

<div align="center"><b>SINGLE BUS-FARE SYSTEM</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Communications whether he will introduce  a  single

fare  system for all passengers travelling whatever

distance by bus along a bus route in the Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The introduction of a single fare system for all

passengers  travelling  whatever  distance  by  bus

along a bus route in the Republic as proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



by   the   Member  for  Punggol  is  an  attractive

proposition  if  there  is  only  one  bus  company

responsible   for   Singapore's  public   transport

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as there are, at present, as many as 11 bus

companies  operating  in  the  Republic  and   with

different  scales  of  fares  in  operation, e.g.

Singapore  Traction Co. charges 10  cents  for  the

first   mile  and  thereafter  5  cents  for  every

subsequent  mile, up  to a maximum  of  25  cents;

whereas  the other 10 bus companies charge 5  cents

for the first mile and thereafter 5 cents for every

subsequent  mile,  without a maximum,  it  will  be

quite  an  accounting  problem  to  resolve  before

contemplating any such proposal in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However. I may add that the Transport Advisory

Board  is attempting a study of the possibility  of

introducing a uniform system of bus fares,  in  the

first instance.

in  which persons were seriously hurt and the  rest

were  all  minor  accidents.  Of  the  three  fatal

accident cases, two of the cases are pending and in

divulged  but of the batch that was so released  90

per  cent of the Servicemen have been placed in the

following sectors of employment, namely - the civil

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether there is any

scheme  of service for the Singapore Armed  Forces;

(b)  when was such a scheme introduced; (c) whether

the  members of the Forces are satisfied  with  the

scheme; and (d) whether he will table the scheme in

Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> (a) and (b) When the Ministry of

the  Interior and Defence was established in August

1965, there was only the existing Malaysian Armed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



Forces  schemes  of  service  to  rely  upon.   The

Treasury  and  the Director of Audit  accepted  the

arrangement   and   since  at  that   juncture   an

appreciable  number of members of the  S.A.F. were

Singaporeans  who had been employed in  the  Forces

during  the  Malaysian  period  it  was  merely   a

question  of  their continuing with their  existing

schemes of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the introduction of National

Service  and the rapid expansion of the S.A.F. the

Malaysian Armed Forces schemes of service have  had

to  be progressively reviewed and examined to  meet

the   requirements   of  our  own   Armed   Forces.

Consideration  has  had to be  given  also  to  the

schemes  of service obtaining in the civil service,

the   effect  that  National  Service  has  on  the

staffing composition of the S.A.F. and the  special

requirements of the S.A.F. Therefore, a new  salary

scheme, a new leave scheme, routes of promotion, to

mention a few, have had to be introduced and  these

have  all  been  laid  down in either  MID  Orders,

Circulars,  Army Board Instructions  or  subsidiary

legislation  made by the Army Board  in  accordance

with  the  provisions  of the Singapore  Army  Act,

1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) There are various categories of officers and

personnel   in   the   MID,  namely   -   regular

commissioned   officers  and  servicemen,   short

service    commissioned    officers,    mobilised

officers   and  mobilised  servicemen,   officers

seconded  from  other Government  Ministries  and Departments;  and National Service  officers  and

servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as officers in the S.A.F. are

concerned, they are generally satisfied with  their

terms  and  conditions of service. With  regard  to

Other  Ranks,  a  new pay code is being  introduced

presently and though there are problems because  of

the  limitations of finance, it is hoped  that  the

majority concerned will benefit. There is close co-ordination  between the Ministry and Units  in  the

field  on  service conditions and within  the  funds

available  conditions  are  improved  where  it  is

feasible to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) I do not propose tabling the schemes of

service  as there is no legal requirement for  them

to be tabled. However, honourable Members who may

be interested in the various aspects of the schemes

such  as  Pay codes, Leave Regulations, Promotions,

etc, could   be   supplied  with  the   necessary

information on application to me.

involved   12   cleansing  workers.   Disciplinary

action  was taken against these cleansing  workers

and the punishments imposed were as follows :-

(d) Fine ( 1/2 day's to 3 days' wages)           6

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be noted, however, that an Operations

Room  was  set  up  at the Ministry  of  Health  in

October last year to receive and expeditiously deal

with  the complaints from members of the public  in

respect  of health nuisances. The public were  also

urged  to lodge their complaints to this Operations

Room.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st October 1968 to 31st August, 1969, a

total of 2,467 complaints of health nuisances  were

thus   received.  Each  and  every  complaint   was

<div align="center"><b>(Recruits)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Health

(a)  how  many daily-rated cleansing workers  have

been  recruited  since the "Keep Singapore  Clean"

campaign which began last year; (b) whether  there

is  any  need  to  recruit more workers;  and  (c)

whether he is satisfied with their performances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Since the commencement of the

"Keep  Singapore Clean" campaign on  1st  October,

1968, to  31st  August, 1969, an  additional  200

daily-rated cleansing workers were recruited  into

the  service  to  provide for a full  seven  days'

cleansing service per week. The actual strength of

the  cleansing workers as on 1st September,  1969,

was   4,033.  There  are  919  vacancies  due   to

resignations,  dismissals,  etc.,  and  action  is

being  taken  to fill them. It is considered  that

the  full  complement  of 4,952  workers  will  be

sufficient at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



present time to maintain a reasonable standard  of

cleansing  services. In 1970-71 it  is  estimated

that  an  increase  of about 930 labourers'  posts

will  be  required  based on  additional  built-up

areas, new housing estates and streets which  will

have  to  be taken over for service by the  Public

Cleansing Branch. In particular, there is  a  need

to   provide  a  better  service  in  the   Jurong

Industrial  Estate where at the  moment  only  the

Town Centre is serviced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performances of the cleansing workers have

improved considerably since the reorganisation  of

the  cleansing  services in August 1968.  This  is

evidenced  by  the increase of the  average  daily

tonnage of refuse collected from 800 tons to 1,200

tons. They are better

disciplined as a result of better supervision by

supervisory staff who were put through a course of

instruction on leadership and man-management

techniques organised in co-operation with the

Police Academy. Further improvement in the

performance of workers can be expected following

the introduction of a scheme of monetary awards to

be given to those who are hard working and who

contribute towards greater efficiency and

productivity in the services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies of the norms

for labourers were also undertaken by the Public

Cleansing Branch and many of the labourers' beats

are being lengthened. This is possible due to

better disposal of litter and refuse into

receptacles by the public. An increase in

productivity and savings in manpower will result

from this exercise of lengthening the beats.
