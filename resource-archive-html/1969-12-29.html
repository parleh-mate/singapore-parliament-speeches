<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Amending legislation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour if he  will

consider  introducing  legislation  to  amend   the

Workmen's  Compensation Ordinance (a) by  extending

the   applicability  of  the   Ordinance   to   all

categories  of employees earning $750 or  less  per

month;  and (b) by increasing the numbers of months

of  earnings and the maximum amounts prescribed for

compensation  in  section 8 of the Ordinance  where

injury  sustained  results  in  the  death  or   in

permanent total disablement of the employee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, manual workers are eligible for

workmen's    compensation   under   the   Workmen's

Compensation Ordinance, 1954, irrespective  of  the

amount  of  their monthly earnings. It is  only  in

respect  of non-manual workers that the ceiling  of

$400 earnings per month is fixed so that non-manual

workers  earning more than $400 per month will  not

be eligible for workmen's compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ordinance is amended in the manner suggested

by the Member for Kallang, it would have the effect

of denying workmen's compensation for manual

workers should their earnings exceed $750 per

month. As for non-manual workers, statistics for

the 11 months of January to November 1969 show that

the number of non-manual workers who were paid

workmen's compensation was 14 out of a total of

7,952. This works out to 0.17 per cent, the rest

being all manual workers. Raising the eligibility

of non-manual workers for claims of workmen's

compensation would, therefore, have little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



or  no practical effect since it is well known that

manual  workers  are exposed to  greater  risks  to

their  personal  safety  in  the  course  of  their

employment than non-manual workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 8 of the Ordinance, the amount of

workmen's  compensation for  victims  of  accidents

resulting  in death is calculated on 36  months  of

their  monthly earnings or $7,200 whichever is  the

less. Where the victim is permanently disabled, the

workmen's  compensation is calculated on 48  months

of  his monthly earnings or $9,600 whichever is the

less.  The  maximum payable for death or  permanent

disablement of the employee is based on an  earning

of $200 per month. This figure is above the average

monthly  earnings  of workers in  Singapore  which,

according to a sample survey made in 1968, amounted

to  $180.60 per month. Amending legislation will be

made  to  revise the scales of benefits should  the

average  monthly earnings of workers  in  Singapore

exceed $200.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Does the Parliamentary Secretary value a man's life

only at $7,200 or 36 months' wages?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I think that is laid down as compensation; that

is,  a man's life-span of work expected of him. But

I  am  sure,  if  the Member has any suggestion  to

make, we will be very glad to receive it.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Does the Parliamentary Secretary not believe that

the  estate  of a deceased person stands  a  better

chance  of being awarded more damages by  the  High

Court  than the award of $7,200 under the Workmen's

Compensation Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, depending on the individual case, I am sure

the   deceased's  family  is  at  liberty  to  seek

workmen's  compensation or to seek redress  in  the

High Court.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree with

me that a workman would get more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



compensation from damages by the High Court  if  he

were to die in a road accident than in a factory or

at a work site?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, that is a hypothetical question. I do not

think I am in a position to answer that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary

said just now that if the average worker

in Singapore should get $200 a month, then he would

take  steps  to  amend  the Workmen's  Compensation

Ordinance.  But is not the per capita income  of  a

worker over $200?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> No, Sir. It can be seen from page 49 of the 1968

Report of the Ministry of Labour, where there is  a

report of a sample survey, that the average monthly

income was $180.60.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Parliamentary

Secretary  not consider it expedient to extend  the

definition   of  "workman"  to  all   classes   and

categories of workers irrespective of whether  they

perform manual or technical work?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think that question was answered in the

Parliamentary Secretary's principal answer.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I underline the word

"technical".



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the Parliamentary Secretary anything to add?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I do not think I have anything to add to that.

<div align="center"><b>LABOUR SHORTAGE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Survey of situation in Singapore)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (a) whether

there  is  a shortage of skilled, semi-skilled  and

unskilled labour in Singapore recently due  to  the

Government's policy of rapid industrialisation; (b)

what  steps have been taken or are being  taken  to

remedy  the situation; and (c) if he will  consider

an   overall   survey  to  ascertain   the   actual

situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the categories and

numbers   of   persons  currently  registered   for

employment   in  the  Employment  Exchange,   there

appears to be a shortage of skilled labour and to a

lesser  extent  semiskilled  labour  in  Singapore.

However, there is no shortage of unskilled  labour.

Out  of  a  total of 52,115 persons registered  for

employment  at the Employment Exchange as  on  30th

November,  1969, 1,475 were registered  as  skilled

workers,  3,259 as semi-skilled workers and  28,854

as  unskilled  workers. The remaining persons  were

registered as commercial and domestic workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps taken by the Government to meet the

immediate  shortage of skilled workers include  (i)

encouragement to industrial concerns  to  undertake

their own training programmes to meet their demands

for skilled workers; (ii) permission for industrial

concerns  to  bring in skilled labour from  outside

Singapore;  (iii) provision of special  courses  to

upgrade  and  retrain  workers  in  the  Vocational

Institutes  and the Industrial Training Centres  by

way of day-release and evening classes. To meet the

requirements of industries for skilled personnel on

a long-term basis, Government has taken measures to

restructure  the educational system so  that  there

will  be an increasing number of school-leavers  in

the  coming  years  with vocational  and  technical

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, various organisations,

including  the  Ministry of  Labour,  the  National

Productivity   Centre,  the   Technical   Education

Department  of the Ministry of Education,  and  the

Economic  Research  Centre  of  the  University  of

Singapore, have carried out their own  surveys  to

ascertain  the  manpower  requirements  in  certain

specific  areas or industries. At the  moment,  the

question of an overall survey is not an urgent one.

If  at  some future date the situation demands  it,

Government  will consider making an overall  survey

to  ascertain the skilled manpower requirements  of

Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars of applications)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Defence (a) how many non-citizens have applied  for

Professional  Employment Passes from August,  1968,

up  to  the  latest convenient date; (b)  how  many

applications were approved; and (c) the reasons for

rejecting the other applications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the period August 1968 to

November  1969,  7,051 applications  were  received

from non-citizens for professional visit passes and

employment   passes.  The  number  of  applications

included  new  applications  and  applications  for

extension.   During   the   same   period,    6,911

applications  were  approved. The  number  approved

included some applications submitted before  August

1968  and finalised after 1st August, 1968. A total

of  508 applications were rejected during the  same

period.   The   rejections   also   included   some

applications  submitted  before  August  1968   and

finalised after 1st August, 1968.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for rejecting the applications are as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If local citizens with similar qualifications

and  experience were considered available  to  take

over the jobs applied for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Applicants who were considered of little or no

appreciable economic benefit to Singapore; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Security objections.

<div align="center"><b>LIVE WORMS FOR FANCY FISH</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Law  and  National Development (a) if he  is  aware

that  fancy fish breeders and hobbyists are  having

difficulty  in  obtaining  live  worms  from  local

sources since the recent anti-mosquito campaign was

started;  and (b) if he will instruct  the  Primary

Production Department to undertake the breeding  of

worms  under  controlled conditions to restore  the

local supply of live



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



worms  to  meet the requirements of our fancy  fish

breeders  and  hobbyists, in  view  of  the  export

earning capacity of fancy fish.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the current shortage of worms

is  due  not so much to the anti-mosquito  campaign

but  rather to the rapid increase in the demand for

worms  as  more  and more people breed  fancy  fish

either for their own enjoyment or for export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department has been

conducting experiments in tubi-fex worm cultivation

since 1967. Successful techniques have been evolved

to  enable fancy fish breeders to produce their own

worms.   The   techniques  have  been   taught   to

interested  parties  and demonstration  units  have

been   set   up  at  Lim  Chu  Kang  and  Sembawang

veterinary  centres. In fact,  many  aquarium  fish

hobbyists and exporters are now producing  tubi-fex

worms on their own. Those who are interested should

apply  to the Primary Production Department  for  a

demonstration of the technique of worm production.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister encourage

further the breeding of worms so that fish breeders

and hobbyists will not find it difficult to get

worms?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Primary Production Department will encourage

the  breeding of worms. For those who do  not  know

how  to breed them, the Department will be only too

pleased  to  give  them  a  demonstration  of   the

technique of tubi-fex worm production.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, is the Minister aware that worms

are now being imported from across the Causeway?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, and I do not see any objection to such

imports.  We have in the past imported  worms  even

from Japan.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Will the Minister give us some assurance that we

will be self-sufficient in worms?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I cannot give the Member that assurance. The only

assurance I can give is that the Primary Production

Department  itself, whilst not producing  worms  on

its  own,  is  prepared to show fish hobbyists  how

they can go about producing worms.

<div align="center"><b>FLOODS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Preventive measures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development, in view of  the  serious

floods  in early December, 1969, whether Government

has  any  effective plans to prevent those  serious

floods from recurring.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the floods on 10th December last

were caused by unprecedented heavy rains coinciding

with  a  high spring tide. Nothing can be  done  to

prevent rainfall or to alter the movement of tides.

However,  our drainage system can be improved.  But

finance is the limiting factor. We can construct  a

drainage  system augmented by huge pumping stations

that will meet all eventualities, but this will  be

extremely costly and difficult to justify. Like all

public  work  projects,  priorities  have   to   be

decided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years, several drainage and

flood alleviation schemes have been approved.  Some

of  these  have been completed, whilst  others  are

still under construction. The following schemes are

now under construction:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation Scheme,

Phase  1, which is the cutting of a diversion canal

to   channel  water  from  the  upper  Bukit  Timah

catchment  area to Ulu Pandan canal. The scheme  is

expected  to be completed by the end of  next  year

and  the  cost  will be in the  region  of  $6�

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The urban renewal drainage scheme - the New

Bridge Road outlet drain and Peng Siang Quay outlet

drain.  Concrete  lining and  realignment  of  both

drains  is being done. Completion date is May  1970

and the cost is $1 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Sungei Kallang improvement scheme, which

consists of the realignment and widening of the

river from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



Braddell  Road  to  Thomson Road, including  Potong

Pasir and Lorong Chuan, costing $� million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Kampong Kembangan and Siglap improvement

scheme.  Work  is being done on the improvement  of

subsidiary  drains  in the Kampong  Kembangan  area

which  lead  into the Siglap Canal  at  a  cost  of

$150,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Sungei Whampoa lining. Concrete lining of

Sungei Whampoa is expected to be completed in  four

months' time at a cost of $� million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in addition, all flood

alleviation and drainage plans are being reassessed

and, finance permitting, proposals for new drainage

schemes will be implemented in the future that will

lessen  the  severity  of  floods.  We  could   not

altogether  avoid the flooding that was  caused  by

the  unprecedented 16.9 inches of  rainfall  in  24

hours  on  the 10th of December coinciding  with  a

high spring tide of 10 feet 1 inch.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from the various schemes

mentioned  by  the  Minister, what  are  the  flood

alleviation  schemes that have been  completed  and

where are these schemes situated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the most recently completed one

was the Pelton Canal scheme which was the lining of

Pelton Canal through MacPherson Estate completed in

Alexandra Canal lining was completed in 1968  at  a

cost of $2 million. The Geylang Canal widening  and

lining  was  completed in 1968 at a  cost  of  $1.2

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from these completed

schemes  and in view of the serious flood recently,

can the Minister inform the House of other proposed

flood  alleviation schemes and when these  will  be

started?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the biggest scheme which has not yet

received approval is the second phase of the  Bukit

Timah  flood alleviation scheme to cut a new  canal

from  the 3� milestone Bukit Timah Road  through

Whitley Road and Thomson Road along part of  Sungei

Whampoa  to join up with Sungei Kallang at  Kallang

Basin. The estimated cost is $7� million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next scheme is at Potong Pasir and Lorong

Chuan  valley. This is a rather low-lying area.  We

could  widen Sungei Kallang and realign and improve

its  subsidiary drains. We could even  construct  a

storage  reservoir in Lorong Chuan valley. But  all

this would cost $5� million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some smaller projects. For instance,

Geylang  Serai  is a very low-lying area  and  some

parts of it are below high tide level. There  is  a

scheme   which  is  being  considered  to   provide

adequate  concrete-lined canals in  Geylang  Serai.

This   will  cost  about  $300,000.  Other  smaller

schemes  are the improvement and lining of  Rochore

Canal  costing about $1 million, the  provision  of

adequate  canals, and the raising of the  level  of

the  roads in the Boon Tat Street area which  would

cost about $� million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister say whether

there  is any flood alleviation scheme for  Changi,

especially in the Koh Sek Lim Road area  which  was

very badly hit by the recent floods?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, officials from the Public Works

Department  and  the  Public  Utilities  Board  are

reconsidering   the   drainage   plans   for    the

Bedok/Changi  area; we are thinking of  building  a

reservoir  where the Housing and Development  Board

is  digging earth to reclaim the east coast. We may

build  this  reservoir both  as  a  catchment  area

against  floods  and  to  catch  the  Water  during

floods.  Alternatively, if the water  is  not  very

polluted, we can use it as an additional store  for

our  water  supply.  The matter  is  receiving  the

consideration of officials and a decision  will  be

made soon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, arising out of the question of

floods,  what is the Government's policy in  regard

to   the  construction  of  temporary  unauthorised

shacks or huts by the victims in the recent floods?

Is the Government going to allow this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Without any hesitation, I would say yes to the

Member for Bras Basah. People who have suffered and

lost  their  homes either completely or partly  can

surely repair or rebuild and have a roof over their

heads  without fearing prosecution from  the  Chief

Building Surveyor. On the other hand, of course, we

must watch the position to see that others who have

not  suffered  from  the floods  do  not  take  the

opportunity to erect unauthorised houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, has the Government any plans to

carry  out  flood alleviation schemes in  Sembawang

Constituency?  Certain  areas  in  Sembawang   were

affected by the recent floods and had water as high

as  four feet. Some roads have been eroded  by  the

flood  waters.  Will the Government take  immediate

steps to repair these roads?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Immediate steps are being taken to repair the

roads  which  have been spoilt as a result  of  the

floods.  But this supplementary question is  really

in  connection  with  the second  question  of  the

Member for Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to floods in Sembawang, I think the Member

will agree with me that this was the first time the

floods  affected  Sembawang. Frankly,  we  have  no

concrete plans for alleviating floods in Sembawang.

But as I said in the last sentence of my reply, our

whole   flood   alleviation  measures   are   being

reconsidered  with  a  view to  alleviating  floods

which  may occur as a result of either heavy  rains

for many hours or high tides or both.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said that Sembawang

was  affected by the floods for the first  time.  I

hope it will not happen again there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to the recent floods,

the damage done was very serious. Some rich people

had their cars totally submerged in the flood and

these were completely damaged. Some people were

killed and others injured. Damage to property was

extensive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister mentioned big flood

alleviation projects coming up. That is good  news.

But,  from my point of view, projects are projects.

In  this  connection, we must learn from  our  past

experience  in building flats and houses.  We  have

been  very  speedy in putting up houses and  flats.

Therefore, we should be equally speedy in  carrying

out these flood alleviation schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Ulu Pandan scheme has been going

on  for  the last few years. I paid visits  to  the

work  site  a  few  times, but there  were  no  men

working  on the scheme. Ulu Pandan Road is  a  very

important  main  trunk  road  which  will   connect

Singapore  with Malaysia and even Thailand. lf  it

rains  very  heavily  for  two  days,  it  is  very

difficult to go through this road. I would like  to

ask  the Minister if he will send more men to  work

on  the  Ulu Pandan scheme. If they are not working

fast enough, they should work day and night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister said that there was not

enough  money to spend on all the flood alleviation

projects. That is wrong. If there is no money, how

can we build houses and flats? We should spend part

of  the money allocated to flat-building on the Ulu

Pandan  scheme, which is a very important  project.

The  small drains in the area should be widened  so

that  the water will flow more quickly to the  sea.

The  East  Coast  Reclamation  Scheme  has  somehow

affected  the free flow of water. Can the  Minister

take steps to remedy the situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, that is the longest supplementary question I

have ever heard! Perhaps to satisfy the Member  for

Ulu  Pandan  I should say, as I said  in  the  last

sitting of Parliament, that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



Ulu  Pandan scheme has been delayed because of rock

formation which has been encountered in the tunnels

we  are  now building between Bukit Timah  and  Ulu

Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the P.W.D. workers who are working on

the  project but the contractors. The work has been

let out to three or four contractors under a tender

scheme.  Of course, if it rains, they cannot  work.

But I will look into the Member's complaint and see

what can be done to expedite matters.

very  heavy rains and the subsequent flooding. Some

10,000 families were affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage to private farms, properties, and

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the floods, the Social

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Bedok School;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Balestier Hill School; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) St. Andrew's School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that 2,800 persons used these five

centres.  In addition, eight relief centres  manned

by  voluntary workers were opened in various flood-stricken areas. These eight centres were used by an

estimated 870 persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Welfare Department gave immediate

relief  on the day of the flood itself by supplying

the following foodstuffs to the above 13 centres:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Rice;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Sugar;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Coffee powder;

<br><br>The  total quantity of foodstuffs supplied came  to

3,250  lbs.  In addition, 3,780 lbs, of  clothings

were issued to those in need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the floods, as an immediate measure, the

Social  Welfare Department paid cash grants at  the

rate of $10 per person to 12 families comprising 65

persons  whose houses had been extensively  damaged

or  rendered unsafe by the floods. Eight  of  these

families   have   been   allocated   Housing    and

Development Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following categories of persons were

adversely affected as a result of the floods:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Farmers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Next-of-kin and dependants of those who died;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Persons who need alternative accommodation

as a result of their houses being washed away,

rendered unsafe or extensively damaged.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has drawn up a relief scheme for

farms damaged by the floods to help the farmers re-establish  their  farms  and  get  back   to   full

production  as  quickly  as  possible.  The  scheme

provides  for  aid in cash as well as  in  kind  to

farms    licensed   by   the   Primary   Production

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small vegetable farmers have been given $100 in

cash  plus  $50 worth of materials, i.e., vegetable

seeds,  fertilizers, insecticides,  fungicides  and

lime. Farmers of medium-sized vegetable farms  were

given  $100  in cash plus $100 worth of  materials.

Farmers  of  large-sized farms were given  $100  in

cash plus $150 worth of materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pig farmers are eligible for a loan of up to

$1,000  at  3  per cent interest repayable  in  one

year.  In addition to this loan, small pig  farmers

who lost pigs in the floods are given $160 worth of

feeding stuff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poultry farmers are eligible for a loan of up to

$500  at 3 per cent interest repayable in one year.

In addition to this loan, small poultry farmers who

lost poultry in the floods are given $150 worth  of

feeding stuff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that this relief scheme for

farmers  will  cost the Government $137,400  to  be

given in the form of grants and $406,500 by way  of

loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also drawn up a scheme to

assist  the  next-of-kin of those  who  died  as  a

result  of the floods. The scheme provides for  the

ex  gratia payment of compensation from the General

Relief Fund. Payment will be assessed on the  lines

of   the  Workmen's  Compensation  Ordinance  which

provides  for  maximum compensation of  36  months'

wages   or  $7,200  whichever  is  the  less.   The

estimated   cost  of  ex  gratia  compensation   is

$20,360.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floods also rendered a number of persons

homeless.   Such   persons  who  need   alternative

accommodation  as a result of the  floods  will  be

paid  a rent subsidy on the same basis as that paid

to persons made homeless by fire, i.e., at the rate

of  $7  per person per month subject to a limit  of

$35 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is aware of the

increasing  seriousness  of  the  problem  of  air

pollution  especially in Jurong and other  smaller

industrial   areas  in  Singapore.  Further,   the

problem  is enhanced by the increasing  number  of

motor  vehicles and other equipment utilising  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the information of the

Member  for Delta, the figures for cancers of  the

follows:



<pre>

     Year    Breast  Neck of    Body of

                      uterus     uterus

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of percentages, cancers of the breast

account for 12 per cent, cancers of the neck of the

uterus  22 per cent, and body of the uterus  4  per

cent  of  all  types of cancer affecting  women  in

Singapore.  Compared with the average figures  over

the  previous five years from 1960 to  1964,  there

has been no significant increase, although there is

an apparent increase when compared with the figures

for  the years 1950 to 1959. This really is due  to

better  service  and more comprehensive  diagnostic

methods  of detecting cancer rather than  any  true

upward trend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since my last statement in this

House  in  December  1968  on  a  similar  subject,

although  the  Cytological Service in  our  Kandang

Kerbau Hospital has not had the number of its staff

increased, the number of slides examined by it  has

increased.    There   is   provision    for    nine

Cytotechnicians  but  only  eight   are   presently

employed,  one  having  resigned.  The  number   of

slides, with corresponding suspicious and confirmed

cases of cancer, is as follows:



<pre>

     Year     Total     No, of     No, of

              Slides   Suspicious  confirmed

	     examined    slides     cases

     1967      9,779      142         71

     1968     14,677      166        116

     1969     14,883      126         67

 (Jan to Nov)

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slides examined in our Kandang Kerbau Hospital

come  from two sources - hospital patients and from

selected Maternal and Child Health Clinics. As  the

majority of slides from hospital patients come from

cases  which have symptoms, the yield of suspicious

and confirmed cases is higher. On the other hand, a

considerable  number of slides  from  Maternal  and

Child  Health  Clinics  are from  patients  without

symptoms.   In  the  Maternal  and  Child   Health

Clinics,  the yield is approximately three  out  of

1,000  slides examined. This figure is  similar  to

the  findings in many other centres throughout  the

world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to October 1969, not all gynaecological

cases  seen  at  the  Kandang Kerbau  Hospital  are

routinely   examined  with  a  cytological   smear.

However, since that date, all gynaecological  cases

attending the hospital are now being screened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of cancer of the breast, detection

can only be made when patients come forward because

of a complaint of a lump in the breast. It would be

extremely   difficult   to   provide   a    routine

examination  for  all  women.  However,  women  who

detect  any  small  lump in the breast  should  see

their  general practitioners or attend one  of  the

Government outpatient dispensaries, or one  of  the

Maternal  and  Child Health Clinics. They  will  be

referred  to the surgeon if the doctor  feels  this

requires further opinion.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not intended to introduce legislation to

provide for periodic examinations for cancer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A proposal for the expansion of the Cytological

Service  has  been made this year.  This  has  been

submitted  to  Treasury for  consideration.  It  is

intended  under this proposal to screen  all  women

who  are  likely  to have symptoms.  The  estimated

figure  to  require such screening  will  be  about

100,000 to 125,000 cases per year.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Health whether he will consider providing nightsoil

workers  with hygienic masks and uniform so  as  to

promote  a healthier, neater and a more disciplined

working   force  befitting  a  "Garden   City"   in

Southeast Asia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry concurs with the

view  that the wearing of uniforms will lead  to  a

neater  appearance and will assist in the fostering

of  a sense of discipline in a work force. But  the

provision of uniforms, if accepted, should in  fact

not be confined to only nightsoil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



workers, but should be made available to all daily-rated   workers  engaged  in  environmental  public

health  work.  In  the  case  of  street  cleansing

workers,  an added safety consideration  exists  as

they can be easily identified by traffic on roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the provision of uniforms has

been  under active consideration, and the  Ministry

is in consultation with the Ministry of Finance for

the  introduction  of uniforms  for  a  disciplined

public  health  work  force.  The  annual  cost  of

providing such uniforms works out to about $35  per

workman;  and the annual cost of such  uniforms  at

the  present  time  for 6,500 environmental  health

workers  has  been  estimated to  be  approximately

$240,000.  This  matter is being pursued  with  the

Ministry of Finance. The cost of providing uniforms

for  600  nightsoil workers alone  is  $21,000  per

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the provision of protective masks in any

work  operation  for workers is  only  resorted  to

where  improvements  to the industrial  techniques,

the provision of exhaust hoods and the installation

of   mechanical   ventilation  are  inadequate   to

eliminate entirely any dangerous dust or fumes that

may  affect the health of the workers. The handling

of nightsoil does not give rise to such dangers and

is  of  no direct health value, contrary to popular

opinion. There is, of course, an aesthetic value as

the   smell  associated  with  such  work  is   not

pleasant.  The use of protective masks,  therefore,

for  this  purpose alone is not practical  as  such

masks  restrict  movement, are  uncomfortable,  and

have   never   been   popular  with   the   workers

themselves. Even if such masks are supplied, it  is

doubtful  they  will  be  worn  by  the  night-soil

workers.

particularly in cinema entertainment in Singapore, whether he will  take steps  to  ensure that film distributors  supply  a

reasonable  quantity of educational  films  to  the

cinemas  so  as  to provide wholesome entertainment

for our children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, film distributors are at

liberty  to  exhibit the types of films  that  they

wish  and they will naturally bring in those  films

which  in their view will draw the biggest  revenue

for  them. The control which is exercised  is  done

through  the  Board of Film Censors  which  ensures

that  objectionable  films are  not  shown  to  the

public. It is neither practical nor practicable  to

lay  down  any  stipulations  with  regard  to  the

quantity of educational films to be shown.  In  any

case,   it   is  difficult  to  specify   what   an

educational  film is, remembering that  films  that

educate  are  not  necessarily  restricted  to  the

documentaries but must include the wider  field  of

film  entertainment from which any child can  learn

something that enhances not only his knowledge  but

his sense of values. In recent weeks some films  of

good   educational  value  depicting  the   broader

aspects  of  nature  and  wild  life  study,  self-reliance, innovation, have been shown in Singapore.

Exhibitors  will bring in such films if they  find

they are appreciated by their customers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children's section of the National Library

also  shows films which are educational in  nature,

in addition to talks, lectures, etc., for children.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister said just now that some good

educational  films have been shown in Singapore  in

recent weeks. Does he know how many good films were

shown  over  the  past two years? There  were  only

seven good films. The rest were all films depicting

violence,  killing and sex. Has not Government  the

duty to promote the screening of good films?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said in my reply, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



film  distributors will import only films that have

a  demand  in  Singapore. Therefore, it  is  not  a

question  of whether Government wants to  stipulate

the  kind  of films to be imported. If there  is  a

great demand for films depicting violence and sword

fights, as can be seen nowadays, the film producers

will  produce more of such films. So it all depends

on the taste of the film-going public.

<div align="center"><b>ABORTION BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[23rd December, 1969], "That the Bill be now read a

Third time." - [Mr Chua Sian Chin].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>3.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many people believe that the

primary  object of the Abortion Bill is to  provide

an  additional  check on the population  growth  of

Singapore,  particularly when contraceptives  fail.

If this is truly the primary intention of the Bill,

then I cannot accept it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family planning in Singapore has been a great

success  and  our  crude  birth  rate  has   fallen

dramatically in recent years to 2.3 per  cent.  For

this,  I  must congratulate the former and  present

Ministers  for  Health, and  I  am  sure  with  the

continued efforts by the present Minister on family

planning, the expected target of two per  cent  by

1970  will be within our reach. I therefore  cannot

see the need to introduce this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My contention is that despite the great advances

made in science, now that man is able to travel  to

the  moon, man is still unable to create human life

in  a  science  laboratory. Since we cannot  create

human life, we have no right to destroy human life.

Except for medical emergencies when both the lives

of the mother and the unborn baby are at stake, and

unless the resort to abortion can save at least the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



mother, I cannot agree to abortion under any  other

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that population control is absolutely

necessary for the preservation and even survival of

the community, but is it necessary at this stage of

great  success  in family planning that  we  should

resort to killing of the foetus in order to control

population  growth? The Minister has  not  proposed

that  it be made illegal for anyone to have  five,

10  or  even 12 children, though the father may  be

deprived   of  income  tax  relief,  free   primary

education,  etc, in  respect  of  the  fourth  and

subsequent  children. Yet it should be pointed  out

that  for every abortion done to reduce the  number

of  births by one, its effect is cancelled  by  the

many  unwanted  births to others who  already  have

several  children. Therefore, the answer  seems  to

lie  not  in  abortion,  but  in  compulsory  birth

control  for  people with more than, say,  two  or

three  children. Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect

to the Minister, I cannot accept the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would leave this thought with

the  House - if this Bill had been introduced, say,

50  years ago, would we be so fortunate as to  have

all our 11 Ministers with us today?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the noticeable trends in

developed  countries  is  that  parents  with  more

education  have  much smaller families  than  those

with less education. This trend is also discernible

in    urbanised,   though   still   underdeveloped,

societies like Singapore. If these trends  continue

to  their logical conclusions, then the quality  of

the population will go down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all societies, there are the more intelligent

and the less intelligent. Professor Richard Lynn, a

member   of   the  Economic  and  Social   Research

Institute,  Dublin, wrote in the New  Scientist  of

20th March, 1969, that geneticists have come to the

conclusion   that   intelligence   is   principally

determined  by  heredity.  One  of  the   ways   of

demonstrating  this  is  through   the   study   of

identical   twins  reared  in  different  families.

Investigations in Britain, America and Denmark



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



have   invariably  revealed  a  high   measure   of

agreement  between the I.Q.s of  identical  twins,

even  though  they have been reared in families  of

different  educational and cultural standards.  The

I.Q. classification of the levels of  the  various

occupations  was  quoted by  the  same  author  as

follows:





<pre>

       Occupation                      Mean I.Q.



  Higher professional and executive       150

  Lower professional and executive        130

  Highly skilled and Clerical             118

  Skilled workers                         108

  Semi-skilled workers                     97

  Unskilled workers                        86

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unlikely that many other attributes of

mind and body are also inherited. But whatever  the

inheritance,  man,  more  than  any  other   living

creature, depends on nurturing and training for his

capacity to mature and to develop. Man needs to  be

reared  for one-third of his life span in order  to

be  productive for the next two-thirds.  In  highly

developed societies, students are supported for  25

to  27 years until they get their Ph.D.'s, and then

begin  to  repay their debt to society.  His  final

performance  is  affected  by  diet,   health   and

cultural,  social  and  educational  opportunities.

When  the  less educated who are also in the  lower

income  groups  have large families,  the  problems

they  create  for  their children  are  compounded.

Resources,  time, attention and care,  lavished  on

one  or  two children, can nurture and develop  the

endowments of the children to their fullest extent;

when  spread and frittered over six or more in  the

family,  prevent any child from getting the chances

he could have had in a smaller family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In urbanised Singapore, this can become an

acute  problem.  Free  pre-natal  care,  post-natal

health  and  almost  free  medical  services   have

reduced infant mortality to the low rates of highly

developed  countries. Free education and subsidised

housing lead to a situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



where  the  less economically productive people  in

the  community are reproducing themselves at  rates

higher than the rest. This will increase the  total

population of less productive people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem is how to devise a system of disincentives,

so that the irresponsible, the social delinquents, do not

believe that all the have to do is to produce their

children and the government then owes them and their

children sufficient food, medicine, housing, education

and jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain areas of activity over which

control  by  any government is both  difficult  and

repugnant.  One  such area is  the  choice  of  the

number  of  children a father and mother decide  to

rear.  One  day  the pressure of circumstances  may

become  so acute that attitudes must change.  Until

such  time  when  moral inhibitions  disappear  and

legislative or administrative measures can be taken

to  regulate the size of families, we must  try  to

induce  people  to  limit their families  and  give

their children a better chance. The quality of  our

population  depends on raising not  only  the  I.Q.

level but also getting parents to care, nurture and

educate  their  children and to develop  all  those

other  qualities  so  crucial to  effective  living

summed up in the word "character".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every person, genius or moron, has a right to

reproduce himself. So we assume that a married pair

will  want  to be allowed two children  to  replace

them.  This is already the average size  family  of

the   skilled  industrial  worker  in  Europe.   In

Singapore  we  still allow three for good  measure.

Beyond  the three children, the costs of subsidised

housing,  socialised medicine  and  free  education

should  be  transferred  to  the  parent.  We  have

changed  the priorities in public housing,  by  not

awarding more points for more children. One day  we

may  have to put disincentives or penalties on  the

other social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By introducing this new abortion law together

with the companion voluntary sterilisation law, we

are  making  possible  the  exercise  of  voluntary

choice. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



we must keep a close watch on the result of the new

laws and the patterns of use which will emerge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unlikely that the people who will want

to  restrict their families are the better educated

parents  in  better paid jobs. They are the  people

who already understand that their children's future

depends  on  their  being able to  care  for  their

health, education and upbringing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the crucial yardsticks by which we shall

have  to judge the results of the new abortion  law

combined with the voluntary sterilisation law  will

be  whether  it tends to raise or lower  the  total

quality of our population. We must encourage  those

who earn less than $200 per month and cannot afford

to  nurture and educate many children never to have

more  than  two. Intelligent application  of  these

laws  can  help  reduce  the  distortion  that  has

already  set in. Until the less educated themselves

are   convinced  and  realise  that   they   should

concentrate their limited resources on one  or  two

to  give their children the maximum chance to climb

up  the  educational  ladder, their  children  will

always be at the bottom of the economic scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlikely that the results will be

discernible before five years. Nor will the  effect

be felt before fifteen to twenty years. But we will

regret  the  time lost if we do not  now  take  the

first  tentative steps towards correcting  a  trend

which can leave our society with a large number  of

the   physically,  intellectually  and   culturally

anaemic.



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was expecting to see, as a

result  of  the numerous representations submitted,

some  basic  changes  and amendments  made  by  the

Select Committee on the Abortion Bill but this  has

not  been  so.  The  Minister  for  Health  in  his

statement  last Tuesday in this House  stated  that

there  were  some minor amendments but  that  there

were    no   substantial   changes,   though   many

representations had been submitted  to  the  Select

Committee. And studying the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



Select Committee's Report, I am somewhat struck  by

a number of points raised in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not wish to go back to those

points  I made in this House on Tuesday, 8th April,

1969. My stand has not been changed since then  and

I  do not wish to waste Members' time by repeating

what  I  said then. Therefore, Sir, suffice that  I

shall confine my remarks to the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it can be seen that out of 29 written

representations  and not 33, Sir,  the  other  four

were on the Voluntary Sterilization Bill - received

by the Select Committee on the Abortion Bill, there

were  no  less than 21 that were either opposed  to

the  Bill in principle or at least were opposed  to

the present broadly worded "socio-economic" clause,

found  in  clause 5 (2) (b). In spite of  this,  it

appears  to me that the Select Committee  not  only

did  not  see fit to propose any amendment to  this

clause, but also they did not appear to have  spent

very  much  time  discussing the arguments  against

this    clause   which   were   made    in    those

representations. The arguments put forth by some of

them  I  consider to be extremely well-founded  and

forceful.  Take  Paper No. 14, in page  A4l  as  an

example.  I  refer to points Nos. 7  to  12.  These

people  consider themselves as teachers who have  a

responsibility to perform, and they are of the view

that clause 5 (2), if passed, will have ill-effects

"on the character of the nation". And so, too, have

many  of the representations been made on the point

that  the  human  foetus has at  least  some  human

rights. Yet nowhere in the Minutes of Evidence do I

find  the  Select Committee seeking  to  have  this

point  discussed,  much less conceded  to.  Surely,

this is the central issue: if the human foetus  has

no  human  rights, then there is no  need  for  any

legal  restrictions on abortion; but if the  foetus

does  possess some human rights, then the law  must

exercise  extreme caution to protect  those  rights

from  being  violated.  It is  regretted  that  the

Select  Committee did not seem to have thought  fit

to  raise the question of the rights of the  foetus

at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me, Sir, to another point about

which I feel very, very strongly. In referring to

those who sent in written representations on the

Abortion Bill, the Minister for Health in his

speech said in this House and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some took their stand in accordance with their

particular religious persuasion, although they of

course did not want openly to admit it.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, I consider this remark a

gratuitous insult to the authors of the

representations. It accuses them, by implication,

of insincerity, of concealment and of crookedness.

I consider it not only insulting but blatantly

unjust and uncalled for. I know that amongst the

memoranda sent in by religious organisations, the

largest number came from the Catholic bodies. Yet

reading the representations, do we find them

arguing that abortion should be prohibited because

the Catholic Church teaches that it is wrong? We do

not. We find them arguing that abortions should be

prohibited because it is bad for the nation. They

ask that their case should be judged not on the

merits of their religious beliefs but on the

strength of their arguments. We may agree or

disagree with their arguments, but we have no right

to doubt the integrity of those who oppose it. I am

a Catholic. I am also opposed to abortions. I am

opposed to abortions not because I am a Catholic -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> - but because I think it is

wrong. Just as I am opposed to murder because I

think it is wrong. All Members of this House think

that murder is wrong too. You do not have to be a

Catholic, or for that matter a Hindu, a Muslim or a

Buddhist to think that abortion is wrong. I am

opposed to a liberalised abortion policy because I

think this would be bad for our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very easy to write off the opposition to

this Bill as "religious objections". This saves us

the trouble of examining the rational arguments put

forward against it. This enables us to evade the

very pertinent questions raised, questions which

have nothing to do with religion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



but which have a great deal to do with the welfare



of our people.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear from the number of

representations sent in that a considerable amount

of thought and care went into their preparation.

The authors of these representations were acting as

responsible citizens. They were fulfilling what

they considered to be their duty towards the State

by expressing their genuine misgivings about the

social consequences of this Bill. Instead of being

glad and grateful that there are such people,

people who are concerned about the welfare of the

nation, people with initiative to clarify their

misgivings, people with courage to express them,

the Minister for Health has seen fit to treat them

with ridicule and to brush them off with a cheap

smear, and I quote, "although they of course did

not want openly to admit it." This sort of attitude

on the part of the Minister is hardly calculated to

enhance the atmosphere of religious tolerance and

mutual respect for which Singapore has been

hitherto renowned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> By imposing your views on others?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Minister, you will have plenty of time to

reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer to my next point on "conscientious

objection" which is in respect of clause 10 (2) of

the Bill. It is gratifying to note that the Select

Committee has made it clear that a statement under

oath or on affirmation will establish proof of

conscientious objection. This is what the Minister

said. However, in dealing with sub-clause (3) of

clause 10, I am surprised to note that no

cognisance appears to have been taken of the

doctor's responsibility towards the foetus. Once

again, it seems to be assumed that the foetus has

no rights at all. In this connection, it seems to

me that the Minister for Health has misinterpreted

a clause in the Declaration of Geneva, because

twice in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



course  of  the  examination of the  witnesses,  he

raised  this point. I refer to pages B78  and  B98,

paragraphs 591 and 750. The Declaration  of  Geneva

is,  in part, reproduced in paragraph 32 of Dr  S.

R.  Salmon's  representation, Paper  No.  27.  This

paragraph is in the Report at page A73. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I will not permit considerations of religion,

nationality,   race,  party  politics   or   social

standing  to  intervene  between  my  duty  and  my

patient.'



<br><br>I  think, Sir, the clear and obvious meaning to  it

is  this.  I  will  not refuse to treat  a  patient

because I disagree with his religion, or disapprove

of his nationality or dislike his race or abhor his

political views or consider his social standing  as

beneath me. In other words, it is talking about the

religion of the patient and not about that  of  the

doctor.  Furthermore, let us not  forget  that  the

doctor   who   has  conscientious   objections   to

abortion, objects to abortion precisely because  he

sees  it  as being against his duty to one  of  his

patients. Sir, may I refer Members to page  A50  of

the  Select  Committee's Report?  Paragraph  10  of

Paper No. 21 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As doctors we consider it our duty to safeguard

the  life  and  health of our patients.  What  non-medical  people apparently fail to realise is  that

when a pregnant woman comes to a doctor, the doctor

considers  that he has two patients to look  after.

This  is  not the opinion based on metaphysical  or

theological  speculation. This  is  a  simple  fact

based on scientific evidence.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, since the Minister for Health is so

concerned about the Declaration of Geneva,  I  wish

that he had also referred to another clause in  the

Declaration.  In  paragraph 32  of  Paper  No.  27,

reproduced   on  page  A73  of  the   Report,   the

Declaration reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I will maintain the utmost respect for human life

from the time of conception;'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> When is that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Ask yourself. You are a father; you should know.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, what causes me a lot of uneasiness

in reading this Report is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



absence  of  any clear indication that  the  Select

Committee  was  convinced that abortion  is  a  bad

thing  and is to be reduced to a minimum. Sometimes

one  could get the opposite impression and this  is

understandable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in discussing the question whether

the  Abortion  Bill is to be used  as  a  means  of

population  control  - I refer  to  the  Minutes  of

Evidence  at page B37, paragraphs 254 and 256  - one

of  the  witnesses quoted the Minister for Health's

speech in this House:



'Another  important  benefit to  our  society  that

would  result from this Bill would be to lower  the

rate of our population growth...'



And further on, the Chairman said, and I quote with

your permission, Sir:



'We  must  recognise one point, and that is,  every

abortion performed under this Bill, when it is law,

will,   whatever  its  purpose,  play  a  part   in

population control.'



This is undoubtedly true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> So what!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> But one searches in

vain  for  any expression of regret that  abortions

should  be performed at all. The impression I  get,

Sir,  is that the Select Committee's attitude  was:

Well,  abortions  are  being performed;  they  will

continue  to be performed. Some people  think  that

this  is  undesirable, so we will make a few  minor

amendments  to placate them. We will merely  change

"risk  to  the  life  of  the  pregnant  woman"  to

"serious  risk"  and  so  on.  But  we  will  leave

untouched the most controversial clause - the socio-economic clause and the environmental clause  which

can  be  interpreted  broadly enough  to  suit  any

purpose.  And  then we will see  what  happens.  If

things work out badly, we can always amend the  law

again.  In  the  meantime, we note  that  abortions

reduce the population growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, the Minister for Communications hit

the  nail on the head when he was reported to  have

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With family planning a success and legislation of

abortion  on  the cards, I envisage that  whichever

government is in power in the late '70s would  have

seriously to consider whether or not to offer  baby

bonuses  to  mothers, in order to  check  the  fast

falling  birth rate that would prevail in Singapore

at   that  time.'  [The  Sunday  Times  dated  21st

December, 1969, page 1].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



So, today this House passes this Bill to liberalise

the  law on abortion. But what I am afraid is  that

the  House in the late seventies, which is some ten

years  away,  may have to forbid abortion  and  may

come up with another Bill - to offer mothers-to-be-hence   baby  bonuses!  Can  you  see  what  irony!

Therefore, if we try to look ahead ten years hence,

I  am  sure  many Members in this House,  who  will

definitely  be  around, will then sadly  sigh,  "We

made a terrible mistake in 1969!".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps the House will be interested to note

further that an article in The Sunday Times of  the

same date and captioned: "A Sunday Times Inquiry"



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ng, if you quote, you might refer to the

headlines.  Holding the newspaper  up  will  hardly

enable Members to identify the article to which you

refer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I have already mentioned that it is The

Sunday  Times  dated 21st December, 1969,  page  3,

under  the headline, "A long queue -but not  enough

babies to adopt".



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Is that a Sunday bonus?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> It is for you! Sir, the conclusion I am about to

draw is obvious, for I did mention in this House on

8th  April, 1969 - Hansard, Vol. 28, No.  11,  col.

895, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...a child unwanted by its parents may well become

a treasure to some childless couple.'



<br><br>May  I  therefore, Sir, recommend this for  careful

and  considerate consumption to those who  are  too

eager   to   recommend  liberalised   abortion   as

advocated in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some of us here in this House are convinced

that  abortion is a bad thing, and that  widespread

abortion  would  be disastrous for the  nation.  We

think  it  should  be confined and  discouraged  in

every possible way. It would therefore seem that we

have failed to convince this

House on this point. Perhaps the fault is ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yours!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Perhaps we lack the ability and vitality to put

our  arguments  across clearly enough.  Perhaps  we

lack  the  power of persuasion necessary to  induce

the  people to look beyond the immediate advantages

of  this  Bill to the long-term disadvantages  that

will come with its implementation.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I oppose the Abortion Bill.

Although  abortion is not forced on those  who  are

against  it,  nevertheless when this  Bill  becomes

law,  it will automatically encourage and also give

an  opportunity to those who seek to satisfy  their

lust  to  abuse this Bill. Is this not  a  shameful

act?  Abortion  on the foetus, which  is  life,  is

tantamount  to  killing.  For  this  reason,  Islam

forbids abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not logical to have the Abortion Bill

because  family  planning  can  be  a  success   if

Government improve on the methods. If this Bill  is

not  successfully carried out, has  the  Government

plans  to  introduce another Bill to kill  new-born

babies?   If  this  happens,  what  will   be   the

devastation that will befall human beings?  Sir,  I

oppose this Bill.



<br><br>4.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, when the Abortion Bill was read a Second time,

I  neither objected to nor approved of it. But  now

that it is being read a Third time. I oppose it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now my colleagues mentioned that, in the

past,   family   planning   campaigns   have   been

successfully carried out. Why then is it  necessary

to   liberalise  the  law  on  abortion  if  family

planning has been a success? Abortion can  be  very

harmful  and dangerous to the health of the mother.

If  we  implement this Bill, are we not,  in  fact,

encouraging  many  young  people  to   indulge   in

promiscuous behaviour?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Minister for Finance is doing

his best to encourage tourism. That is why the bars

are doing very well. These places of sin result  in

the birth of more babies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Minister for Culture, in reply to a

question   earlier,  said  that   films   depicting

violence  and  sword fights are  popular.  He  then

becomes a "yellow" Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of clarification. In

fact,  before  the  Member for  Delta  raised  this

question  I  had, on occasion, personally  met  the

film distributors, like the Cathay Organisation and

Shaw  Brothers, who produce films in Hong  Kong.  I

raised  with them the fact that there are too  many

films which are not of educational value, and asked

them  whether they would produce more  films  which

would  be  of  civic and educational  value.  Their

answer was this. They said that they had, in  fact,

imported some of these films and found that the box-office  takings  were always very  poor.  They  are

therefore very reluctant to produce films which are

of  a  serious  type or have educational  or  civic

value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate it if Members, like the

Members  for Ulu Pandan and Delta, would  do  their

part  to  exhort  parents not  to  encourage  their

children to patronise sword-fighting films  but  to

patronise films having educational or civic value.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a point of clarification. May I

know what relevance this has to the Abortion Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> By virtue of your proximity to him, Mr Chua, it

is easier for you to ascertain that from the Acting

Minister for Culture than for me!



<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to be quite honest, before the

Minister  for Health made his Third Reading  speech

on  this Bill, I was in two minds whether I  should

speak again or not, considering the fact



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



that  I  had  spoken at great length on the  Second

Reading  on  this topic. But after  his  speech  in

which he made many sweeping statements, I found  it

very tempting to speak again, and I have decided to

speak now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Abortion Bill, the

Health  Minister,  to  me,  somehow  seems  to   be

labouring under the magnificent obsession  that  he

has  become a liberator of women's rights.  He  has

liberated  them from unwanted pregnancies.  He  has

also  come  out  with  a solution  to  solving  the

delinquency  problem and improving the  quality  of

children  to be born in future. This, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  sounds to me like the views of an  extremist,

because  if we were to speak in the same manner  as

he  did  on  the point of liberating the rights  of

this  or  that category of persons, then  would  he

consider fighting for the rights of groups  of  men

who   would   want,  on  their  own,  to  patronise

brothels,  or  watch  obscene  films  without   the

harrassment  of the police? There is at  present  a

law against such type of entertainment which is, in

fact, in the manner of the Health Minister, denying

the  rights of certain categories of our  citizens.

Is   he  also  not  worried  about  the  rights  of

thousands of women who perhaps for months and years

have been out of job and to whom we, as Members  of

Parliament, have had to attend sometimes  at  meet-the-people   sessions?  And   would   he   consider

legalising  prostitution, because that could  be  a

very  profitable profession today  in  our  present

situation?  But for him to speak as  he  did  would

only   incur  probably  the  displeasure  of  many,

because there are such things as public morals  and

public concern for matters like this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also mentioned the solving of the

delinquency  problem, or something to that  effect.

Perhaps  he  should  turn  his  attention  to   the

delinquency problem in England, and in places where

abortion  is already legalised. It has  been  found

that  in  no  way  does  abortion  help  to  reduce

delinquency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> When did Britain legalise the abortion laws?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> What proof has the Minister that delinquency is

the result of unwanted babies?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other very damaging point that he has made is

that  this  Bill  could  improve  the  quality   of

children born after the Bill is passed. This is  to

suggest  that  all  this  while,  the  quality   of

children born before the enactment of this Bill  is

questionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now view the whole Bill

as  it  stands. Leaving aside the minor  points,  I

think   the  Bill  can  be  reduced  to  two  major

underlying  principles, namely,  that  abortion  is

permitted (1) on medical grounds, and (2) on socio-economic  grounds. The first principle  on  medical

grounds   would  also  include  cases  on   eugenic

grounds,  and cases of rape which could  result  in

the mental health being affected. This could be the

main underlying principle behind this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first principle, namely, on medical

grounds,  I think there is in existence today  some

provisions  in the Penal Code permitting  abortions

to  be carried out under limiting circumstances  on

medical grounds. It may be necessary that the scope

and  area in which an abortion could be carried out

on  medical  grounds should be extended. Therefore,

any  feature of this Bill relating to the  question

of  permitting  abortions  to  be  carried  out  on

medical grounds will find no objection from me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My objection, and what I consider as a very

highly  controversial point in this  Bill,  is  the

clause that permits abortions to be carried out  on

socio-economic grounds. To begin with, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  term  "socio-economic grounds"  is  very

difficult  to define and to assess. For example,  a

middle-aged  couple may find it very  difficult  to

have  two  or  even  one child because  they  would

prefer   to  have  a  car,  a  television  set,   a

refrigerator, and all the modern comforts of  life.

And  if  they have a car, a television set,  and  a

refrigerator,  they would further prefer  a  bigger

car,   a   bigger  television  set,  and  a  better

refrigerator.  On the other hand, a couple  with  a

low income may find it quite acceptable to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



more  than two or three children, because  they  do

not  care very much for the modern luxuries of life

but  they  care more for the love and affection  of

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families amongst the vast majority of workers in

the low-income group are too large because they  do

not  believe in family planning. I think the  right

step to take to help reduce the plight and size  of

such families in the low-income group is to step up

the  family planning campaign and to make a genuine

effort  to get these big families in the low-income

group to participate in family planning programmes.

But  to do it through abortion will, I think,  lead

to  a  great  deal of other complications,  because

abortion  is not as simple a matter as the  removal

of an appendix but an operation that involves wider

implications.  Abortion  means  the  removal  of  a

foetus.  Whatever our religious views  are  on  the

status  of the foetus, no one can deny that  it  is

the  source  of life, a potential life.  Therefore,

its removal is not a matter to be taken lightly. It

is precisely because of our respect for the foetus

irrespective  of  whether it is life  itself  or  a

potential life, and because we hold a high  respect

for  life itself that we should be very careful  in

taking any step that will cause disrespect for  the

foetus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said already both from within and

from  without  this  House on the  implications  of

abortion, and I feel it is not necessary for me  to

repeat  all the arguments against the complications

and   implications  of  such  a  move.  My   point,

therefore, Mr Speaker, is that abortion is  not  a

simple matter. It has other repercussions and other

implications.  We  will allow  an  abortion  to  be

carried  out only under very good grounds.  But  to

legalise  abortion  and to allow  abortions  to  be

carried out on socio-economic grounds will lead  to

many  serious undesirable results. Because of that,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  not  convinced  by  the

evidence   appearing  in  the  Select   Committee's

Report, and I do not think that the speech  of  the

Minister  for Health can change my views  on  this

Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Abortion Bill was read

a  Second time in this House, I did not speak on it

because  I thought many of my colleagues  here  had

already  expressed their views. I  had  hoped  that

when  the  Bill was considered in Select Committee,

Government  would accept the views of the  majority

and would introduce certain amendments to the Bill.

But  after  the Bill had been considered in  Select

Committee and brought up for Third Reading in  this

House, I find that the Select Committee's Report is

very disappointing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My views on this Bill centre on two points.

First,  I  would like to give my views as a  woman.

Second, in respect of the future of our country,  I

would  like to give a warning. All of you  are  not

women.  Of  course, all of you think that  whatever

you  want  to  do,  you can and  will  do  it.  For

example,   when   Government   wanted   to   reduce

population   growth,  it  implemented  the   family

planning campaign. This is beneficial to the future

of  our  country as well as to the family. In  this

respect, women have sacrificed a great deal. In the

whole  process of family planning, those  adversely

affected  are the women. Whenever you are free,  go

to  the family planning clinics and you will find

that those who go there are women, not men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our women have played their part for the country.

This fact is well recognised by the country and the

people   themselves.  Quite  often  it   has   been

emphasised that, in terms of population growth, the

family planning campaign is a great success because

it  has  managed  to reduce the population  growth.

This  should  be a source of great satisfaction  to

all of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government does not sufficiently

accept   the   success  of  this  family   planning

campaign. Instead it is proposing to adopt  another

course  of  action, i.e., when a woman is  pregnant

and  does  not  want  the baby,  she  can  have  an

abortion. According to the Minister for Health, the

process is painless



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



and will not affect the mother's health. Perhaps it

is  because he is not a woman that he does not know

how  it  feels.  Whether  the  performance  of   an

abortion  is painful and whether it is damaging  to

the mother's health, only a woman can tell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider this Bill very carefully. Those

women  who go for abortions usually come  from  the

lower  income group, i.e., their standard of living

is  poor.  Quite  often they lack  the  nourishment

necessary after an abortion. If we move from family

planning  to abortion, then I am afraid  that  more

pregnant women will go for abortion, and in the end

those  who suffer will not be the fathers  but  the

mothers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Prime Minister

mentioned  that  from  the point  of  view  of  the

economy of the country it is necessary to curb  the

population  growth of the country.  Since  we  have

recognised  the  fact  that  the  family   planning

campaign  has been successful, why must we  pass  a

Bill  to  legalise abortion? By doing so,  we  will

encourage  people  to  do  things  which  are   not

beneficial to the country. We can see that in  many

countries  they  have  not found  it  necessary  to

legalise  abortion  in order to  reduce  population

growth  and  thus  improve  the  economy  of  their

country.  They  do not rely on the legalisation  of

abortion  to  raise  the living standard  of  their

people.  Take China as an example. We can say  that

it  is  the most heavily populated country  in  the

world.  But  its economy is also one  of  the  most

stable.  Why is this so? Why cannot we  learn  from

the  example of China as well as of other countries

in  our effort to improve our economy and raise the

living  standard of our people? Why must we take  a

retrogressive  step  by  introducing  the  Abortion

Bill? It is not an act of a responsible government.

The  Singapore  Government has  already  emphasised

that we must try to establish our prestige in South-east Asia. At the same time, we must also try to be

a  model  country in South-east Asia.  But  are  we

trying to establish ourselves as a model country by

this  Abortion Bill? If the Government thinks  that

our population is too big and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



that it is having an adverse effect on our economy,

why  does  it not kill some people? Is this  not  a

better  way? Legalisation of abortion is tantamount

to  murder. But it is not a direct form of  murder.

It  is an indirect form of murder. If we go through

with  this  Bill,  then in time  to  come  we  will

realise  that what we are doing now is wrong.  From

the  short-term point of view, it may appear to  be

the  correct course of action. But from  the  long-term  point  of view, it is wrong. We must  try  to

educate  our  people not only on sex  but  also  on

every  other  aspect of life. That  is,  make  them

understand  the  problems arising out  of  a  large

family  and  their effects on the  economy  of  our

country.  This  is  what  a responsible  government

should   do.  The  P.A.P.  Government  should   not

introduce  this  Bill  and other  Bills  that  will

encourage  promiscuous behaviour in our people.  We

know  that  our people conduct themselves  properly

because they live in a society governed by law  and

order. They realise that in a democracy there is  a

limit  to  their  freedom. But by introducing  this

Bill  to legalise abortion, we are giving them more

freedom. This is an undesirable action on the  part

of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind the

Minister  for Health that our women will  suffer  a

great  deal more if the Bill is passed.  We  should

reconsider  it and take into account the  long-term

point  of view and its effect on the country  as  a

whole.



<br><br>4.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in every democratic government,

the motivation for introducing new laws or changing

old ones is based on two factors. First, it can  be

the  result  of a public outcry for  or  against  a

certain  matter.  The  second  factor  is  when   a

situation  is  so very critical that Government  is

called  upon  to  introduce  emergency  laws.  With

abortion,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, there  is  no  public

outcry  for  the introduction of a  law.  Even  the

doctors themselves do not like the abortion law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



In  so  far  as the liberalisation of  abortion  is

concerned, I have a feeling that the law  is  cock-eyed  since  there  is  an Authorisation  Board  to

terminate  pregnancy. We all know that  a  pregnant

woman or any woman who carries an unwanted baby  is

a  desperate woman and she will not submit  to  the

embarrassment  of  presenting  herself  before  the

Authorisation  Board.  No  one  will  go   to   the

Authorisation Board. Women who are in a financially

sound  position will see a private doctor. However,

those  who are poor will still resort to the  back-street  practitioners for an  abortion.  These  are

facts which we cannot deny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a realist and I always speak with facts

and  figures to back me up, unlike the Minister for

Health who always speaks in abstract terms. Let  us

look at the figures of population growth in 1968. I

am  quoting  from the Monthly Digest of  Statistics

published  by the Ministry of Labour in  1968.  The

figure  for  live  births in 1968  is  47,241.  The

figure  for  deaths in the same year is 10,982.  So

for  1968  we  have a net gain of  36,259.  Let  me

project  it for ten years, from 1969 to  1979.  The

population  increase  will  only  be  360,000.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, 360,000 is a little bit more than one-third of a million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> What is the basis of your projection?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On the same basis as the figure for 1968 where

the  difference in live births and deaths  gives  a

net gain of 36,259, Assuming that this rate remains

constant, in ten years' time our country will  have

an increase in population of only 360,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> What is the basis of your assumption?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> This is no assumption, Mr Speaker. I have

obtained these figures from the Ministry of  Labour

publication.  I  do not see how  the  Minister  can

behave like an alarmist, why he is so afraid of the

population. Let us not forget that the Minister  is

very young, energetic and virile. He has fought the

Communists  and the communalists.  But  now  he  is

running away



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



from  infants  and  babies. All possible  arguments

have  been  put  forward in  the  Select  Committee

meetings and published in the report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Over and over again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> There is no need for us here to carry on the

debate  "over  and  over  again",  to  borrow   the

Minister's words, if, in the implementation of  the

Abortion  Bill,  it  can  fulfil  the  aim  of  the

Government, let it be so. But if there are  adverse

results,  my  only hope is that  the  law  will  be

reviewed   as   early  as  possible,  without   the

Government waiting for four years and a  review  in

the fifth year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate on Third Reading resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I reply to the points

raised  by the various opposition speakers  to  the

Bill, may I first make a few preliminary remarks on

their  speeches? At first, I was rather anxious  to

hear  some  more new points that they  might  bring

forward  to oppose the Bill. But, unfortunately,  I

find that they have repeated the familiar arguments

in  opposition  to  the Bill and  it  has  left  me

greatly disappointed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Any new point would have fallen on deaf ears!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> However, may I just say this? After listening to

the  very  ardent speech by the Member for Punggol,

may  I  say  that  I  do admire his  doggedness  in

opposing  this Bill? He did not, as expected,  lose

any opportunity to oppose this Bill once again even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



on  its Third Reading. I do respect his persistence

and  the courage of his convictions in speaking out

quite  loudly  and strongly against it.  But  I  am

afraid  I cannot likewise have similar respect  for

the  cogency  of  his arguments in opposing  it.  I

admire  all  the more his dogged opposition  to  it

since I have every reason to believe that his  last

stand  against it must necessarily end  up  in  the

dust-bins of history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take the arguments of Members one at a

time?  To  begin with, of course, I must  give  the

honour  to the Member for Punggol. In his argument,

he  did say that out of the 29 representations made

on  the  Bill in Select Committee, 21 were  against

the  inclusion of the socio-economic clause or  the

environmental  clause  in the  Bill.  I  think  his

argument  is  that there was strong  opposition  to

this    clause   judging   by   the    number    of

representations made on it. May I just  remind  him

that  the multiplicity of representations does  not

necessarily  mean the strength of  the  opposition.

For  example,  if  you just look  at  some  of  the

addresses  of the representations in opposition  to

the Bill, you will find that a number came from the

same  address. Two of them came from 96 Bras  Basah

Road  and  three of them came from  76  Bras  Basah

Road,  but,  of course, under different  names  and

different labels.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> That is very unfortunate!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I hope my point is quite clear. The other point

on  which  the  Member for Punggol  did  express  a

certain  amount  of  sorrow  is  that  the   Select

Committee  did not think fit to debate whether  the

foetus  has  a right to life or whether  it  should

have  human  rights like anyone of us. This,  as  I

have  said  again and again, will involve ourselves

in   the  argument  which  primarily  springs  from

religious  and  ethical  considerations.  When  the

Member  for Punggol made this assertion, he  forgot

one medical fact - that, as far as I know, from the

medical  point of view, the foetus  is  not  yet  a

human  being, and as such, logically,  how  can  it

have human rights?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol did take strong exception

to my remark that some of the opposition comes from

persons  who  take their stand in  accordance  with

their  religious persuasion, although they  do  not

want to admit it openly. I suppose it would suffice

for me to say that the truth does hurt. Some of the

opponents  to the Bill say that they do not  oppose

it  on  religious or ethical grounds, but  when  we

examine their arguments more deeply, we are sure to

find that they revolve around certain religious  or

ethical dogmas. I have said this in my introductory

speech and I do not think I need go further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol made a great deal of play

on  The Sunday Times report of "baby bonuses" which

was  attributed to a speech made by  my  colleague,

the Minister for Communications. May I say this? My

colleague's prediction that Singapore may  have  to

offer  baby  bonuses to mothers in the  late  1970s

because  of  the great success in slowing  down  of

population  growth  in  Singapore,  is  in  no  way

inconsistent  with  the  main  objectives  of   the

Abortion Bill. The Member for Punggol thought  that

it  was  a  bonus  for him to use  it  against  the

Abortion  Bill. I am afraid he is under  a  serious

misconception   again.  I  have  time   and   again

reiterated that it is not the purpose of  the  Bill

to  be  used  as  a  means of  population  control.

However, time and again, some opponents of the Bill

who,  of  course, include not only the  Member  for

Punggol  but also the Members for Delta, Anson  and

Bras Basah, have tried the all too familiar tactics

of  labelling  it as such so as to find  sufficient

arguments  to  oppose the Bill. This, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  only  serves  to indicate the  bankruptcy  of

their arguments against the Bill. May I just repeat

once again that the main purpose of the Bill is  to

liberate  our  women from the tyranny  of  unwanted

pregnancies, and that, as far as is possible, every

child born in Singapore will be a wanted child  who

will be cared for so that he can grow up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



to lead a meaningful life. This Bill will also be a

tremendous  aid and will complement our efforts  to

help  our people plan their families. Any reduction

in the birth rate as a result will be an incidental

benefit, and not the main purpose of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have emphasised before, and I repeat, the

relationship between family planning by the use  of

contraceptive  methods  and legalised  abortion  is

like  that between prevention on the one  hand  and

cure  on  the  other. There will be a close  tie-up

between  the  administration of the  Abortion  Bill

when   it  becomes  law  and  the  national  family

planning programme. The family planning staff will,

when  this  Bill  is implemented,  interview  every

woman  who  has  been granted an  abortion  in  the

hospital,  as  they do now, and encourage  them  to

take  up  family  planning.  If  a  woman  has  not

subsequently    adopted   family   planning,    the

Termination  of  Pregnancy Authorisation  Board  is

likely  to  take  an  extremely  dim  view  of  any

subsequent application by a woman for an  abortion.

The  recommendation for abortion  from  the  Family

Planning   and   Population  Board,  supported   by

evidence  of  the practice of family  planning  and

other records, will make it very easy for women  to

get  an  abortion in case of contraceptive failure.

Further,  I have already stated that the Government

has decided to make a woman with three or more live

children  accept  voluntary  sterilisation   as   a

condition for the authorisation of abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to clear any further

misconceptions, perhaps I should explain here  what

family  planning  means. Family planning  does  not

merely mean restriction of population growth.  What

it,  in  fact,  means is that a  couple  who  adopt

family  planning  plan not only  the  size  of  the

family  but  also when pregnancy should  occur,  so

that they can have children when they want them.  I

hope  that  disposes  of  the  misconceptions.   Of

course,  if misconceptions are doggedly adhered  to

on  grounds of dogmas, I do not think I can go  any

further!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which the Member for Punggol

brought  up was when he waved a copy of The  Sunday

Times showing a picture of people adopting unwanted

babies.  I  think his point is that there  will  be

people  to  adopt  these unwanted babies  and  that

these  unwanted  babies  will  provide  solace   to

childless couples. But the fact remains that  these

babies are unwanted babies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the conscientious objection clause,

the  Member for Punggol pointed out that, according

to  him,  the  doctor's responsibility towards  the

foetus should be given due consideration. That is a

familiar  argument brought up by him. He  keeps  on

harping on the foetus. By doing so, he forgets  the

plight  of  the unfortunate pregnant mother.  As  I

have   stated  in  my  introductory  speech,   this

preoccupation  with  the  right  of   the   foetus,

unfortunately, ends up in lack of consideration for

the  mother.  As  I  have also stated  before,  the

Catholic dogma is that the foetus has the right  to

life.  This assumption can put the Catholic  doctor

in  a  moral  dilemma -to choose between destroying

the  foetus in order to save the mother's life,  or

allowing  the mother to die in the hope  of  saving

the  foetus.  This  Catholic preference  for  doing

nothing to assist the mother, in fact, amounts to a

preference of the foetus over the mother,  and  may

amount to a sentence of death for both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the principles of the Declaration of

Geneva   where   a   doctor   should   not    allow

considerations of religion, political  affiliation,

etc.,  to  come  between him and his  patient,  the

Member  for Punggol very cleverly used a  twist  by

saying  that these principles refer to the religion

of political affiliation of the patient and not the

doctor.  But  how do you split this? Will  not  the

religious  and ethical conviction of the doctor  be

equally relevant?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the Member for Anson. He

introduced  in his last remarks a very  interesting

point  about compulsory birth control, but  he  did

not  elaborate  on it. Members will  remember  that

five   days   ago   the  Member   for   Anson   was

congratulated by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



the   Minister  for  Law  on  the  courage  of  his

convictions  when he raised a lone  voice  in  this

House  against  the abolition of the  jury  system.

Sir,   it  would  be  amiss  on  my  part  not   to

congratulate  him  similarly on raising  his  voice

against the Abortion Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> But I am afraid that he has opposed the Bill not

only  because  he wants to assert his  independence

but also because it is clear, from his speech, that

he has ill understood the considerations which have

made  us introduce it, although I have taken  great

pains  to  explain  them in the  Second  and  Third

Readings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Member for Geylang Serai. I

think  he  has just repeated the familiar  argument

that  abortion  will  lead to promiscuity.  I  have

already  replied to the same point he  made  during

the   Second  Reading  of  the  Bill.  Will  family

planning  by contraceptive means not also encourage

promiscuity if his argument is correct?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the Member for Ulu Pandan? He

has  quite  categorically stated that after  having

read  the Select Committee's Report he has come  to

the   conclusion,  a  very  strong  conclusion,   I

suppose,  that he is now against the Bill, although

he  abstained from voting on the Second Reading. He

has  also  made certain remarks that the  Bill  has

been  introduced  because  Government  intends   to

encourage tourism. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do  not  see

what  relevance  tourism has to the Abortion  Bill.

Although  an  old man, perhaps he has  allowed  his

imagination to run riot. Further, he harps  on  the

theme  that  the Abortion Bill has been  introduced

for  the  purpose  of population control.  On  this

point,  I do not wish to repeat what I have already

said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Member for Moulmein, he repeats

the  familiar argument and says that if we legalise

abortion,  then what about legalising  prostitution

or  allowing the viewing of blue films? This  point

again  is repetitious. The Member seems to be quite

obsessed with blue films.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Because the Minister is obsessed with --



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> So the Member is obsessed with blue films then.

But I cannot see the logic of his argument. It does

not  follow.  This is what we call non  sequitur  -when we legalise abortion, we are going to legalise

prostitution.   It   is   rather   facetious    and

mischievous. [Interruption] Well, it is  the  right

of   an   individual  to  have  an  abortion  under

specified conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to Madam Chan.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Minister refer to the Member by

her constituency, and not by name?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I am much obliged, Sir. The Member for Delta did

say  that the fact that I am a man does not entitle

me to know the sufferings of women.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> It is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not deny that it is true

that  I  am a man. But what I do deny is  that  the

Member  has,  in  her  strong  opposition  to   the

Abortion  Bill, forgotten the plight of her  fellow

women   who  are  suffering  because  of   unwanted

pregnancies and have to resort secretly to  illegal

abortionists  to get rid of their unwanted  babies.

Is that not suffering? Is that not human misery? As

I  have said before, it is all very well for us  to

come here in this august Chamber and moralise.  But

we  often  forget that there are women who  are  in

such   a  predicament  that  they  resort  to   the

backstreet  abortionists  to  get  rid   of   their

unwanted babies at the risk of their health.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Minister prepared to give way to Madam

Chan?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Of course.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Can the Minister say whether the Abortion Bill,

when  passed,  will  do away  with  the  backstreet

abortionists?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I think the Member has not read my speech

carefully,  or  she  has not bothered  to  read  my

speech  at all. I have not said that when the  Bill

is   passed   it  would  eliminate  all  backstreet

abortionists.  What I have said  is  that  it  will

reduce  the number of backstreet abortionists,  and

in doing so it will reduce pain and suffering which

has  been the lot of these unfortunate women in the

past.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> There will be more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Well, I am not as sure as the Member for Delta

is. She moralises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Bras Basah. He says

that  Government only legislates or takes  measures

when  there is a public outcry or when there is  an

emergency. Obviously that cannot be true. If it is,

then   we  are  not  a  good  government.  A   good

government  plans  ahead and weighs  the  long-term

effects  of  any measure. If the long-term  effects

are    good,    the   government   will   introduce

legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> A good government also makes mistakes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Of course, I do admit that. Perhaps the Member

for Moulmein does not make mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah said that the Abortion

Bill  is cock-eyed. The Bill is not cock-eyed,  but

his  reasons  are. He said, "What  is  the  use  of

having  such  a  law, because the poor  women  will

still go to -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I said, "What is the use of having the

Authorisation Board?"



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member stand up and make his

point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I just want to make a point of clarification.

What  I  said was that if the Government is  going

to legalise abortion and liberate the women, as the

Minister  has said, then it should not set  up  the

Authorisation  Board.  By  doing  so,  nobody  will

believe that the women will come forward before the

Board to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



cross-examined  by  its  members,  who   will   ask

questions like, "Why do you want to get rid of  the

baby?",  and so on and so forth. Therefore,  rather

than expedite the abortion, the Authorisation Board

will hinder it. That is my point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing this point again,

I am not so sure whether the Member is now opposing

or supporting this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Definitely I am opposing the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> According to his contention, the Authorisation

Board  will be a hindrance to women who  apply  for

abortion.  If  he  is opposed to the  principle  of

legalised  abortion, then he should be  happy  with

the Board, is that not so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I say it is cock-eyed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Anyway, I do not think I can stretch the

explanation any further. It is quite clear that  if

he  thinks that the Authorisation Board will  be  a

hindrance  to women who want to apply for abortion,

then  I  challenge him to vote in  support  of  the

Bill,   in  particular,  on  the  clause   on   the

Authorisation Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have dealt with all

the points raised by the opposition speakers. It is

now  left for me to conclude. But before I  do  so,

may I just raise one particular point not mentioned

by the Members of this House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter was recently published in the press. It

expressed  concern  that the Select  Committee,  by

agreeing  to add the word "serious" to qualify  the

risk  to life or injury to the physical and  mental

health  of the pregnant women in clause 5 (2)  (a),

has made it impossible for the unmarried college or

working girl, caught with an unwanted pregnancy, to

have  an institutionalised abortion. This is indeed

a  serious  misconception of  the  meaning  of  the

proposed amendment, and should not be allowed to go

unrefuted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only the writer of this letter had read my

speech carefully, it would have been quite clear to

him  that the amendment was on the medical  reasons

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



which  an  abortion may be authorised.  As  I  have

explained,  it may probably restrict  the  area  of

manoeuvre of the medical practitioners, but it does

serve to clarify the position of this provision. It

does  not  in  any  way  affect  the  environmental

grounds on which an institutionalised abortion  may

be  authorised. As a matter of fact,  it  has  been

envisaged that the case of unmarried mothers, which

the  writer  of the letter was so concerned  about,

would normally come under the environmental clause,

i.e.,  clause  5 (2) (b). In fact, when  discussing

the environmental reasons for authorising abortions

in my speech moving the Second Reading of the Bill,

I stated that common examples would be, and I quote

[Hansard Vol. 28, No. II dated 8-4-69, col. 864]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When the pregnancy will bring about social ruin as

when  the woman is unmarried, is deserted  or  when

she is on the threshold of a career;'.



<br><br>However,  I  would  like to say  that  the  concern

expressed by the writer for the plight of unmarried

mothers  is indeed admirable, and I would  like  to

assure  him that it is well taken care  of  in  the

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to reiterate

that the central purpose of the Bill is to liberate

our women from the tyranny of unwanted pregnancies.

It  will  serve to ensure that, as far as possible,

every  child born in our Republic will be a  wanted

child  who  will  have  the  opportunity  of  being

properly  nurtured and educated, so  that  whatever

good  qualities he has inherited will be  developed

to  their full capacity so that he can grow  up  to

lead  a  meaningful life and contribute his maximum

to  our society. It will also avoid the tragedy  of

children  born  unwanted  or  children  born   with

physical  or  mental abnormalities.  Thus  it  will

serve   to  improve  the  total  quality   of   our

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been stated by the Prime Minister, one of

the  social  yardsticks by which we shall  have  to

judge the results of the new abortion law, together

with  the  companion  sterilization  law,  will  be

whether  it  tends  to raise  or  lower  the  total

quality of our population. The total quality of our

population depends



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



on  the  raising of the mean I.Q. level and on  the

capacity  of parents to help the state  to  nurture

and   educate  their  children  to  their   maximum

capacity.  Of  course, by the  application  of  our

social policies, we shall encourage those who  earn

a  low income and who cannot afford to nurture  and

educate  their children to have less children,  and

those better educated parents who have the means to

nurture their children to have larger families. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, whatever Members opposing  the  Bill

have  said about it, I wish to stress that  I  have

every  confidence  that it will  fully  fulfil  the

purpose for which it has been introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the Bill be now read a Third

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>5.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, the Voluntary Sterilization Bill did

not attract as many representations as the Abortion

Bill.   Neither  did  it  arouse  as  much   heated

controversy. The representations received have been

useful and the suggested amendments which have been

proposed for adoption will serve to strengthen  the

Bill  further. The amendments proposed in the  Bill

are, however, minor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(1) Definition of "sexual sterilization"</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment relates to the definition of

"sexual   sterilization".  As   defined   in   the

original text, the surgical removal of the  female

or  male reproductive organs would all come  under

the  purview of this Bill. It was pointed out that

this  was  too broad a definition. The  definition

has,  therefore, by the amendment, been restricted

to  exclude the removal of such organs  which  are

essential  for  reasons of medical treatment.  The

suggestion  was  made  by  Professor  L.C.  Green,

former  Professor  of  Law in  the  University  of

Singapore,  in  a  written representation  to  the

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain conditions where the removal

of  the  reproductive organs is  undertaken  as  a

therapeutic measure, for example, the  removal  of

the  ovaries as part of the treatment in the  case

of  cancer of the breast. Such therapeutic measure

should not come within the ambit of the Bill.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(2) Membership on the Eugenics Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar amendment as that made for the

membership   of  the  Termination   of   Pregnancy

Authorisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



Board is also proposed. The amendment provides that

at  least one of the two appointed members  of  the

Eugenics  Board should be "professionally qualified

social  workers"  rather  than  one  who  "has  had

experience in social welfare work". The reasons for

this   change   were  already   described   by   me

previously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(3) Treatment for sexual sterilization</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment to clause 5 is a significant

amendment. Under this amendment, sterilization of a

woman  by the ligation of the tubes may be  carried

out  immediately after birth or at  the  same  time

when  an  abortion is performed. This is the  usual

practice  now.  The  operation  of  tubal  ligation

immediately  after  birth  is  a  very  simple  one

compared to the same operation if performed  later.

The  provisions  of the Bill as it stands,  without

this amendment, would prevent such an operation  to

be  carried  out immediately and could  defeat  the

purpose of sterilizing persons when it is so simple

and  safe to do. If these persons have to wait  for

30  days  at  least  before the  operation  can  be

carried out, the operation is much more difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said before,

this  Bill,  together with its  companion  Abortion

Bill  when they become law, will liberate our women

from  the  tyranny  of unwanted  pregnancies.  They

have,  therefore, been rightly described  as  Bills

relating to human rights. The adoption of this Bill

today  indeed marks a significant milestone in  the

social progress of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the success of any family

planning   campaign   depends   largely   on    the

acceptability of the contraceptive methods offered.

However safe and effective these contraceptives may

be, one often hears of reports of side effects with

some of the oral pills. However



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



founded or unfounded these reports may be, the  use

of    contraceptives   is,   in   the   least,   an

inconvenience, and for those who already  have  the

number  of  children they want, such  inconvenience

would   be   eliminated   by   sterilization.   The

introduction  of  the Voluntary Sterilization  Bill

is,  therefore, a sensible approach to the  problem

of  family planning and population control,  and  I

will not only support the Bill, but hope that  the

Minister will give it the widest publicity so  that

the need to use contraceptives will be reduced to a

shorter period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support the Bill.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>5.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the

Member  for  Anson  for his  full  support  of  the

Voluntary Sterilization Bill, although he  did  not

support  the Abortion Bill. From the way he  spoke,

he  is  now  very much in support of the  Voluntary

Sterilization  Bill. Perhaps it is because  of  his

recent  trip to India. I know that in India  today,

they  are  in fact making every effort to sterilize

persons.

about Singapore and not about India.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, so far as sterilization is

concerned,  in India, they have in fact  introduced

what  they  call "instant sterilization" whereby  a

in railway stations.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> They are giving a bonus!

who  gets himself sterilized and 10 rupees  to  the

person who brings a person for sterilization.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 19, to leave out "of the Supreme

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words are really not necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 -

23 of the Partnership Act, 1890" and insert "any

provision of any written law relating to

partnership".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as this clause imports an English Act, by

the amendment as proposed, it will not be necessary

in  the  future to make further amendments to  this

clause   should   there  be  any  change   in   our

partnership laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 7, lines 7 and 13, to leave out

"Criminal".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be preferable that the expression

"District  Courts" appearing in this clause  should

not  be  qualified by the adjective  "Criminal"  or

"Civil". This would be in line with the Subordinate

Courts Ordinance and would also avoid the necessity

of   any  amendment  should  the  present  division

between Civil District Courts and Criminal District

Courts be done away with in the near future and the

jurisdiction of these courts merged.
