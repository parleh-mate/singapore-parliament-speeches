   <b>(Funds for upgrading of public areas)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether his Ministry will consider allocating funds for upgrading of public areas such as parks, roads and footpaths in private residential estates, similar to the proposed plan to upgrade the public housing estates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Lee Boon Yang) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, the Government maintains all public areas in Singapore including those in the private residential estates. For example, about 500 km of roads and 60 hectares of open spaces in private residential estates which are vested in the State are currently being maintained by the Public Works Department and the Parks and Recreation Department respectively. As part of maintenance, these roads, sidewalks and open spaces
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are upgraded and improved as and when necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson):</b> Sir, would the Minister not agree that in Singapore there are, in fact, several very old private residential estates, much older than the HDB estates, which require a fair amount of sprucing up and upgrading. Therefore, should the Government not also consider spending money to upgrade such areas as well since it has a plan to upgrade HDB estates?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said in my main answer, if there are public facilities which are old and need upgrading in these old private residential estates, my Ministry will certainly look into them and upgrade them in due course.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong</b> asked the Minister for National Development what steps are being taken by the Government to ensure that permanent residents will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> not buy resale Housing and Development Board flats for speculative purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore permanent residents who purchase resale flats from the open market must abide by the following conditions. First, the flats must be owner-occupied. Second, the lessees must live in the flats for 30 months before the flats can be resold on the open market. Third, each family nucleus is only allowed to own one HDB flat. Fourth, no subletting of the entire flat is allowed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these safeguards, we will be able to prevent permanent residents from buying resale HDB flats for speculative purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, what if the family of the permanent resident lives in, say, Hong Kong, and he is the only one living in Singapore, will he be allowed to buy an HDB flat?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Hongkonger and some of his family members are eligible by relocating in Singapore and wish to purchase a flat, we will allow them to do so. Subsequently, if only he himself wants to occupy the flat, it will also be allowed. The important point is that the applicant, the owner of the flat, must live in the flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong:</b> How would the HDB monitor the case if, by definition, part of his family is in, say, Hong Kong, and he has to travel between Singapore and Hong Kong frequently? It will be very difficult for the HDB to make sure that he is living in the flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> No doubt it is a difficult task to monitor and see whether the owner is actually living in his flat and for how long. But let me assure the Member that HDB will be able to monitor.

  <br>
  <br> Public Works Department will upgrade the street lighting along Bedok North Road beginning from its junction with New Upper Changi Road.

  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Works Department has an on-going programme to upgrade street lighting. The street lighting along Bedok North Road is scheduled to be upgraded in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Sir, the PWD has inspected the site at night and found some overgrown tree branches partially obstructing the street light. The Parks and Recreation Department has pruned these branches to provide temporary improvement.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Davinder Singh</b> asked the Minister for Education whether his Ministry has any plans to allow non-Tamil Indian pupils to study their own mother tongue as a second language.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Education (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our bilingual policy requires all pupils in schools to study a second language in addition to English. The Ministry of Education provides instruction and examinations in the three official languages - Chinese, Malay and Tamil - and non-Tamil Indian pupils are presently required to choose one of these languages as their second language.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of allowing non-Tamil Indians to study their own mother tongues (Gujarati, Punjabi, and so on) in place of Tamil is not a new one. It was considered as long ago as 1956. But owing to the difficulty of providing instruction in the languages and maintaining standards in examinations, the Ministry decided that non-Tamil Indian pupils should confine the choice of their second language to one of the three official languages, ie, either Chinese, Malay or Tamil.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a small number of Indian pupils in our secondary schools study a minority Indian language other than Tamil as a third language and offer it as an '0' level subject. The following minority Indian languages are available as '0' level subjects - Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi, and Urdu.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since examinations in the above five minority Indian languages are available in the '0' level examinations and the standards are maintained by the Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the Ministry has reviewed the matter and has decided to allow from 1990, ie, next year, non-Tamil Indian pupils to offer one of the above five minority Indian languages as their second language in secondary schools. As the Ministry will not be able to provide instruction in these languages, the non-Tamil Indian pupils will have to arrange for their own teachers but, where possible, the schools will make available their premises for lessons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is presently discussing with the Cambridge authorities to make available examinations in the above five minority Indian languages at the 'AO'level and also at the 'N' level. When these examinations are available, possibly by 1992, non-Tamil Indian pupils will be allowed to choose one of these languages as their second language at the 'AO' level and at the 'N' level examinations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the primary school level, the problem is more difficult as both the Ministry and Cambridge are at present not in a position to provide examinations in the minority Indian languages other than Tamil. We have asked Cambridge to look into the feasibility of their assisting us to make available examinations in the minority Indian languages at the Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE). Pending the setting up of examinations in the minority Indian languages at PSLE, non-Tamil Indian pupils will continue to choose one of the official languages - Chinese, Malay or Tamil - as their second language at PSLE.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much obliged, Sir.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information (Mr Ho Kah Leong) (for the Minister for Communications and Information):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cardphones are gaining widespread popularity, with sales of phonecards increasing month by month. I have asked the Clerk of Parliament to distribute a table (Cols. 661 - 662) showing the sales data for Members. I think copies of the table are with Members by now.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1989/19891006/19891006-HA-0540661.htm">table - Phonecard Sales, Jan - Jul 89 (Cols.661 - 662)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will notice from the table that in June and July 1989 about 140,000 cards were sold each month, almost double the number sold in January. The total number of cards sold in the first seven months of this year is about 820,000 (ie one card for every three Singaporeans), a clear indication of their convenience and popularity. The NCMP is thus mistaken.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the use of cardphones is a technological advance which is happening worldwide. There are advantages to the consumer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there is less vandalism of cardphones compared to coinphones which invite theft and damage, and hence are often out of order, causing inconvenience to potential users.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, coinphones are also more labour-intensive to operate and maintain, and hence susceptible to increases in charges to recover cost as wages go up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, cardphones are especially convenient for long and long-distance calls compared with coinphones, where large quantities of coins are required for such calls.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inconvenience, the coinphone is being phased out worldwide, especially in developed countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In introducing the cardphone, Singapore Telecoms has made every effort to ensure that the switchover from coinphones does not inconvenience the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, 5% of the public telephones are cardphones. Where there are cardphones, there is also a coinphone nearby. The public therefore is not inconvenienced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its replacement programme, Singapore Telecoms has also planned for the ease of purchase of phonecards and a wide choice of values of phonecards ranging from $2 to $50 to meet the different needs of users.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Does the Government realise that there are people who do not buy these phonecards? They have great difficulty in using phones when they have to queue up for the single coinphone?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, the trouble with the NCMP is that he thinks the world works the way he fancies. In my reply, it is very clear that the cardphones are gaining popularity among our population. Even after the coinphones are phased out, the public who do not buy the cardphones can still use coinaphones, which are widely available in Singapore. So the public will not be inconvenienced.

  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he will give a progress report of the activities of the 21 Singapore police officers serving as UNTAG peace monitors in Namibia.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, the 21 Police officers in the Singapore Contingent of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) arrived in Namibia on 5th May. They have been deployed in groups of three to five men to serve as Police Monitors in the various districts of Namibia stretching from the Northern border near Angola to the Southern border near South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leader of the Singapore Contingent, Superintendent Lee Kok Leong, was recently appointed the Chief Electoral and Refugee Officer in UNTAG Headquarters. He is responsible to the UNTAG Police Commissioner for supervising the forthcoming General Elections and also to oversee the return of Namibian refugees from neighbouring countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of our police monitors include accompanying the South West African Police (SWAPO) on their duties, inspecting refugee camps, checking of information received on SWAPO movements and other activities and guarding and escorting registration papers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our contingent has been performing their duties fairly and impartially. They have been proven to be tough, disciplined,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> highly skilled in various policing duties and adaptable. The UNTAG Police Commissioner has commended our men highly for their professionalism, dedication and initiative.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections there are due in mid-November. In anticipation of these elections, tension is mounting in Namibia. A heavy responsibility will lie on all the UNTAG Forces, including our Police Monitors, to ensure a fair and smooth elections. Sir, I am confident that the Singapore Contingent Leader, who is the Chief Electoral Officer, and his men will contribute in no small measure towards ensuring this. After the elections, UNTAG is expected to remain until 31st March 1990, to enable the newly elected Government sufficient time to consolidate. If all is well, the men will be back home to Singapore and to their families in early April 1990. I may add, Sir, that last month we sent a team of senior officials from my Ministry and the Foreign Affairs Ministry, including a doctor, to visit our police contingent. They reported that our men were in good health and spirits.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned that our men there are assisting members of SWAPO. As I understand it, SWAPO is a political party there. It stands for South West African People's Organization. Can I have a clarification on what the Minister has just said?

   <b>(Offer of indemnity to proprietors and publishers of The Times of London)</b>

  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs on whose authority the Singapore High Commissioner to London offered an indemnity to the proprietors and publishers of The Times newspaper in London to publish a matter relating to a citizen of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, I wonder if I may have your permission to take both Question 8 and Question 9 together as they relate to the same subject matter and perhaps both the Members can thereafter ask any supplementary question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have my permission.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Thank you. First, if I may deal with the question asked by Mr Chiam See Tong. The answer is, Sir, that an amount of o7,000 was paid for the advertisement in The Guardian, o12,364 and 80 pence was paid to the Financial Times, while $3,969 was paid to The Straits Times.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be interested to know that The Guardian has a daily circulation of 418,000 copies while the Financial Times has a circulation of 280,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn to the question by the NCMP. The Minister for Foreign Affairs authorized the offer of indemnity to The Times by the High Commissioner in respect of any legal action arising from the publication of the High Commissioner's reply. He did so after consulting the Minister for Law and the Attorney-General.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter by the High Commissioner was to reply to serious allegations against the Government about "the misuse of the law" in an article by Mr Bernard Levin published in The Times on 19th June 1989. The Times not only insisted on considerably editing the reply but also refused to publish two key paragraphs in the High Commissioner's letter on grounds of possible defamation. The paragraphs were, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Mr Jeyaretnam is a person of "scrupulous integrity - professionally, personally and politically", how
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is it that after July 1975, when the Workers' Party was ordered to pay costs after losing its slander action against a former PAP MP, its bank accounts never contained more than $500, even though between 1976 and 1980 the Party had collected $24,008 in donations and expended $45,196 in election and other expenses? Mr Jeyaretnam could not explain why this was not a deliberate scheme to defraud the creditors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Levin cites two court cases which Mr Jeyaretnam had "duly lost" and "of course lost", implying that these actions should rightly have succeeded in law. Mr Jeyaretnam acted as his own counsel in both these cases. Did Mr Levin know that in these two cases:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. In his slander action, he had failed to set out the actual words he complained of, a basic legal requirement in Singapore, as it is in England?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In the election petition on behalf of the Workers' Party, he had failed to serve the petition on the Returning Officer as required by law?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Malayan Law Journal reported both cases."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclusion of these two paragraphs was important as they would have effectively rebutted Mr Levin's allegations against the Singapore Government and the judiciary in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When such serious allegations are published, it is important that the facts be made known to the readers. Furthermore, the Government was advised by the Attorney-General that there was nothing in the High Commissioner's reply which was defamatory. So as not to give The Times any excuse to refuse to publish the full letter, and I repeat, the full letter, the High Commissioner was authorized to offer the indemnity.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> After the publication of the two advertisements in The Guardian and the Financial Times, did the Government attempt to put further advertisements in these two papers?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, after the publication of the advertisements in The Guardian and the Financial Times, a further advertisement was taken out in the Daily Telegragh.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think the Minister has to answer the question. Did the Government attempt to put further advertisements in The Guardian and the Financial Times?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thought we said so publicly, Sir, that we wanted to publish
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> further advertisements in The Guardian and the Financial Times, but they decided that they would not publish those advertisements.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Would the Minister say where provisions have been made for such expenditure in the 1989/90 budget?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been advised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that it is within their budgetary allocation. And if it is not budgeted for, I am sure the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will seek supplementary provision from this House.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> If that should be the intention, Sir, should not the Government have first sought permission from Parliament before instituting such an expenditure?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Jayakumar; Mr Speaker, Sir, we have many missions and ambassadors abroad. One of their tasks is to ensure that the reputation and integrity of Singapore and its institutions are not maligned, distorted and discredited without grounds. It is their duty, whenever such attempts are made, to correct and rebut the false allegations and we expect them to do so on their own as quickly as possible without having to come to this House, summon a special meeting of this House and to get permission from this House. It is a normal accepted function of any diplomatic mission of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Would the Minister agree that any offer of indemnity is quite different from ordinary costs and that in the circumstances permission has to be obtained from Parliament first?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I do not see any requirement in any law or Standing Orders of Parliament that permission of this House must be obtained for what is an obvious course of action for any overseas mission to take when a foreign newspaper refuses to publish a full reply on various pretexts and where the offer and indemnity exposes the newspaper and shows to be hollow their excuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Would the Minister explain why the Government has refused to waive the diplomatic immunity
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for the High Commission in London for his letter to The Times?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> It is really not relevant, Sir, but we have publicly stated that The Times of London has refused to publish the full reply and they refused to publish the two key paragraphs. We have stated publicly that if and when The Times of London publishes the two paragraphs the High Commissioner will waive the immunity. That position stands even as of now.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Would the Minister agree that the refusal makes nonsense of its claim that it wanted to offer the indemnity to put verifiable facts before the British public?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Not at all, Sir. We have asked The Times of London to publish the facts. Mr Jeyaretnam can sue and the High Commissioner will waive his immunity. I do not see what is the point raised by the Member. We are willing and ready in London to establish the facts before the British readers of The Times of London. But The Times of London has to carry those two paragraphs.

  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) is still needed; and, if so, whether his Ministry has any plans to ensure that CASE continues to play an effective role in safeguarding consumer interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) is a private association formed to protect consumer interests. Such private consumer groups can educate consumers, inform them where to get the best value for money, and take up on their behalf issues of product safety, truth in advertising or profiteering.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are useful functions which enable our consumers to get a fair deal, and also help to keep down the cost of living. The best measure of how well CASE is fulfilling these needs is how much its services are in demand, and how willing its members are to support and pay for its activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government supports these objectives of CASE. As a token of this support, MTI gives CASE a small annual subsidy to cover part of its operating expenses. This year, the grant is $110,000. However, CASE must earn the bulk of its revenues itself: from members' annual subscriptions, from its product and information services, and also from services provided to other institutions, for example, handling tourist complaints for STPB. The Government cannot underwrite the difference between CASE's expenses and its revenues from other sources, much less fund all of the Association's needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, the Government grant was tied to specific projects. This was unsatisfactory as much of CASE's expenditure is recurrent. MTI has reviewed the system, and decided to raise the grant to $130,000 for FY 90, ie, next year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is prepared to continue assisting CASE through this annual grant so long as CASE's own members support its activities. I believe CASE itself recognizes this. Its latest Annual Report (1988/89) states:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As CASE is a membership organisation, it can only function effectively with the active support of consumers."

  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the parcel of land bounded by Strathmore Avenue, Dawson Road and Alexandra Canal has already been earmarked for the building of additional flats under the new booking system. Tender for this project will be called in the middle of next year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already informed Members in April this year that the central area will be redeveloped more slowly in order to tie up with the comprehensive urban planning and to optimise the long term potential of the land. There are no plans at present for further development in the Strathmore Avenue area.

   <b>TEACHING OF RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE IN SCHOOLS</b>

   <b>(Statement by the Minister for Education)</b>

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in March this year, during the debate on the Estimates of the Ministry of Education, I informed Members that the Ministry of Education was taking a fresh look at the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> whole question of the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools. The basic reason that necessitated such a review was the conclusion of a recent study conducted by the National University of Singapore's Sociology Department on Religions and Religious Revivalism in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members may recall, the conclusion of that study was that Government, through the introduction of compulsory Religious Knowledge programmes in schools, has not been entirely neutral in the matter of religions. By designating only certain Religious Knowledge subjects to be made available in schools as compulsory subjects, the Government has given the impression of according preferential status to certain religions. This is not in accordance with the Government's desire to be neutral and even-handed in the handling of religious matters in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the debate in March, I put forward three possible options for consideration. First, discontinue all teaching of Religious Knowledge subjects in our secondary schools and bring back the Civics courses which we had in 1979. Second, scrap the Religious Knowledge options and replace them with a general subject called "Study of World Religions" or perhaps "Study of Major Religions". And third, allow the Religious Knowledge subjects to be taught in schools but only as optional subjects to be taught outside curriculum time and not to be used for purposes of admission to junior colleges and pre-university centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting forward the three options, I said that whatever course of action we eventually choose, there is one thing we must do and, that is, we should not take precipitate action on such a complex and important matter. Rather, we should first discuss the matter with parents, teachers and principals, community leaders and the heads of the established religions in Singapore, Members of Parliament, academics and the public, before making a final decision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, following the announcement in Parliament, I have held four meetings with various groups - on 20th
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> May this year, with principals and teachers; on 26th May, with members and resource persons of the GPC on Education and academics; on 8th July, with the heads of the religious organisations; and on 12th August, with community leaders and the general public at a dialogue session organised by the Feedback Unit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these meetings, Sir, have been reported in the press and I do not wish to bore Members by describing the proceedings in detail. It suffices for me to say that there was no consensus at the meetings. I think this should not be surprising. Religion is a very deeply felt matter. It touches the very hearts of people and determines their motivation. It is therefore not surprising that no consensus has arisen from the meetings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we can discern three groups of opinions as arising from the meetings. The first group would prefer to retain as far as possible the method and form in which the Religious Knowledge subjects are taught in our schools. This group feels that Religious Knowledge has been beneficial to students and has helped to give them a direction in life. They feel that the subject is needed today to give children a guide to life and that it will be a grave loss to our education system if Religious Knowledge were not to be taught in schools. This view is supported by representatives from the major religious groups as well as by many parents who feel that they would like their children to be exposed to some religious education during their school days.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group would recommend scrapping the Religious Knowledge subjects and replacing them by a subject to be called either Civics or National Education which would place emphasis on correct behaviour, national priorities, how Singaporeans should get on with one another, and an appreciation of how to live in a multi-racial, multi-religious society. This view is supported by many of our school principals and representatives of the teacher organisations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group would scrap the Religious Knowledge subjects and replace them with a subject on the major religions in Singapore. This would be taught, not as a means of providing a guide to children
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> as to how they should live their lives, but as part of a moral education programme on personal conduct. The aim would be to provide an appreciation of how the major religions conduct themselves and their different practices and beliefs. This view was advanced by a wide cross-section of the public, including parents, representatives of the established religions and ordinary laymen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Parliamentary Committee on Education has organised its own hearings on the subject and held informal dialogue sessions with teachers and students from different schools. In a report to me, they also reported that there was no consensus from participants at their public hearing and the subsequent informal dialogue sessions which they had as to the future direction the Ministry of Education should take with regard to the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools. After deliberation, they have recommended that schools be allowed to continue to teach Religious Knowledge subjects but as optional subjects outside school hours and the subjects should continue to be used for purposes of admission to junior colleges and pre-university centres. In place of the compulsory Religious Knowledge subjects now taught within curriculum time, the GPC suggested that a new subject called "Civics" be introduced to incorporate both the Moral Education and Pastoral Care Programmes and to be taught as a non-examination subject to students at Secondary 1, 2 and 3 levels.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the range of opinions that have been raised at the various meetings is aptly summed up in an editorial in The Straits Times on 12th August, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the subject of the teaching of Religious Knowledge was raised in March, there has been no let-up in public discussions and no lack of educationists, religious leaders, teachers, parents and various individuals willing to offer their suggestions. Their preferences ranged from maintaining the status quo of having compulsory religious knowledge in schools to scrapping it completely; from making it optional within school hours to outside hours; from bringing back Civics to introducing world religions. For a matter so close to the heart or indeed for some, of the souls, the sentiments are understandable."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, faced with such a number of options and with the complexity of the subject, the question is what should we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> do? I think, Sir, that under such circumstances the correct approach which we should use in coming to a decision is first of all to go back to first principles and to ask ourselves one fundamental question and, that is: Was the Government right in 1982 to accept the principle that it was proper for schools to play a major role in the teaching of Religious Knowledge to children? This, to me, is the crux of the issue and we have to settle this question first before we can arrive at a decision on the future direction for the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no right or wrong answer to this question. Our decision must depend on the type of society Singapore is, the component groups in our population, the circumstances in which we find ourselves and the general desire and priorities of our people. Furthermore, no decision is valid for all time. All decisions must change as circumstances change and decisions which were right at one time may be wrong and may have to be modified at another time. One example is our population policy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we ask ourselves: has there been any fundamental change in circumstances since 1982 when Government decided to introduce compulsory Religious Knowledge options in schools?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, one fundamental change has taken place. Unlike 1982, there is today a heightened consciousness of religious differences and a new fervour in the propagation of religious beliefs. This trend is world-wide and it embraces all faiths. It can be seen in the growth of Islamic fundamentalism, enhanced Christian evangelisation and resurgence of activity and interest among traditional religions such as Buddhism. Sir, if carried to extremes, this trend towards greater fervour in the propagation of religious beliefs can disrupt our traditional religious harmony and religious tolerance which are pre-requisites for life in Singapore. It is not possible for Government to ignore this new development. We must take cognizance of it and we must implement measures to ensure that it does not upset the present climate of religious tolerance in Singapore. I think, Sir, we have to face this fact squarely.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to avoid any suspicion of partiality in formulating and implementing the measures, it is essential for Government to be seen to be scrupulously neutral and even-handed in the handling of religious matters in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to clarify what is meant by the phrase "to be neutral and even-handed in the handling of religious matters". What the phrase means simply is that Government cannot and should not be perceived to lean towards or to favour any particular religion. The phrase, does not mean that Government is against religion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Singaporeans, including the Government, are well aware of the enormous contribution which religious groups have made to the life and progress of our country, particularly in the field of education. The schools which have been established by the major religious groups in Singapore have made a great contribution to the cause of education in Singapore. We hope that they will continue their good work and we can assure them of the Government's support for their educational efforts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to be neutral and even-handed in a matter of religions must mean, at the very least, that Government should not give the appearance even unintentionally of giving preferred status to any particular religion or of using Government institutions or Government-supported institutions such as schools to help propagate any particular faith.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows then, Sir, that schools as Government-supported institutions should, in my view, not be used as a means to impart religious beliefs to children. The teaching of religious beliefs, of what guides a person through life, what impels a person to be what he is, this is the province of the home. It is not the province of the schools. And parents cannot abdicate this responsibility to the schools or to Government. It is the responsibility of parents to be moral exemplars, to set examples for their children, to teach them their religious beliefs and to bring them up in the religion in which they would like
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> their children to follow. Schools can at most play a minor supporting role but the prime responsibility must remain that of the parents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we accept the principle that the proper province for the teaching of religious beliefs is not in the schools but in the home, then it must follow that Religious Knowledge should not be made a compulsory subject to be taught within curriculum time in schools. And neither in principle should Religious Knowledge be used as a subject to be counted for junior college or for pre-university admission purposes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In place of the Religious Knowledge programmes, it is the intention of the Ministry to extend the present Civics/Moral Education Programme, which is presently taught in the lower levels of our secondary schools, to Secondary 3 and 4 with a view to expanding the Programme and incorporating aspects of nation building, an awareness of our shared values and an appreciation of the beliefs and practices of the various religions and races in Singapore. It will take the Ministry at least two years to construct the syllabus, to write the textbooks and train the teachers to teach this new subject. The first cohort of students to study the expanded Civics/Moral Education Programme will be those going into Secondary 3 in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I realise that this is a radical departure from the Government's position in 1982 when Religious Knowledge was introduced in schools. And it will be natural for parents to be concerned and to worry whether their children's education will be affected by this new policy. To avoid upsetting school schedules, the Ministry intends to phase out the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools over a period of years so as to cause the least disruption to the education of our children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Ministry will not be able to introduce the expanded Civics/Moral Education Programme in schools until 1992 at the earliest, the following transitional arrangements will apply:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, students who are in Secondary 1 and 2 this year, the lower levels of our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> secondary schools, will not be required to study Religious Knowledge as a compulsory subject during curriculum time when they proceed to Secondary 3 in 1990 or 1991. The students may, if they wish, study a Religious Knowledge subject but on an optional basis outside curriculum time and they can still offer it as an '0' level subject. In the transitional years in 1990 and 1991, when the expanded Civics/Moral Education Programme will not yet be available, principals will be given the flexibility to decide on how to utilise the two teaching periods within curriculum time which are now allocated to Religious Knowledge. The principals can use these two periods for activities such as pastoral care and values education, discussions on current affairs, and strengthening rapport between teachers and pupils.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, for the students who are presently in Secondary 3 and 4 and who will be proceeding to do the GCE '0' level examinations in 1990 or 1991, they will continue to be given instruction in the Religious Knowledge subjects of their choice during curriculum time. This is because the students would have already covered a substantial part of the syllabus with a view to including Religious Knowledge as a subject to be counted for purposes of admission to junior colleges and pre-university centres. We should enable these students, who are now in Secondary 3 or in Secondary 4, to continue their study of the Religious Knowledge subjects with as little disruption as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I turn to the inclusion of Religious Knowledge as a subject to be used for purposes of admission to junior colleges and to pre-university centres. The Ministry has considered very carefully the effects of not allowing Religious Knowledge on the academically weaker pupils who would normally rely on the use of Religious Knowledge as one of their subjects to qualify for admission to junior colleges and pre-university centres. A simulation study done by the Ministry shows that, while the number going into junior college will be reduced, the impact should not be too severe.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give some figures. Of the students who were admitted to junior colleges this year, ie, 1989, the number of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> pupils who would still meet the requirements for junior college, if Religious Knowledge was not included, would be reduced by 5% (from 10,651 to 10,107). The number of Malay pupils qualifying for junior college admission would be reduced by 13% (from 306 to 265). And the corresponding figures for the other races are: for Chinese pupils, a reduction of 4% (from 9,640 to 9,242); for Indian pupils, a reduction of 15% (from 514 to 435) and Other Races, a reduction of 14% (from 191 to 165).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to give the students ample time to adjust their subject combinations, the Ministry has decided to allow the use of Religious Knowledge as a subject for junior college and pre-university admission requirements up to the Year of Admission 1994. What this means is that all students who are presently in secondary schools today, including those who will proceed to Secondary 3 in 1990 or 1991 and who will sit the '0' level examinations latest by December 1993, will be able to count Religious Knowledge as a subject for purposes of admission to junior colleges and to pre-university centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education and the Government have considered carefully the decision to phase out the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools. We have not taken this decision hastily. Six months have passed since I announced the decision to review the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools. We have actively sought feedback from all sectors who would be affected by our decision. All views have been taken into account. I do not expect the decision to be welcomed by all quarters. Indeed, I am sure that there will be some disappointment and also perhaps some criticism. But I would be satisfied if the public and parents particularly come to regard this decision as fair and, unwelcome as it may be, to be in the long-term interest of Singapore and of Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as this is a topic on which I know that Members have different views, I believe that Members would therefore like to debate my statement. Under the rules, this would not be possible as there is no question before the House. I have consulted the Leader of the House on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> how Members can have an opportunity of having a full debate on my statement. On his advice and with your indulgence, Sir, I intend to adopt the device of moving a motion for adjournment for that specific purpose. At the conclusion of the debate, I shall then seek leave to withdraw my motion, so that the House can then proceed to the other business in the Order Paper. May I add, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I understand the Leader of the House has also sought your advice on this matter.

   <b>TEACHING OF RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE IN SCHOOLS</b>
  </div>
  <br>1.30 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this fair recommendation and I wish to put forward some views and make recommendations to the Ministry of Education. I also want to put on record in Hansard my GPC's stand on this subject. I do not want to go through the introduction of my paper. I will just come down to the summary of feedback received by the Ministry of Education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, there was no firm consensus from the participants at the public hearing that my GPC conducted, and the subsequent informal dialogue sessions as to the future direction that the Ministry of Education should take with regard to the teaching of Religious Knowledge (RK).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were four different schools of thought and I shall summarize these as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. That RK should continue to be taught in its present form, ie, taught during school hours as a compulsory subject and which can also be considered for Pre-U/JC admission. This was strongly supported by the representatives from the Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim religious bodies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. That RK be taught as an optional subject during school hours which can also be considered for Pre-U/JC admission, a view propounded by most of the other participants including the Christian and Tamil Teachers' Unions. In that case, the Taoists and the Bahais would also like to see equal treatment being accorded to all religions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. That in addition to making RK an optional subject, Civics should also be reintroduced into the school curriculum,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> as was suggested by the Singapore Chinese Teachers' Union.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. That RK be replaced by a Moral Education Programme which also incorporates the essentials of the main religions, a proposal put forward by the Singapore Teachers' Union and the Tamil Language Society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one spoke up for the retention of Confucian Ethics. When asked for an opinion, the representative from the Singapore Teachers' Union said that Confucian Ethics was too difficult and abstract to teach effectively at this level.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now give the views and recommendations of my GPC. Whilst recognising that the teaching of the RK may provide moral guidance to pupils, our GPC is of the opinion that it should not be taught as a compulsory subject during school hours for the following reasons:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Teaching only a few religions, especially the main ones as practised in Singapore, is not being fair to the other religions, bearing in mind the multi-religious fabric of our society. Nor is it fair to the large numbers of free thinkers, an increasing section of the population who have no RK option.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Making RK a compulsory subject for all students does not appear consistent with the secular basis of the Government and State.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Teaching students only one specific religion may lead to religious exclusivity and is likely to further accentuate the religious differences which, in turn, may indirectly hamper our efforts to create a united nation, especially when, as happens, religious and ethnic divisions coincide.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) With the recent religious revivalism, there is a danger that the continued teaching of RK may heighten religious proselytization by certain religious groups leading, in turn, to the same by hitherto inactive groups from the other faiths.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the foregoing and after taking into consideration the feedback and views received, our GPC would like to make the following recommendations:
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) That the teaching of RK as a compulsory subject during school hours be discontinued and instead be taught as an optional subject outside school hours. This is in line with the Ministry of Education's thinking and recommendation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That students be allowed to take it as an examination subject if they so desire, and the grades they receive can be considered for Pre-U/JC admission, as is the present practice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has now agreed that it could be used for Pre-U/JC admission but only up to the year 1994. I was about to ask the Minister how this will affect enrolment in the JCs and he has given us the answer and therefore I would not want to pursue. But I agree with him that this will cause some unhappiness, especially among those students who took up RK as a subject because they could use it as a subject for entry into Pre-U. I support the Ministry in this because I think sufficient time has been given, up to 1994, and therefore adjustments could be made by then.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing away with RK as a compulsory subject, steps should also be taken to streamline and link the present Moral Education Programme taught to Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 students with the Pastoral Care Programme at the upper secondary level. We make this recommendation and it may sound a little bit odd mixing the Moral Education Programme with the Pastoral Care Programme. But discussions with teachers give me the impression that there are many similar topics being taught by the Moral Education teachers and also by the Pastoral Care teachers. There seems to be a lot of similarities. That is why we suggest that it should be streamlined. This will make the curriculum neater and also easier to manage the time table.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, we propose that a new subject called Civics be introduced and this is also in agreement with the recommendation of the Ministry. But we would like to say that its syllabus could include citizenship education as well as the values of the proposed National Ideology together with a broad over-view of the main beliefs and practices of the various
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> religions in Singapore, focusing on shared moral values in order to promote greater racial and religious understanding and tolerance. Such a course should emphasize shared loyalties and values and not differences as does the present RK Programme. This new subject, Civics, should be taught as a non-examination subject to students at Secondary 1, 2 and 3 levels. Here, among my GPC Members, there was disagreement. Some felt that it should be an examination subject, but the majority thought otherwise. We suggested that at Secondary 4, it will be better to allow the students to concentrate on the other examination subjects and leave teaching of Civics or whatever subject that the Ministry is proposing to stop at Secondary 3 level. We are also concerned that measures should be taken to ensure that the periods allotted to the teaching of this subject are not utilized for other purposes, such as make-up or remedial lessons for other subjects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my dialogue sessions, we encountered many requests from religious bodies that they might not be able to cope with this new change. They suggested that the Ministry should consider providing the necessary facilities such as administrative and physical arrangements necessary for the holding of such classes which could be centralized in certain selected schools. This interim measure will allay the fears of some religious bodies which have, as I said, no facilities to conduct these classes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in summary, I would just like to say that I have pointed out the similarities and the differences of the Ministry's recommendations and my GPC's recommendations. I have also pointed out the implications of this change, how it will affect the school, how it will affect the students, how it will affect the enrolment in JCs, and whether this new subject will also be an examination subject when it is combined with Moral Education or combined with Pastoral Care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that I concur with the Minister that ultimately the family plays an important part in inculcating values to our Singa-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> poreans. This must be strongly recognized and that the schools only play a supportive minor role.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that the present decision is a very difficult one to make. But I believe the decision made by the Minister for Education is a very fair one which meets the long-term interest of our people and our country. I firmly believe that we must insist on the policy of separation of religion and politics or the State. Therefore, I am of the opinion that religion should not be brought into the school. Therefore I support the Government's decision on this point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undeniably Religious Knowledge has its good points to the students. But now we have also seen its maladies. Because of changes in objective circumstances we now can see that if we were to maintain the present status quo there would be more disadvantages than advantages. He who adapts will suit the time. Now it is one time, then it was another time. The situation five years ago was different from the situation today. What particularly would call for our attention is the NUS sociology scholars' study-report on religion in our society, what they have pointed out about the possibility of social tension and religious conflict resulting from religious revivalism and fervent religious propagation by some groups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the abolition of Religious Knowledge as a compulsory subject, I believe the majority of the principals and teachers will also agree with the decision of the Ministry of Education. But here I would like to say that this decision also behoves us to go back to our traditional moral education, ie, moral education without religious colours, such as to subjects like Civics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, we have noticed that in the past, even now, subjects like moral education or ethics, which had nothing to do with examination had been ignored by the schools and the students. Some schools even made use of the period for such subject for other things such as supplementary teaching and make-up classes for other subjects. This neglect on teaching of moral education or ethics is possibly the major problem in our schools, moral
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> education. So we must try to rectify this situation. In fact, at the moment, we also lack one set of common subjects on moral education or ethics which would be acceptable to all schools, particularly secondary schools and to students of all ethnic communities as a continuation of Civics subjects taught in primary schools. In our secondary schools, there should be one set of common teaching materials on ethics or moral values so that our students may be inculcated with a commonly shared and accepted traditional moral values and concept irrespective of ethnic origin and be able to discern and cultivate good and high standard of personal character and conduct so that they will be imbued with our correct moral values and attitude and be able to ward off any undesirable western decadent influences and stand up as morally upright and self-respecting Asians and good Singapore citizens, not subjecting themselves, in their spirit to be slavish to western decadent sub-culture and values through the English language and the neglect of one's own social responsibility as against extreme Western individualism as a duty owed to one's own country. I hope that this set of common moral textbooks will come into being very soon and our schools, including our principals and teachers, from now on will pay more attention to the education of moral values in the schools and try to set examples to the students to guide them in their ethical behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the difference between religion and moral education lies in the fact that religion is a kind of faith in some metaphysical deity imposing certain precepts binding on the believers, whereas ethics or moral education depends on the teachers untiringly setting good examples to show the students how to behave, how to be upright and good citizens. In view of this important role of the teachers, a long time is taken for education. I hope and believe that from now on our schools, teachers and all people concerned would respond to and take active part in this task and challenge.

  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, I wish to make a few observations on the question of teaching of Religious
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Knowledge in our schools. While I accept the Ministry's decision, given the long-term implications the teaching of the subject may have on political stability, racial harmony in our multi-racial and multi-religious society, I am rather concerned about the reaction that certain religious organisations and minority communities will have on this change in policy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education is aware of the preference of most religious organisations and a number of minority communities on this subject. The Minister himself has heard these various views both at his own dialogue sessions and dialogue sessions organised by the GPC on Education and the Feedback Unit. They have unanimously held that the teaching of religious studies in a manner that would not compromise the Government's secular stand on religion. They believe that such classes would benefit the students by giving them basically some moral anchor. This is particularly so for some ethnic communities like Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus who have found that the teaching of their respective religious studies has helped their children to become more responsible and better citizens, thus alleviating and reducing social problems within their communities. Furthermore, Sir, it is their view that Religious Knowledge was only introduced five years ago and it is still too early for the Government to assess its long-term impact, good or otherwise. To begin, in their own words, another experiment could produce to be unwise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, there are also a number of mission schools in Singapore which will be affected by this policy. Religion has been a major pillar in such schools and we know for a fact that many of them nurture very good students, including the Minister for Education. To remove religion from their curriculum is like taking away their souls. A number of religious organisations representing these schools even feel that they should be allowed to continue teaching their respective religious studies to the exclusion of even other studies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my next point refers to the withdrawal of religious studies like Hinduism and Islamic studies during curriculum time. Whilst I accept the necessity
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to withdraw, I think somewhere it is necessary for the Government to provide brick, mortar and even teachers to facilitate the teaching of such subjects for a period of time, possibly on a centralised basis if there is a need. This would allow some form of continuity. However, Sir, I also believe that on a longer term basis, the community itself through organisations like MUIS, the Hindu Advisory Board, Sikh Board and similar institutions, should take the responsibility for the teaching of religious studies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a major worry and concern among the minority communities is the impact this policy will have on the admission of students from these communities to Junior Colleges and Pre-University Centres. So far, as the Minister indicated, students have been allowed to offer Religious Knowledge as a subject for entry into Junior Colleges and Pre-University Centres. Some of the figures the Minister gave in his statement apparently would deny 13% of Malay students, 15% of Indian students and 14% other races, if Religious Knowledge is not included as a subject. This number is not insignificant, as suggested by the Minister in his statement. If Religious Knowledge is still left as an examinable subject, I think the Ministry should reconsider this and allow it to be included as a subject for entry into junior college, just as second language is allowed as a subject. The relevance of a second language or Religious Knowledge to the academic studies is about the same. Otherwise, if this is not included, I feel that Malay and Hindu students will be further disadvantaged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, let me add that apart from the above observations which I have made, I fully agree with what the Minister has stated about Singapore being a secular state. It is not only a secular state but a multi-racial and multi-religious one. To preserve religious harmony, we have to be extremely sensitive and it is also essential to keep religion and politics totally separate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President in his Address at the opening of Parliament this year stated that some ground rules should be spelt out to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> keep religion religiously separate from politics. I believe it will not be out of place during this debate for me to ask the Government what has happened to this proposal for establishing ground rules. Or does the Government feel that it is not a serious problem and that there is no need for such rules during this period of time?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion and to seek clarifications from the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has stated that in Government institutions or Government-supported institutions, the Government must be seen to be scrupulously neutral. In this connection, I would like to ask the Minister for clarification regarding, firstly, Government-aided or mission schools and, secondly, the tertiary institutions, the polytechnics and the universities. Sir, firstly, with regard to Government-aided or mission schools, will they be allowed to propagate their beliefs? Will chapel classes, for example, be allowed? Will these schools still be allowed to appoint chaplains who are church ministers? Will religious groups be allowed to meet in mission or Government-aided schools, outside curriculum hours?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the tertiary institutions, practically all the major religions have student groups meeting in these institutions. Will these student groups be allowed to meet and be recognised by the authorities so that they can, for example, continue to use certain lecture halls or rooms for meetings?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with my colleague, Mr Chandra Das, that it is time that the Government further elaborated on what are the ground rules regarding the State and religion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Wan Hussin Bin Haji Zoohri -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Wan Hussin bin Haji Zoohri (Aljunied GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with mixed feelings that I listened to the Minister's statement on the status of the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools. It is a feeling of regret tempered with anxiety.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that what was thought to be educationally sound in 1982 is now considered unsound. I recall that the Report
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> on Moral Education (1979) recognised the fact that "religious studies help to reinforce the teaching of moral values." Hence, the introduction of Religious Knowledge in schools in 1982. Now, after seven years, just as Religious Knowledge is about to firm itself, this educational investment is now considered too risky.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My anxiety, Sir, is over public response to the statement. Recognising the value of Religious Knowledge, what will be the form and substance of the substitute that will fill this educational vacuum? Will this substitute again have to suffer the same fate seven years after its formal adoption? These are some of the questions that will be asked by the public and the parents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as there is no consensus on this issue, as reported by the Minister, I would prefer that we maintain the status quo but with some modifications. Much time and effort have gone into this educational project. It has yet to reach its maturity stage, so to speak.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the question to ask is: has the teaching of Religious Knowledge served its purpose of reinforcing moral values? The Ministry could have done an interim survey or study on this. Like any curriculum development project, there are the expected and the unexpected results or by-products. If there are unexpected ones, what are they? Has the Ministry convinced itself that the unexpected or the undesirable by-products far outweigh the desirable ones? And again, on this question of the fundamental change on religious revivalism, to what extent are there indications that the teaching of Religious Knowledge will contribute to the rise of religious fervour amongst our students?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, based on the Minister's statement and against the backdrop of this heightened religious fervour, I do sympathise with his concern in this matter. If anything else, he wants to err on the side of caution. It is a precautionary step to ensure that the teaching of Religious Knowledge does not develop into a hornets' nest. It is a step to insulate the school system from this stream of religious fervour that is flowing upstream in our society. The Ministry wants to free
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the schools from later becoming the fertile soil or the vehicle or the conduit for religious fervour and maybe extremism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the underlying concern of the Ministry. If in the judgment of the Minister that the teaching of religious knowledge within the formal education system would one day be in danger of being influenced by the growing strength of religious fervour within our own environment, and if the education system does not have at its disposal the defusing mechanism on matters as sensitive as religion, then it is sane enough to expect the Ministry to neutralise the religious elements or the teaching of religious beliefs within the school curriculum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, what then will be the alternative that will fill this educational vacuum? The Minister mentioned the possible introduction of an expanded version of Civics and Moral Education. But whatever the form and substance of this new syllabus will be, I hope the Ministry will not lose sight of the primary objective of educating our Singaporean children. It should take the cue from what was said by the Prime Minister in his response to the Report on the Ministry of Education (1978). I think it is worth repeating, Sir. He said, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... the litmus test of a good education is whether it nurtures citizens who can live, work, contend and co-operate in a civilised way. Is he, loyal and patriotic? Is he when the need arises, a good soldier, ready to defend his country, and to protect his wife and children ... Is he a good neighbour and a trustworthy friend?' And of direct relevance, Sir, to our debate today, the Prime Minister emphasised, and I quote again:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' ... Is he tolerant of Singaporeans of different races and religions?'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, encapsulates the kind of a rounded Singaporean that we hope will emerge from our education system. And it is this new expanded Civics and Moral Education that will have to provide the necessary ingredients for the making of this rounded Singaporean.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this envisaged new syllabus will undoubtedly be a challenge to our curriculum developers. Apart from giving the syllabus its own intellectual basis, it must have a structure and character that is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> distinctively Singaporean. It must mirror the values and virtues of our social and cultural environment, circumstances and even temperament. When completed, the curriculum developers must ensure that the values and virtues inherent in the syllabus could be translated into the teaching materials and modules. And I am confident that the curriculum developers will succeed in venturing into this new educational frontier that is relevant to Singapore's multi-racial setting.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, turning to the question of the transition period. I am glad to note that the Minister will be exercising great flexibility. Whatever the dislocation may be, it must be minimal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the provision to allow religious studies to be taught outside curriculum time as an optional subject, I hope the Minister will take into consideration and allow Muslim students to study Islamic Religious Knowledge outside curriculum time should there be requests from them in certain schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I must say that to chop and change the syllabus mid-stream is an unhealthy practice. But here, I think it may be an exception to the rule. It seems to me that we need to chop or amputate the leg to save the body. The overriding reason in doing this is because this is Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our social, cultural and religious setting is unique. But we must not forget that it is also fragile. It can crack or crumble under growing inter-racial and inter-religious pressure. We therefore need to be vigilant and prevent this from happening. We must guard and preserve this racial harmony. Nothing should be allowed to destabilise it. Only then will our future be safe.

But your objection was directed against the moving of the motion of the adjournment by the Minister. And if you know your Standing Orders, the Minister is within his right to move a motion for the adjournment without any notice. You really have no grounds for any objections to the debate.

  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, I just want to make one point with regard to Mr Chiam's point that the Opposition has not been given notice. I believe, Sir, at the beginning of this month, at the first meeting of the Mendaki/MOE Committee, I was asked by reporters as to when I would be announcing the Ministry's decision on the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools, and I said that I would do it at the next sitting of Parliament. I also notice that in today's Straits Times, it is stated very prominently that I will be coming to Parliament today to announce the Ministry's decision. I think enough notice must have been given.

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> important topic. And if he feels that he has not got ample opportunity today to express all that he wants to say, I think Members would certainly have no objections if in future he exercises his right to move a motion on this matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, first of all, I will comment on what the Minister for Education has said. I do not think it is fair that our Order Paper should be transferred to the Straits Times and we have to keep tab with what is going on in Parliament by reading the Straits Times.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Minister for Law and Home Affairs for saying that I could move another motion. I think he has got it right there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Education did say that religious teaching, whether or not to change the policy, depends upon the type and circumstances of our society. I think this is very true. The type of society we have is inherited from the British. We have an education system for more than 100 years. Apart from the education system, religion has been taught in school and this is a historical fact.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order for the society to have stability, we must not abruptly uproot or change institutions that have already been established and tested for a long time. I am referring to the mission schools in Singapore. They have been a great contributor to the society and they are tested institutions. The teaching of religion in these schools, I think, has been recognised by the Government as an important fact contributing to the good of our society. I think that is why in 1982 the Government had in fact gone one step further and introduced the teaching of religions in schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do recognise and accept that Government must be secular. But I think the teaching of religion in schools does not make the Government involved in religion. We should continue the historical institution of teaching of religion in our schools. This is something that is historically with us. We are accepting what is already with us for a long time. I do not think it is wise to go around trying to change a very fundamental thing in our society very quickly. That will disorientate our society
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and make us really rootless. If we want to have roots in our society, we must have basic institutions. I think the teaching of religion in our schools is one of these basic institutions. The Government recognised it in 1982. They must have given it a long and hard look and thought about it. And now all of a sudden, we come to this House today and say that we are going to completely change that policy. I think this is a major decision to be made in Singapore - to take away religious teaching in our schools. The Government should not take such a strong step, but perhaps modify it. All right, if you do not want to make it compulsory, maybe it could be on an optional basis. [Interruption] No, you are taking it away completely from the schools and teaching it outside the schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Outside the curriculum, but still taught in the schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> That is right. I know. But it is not part of the school curriculum. I think that is very important. Because you are taking religion as if it is athletics, badminton or some other subject. I think that is a wrong emphasis on a subject. It should be taught within the school curriculum time, but on an optional basos. There is a basic difference there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think it is true to say that the students who take religion as an examination subject are students who are weak, who cannot pass the normal subjects or take religion to get them into pre-U classes. I think that is not fair. There are many students who want to have a grounding of religion and they take it as a subject, and they just follow it through as an examination subject.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think religion is definitely important in our society. It gives a man the ballast, something to hold on to. We have seen a lot of social problems in Singapore, because if you take something away from them, they do not know what to cling on to unless, of course, you have got a good alternative. It is important that if we do not give our people some spiritual balance, they might search for other teachings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason given for changing this policy is that they say there is a heightened religious awareness. I think this is typical
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of this Government. If there is a show of any slight movements in our society, they will have to go there and make big changes. I think this is wrong. This is something which is typical of our society. Sometimes when something comes up, it goes in a cycle and it will probably fade out in time to come. But I do not think it is right to change a major policy just because there is some heightened religious awareness. On this policy of trying to take away religious teaching from our curriculum, I do not think that it is a good thing. Many people fear that this is only a first step. As Dr Arthur Beng has stated, maybe the Government will say, "No more religious activities or groups of activities in our schools." I think people will fear that this is a first step and the Government should assure the people that they are not taking such steps.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information (Mr Ho Kah Leong)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister for Education has said in his statement and also as reflected by the various Members of Parliament the question as to whether we should retain or do away with the Religious Knowledge subject, everybody has his own reason and justification for saying so. But since the Government has already balanced the pros and cons of this subject and has made the decision to abolish RK as a compulsory subject, I think we should only hope that this decision is a correct one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am concerned is that this decision will cause the subject of Confucian Ethics to be the victim of abolition of RK subject. By name or by connotation Confucian Ethics, is a kind of ethics, a philosophy. It is not a religion. So, it should not be mentioned in the same breath and treated as a Religious Knowledge subject and subject to the same fate, being abolished together.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that when the subject of Confucian Ethics was being prepared, the Ministry of Education had taken the trouble to recruit Confucian specialists and scholars to come to Singapore as consultants to help in compiling teaching materials and texts for the teaching of this subject. There have been many forums and seminars and studies to collect views on this subject. Finally, there was a systematic compilation of Confucian teaching taken from "The Four Books" into textbooks in both English and Chinese versions as a subject to be taught in schools. Singapore's effort is the first ever in the world. The Ministry of Education's attitude and careful manner in dealing with this matter should win our accolades. It has been lauded also by many International Confucian Scholars. Confucian Ethics as a subject has also been adopted by many schools, about one-fifth of our Secondary 3 and 4 students have opted for this subject.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Confucianism originated from China, but it does not mean that it is a Chinese thought. Much of the teaching is universal. Its promotion are also very popular in other countries such as Japan and South Korea, not just confined to China or Taiwan. There are many Confucian scholars, even among western countries. So now if you take away Confucian teaching from the schools, treating it as a religious subject to be abolished together, it would be a retrogressive action. The more sensible way for the Ministry to do is to treat Confucian Ethics teaching as the subject Civics, teaching morals, and not regard it as a RK subject. So, we should continue with and strengthen the teaching of Confucian Ethics as a curriculum subject in schools to fill up the vacuum left by the abolition of Religious Knowledge. Since Confucianism has been a subject of study internationally, it is also a subject good for all non-Chinese students in Singapore, whatever race they are. Because in the teaching of Confucianism there are such teachings on how cultivate oneself, form one's character and how to have proper relationship with other people. All students, whatever their race, will have life-long benefit from the learning of these teachings. If the text of Confucian Ethics had been too hard to compre-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hend, as alleged by the Member for Ayer Rajah, we could ask the CDIS to amend it. We should not discard it just because it is hard to swallow by aboloshing the Confucial Ethics as a curriculum subject. Therefore, I hope the Minister will give furhter and deeper consideration to my suggestion before abolishing Confucian Ethics as a subject in the schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline K Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline K Wong (Tampines GRC):</b> Pending the clarification from the Minister on the position of the mission schools, vis-a-vis the teaching of Bible Knowledge, let me also share my concern about the particular position of the mission schools in Singapore in view of their past contributions to our education efforts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Member for Kampong Ubi, I also feel that the public is bound to ask the question that, after only five years of the introduction of Religious Knowledge, why is the Government now making the decision to change the status of the programme from a compulsory to an optional one? It would appear to have been a great waste of resources if the programme is scrapped only after such a short time. However, I also understand that circumstances are such that we have no choice but to change the status of the programme. What I do foresee is that even though we are making the programme an optional one from now on, in effect, I think the programme will die a natural death. Once Religious Knowledge ceases to be a compulsory subject and once it is no longer tied to the admission criteria for junior college and pre-university courses, I can see that the number of students is going to drop so drastically in a few more years and the whole thing will just die off.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that even though the Minister has clarified for us the circumstances surrounding the change of the status of the programme, ie, an increase in awareness of religious differences among the population in the last decade or so, I must add that this is not necessarily due to the Religious Knowledge Programme in itself. Even in Singapore there has been a quiet revival of religious fervour. In fact, we already hear of occasions when some communities feel that they are encroached upon and feel quite upset about it. In our situation, I think the complexities become
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> more so because race and religion are quite closely linked to each other. In that light, in the past few years there has been a noticeable increase in the racial awareness of our population because we have discussed so many racial issues in the open, about political representation, about educational privileges and fertility. So the awareness of religious and racial differences has not arisen because of the RK programme in itself. Be that as it is, then it is by a coincidence of a number of factors external to the Ministry of Education that the RK Programme has been caught up with racial and religious sensitivites.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, the only way to resolve the problem is to ask the most fundamental question about the whole programme. The most fundamental question is whether the Government of a secular state should be involved in the teaching of religion. In my mind, the answer is a very clear, no. Having settled that, the next question is how to phase out the programme. I think the way proposed by the Minister is entirely fair to the students. The students' interests would have been taken care of and I should say this is very characteristic of our Minister's way of dealing with things, to be very fair and keep promises. The question which now remains is: what kind of formal teaching should take the place of Religious Knowledge so that the original objective of the programme can still be achieved?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original objective, ie, the rationale behind the introduction of Religious Knowledge was our concern that younger Singaporeans have become so westernized as to lose the sense of their cultural roots. So Religious Knowledge was supposed to transmit cultural values rather than to teach religious beliefs. In the lacuna left behind by the dropping of Religious Knowledge from the school curriculum, then the question is what can we put back. Moral Education is already being taught at Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 levels. Should the new Civics course be introduced at the upper secondary level? I do not know how this will work out in practice. But if the new Civics course is to be a mere extension of the present Moral Education course emphasizing universal humanistic values or even
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> incorporating the new set of core values, I doubt very much if there is enough course content to occupy the Civics course for two further years of studying. The more appropriate place for the teaching of cultural values, ie, values specific to our major cultural traditions, is the teaching of the second language. Lessons in the second language should be expanded in terms of cultural and historical content, as well as introducing students to literary works in that particular language. So in lieu of the Civics lessons, students can be given additional hours in the second language with this increased cultural, historical and literary contents. The Ministry of Education should not rule out this possibility. Otherwise I cannot really imagine how you can fill two more years of Civics lessons with good enough content.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Chinese community is concerned, Sir, I think the advocates of the teaching of Confucian Ethics are going to be very disappointed. We have just heard Mr Ho Kah Leong speaking up for this segment of the Chinese population. Personally, I also feel a sense of loss at the fact that Confucian Ethics will also have to be dropped along with the other subjects. Some people may even think of the eventual demise of Confucian Ethics as a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water." They would argue that Confucianism in itself is not a religious subject and it really should not be treated on the same status as the others in the programme. But in my mind, no matter how I regret the decision, I feel that you cannot separate it from the rest of the programme because once we have accepted it as part of the programme, there is no other choice. So the question is, how to put back some Confucian Ethics or some elements of it into the teaching for our Chinese students in the Moral Education lessons or, as I said, in the extended version of the second language.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Chinese community itself must also ask a very deep question: why is it that even when Confucian Ethics is a compulsory subject, only 17.8% of the students are taking it as compared to 44.4% who are taking Buddhist Studies? I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> think this is a very soul - searching question and we should really look at ourselves very honestly. It is said that it is easier for the students to pass Buddhist Studies than Confucian Ethics. If our parents hold this pragmatic orientation towards Moral Education in our children, I do not think it is fair to blame these things on the Ministry of Education or the set of texts. I do not know whether Chinese parents now feel that we have missed out on a golden opportunity. When Confucian Ethics was taught as a Compulsory RK lesson, we did not ask the children to take it. Now it is going to be gone. Are we going to ask or pressurize the Ministry of Education for further consideration? I think with or without the parents' demand, it is the duty of our educational professionals to think in terms of the interest of our students and to re-introduce Confucian Ethics in some form or other into second language teaching, or into the new Moral Education teaching, because I think only then would the original objective of the RK programme be preserved.

  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Minister's move to remove the teaching of Religious Knowledge from the curriculum. I think the decision to introduce the teaching of Religious Knowledge as a compulsory subject in 1982 was a wrong decision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer Mr Chiam's point whether this actually changes the Government's decision on religion, the answer must be no, because the position is very clear with regard to religion. Everybody is free to practise whatever religion he wants to practise. The state is secular. On that fundamental, there is no change.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, when Religious Knowledge was introduced as a compulsory subject at Secondary 3 and 4, it was not to propagate or to enhance the religious status of certain religions. That was not the purpose. The purpose was in one of the twin objectives of education. The twin objectives are to teach every child the three R's and to make sure that he is morally sound, he has got the moral fibre to be a good citizen, a good father, a good member of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the community. While in the past there were subjects like Civics and Moral Education to ensure that this aspect of education was achieved, it was thought that perhaps Religious Knowledge could better achieve this second objective of education and that was why it was introduced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had certain reservations then because it was a direct contradiction of the State philosophy, ie, the State is a secular state and therefore it should have nothing to do with how religion should be taught. Now that it has taken place for the last six years, the more I look at it, the more convinced I am that it was a wrong decision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether a person can be a better person with Religion Knowledge. The mere knowledge of a religion itself does not make a person a better person. Look at the number of criminals in the prison. Ask the Minister for Home Affairs. Do you mean the prisoners do not know what is right and what is wrong? Do you mean they do not know the different types of religions? In fact, if you examine their background, many of them are not ignorant of religions or ignorant of what is right or what is wrong. I think many of them went in because they lacked the moral fibre, the courage or the morality to take the decision not to do the wrong thing at the time when there was a great temptation. Therefore, if religion is to be of any use to inculcate this moral fibre, to give this moral value and to bring about a better citizen, I think religion cannot be taught in the school in a secular state where there is a total absence of this religious element. Because without faith, without the practice of that religion, a person will find very little value to just know of Religious Knowledge, if the objective is to make him a better person.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the school as compared to the church, mosque or temple is the last place where Religious Knowledge should be taught. The right place is in the church if you are a Christian, in the mosque if you are a Muslim, in the temple if you are a Hindu or Buddhist. Because, apart from the knowledge, it is strengthened by the atmosphere, by the element of faith, then there is a value.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the Minister's point that parents must recognise that ultimately it is their responsibility. Now we are telling the parents squarely and emphatically and I think they must not abdicate from this responsibility. Because it is only with this recognition that finally it is the parents who take the responsibility to ensure the moral well-being of their children that we will ensure that our children are brought up properly. To pass it to the schools will be the wrong place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the last point which is that the Singapore schools are not adequate to teach religion. In certain countries where they have a state religion, because it is a state religion, it is part of their responsibility as a state to make sure that that religion is propagated and that religion is taught in the schools. It is essential in such a situation. What do they do in such a situation? Apart from setting aside periods for such religious knowledge studies, they make sure that they employ the right type of religious teachers to impart not just knowledge but also the religious values. Therefore, if you look around, in some countries where they have a state religion, where they teach religious knowledge as part of the responsibility of the state, they employ competent and qualified religious teachers to teach. It will be disastrous if you get religious teachers to teach Mathematics, English and Science. Equally, it will be disastrous if you get secular teachers who are trained to teach English, Science and Mathematics to teach religion. It is not just another subject that you read up, because you must not take religion as a trivial matter. You must not let teachers take religion as a trivial matter where they just read up and go to class and teach.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the problems of religious fanaticism and deviant behaviour is a result of people teaching the wrong things about religions. If you want to be serious about making sure that our future generations are properly imbued with the right values and the right religion, I think the choice is not with the State. The choice is with the individual. And every parent, if he is serious about what his son or daughter should profess in regard to religion, the first responsibility is to make sure that he goes to the right place to be taught by the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> right people on religion. I say without fear of contradiction that the Singapore school is not competent for such a role because we are not made up that way. Our school is a secular school manned by teachers who are well trained to teach English, Mathematics, Science and all the secular subjects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Ministry of Education or the PSC recruit teachers on the basis of their religious qualifications? It is nothing like that. If you want to put the moral future of your children in such an unsuitable situation, that is not the right way to do things. Therefore, I think the decision in 1982 to introduce compulsory teaching of Religious Knowledge was a wrong decision and today I am more convinced that it is a wrong decision. At least, now the Government has got the courage to say that it is a wrong decision. We should encourage the churches, the temples, the mosques, and the parents to take a greater responsibility in the religious education of their children. We should help them. And although this is not the responsibility of the State, there are ways and means in which the State can help indirectly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1982, as Mr Chiam mentioned, the Christian schools did a great deal by making great contributions, particularly in religious education and things like that. They did that without going through the formal curriculum. They found other means of doing so. So we could go back to pre-1982. The Christian schools could still continue to do whatever they had done before 1982. The Muslims, with so many mosques now and through Mendaki, MUIS or whatever body, because they are interested in the children's education and since so much efforts have been made, they can do that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it very clear. I am all for religious education. I believe that religion is very essential for an individual, for those who believe in it. A religion can make a man a much better man and I think we want that. But there is a right place to do it and a wrong place to do it and the Singapore school is the wrong place to do it.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Marine Parade GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, basically I agree very much to the Minister's exposition and I welcome his proposition very much. In terms of Singapore's educational history this is a very important milestone. It is a very important decision. I hope the Minister will also consider and adopt the opinions expressed by the Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Ho Kah Leong, Dr Aline Wong and Mr Goh Choon Kang. I believe that when the subject Religious Knowledge is changed to be an optional subject and the new subject Civics is introduced in the schools these changes will be acceptable to and get the support of the parents, the teachers, principals and the people of our society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of Religious Knowledge taught in the past few years may not now meet the requirement of our present circumstances. Times have changed. Everybody knows that Singapore is an oriental, multi-religious, multi-racial and multi-cultural society. If we continue to allow our young people to take RK as a curriculum subject in school it will be limited in scope. The learning of Civics in place of RK is very appropriate and timely. But what is important now is to look forward, not to look back.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we should do now is to talk about how is the Ministry of Education going to compile a series of textbooks for the teaching of Civics in schools in order to meet the requirements of our society, a plural, multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-cultural society and to bring up a new generation of educated, cultured and loyal citizens. I hope that the new Civics course will include the following. Other than emphasizing the teaching of moral education, I hope we should also teach the younger generation about the principles of life, concept of the family and so on, introduce to them our history, our people and their customs, and also introduce to them the principal teachings and the truths of the various religions existing in our country and, of course, also inculcate Confucian thoughts, as the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has just said. Confucianism is not just confined to the Chinese society. Its universal teaching is applicable to all people and countries. It meets our local
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> situations also. Or, we can teach them some suitable thoughts and ideology befitting our situation. Since we do not have a long history, I also hope that the Ministry can also adopt the deeds and achievements of some historic figures as good teaching materials from various countries such as, say, Yue-Fei from China and others to cultivate the spirit of national consciousness and patriotism in our young. We also know that different types of music used for different situations will produce different moods and atmospheres. Therefore the system of education and the course contents of the Civics subject taught will determine what type of younger generation will be produced. We all hope that our next generation will be of good quality imbued with good ethical spirit and sense of citizenship with refined cultural standing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope the Ministry of Education in compiling Civics course will pay great attention to culling and harnessing the various aspects and scopes of the deeper essence and values from various sources without undue religious colour as education is a sacred task. To educate the people, four aspects of education should be stressed, they are moral, knowledge, physical and social education. Without RK as a curriculum subject in school will not make our younger generation walking corpses as alleged by the Member for Potong Pasir. On the contrary, with the subject Civics introduced into the schools, I believe, our people will be imbued with more Eastern traditional cultural values and more able to promote our economy and the advancement of our country a step forward in our nation building.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tiong Bahru GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to say a few words regarding the changes in the educational policy relating to the teaching of Religious Knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some parents and community groups would be disappointed with the move to exclude the teaching of Religious Knowledge from the curriculum. This is understandably so, Sir, because they feel that the teaching of Religious Knowledge is useful to their children as it provides a basis to help them to be better people, at least to learn about how to become people who have some morals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the question is: which are the institutions that should be basically concerned in trying to imbue such religious values to children? I feel that the family is the basic foundation of any society. And it is this foundation, the basic family unit which should be concerned about inculcating religious values to children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the option is with the family. The family can make the choice in terms of what religious persuasions they would like to go to, and I do not think the State should intercede or intervene in such personal choices. Rightly so, Sir, that if this is the case, then the policy that we are adopting should in a way steer ourselves from interceding into areas which are outside the domain of the Ministry of Education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, there are parents who are concerned with the impact of these policy changes and I am of the opinion that these parents and the wider public need to be given further explanation by the Government for making a departure from its present educational policy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more importantly, the schools affected should work with the parents perhaps through the parents/teachers association, through various other groups within the school system, to see how the difficulties facing children taking Religious Knowledge as a subject in the next few years could be reduced. I see this is a crucial thing and I note that the Ministry is trying to take various measures to deal with the problem as a result of these changes in this curriculum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, assistance must be given to minimise disruptions which would be caused by this change. The question that I would like to raise is whether the schools that are providing religious teaching would continue to provide whatever support in terms of facilities, manpower positions, and teacher assistance, to allow the children that are undertaking religious knowledge as a subject. And this, I think, would have to be looked into and whether future policies would change in relation to whether the Ministry will continue to give support in terms of teacher and manpower resources for the teaching of Religious Knowledge outside the school hours. These are important issues that we would like to seek clarification.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like all reasonable parents, I support the move by the Ministry of Education to promote moral and civics education as a part of the education curriculum and make religious teaching outside the school hours. This is a sensible decision which is important for Singapore's long-term interest and social health. Sir, I do not want to sound moralistic or be moralising. But I would like to acknowledge that this switch in the policy is timely. I see a number of good reasons for this and I am sure other Singaporeans would see the merits of the case.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, the social health of our society is dependent on the moral fibres of our people and our capacity to find social antidotes to counter religious antagonisms, conflicts and other negative or decadent values which could erode the moral and social responsibilities of our people. Therefore, the provision of a more rounded and carefully designed moral and civics education programme in our schools would be an answer to this problem. I know that in many educational systems they have devised very good moral education programmes and value education, and these have produced effective results. And I think that if we are going to implement moral education and civics education programme in the schools, I stress that we should give serious thought in terms of how to devise a good curriculum to implement this programme. Sir, it is the view of many educationists that a good moral and civics education programme can play an important role in inculcating into students desirable social and moral codes. Formal moral and civics education must therefore start as early as possible, especially when a child begins school. If we can provide them early exposures in terms of this area of education, I think the better edge we will have in trying to produce better students who have good moral values.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry whether it has professional expertise and teachers to mount an effective civics education programme. What steps are being taken through CDIS to develop a well-rounded and effective CIVICS education programme to cater for our secondary school pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, the teaching of moral and civics education is non-sectarian and not biased towards any single religion, be it Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and Buddhism. It is universal and encourages our students to be mutually supportive, respectful and tolerant in their later years. This can help to promote social cohesion among our citizens with different religious persuasions and ethnic backgrounds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, in implementing moral and civics education, we duly recognise the multi-ethnic and religious composition of our society and the complications that may arise if allowance is made to promote values of one religion over others. Sir, we can ill-afford to allow communal groups to ruin our social and economic well-being by inciting religious conflicts and differences. There are many historical lessons to draw from many multi-ethnic societies where religion and language have led to communal strifes and consequently breakdown of these societies. I agree with Mr Chiam that we should learn from history and we should preserve historical traditions. But there are a lot of lessons from history that we can learn and I am sure that he is quite aware that in many societies, because of religious differences, communal conflicts, such societies have broken down. And I am quite sure that Mr Chiam and myself would not want to see this happen in the context of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our case, I assert that moral and civics education can help to prevent these consequences as it is centred on a curriculum designed to encourage good citizenship. It is a universal programme which would reduce perceptual contradictions between and amongst different religious and interests groups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, our educational setting would be able to allay future demands by various religious groups to deploy governmental resources to support religious activities. I feel that if the Education Ministry does get into the promotion of religious programmes within the curriculum, then what is there to prevent different groups to make demands on State resources? I think these are some of the fundamental questions that the Education Ministry has to address itself and I am glad that the Government has finally been able to make
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a clear decision to drop the teaching of Religious Knowledge within curriculum time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I assess that the change to civics education is for the overall good of our society. It will still strengthen the moral values of our children and enhance their civic consciousness.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Ibrahim Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Ibrahim Othman (Bedok GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, since the release of the report on Religions in Singapore by the Ministry of Community Development last year, various comments and views have been conveyed to the Government, urging fairness in matters of religion. There have also been organisations and individuals, including Members of Parliament in this House, who proposed that the Government, in particular the Ministry of Education, carry out a detailed study of the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools. The Malay/Muslim community in Singapore had been looking forward to the decision to be made by the Ministry of Education on the issue of Religious Knowledge in school, and the statement just given by the Minister for Education would certainly be a disappointment to many members of our Malay/Muslim community. It would mean the closure of a main channel, i.e. the schools, for the inculcation of values and for the teaching of religious knowledge, something which our students truly need. The step taken by the Ministry would also put greater demands on mosques and Muslim organisations to meet our children's need for Islamic religious education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the currently inadequate number of mosques and Muslim organisations having facilities of their own to conduct Islamic religious classes, it is still too early for the Ministry of Education to phase out the teaching of Religious Knowlege in schools.
  <br>3.00 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Islam is important and has been of positive influence to the Malay community. Islam is a necessary shield against evil elements, more so in this era of negative influences. Religion helps us to inculcate moral values in our children and to produce a community of high morals,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> which is what the country needs. We also cannot deny that Islamic Religious Knowledge has brought good to the Malay students. Their conduct has improved; they perform their duties with a greater sense of responsibility and they are able to differentiate between good and otherwise. For the better students, good Islamic Religious Knowledge grades at 'O' level help them to gain entry to pre-university education. Mr Speaker, although what I said concerns Islamic Religious Knowledge, I think the same applies to the other religious subjects in school. We should not be concerned about the grades for Islamic Religious Knowledge or the other Religious Knowledge subjects being used for purposes of pre-university enrolment, as usually it is offered as the sixth subject, equivalent in ranking to other subjects not relevant to Pre-University education. What is important are the compulsory four or five subjects that enable student to enter Pre-University.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the statement by the Minister for Education can be considered retrogressive, not progressive. If the phasing out of Religious Knowledge is done because of problems relating to the increase in religious propagation activities, I think what we should do instead is to take measures to control over-zealous propagation, not phase out Religous Knowledge in school. If it is because RK has led to our pupils banding up according to religious persuasion, we should introduce a more effective Civics Education programme to bring about harmony among our younger generation in school. In view of the positive impact of Religious Knowledge on our students, I would like to urge the Ministry of Education to continue its teaching in school. If the Ministry is not in favour of that, at least it could allow the teaching of Religious Knowledge outside school cirriculum hours and, in addition, provide teachers for the purpose. I would also like to urge the Ministry to allow Religious Knowledge grades to be offered for enrolment into, at least, Pre-university centres. I agree with the Ministry of Education that our country is a secular state and that relgion and politics must be kept separate. However, in view of the multi-racial, multi-religious make up of our society, we have to allow Religious Knowledge as a school subject to remain,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> because religion is an important element of the character of a society. And in our present process of development, where we are trying to maintain our identities as Chinese, Indian or Malay, Singaporeans, I think we still need to have Religious Knowledge in school. Thank you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministerial Statement on Religious Knowledge made by the Education Minister just now is worthy of support. Since 1982, the Education Ministry has implemented Religious Knowledge and Confucian Ethics in the secondary school curricula, with religious Knowledge further divided into Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism. Its basic aim is to ensure that our students have a better understanding of the religion of their choice as well as to inclucate positive moral values. However, since its implementation, it has somehow departed from its original objectives; some schools are becoming religious "conversion halls", thus causing great concern among members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreoever, our students are only exposed to the religion of their choice, resulting in ignorance of other major religions. In the long run, religious extremism may develop, and this will run contrary to the basic principles behind the implementation of Religious Knowledge. As such, if left unchecked, this trend will pose a serious threat to our existing social harmony.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech at the Opening of the Seventh Parliament, President Wee stated that religion and politics should not be mixed so as to prevent any unscrupulous usage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as religious knowledge has caused much concern among the public, I fully agree with the Member for Cheng San GRC, Mr S. Chandras Das' sentiment. To avoid further confusion among the public, I feel that our Government should make a clear stand as to whether religion and politics should be mixed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should set up a committee, comprising knowledgeable and established personalities, to look into the course
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> structure and content of Religious Knowledge. This will minimise any past mistakes, such as "dead or dull" content and avoid further confusion to parents and guardians through frequent changes within a short period of time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have to include religious knowledge into the new subject, we should ensure that it is a unbias representation. Regardless of race or religion, our students will be able to appreciate the principles of multi-religions in our society and to tolerate different religions practised by others. This will be a step further in religious tolerance and cooperation, thereby preserving our existing social harmony and, at the same time, avoaiding religious extremism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Confucian Ethics, and other philosophy, we should also consider including these into the new subject because Confucianism is not a religion. If we were to lump Confucianism as a traditional ideology, regressive to our society, then we will be making the same mistake as Mr Chiam See Tong and it will be a great pity indeed! This will contradict our Government's stand in promoting traditional and cultural values, as well as cause parents to be suspicious of the setting up of seed schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that this new subject will not cause students to have the misconception that it is a secondary subject of minor importance in the syllabus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Education Ministry would consider the following points:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Using modern and updated stories to inculcate civic qualities. Examples used could be stories from ancient times as well as modern-day examples which students are familiar with. This will ensure a better understanding and erase any misinterpretation of values.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Using simplified but interesting language to prevent long and weary leassons, carried out in a "preachy" manner. In this way, the new subject will be able to capture the attention of the students.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Prohibit teachers from utilizing periods to teach other subjects, which will

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) As a replacement, Ethics will be a better alternative than Civics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Ministerial Statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee) (In Mandarin) :</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 10 years ago I participated in the work of the Committee on Moral Education which was chaired by the then Minister for Culture, Mr Ong Teng Cheong who is now the Second Deputy Prime Minister. I remember that one of the main recommendations of the Committee was to replace the "Education for Living" then taught in the primary schools and the then Civics subject in the secondary schools by a Moral Education course. The Committee also recommended that the curriculum of the Moral Education course should entail the three following points: First, personal behaviour, such as good habits, honesty, filial piety etc.; secondly, Social Responsibility such as civic consciousness, law-abiding, cherish one's own cultural heritage and respect other people's cultural heritage etc.; and Thirdly, Loyalty to the country such as patriotism, upholding democracy and justice, etc. All the three points are still valid in today's context.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Committee on Moral Education felt that the study and learning of Religious Knowledge could reinforce the teaching of moral values and, hence, it suggested to the Ministry of Education to review its policy so as to allow the mission schools greater flexibility in the teaching of Religious Knowledge and implement their own religious instruction programmes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, I support the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools as an extension to the moral education programme. However, during the Budget
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Debate in March 1982, when I spoke on the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools, I raised a few problems for the Ministry of Education to consider when it implements its policy to teach Religious Knowledge in school. First, I pointed out then, we should emphasise the mutual respect and tolerance among the various religious groups, and such tolerance should be extended to cover the traditions and customs of the various communities. Among the Chinese, there are many who are polytheistic. They worship not only the deities but also their ancestors. They also believe in geomancy. At that time, I asked whether the students who studied Religious Knowledge would tolerate all these. Would the Christians say these are heretical beliefs and superstitions? Would the non-Christian Chinese feel that the Christian are devoid of feeling for their ancestors and are forsaking their roots? If we were not careful, Religious Knowledge would have some disintegrating effect on the cohesiveness in our society. Unfortunately, what I said at that time turns out to be true.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I was also concerned that some religious fanatics would make use of the teaching of Religious Knowledge to preach their religious beliefs and to attack the other religions. The Ministry of Education then announced that a monitor unit would oversee the teaching of Religious Knowledge. I was doubtful, even at that time, that the unit would be able to supervise 140 schools in the teaching of Religious Knowledge. I believe the Member for Moulmein also expressed his worry on this matter at the same sitting. At that time, the Minister of State, Dr Tay Eng Soon, replied that the Government would take very stern action against those who made use of Religion and religious issues to disintegrate our society and create conflicts therein. In his conclusion, he said that the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools was appropriate, otherwise many of our students would have no knowledge of the major religions in the world and he asked whether this was what we wanted for our future generation. His exact works (in English) were, "Is this something that we want for future generation?". Yet, just a few years later, the Ministry of Education has now decided to abolish the teaching of Religious Knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, circumstances have changed. Religions in our Republic have undergone some revival. Our Constitution provides for freedom of religion for our people. The Government has adopted a fairly neutral stand as far as religions are concerned. However, in a multi-religious society, if any of the religions is to develop too rapidly, it would naturally result in reactions or response from the other religious groups in self-defence. Some over-zealous or even fanatical preachers may forsake the basic principle of inter-religious tolerance and neglect the importance of inter-religious peaceful co-existence. In order to further their objectives of preaching their religions, they will not hesitate to run down the other religions and beliefs, and criticize other people's traditional customs and practices. Such development will result in more friction among the religious bodies in our society. It would also aggravate the conflicts and problems among members of a family because of different religious beliefs. We have often heard that in a family, many problems arose at their wedding ceremonies or funeral rites because of different religious beliefs. In other instances, some members of the family refuse to perform some traditional rites or to observe certain festive occasions owing to their religious differences, thereby resulting in conflicts and unhappiness in the family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, if we persist in teaching Religious Knowledge in our secondary schools, it will not only result in our schools being used as the cradle for the preaching of religious beliefs, but also further aggravate the frictions among the various religions in our Republic, thereby polarizing our society. For these reasons, I support the Minister of Education's decision to abolish the teaching of Religious Knowledge which he announced just now. I believe this is a correct decision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the teaching of Religious Knowledge is being abolished, Confucian Ethics, as an innocent by-stander, unfortunately, has to face the chopping board and be abolished as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Few years ago, we spent a lot of time and effort, in developing the subject. We even went to the extent of going abroad to invite experts such as Tu Wei-Ming, Yu Ying-Shih, etc. to help us draw up a conceptual framework for the syllabus for Confucian Ethics. This syllabus is used for just a few years and it has to be abolished. In fact, as my colleagues have already pointed out, Confucianism is not a religion. What it emphasizes is human relationship, the relationship between man and society, and the relationship between man and the nation. It does not involve the relationship between man and God. It is not a religious belief and is not in conflict with any other religion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circumstances here have changed. But, the various adverse effects on our society brought about by religious revival over the past few years have nothing to do with the teaching of Confucian Ethics. Moreover, we are now emphasizing the inculcation of oriental values. To many Chinese, Confucianism is a complete set of traditional values by itself. What the Ministry of Education is doing is to treat the six subjects on equal footing. Although, superficially, this may appear to be a fair treatment for all. But, in reality, such an act is most unfair! As such, I concur with the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Ho Kah Leong's view that the Ministry of Education should reconsider the matter and not abolish but retain Confucian Ethics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the abolition of Religious Knowledge, what are we going to replace it with? It is not just a question of filling up the lesson time. The important point is Moral Education is part and parcel of our education programme. We all know that education must comprise the three essential components: Moral Education, Intellectual Education. Moral education is particularly important when we see so many unhealthy phenomena in our society today. We have delinquents and an increasing number of drug addicts; some commit suicide at the slightest setback; and other resort to emigration over the slightest dissatisfaction in life. As such, the school should coordinate with the family in the inculcation of the right values and the true meaning of life in our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> students. This is the main objective of Moral Education, irrespective of its approval or method of teaching.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the teaching of core value is a feasible method. I agree with Dr Aline Wong that Confucianism can be included in the Civics subject, although I must say the scope of civics is somewhat narrow. Unless we have some interesting teaching materials, it will become sermon-like and boring. One other feasible way is like what I suggested just now - to retain Confucian Ethics as an optional subject. A third alternative for the Ministry of Education to consider is perhaps the teaching of the essence of oriental and western thoughts, philosophies and civilization. Such a subject will have no religious flavour in it, but it will enable our students to widen their field of vision so that they can look at things in a more balanced manner. By this, we can offer our students with a more intellectually challenging subject. I hope that the Ministry of Education will consider these suggestions. Thank you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Batok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the policy outlined by the Minister. Circumstances have changed since Religious Knowledge was first introduced as a compulsory subject in our schools. There is an upsurge in religious activities in our country and religion is increasingly a sensitive subject in our midst. We therefore have to adjust and adapt our policies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, Sir, the State should, and must, maintain a position of complete impartiality and seen to be so, be equidistant from all and even-handed towards all religions. The State should not use its powers to compel its citizens to study and sit for examinations in Religious Knowledge. Religious studies, Sir, should be by choice, not by compulsion. The spiritual realm should be best left to private initiative, to private choice. I believe this is in line with our overall privatisation programme. After all, Religious Knowledge is not scrapped but made optional. So one can exercise the choice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the better alternative of Civics and I welcome its introduction to our schools. It is good for Singaporeans of all races and religions to share the same
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Civics lessons in class, to learn what it is to be like to be Singaporeans, together in the same class, rather than going their separate ways to different classes to study different religions during curriculum time. In Civics lessons, the pupils will be on common ground, together as Singaporeans, learning about our common heritage, sharing our common aspirations as Singaporeans and committed to our common destiny as a nation. This, Sir, cannot be but for the good of all, and all Singaporeans should support this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Tay Eng Soon):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was involved in the policy and in the implementation of policy to make Religious Knowledge a compulsory subject in schools in 1982. Having heard a number of Members speak on this, especially with reference to 1982, I felt that I should join in to clarify the position and also to answer one or two points raised by Members, particularly the point raised by the Member for Moulmein, Mr Lawrence Sia, who says that he is now more convinced than ever that that policy was wrong.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reasons that motivated the Ministry of Education and the Government to introduce Religious Knowledge in 1982 were valid and are still valid. The difference that brought about this change in the policy announced by my Minister today is this. It is to make Religious Knowledge optional, a matter of personal choice, as a subject which anybody can choose and it is no longer compulsory. And, secondly, to introduce in its place within curriculum time more Civics education which will bring together the students in a common cause throughout their secondary education. But otherwise Religious Knowledge is still available as an optional subject for anyone to choose.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why do I say that the reason for introducing Religious Knowledge in schools then and now has validity? The reason why, after careful consideration, we decided to introduce Religious Knowledge as a subject in schools is based on the recognition that undergirding the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> moral values of most people are in fact the major religions. If you look at the history of all our societies, all our cultures, religious beliefs and, religious faith have always been the undergirding foundation behind the moral values of most societies and most cultures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Chinese society, one cannot deny that religious beliefs have undergirded the values that have been held important and even sacred by the members of that society. This is the human experience and for centuries and thousands of years this is how societies have generally kept themselves intact as far as moral values which have helped to shape them have survived. Those societies that have completely done away with religious faith, religious values, religious convictions, stand to change and possibly to lose their direction and I think we can see this happening in some parts of the world today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with that recognition that it was felt that some knowledge of the major religions in our society should be made available as subjects for the students to study and that if they understand the foundations of those religions, their origins, their precepts, this will reinforce the moral education that they will have received in school. Sir, we should note that the children in our school have eight years of moral education (six years in primary school, two years in Secondary 1 and 2). When Religious Knowledge was introduced, the purpose was to reinforce the moral education that they will have received in school, so that by the time they leave school their foundations will be that much stronger.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were careful even then in recognising that we are a secular State, that a secular Government cannot be involved in religious instruction, in religious propagation as implied in religious education and therefore we called it Religious Knowledge. There is a difference. In religious education and in religious instruction, one sets out to implant in the individual full religious conviction and practice. But in Religious Knowledge, one teaches the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> subject from the point of view of its foundations, its founder, its origins, its precepts, as a body of knowledge. And therefore in the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools we were careful, and we are careful to ensure that there are no worship practices, that no religious objects are brought into the classroom, that no meditation or practices take place within the class.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have been aware of this very important difference between what the State can and should do and what the State should not be involved in. We knew, Sir, that two years of Religious Knowledge (Secondary 3 and Secondary 4) can only achieve a number of limited objectives. Its objectives are limited to helping the child to understand something of one of the major religions that he should choose to study and the precepts. And the hope is that this will reinforce the moral values that he would have studied in his earlier years. Certainly, the objective was not to convert him from one religion to another, or from no religion to a religion. So to say that Religious Knowledge is dangerous because it will result in this, I think it is misunderstanding this course, misunderstanding its objectives, and giving too much to the two years in which the subject is taught. Anyone who is a religious person, who takes his religion seriously, can tell you that it is a life long process. It is something which starts very young and is something which grows with the individual with time, with personal experience, with practice. It is not something that happens in two years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were aware of the limited educational objectives of the subject of Religious Knowledge. The difference then and now with the new policy is that we made it compulsory. Perhaps in our eagerness to get every child to study one of the major religions, we failed to see that it should not be compulsory. You cannot compel everyone to choose one of the major religions and/or Confucian ethics and say that you must study it. I think in that respect perhaps we have erred. It is an error in application or approach. Nonetheless, it is an error. But the reasons for making Religious Knowledge available are valid, as I have mentioned and explained. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> change proposed is to remove the compulsion, but to make it available as an option to anyone to choose and to do it outside curriculum time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inculcation of religious values of a religious faith is certainly something which must take place in the home with individuals. It is not the right place for a secular school to be involved in. The Minister has quite rightly given emphasis to the key role that parents who believe in the moral upbringing of their children would have to play in this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that Religious Knowledge in its present form as a curriculum subject will be available as an option in schools outside curriculum time. The issue then is whether parents will choose for their children to study one of these subjects, whether they will take up the option. I believe they will, after hearing the Members in the House, that people place high value on the moral education of their children. Furthermore, from the feedback sessions, from the GPC on Education's feedback, many parents say that Religious Knowledge has been good for their children and that they believe that their children benefitted from it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice is still there. It has not been removed. It is now optional. They can choose and, of course, I hope very much that many parents will still choose to let their children study a religious knowledge of their choice outside curriculum time in the facilities and premises that the schools can provide. Then we have lost nothing, Sir. We would still have available this important subject. Parents who believe in its value will have the free choice. The element of compulsion has been removed. Furthermore, Civics will be expanded for integrating our children much more through a course of civics education. I think this change has not removed Religious Knowledge. It has not invalidated the reasons why it was started. It has removed the compulsion and I think parents will stand to gain out of this exercise.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong :</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to ask the Minister of State, is it not true that prior to 1982 Religious Knowledge was also an optional subject? Prior to 1982, all along Religious Knowledge was taught as an optional subject. In
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 1989, we are going back to pre-1982. The mistake in 1982 was to make RK compulsory. So how could the Minister of State say that there was no mistake.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon</b> rose -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> I have not finished. Of course, the underlying reasons for the teaching of Religious Knowledge are always valid since time immemorial - to teach man to be good. After all, our moral education basically wants to achieve that. Since 1959, not just 1982, the underlying reasons for moral education have always been the same. And that is why from 1959 to 1982, in the mission schools particularly, Religious Knowledge was an optional subject. But the Education Ministry made it compulsory in our schools. That was the mistake. So today we are going back to pre-1982 and do not try to absolve from the mistake. It is quite all right. It is a genuine, sincere mistake made with a good intention. It is quite all right.

   <b>TEACHING OF RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE IN SCHOOLS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Tang Guan Seng)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today we are debating on the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools. In the Ministerial Statement, I believe the most
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> important message is this: Government institutions and Government supported institutions, including schools, should not be used as a venue for the preaching of religion. The most important thing that we should bear in mind is we are a multi-religion society. In our multi-religious society, the recent heightened consciousness of religious differences and increased propagation of religious beliefs would result in apprehension among religious bodies. We have to maintain the traditional religious harmony and tolerance without which our society cannot exist. It is for this reason that we have re-examined the whole issue and decided to make the teaching of Religious Knowledge optional. We have to treat the various religions fairly and equally. If we accept this principle, then we should not allow Government-sponsored institutions such as schools to be used as a venue for the preaching of religion. Religious Knowledge should not be taught within the curriculum time in schools and it should not be used as a subject for the admission to junior colleges and pre-university centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Members mentioned just now that Confucian Ethics is not a religion. But because we are phasing our Religious Knowledge as a compulsory subject, we will also withdraw the teaching of Confucian Ethics. This cannot be helped because if we are to maintain on Confucian Ethics and phase out the other religious subjects, there will be problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we phase out Religious Knowledge as a compulsory subject, it does not mean the Ministry of Education does not attach importance to the teaching of moral education. We will extend our Civics Moral Education programme so that sutdents in Secondary 3 and Secondary 4 can also learn from it. The contents of the programme would include aspects of nation building and shared values, and the characteristics of our mulit-religious society. The Ministry needs at least two years to compile the syllabus and teaching materials and train the teachers for the new subject. Just now, one Member mentioned we should set up a committee to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> draw up the syllabus. We will consider it. Other Members mentioned that we should include the essence of Confucianism in the new subject. This will also be considered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point to note is that we do not want our students to be adversely affected by our new decision. That is why we have decided that Religious Knowledge could be used as a subject to be counted for admission to Junior Colleges and Pre-University Centres until 1994. By so doing, I believe the effects on those students who are alsready in secondary schools now will be minimised.

   <b>TEACHING OF RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE IN SCHOOLS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, first of all, I would like to thank all Members for their very constructive comments and suggestions regarding this very difficult and important subject on the teaching of Religious Knowledge in our schools. I think all of us must feel some regret that we have had to take this new policy direction. It not only means that at the very least, Sir, seven years of very hard work put in by the Ministry of Education will eventually have to be scrapped but not entirely scrapped, because the experience, the knowledge, which we have gained in working out the Religious Knowledge programme will not be wasted. Also, whenever there is a change of educational policy, I realise that it must bring apprehension and concern to children and to their parents. That is why I emphasised in my statement that we have not come to this decision lightly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I announced in March of this year that we were going to review the teaching of RK in our schools. I believe the review was
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> necessary in the light of the circumstances which have changed since 1982. But we have given ample time for all views to be heard. The arrangements which we have made to phase out the teaching of Religious Knowledge in schools are, I believe, fair. They will cause as little disruption to school schedules as possible and I hope that they will cause as little disruption as possible to the education of our children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this has always been the guiding principle in the Ministry of Education. We cannot promise Members, the public and parents, that we will not change educational policies from time to time. It is necessary as times change. But what we can promise is that each change will be considered carefully as this has been done and we will try to make arrangements so that whatever happens, parents and students will not be stranded mid-stream and changes will be implemented with as little disruption to our children's education as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the Members who have spoken today have touched upon the new Civics/Moral Education Programme which is under construction at the Ministry of Education at the present time, and which we hope to introduce by 1992. Members who have touched on this topic and in general include the Member for Ayer Rajah who have suggested that perhaps it could be made a non-examination subject. So have the Members for Braddell Heights, Tiong Bahru GRC, Jalan Besar GRC, Moulmein and Bukit Batok. I thank them for all their suggestions. It is not an easy topic. What we are trying to do is to construct a syllabus which will not only involve Moral Education but also teach the elements of good citizenship, and a particular appreciation of what it means to live in a multi-racial, multi-religious society like Singapore. I cannot say, Sir, that the product which we will come up with in two years' time will satisfy everyone. It cannot be. But we will have a try and we will get the subject ready by 1992 and we will teach it. I hope that all Members will take an interest in this new subject so that after a period of time we will be able to have a Moral Education Programme which is suitable for our type of, multi-racial, multi-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> religious society, which will reflect the aspirations of parents and of Singapore society. I think if we put our hearts to it, if we apply our minds, if we have the will, there is no reason why we cannot succeed, although we may take a bit of time. In that case, Sir, I hope, within next year and in 1991, to inform Members from time to time of the progress of this subject, possibly when we debate the estimates of the Ministry of Education in March each year. It is still in its infancy. So I cannot say very much about it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, on the topic about the inclusion of Religious Knowledge as a subject for junior college and pre-university admission purposes, which was touched on by the Member for Cheng San GRC and the Member for Bedok GRC, I think that, as I tried to stress in my Ministerial Statement, we have to start from a general principle first. Is it right for schools to be used as a major vehicle for the teaching of Religious Knowledge to children? If that principle is not right, then it should not be made a compulsory subject to be taught within curriculum time. As I said, neither in principle should it be included as a subject for junior college and pre-university admission purposes. I think you cannot have it both ways. If that is the principle, then this must follow logically. But what we can do is to ensure that the phasing out of RK as a subject for junior college and for pre-university admission purposes is done in such a way so that it will give children the maximum time to adjust their subject combinations so that they will have the best opportunity to qualify for junior college and pre-university admission purposes. I stressed in my Ministerial Statement, Sir, that we were not unconcerned with this aspect. And if I may be so bold as to correct the Member for Cheng San GRC, I did not say that the impact will be insignificant. I said that while the number will be reduced, the figure showed that the impact should not be too severe. I think this is the case. Our children have shown a great capacity and the schools have shown the ability to advise the children and to prepare them. Now we are going to allow the use of RK as a subject for junior college and pre-university admission up to the year of admission 1994. This means that it will not affect any child who is presently in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> secondary school today. The only children who will be affected will be those who are going into secondary school from next year. Therefore, they will have at least four years for those in the Express Stream and five years for those in the Normal Stream to prepare for this change. We cannot go beyond that. Once we go beyond 1994, we have to make it permanent and I think this would be wrong in principle.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of Members have touched on the very important topic about what would be the result of this new policy change on our mission schools, on the schools set up by the various religious groups. The Members include the Member for Cheng San GRC, the Member for Fengshan, the Member for Potong Pasir. This, Sir, is a very important point. I think we have to recognise that schools which are set up by the various religious groups, whether they are church groups, the Mission Schools or the Buddhist Schools, these schools have their own distinctive identities. I do not think that we would wish all our schools to operate in exactly the same way. Indeed, it is for that very reason that we have encouraged some schools to go independent. It is good for our children that schools should be differentiated, that each school should have its own character. And a mission school is a mission school, a Buddhist school is a Buddhist school, and a Catholic school is different from a Methodist school, a Methodist school is different from a Buddhist school. And if you eliminate all vestiges of that particular religion from that school, then I do not see what you are left with.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, Sir, I think it would be wise of mission schools and schools set up by religious groups to take cognizance of the particular circumstances in which they are located in Singapore and that is within the context of a multi-racial, multi-religious society. Sir, this is not a new subject. We have always been that way. I would like, Sir, in this respect, to advise mission schools to follow the examples which have been set many years ago. When I spoke at the opening of St. Joseph's Institution in April this year, I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> made the point that in fact this particular issue had been addressed by the founder of St Joseph's, a Catholic priest by the name of Father Burel, who issued a prospectus for St. Joseph's in 1848, ie, more than 140 years ago. I think what he said then is still relevant today. In his prospectus, Father Burel made a point, that he recognized that St. Joseph's will be drawing its pupils from a multi-racial community with people of many faces. Therefore, for St. Joseph's, he said, and I quote from his words:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'St Joseph's will be open to everyone, whatever his creed may be; and should, for instance, a boy of a persuasion different from that of Roman Catholics attend it, [that is the school] no interference whatever will take place with his religion, unless his parents or his guardians express their wishes to have him instructed in the Catholic religion. Public religious instructions will be given to Roman Catholic boys either before or after the hours for school; but at all times, the Masters of the school will most carefully watch over the morals of the whole school, whatever their religious persuasion may be.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a statement or principle to guide a mission school or any church school in our multi-racial, multi-religious society, I think it will be difficult to work out a more far-sighted and enlightened policy. So long as our mission schools and our church schools and the schools set up by the various religious groups adhere to this philosophy, which actually was set up 140 years ago, I think we should have no problems. I may say that before deciding on this policy, I had a meeting with various school principals, including principals from some of our mission schools and schools set up by other religious groups. I asked them whether they would have difficulty in implementing this new policy. I can tell Members that all of them said that in fact they would welcome this change of policy. These are people on the ground. They have the job of operating the schools and I am satisfied when they tell me that they can work with this new policy. Indeed, I asked the principal of St. Joseph's what would be his philosophy regarding the teaching of different religions in his school. Sir, his basic philosophy is that as principal of St. Joseph's his job is to look after the education of all his children. "All his children" means all children and the majority of the pupils in his schools are in fact non-Catholic children. To look after
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the education of all his children fully, he must provide for their moral instruction and, where necessary, also for teaching of the various religions within his school. As a result, St. Joseph today, in addition to the teaching of Bible Knowledge, the school also provides within curriculum time, as is the current practice, the teaching of Islamic Religious Knowledge, Buddhist Studies, Hindu Studies and Confucian Ethics. When this new policy comes into palece, he intends to make these subjects also available as optional subjects outside shcool hours.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if all our mission schools and I hope all the schools set up by religious groups will take this approach, I think there is no reason why they cannot thrive as before. I would emphasize, Sir, that I have discussed this with them and they have raised no objection to this change in policy. In fact, they welcome it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, following on that, I want to touch a little bit on the point made by the Members for Cheng San GRC, Aljunied GRC and Bedok GRC concerning the particular position of the members of our minority religions here, particularly the Muslims, the Hindus and the Sikhs. I know, that they will be disappointed with this change in policy. In my dialogues with them, they have expressed their wish very strongly to see the status quo being maintained and, that is, RK to be a compulsory subject to be taught within curriculum time and to be used as a subject for pre-university and junior college admission purposes. It is not possible because in principle we have to change. But the arrangements which we have made, I hope, will enable the pupils of these minority religions to continue the study of their religions but as optional subjects outside curriculum time. I would encourage all the schools to accept this arrangement and the Ministry will provide facilities where necessary, for example, for Islamic Religious Knowledge and the other minority subjects provided there are enough pupils within the school for the subjects to be taught outside curriculum time which is necessary but within the school premises, and we will try to provide the facilities as far as we can for that purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, I also want to refer to the point made by the Member for Fengshan regarding our tertiary institutions and whether we would allow religious groups and societies to operate there. I see no reason why there should be any change. They should continue. They add to the life of the polytechnics, to NUS and to NTI. I think they will conduct themselves in a responsible way. We have had no trouble with them so far and I do not see why this change of policy should in any way curb their activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of Confucian Ethics was brought up by the Members for Jurong, Tampines GRC, Marine Parade GRC, Jalan Besar GRC and the Member for Leng Kee. I also understand the sentiment behind their comments and their reluctance and their regret at having to see Confucian Ethics treated as a subject within the Religious Knowledge programme. But, Sir, it is not possible to allow Confucian Ethics to be taught as a subject within curriculum time without allowing Islamic Religious Knowledge, Buddhist Studies, Bible Knowledge, Sikh Studies and Hindu Studies to be taught within curriculum time at the same time. Whether or not Confucian Ethics is regarded as a religion, you cannot allow one without allowing the others. Once you allow the others you breach the basic principle. But there are many elements of Confucian Ethics which I think are quite universal which would serve well within our society. And there is no reason why in the construction of this new Civics moral education programme we should not take the best of what there is and implement it. I think it will make for a richer programme and this will benefit not only our students but also Singapore society and we will make an attempt to see what we can put within the context of an overall moral education programme. But to teach it specifically as a subject within curriculum time is not possible within the present context.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one point from the Member for Potong Pasir who regretted the change because the teaching of RK was, as he said, a basic institution within our education system. I think this is not the case. In fact, before 1982, it was taught as an optional subject. We have now returned to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> what it was before. The change in 1982 was when we made it a compulsory subject and this is a change which we are now making. It was never a basic institution and we are not uprooting a historical tradition. I do not think, Sir, that the changes which we have made will in any way weaken the ability of those students whose parents would like them to study Religious Knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I wind up, Sir, and pass on to the last point, I would like to thank all Members, as I said, for their comments today. The general tone of the debate I would sense, has been that in principle all Members recognise the necessity for this change. I welcome all the suggestions to modify or to make amendments to the transient arrangements. We welcome all the suggestions and, as I said, unwelcome as this change may be and disappointing to some groups, it is necessary. I would be quite satisfied if at the end of the day people regard it as fair and in the interest of Singapore and of all Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I want to make, Sir, is the point made by three Members of Parliament - the Members for Cheng San GRC, Fengshan and Jalan Besar GRC - concerning the ground-rules for the separation of politics and religion which was mentioned in the President's Address. Sir, this is outside my jurisdiction. Perhaps my colleague, the Minister for Law and Home Affairs, might like to comment on it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much obliged, Sir. [Applause].
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law and Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I reply to the question posed by the Members for Cheng San GRC, Fengshan and Jalan Besar GRC who had asked in the intervention about the proposed ground-rules to ensure that there is no mixing of religion and politics. Sir, the Government's policy on this was clearly stated in the President's Address at the opening of Parliament this year when he said [Hansard, Vol 52, No. 1, col. 18]:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Religious harmony is as important to us as racial harmony. Singapore is a secular state, and the supreme source of political authority is the Constitution.'
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Going down further he said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Religion must be kept rigorously separate from politics. Religious groups must not get themselves involved in the political process. Conversely, no group can be allowed to exploit religious issues or manipulate religious organizations, whether to excite disaffection or to win political support. It does not matter if the purpose of these actions is to achieve religious ideals or to promote secular objectives. In a multi-religious society, if one group violates this taboo, others will follow suit, and the outcome will be militancy and conflict.' The President said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We will spell out these ground-rules clearly and unequivocally. All political and religious groups must understand these ground-rules, and abide by them scrupulously. If we violate them, even with the best intentions, our political stability will be imperilled.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has decided to introduce legislation to give effect to these ground-rules. I expect the Bill to be ready for introduction at the next sitting of Parliament. The Government takes a serious view of religious leaders who stray beyond the confines of religious activities or who exploit and manipulate religious organisations. If one religious group involves itself in political issues, others must follow suit to protect their own positions and one wants to outdo the other to retain its flock. Political parties will also look for religious groups to back them up. This will lead to collision with the Government and also between different religious groups. The outcome will surely be conflict and political instability . It is extremely important therefore that priests and other religious leaders or groups never mix religion with politics or mount political campaigns.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact, however, is that there have been several religious leaders, Christians, Muslims and others, including some foreigners, doing precisely this. They do not hesitate to use their religious appointments or the premises of their institutions for mounting political agitation or making inflammatory or political speeches.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speech in August 1987 described several instances, including an Indian Muslim foreign preacher who urged Muslims in Singapore to be more militant. He accused them of being complacent, of having failed to convert Chinese to Islam, with the result that the Chinese had taken over power in Singapore. He had also passed disparaging remarks about Christianity saying that it was a foolish religion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a more recent example. A few months ago, in May this year, one Christian priest speaking to his congregation on the second anniversary of the arrest under the ISA asked for prayers for the detainees and went on to declare that the Minister for Home Affairs, Jayakumar, all Judges and ISD officers would face God's punishment for this matter. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a Hindu, not a Christian, therefore I am not frightened by Christian priests pronouncing an anathema or curse upon me instead of a benediction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever our religion and however different our religions may be, it is a matter of grave concern that in Singapore any priest or religious leader, whatever his religious faith, should use his religious authority to work up feelings against Judges, Ministers and officials and to invoke the divine power of damnation upon secular authorities. Such activities in the name of religion will do great harm to our society which is established on a secular basis precisely because Singaporeans belong to varied and strongly-held religious faiths.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation which I expect to be introduced at the next sitting will be designed to deal with such mixing of religion with politics and also to deal with those who cause disharmony and ill-will between different religions. And when the Bill is introduced, it will be Government's intention to refer it to a Select Committee so that all individuals and groups who have an interest in the matter and views to express can make known their views.

  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Harmful effects of smoking</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the pattern of illness in Singapore is dominated by smoking related diseases such as lung cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic bronchitis. Together they account for about 30% of all deaths in Singapore. Scientific evidence has shown that cigarettes are linked to at
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> least 85% of all deaths from lung cancer, 75% of deaths from chronic bronchitis and 25% of coronary heart disease cases. Last year, cigarette smoking was largely responsible for the deaths of about 2,600 Singaporeans. This works out to about seven deaths a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Smoking Control Programme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures to control smoking were first introduced in 1970, when legislation was introduced to restrict tobacco advertisement, together with programmes to educate the public on the harmful effects of smoking. In view of the increasing pool of evidence on the health hazards related to smoking, my Ministry launched a coordinated, intensified national smoking control programme in December 1986, with the aim of promoting non-smoking as a norm in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this objective, we must discourage and prevent the young from taking up smoking, while encouraging and helping existing smokers to give up this harmful habit. My Ministry is striving to achieve this through our public health education programme through the mass media, through talks and exhibitions to members of the public, especially school children, national servicemen and young workers, and through personal counselling by doctors and nurses. The legal requirement to have rotating health warnings prominently displayed on cigarette packs will also serve to remind smokers of the risks that they are taking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will take time to achieve the objective of non-smoking as a national norm. In the meantime, we need to continue to safeguard non-smokers from the harmful effects of cigarette smoke. Non-smokers have a right to smoke-free air. The Ministry of the Environment has therefore recently expanded the restrictions on smoking in various public places.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Smoking among young</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How have we fared in our efforts so far? Our health education and other smoking control programmes have definitely made
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> an impact. The prevalence of smoking has fallen from 23% in 1977 to 19% in 1984, and has levelled off at 13.5% in 1987 and 1988.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our latest survey showed that whilst an encouraging 25% of smokers were convinced that they should give up smoking because of the harmful effects, a significant number of the young are still tempted to experiment with smoking and eventually they become addicted to it. This is because our health messages to the young are being nullified by cigarette advertisements and various promotional gimmicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Inadequacy of present legislation</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the tobacco industry has increasingly used the exemptions provided in the existing legislation to extensively promote their products. These include the distribution of souvenirs and subtle advertising by means of posters at retail outlets. These posters associate smoking with sophisticated young men and attractive women engaged in sporty or glamorous activities. Such cigarette promotion efforts if allowed to continue will undermine our efforts to discourage smoking.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Purpose of Amendment Bill</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is therefore to tighten the existing legislation on the prohibition of advertisements related to smoking. The Bill seeks to make the provisions more explicit and comprehensive and widen further the prohibitions concerning all forms of promotion of smoking. This is part of our multi-pronged approach to the problem of smoking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with the major provisions of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Provisions in the Amendment Bill</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Prohibitions on advertisements and sales promotions</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to prohibit the following:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) advertisements which mention or depict the brand name or trademark of tobacco products on any notices, vehicles, souvenirs, mementos and gifts;
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) sale of any product with a tobacco product as a free gift and vice versa;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) sale of tobacco products packaged together with any other products;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) distribution of free samples of tobacco products to persons other than those in the tobacco trade; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) giving of tobacco products as prizes in any lottery, draw, game or competition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Certain advertisements allowed</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry recognises that some tobacco companies are also involved in services and products unrelated to tobacco products. Section 3(2) allows bona fide advertisements by such companies to be considered and allowed on a case-by-case basis. It also allows the Minister to approve certain advertisements which mention the name of the tobacco manufacturer or distributor as a sponsor of an event or in congratulatory messages.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Owners or occupiers of premises</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes it an offence under section 3B for owners or occupiers to permit their premises to be used for the display and publication of smoking advertisements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for committing this offence the first time is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or six months' imprisonment or both. For subsequent offences, the penalty is a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than one year or both.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Rebuttal presumption</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, posters and other cigarette advertisements are often displayed on hoardings at construction sites and other locations. Smoking advertisement leaflets have also been dropped in letter boxes. It is not possible for the authorities to physically apprehend the culprits who are involved in putting up such posters or dropping such leaflets. Section 3C of the Bill provides that if more than 10 copies of such smoking advertisements are found in the possession or premise of a tobacco manufacturer, distributor or retailer, he is presumed to have
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> knowingly taken part in the publication of these advertisements unless he can prove to the contrary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Penalty</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for all offences committed, except that under section 3B, is a fine of not more than $10,000 or six months' imprisonment or both for the first offence. For subsequent offences, the penalty is a fine of not more than $20,000 or imprisonment of not more than one year or both. The increase in the fines is necessary in order for them to have an adequate deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also allows minor offences to be compounded with fines not exceeding $1,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendments will allow us to curtail cigarette advertisement and promotion, thereby preventing the tobacco industry and retailers from directly or indirectly promoting the sale of their products to the general public. This will help to further reduce the number of smokers in the future, thereby contributing to the better health of all Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wan Soon Bee (Pasir Panjang GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my fullest support to this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the impact of smoking on health is not a mystery to any of us. Time after time, research has shown that many health hazards are directly linked to habitual smoking. This addictive habit is a major contributory factor to some of the deadliest diseases known to man.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, an often fatal and extremely painful disease. Statistics from the Ministry of Health show that 80% to 90% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to smoking. This is frightening indeed. But what is less well known is that smoking causes other forms of cancer as well. For example, cancer of the oesophagus, cancer of the bladder, mouth, throat, pancreas, kidneys and cervix. In short, smoking is an important causal factor associated with most forms of cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking is also notorious for its role in cardio-vascular diseases. People who smoke are three to four times more likely to develop heart attacks as compared to non-smokers. Four out of 10 deaths caused by heart attacks are attributable to smoking, as well as half of all stroke cases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, 2.5 million people around the world die from diseases related to smoking. What is amazing is that in spite of these morbid statistics, there are still so many people who continue to smoke.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the worst thing about smoking is that it not only hurts those who have consciously chosen to smoke, it also harms those who by no choice of their own are forced to continually inhale polluted air filled with cigarette smoke. For too long this is the problem faced by the passive smoker. The smoker not only puts himself at risk, he is also putting his spouse, children, friends and colleagues at peril. Even unborn children are not spared.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs associated with smoking are too high for us, as a responsible Government, to ignore. Every year, many of our fellow countrymen are dying tragically and painfully because of this addiction-forming habit. Their families and friends share in this traumatic experience, all the more so when the victim is at the prime of his life. In addition to this pain and suffering, there is the economic cost of smoking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally accepted that smokers are less healthy and fit as compared to non-smokers and are thus prone to infections like colds and flus. This causes a higher rate of absenteeism among smoking workers, leading to thousands and thousands of lost man-hours every year. Their overall lack of fitness also means that they are not as productive as they could have been. Add to this, the economically active workers who die from heart disease, cancer, etc. are all citizens who would otherwise have contributed to our nation. Then there is the financial burden associated with hospital and medical expenses. The irony is that people actually spend money every day for years to do harm to themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is not easy for us to convince those who are already hooked on the habit
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to give it up. But we must at least try to prevent those who have not started from doing so. We must actively discourage smoking by making our population aware of the risks inherent in smoking and by disallowing any form of advertising which might encourage smoking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us have been subjected to subtle persuasiveness of advertising. Advertisements are very effective, especially in this technological age, in creating markets for its products. The young are especially vulnerable to the impact of advertising. One has only to follow the fads of the young to see how easily they are swayed by advertising. This was the main reason behind the enactment of the Smoking (Prohibition on Advertising) Act of 1970. It was not so much aimed at reducing smoking amongst those who were already smokers but to try and eliminate the persuasive impact that smoking advertisements had. The aim was to protect our population, especially the young from the constant bombardment of cigarette advertisements that invariably glorified smoking. These would inevitably arouse the curiosity of people to try out smoking. A recent survey among school students aged 9 to 20 years old showed that 20% of the boys had experimented with smoking. 36% of them became regular smokers. This shows how dangerous experimenting with smoking can be. The urge to experiment must surely be greater when one is constantly being told in advertisements that smoking is refreshing and is associated with success and prestige.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the 1970 Act has achieved its objective to a great extent. It has successfully eliminated most forms of cigarette advertising in Singapore. However, its effectiveness has been reduced by certain loopholes which allow the tobacco companies to circumvent the 1970 Act. Some of the examples are giving away free samples of tobacco products, giving away cigarettes as prizes in competitions, a common practice at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Amendment Bill also seeks to increase the effectiveness by providing for stiffer penalties. I believe these stiffer penalties are a more realistic deterrent and hopefully would persuade would-be offenders to think twice. I hope
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that this Bill will be able to achieve its intended objective.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of the no-smoking law in public places from 1st November is a step in the right direction. It may appear harsh, but I think it is necessary in order to safeguard the health of many non-smokers who for years have had to put up with smoky environments in many public places. The effectiveness of the ban, however, cannot be maximised unless non-smokers learn to assert their right to breathe unpolluted air. It is time that non-smokers stood up for their rights.

  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, I have only a few points to add to what the Member for Pasir Panjang has just said.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill for the obvious reason that we must do everything we can to try to reduce further the proportion of smokers among our population. One way is by curbing advertisements. I particularly welcome the provision banning the giving away of free samples of cigarettes. In our daily activities, we come across distributors giving away free cigarettes at balls, dinners and dance functions, etc. They could be very tempting for people to light up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally, however, feel that by banning advertisements in Singapore, probably our efforts may be nullified by the fact that our population is still exposed to advertisements in foreign publications and TV channels from neighbouring countries. So I would urge the Ministry to concentrate further on public education to target our campaigns at the young. I find it particularly disturbing to see very young children starting to smoke. Peer pressure is one important reason why they do that. How can we counter that? I think the Ministry should come up with some very innovative strategies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our goal to achieve or to shape a smoke-free nation, we have to be a little realistic. In every country, in every society, there is bound to be a small proportion of adults who cannot give up. And so long as they do not smoke in the presence of others, thus harming others' health, I think they should be left to decide pretty much
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> on their own whether or not to quit, now that they know that it is harmful.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the extension of the ban on smoking in public places is now being mooted and will be in force very soon, I would also like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister two questions. First, what is the reason for not extending this ban to private offices? People who work in offices where people smoke will be inhaling this polluted air for eight hours of the day.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in extending or enforcing this ban in public entertainment areas, I think we need to have some consideration for tourists and people who have to do entertaining of foreign clients in certain places, eg, restaurants in hotels, hotel lobbies and such like. I do not know whether the Ministry has already conducted some dialogue sessions with people who own these establishments and see whether some way can be devised to accommodate the tourists. These establishments can be required to install separate ventilation systems or improve upon the present ventilation systems so that smoking and non-smoking areas will not get mixed up in the air circulation. I hope we can find some way of accommodating this kind of business clientele. After all, our campaign should be aimed at Singaporeans. We cannot hope to convert four million tourists every year who pass through Singapore to become non-smokers over night.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think smoking is a bad habit. There is no doubt about that. The Minister has quoted statistics to prove that there is a correlation between bad health and smoking, in particular to the disease of lung cancer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present amendment is certainly a step in the right direction. Everything that could be done must be done to protect the health of the citizens. But like Dr Aline Wong, I think this is still not enough. There must be a lot of public education, especially among the young citizens. If we look at the statistics, you will find that the consumption of tobacco and cigarettes is increasing every year, something like five times from 1978 to 1988. So if the statistics
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are any indication, cigarette and tobacco consumption will still continue to rise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these smokers pick up this bad habit when they are young. I have heard that many of our youngsters learn to smoke when they are doing their national service. I wonder whether the Ministry is aware of this and whether the situation is true. If it is true, then the Ministry of Defence must certainly do something to correct this situation. I think an intensive campaign must be launched amongst our young national servicemen to show that it is not necessary to smoke to portray an image of toughness or ruggedness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to bring up is with regard to section 3(2). It would appear that the Minister can give certain approvals to cigarette manufacturers to advertise if they sponsor certain events. I wonder whether it is morally right. On the one hand, you discourage or curb the cigarette manufacturers from making profit and on the other hand, you accept their money for charity. This is surely a contradiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> Sir, our anti-smoking programme has been effective. As the Minister has said, today we have one of the lowest percentage of smokers in the world. This success is attributed to the efforts of the Government as well as Singaporeans at large. I support the objective of this Bill, ie,to further curb cigarette advertisements which promote and encourage smoking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that clause 6 of the Bill provides for exemptions to advertisements relating to smoking contained in the newspaper, which is published or printed outside Singapore and is brought into Singapore for sale or distribution. If one looks around us today in Singapore, Sir, whether in the office, in the public library, in bookshops or at home, the number of foreign newspapers or publications is not insignificant. A good number of these publications still carries cigarette advertisements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not advocating that we ban the circulation of these foreign publications or newspapers. While we are trying to pro-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> mote a healthy society, we should not inadvertently cut ourselves from the rest of the world by restricting the free flow of news and information. I think there must be a trade off.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is whether the Ministry has assessed the impact of these cigarette advertisements in foreign newspapers and publications on the Ministry's anti-smoking effort and programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Workers' Party I support the Bill in principle. Today, there is no longer any doubt that cigarette-smoking is a most harmful social habit. It causes ill-health to the smoker in many ways. It is a major cause of chronic lung disease, coronary heart disease, stomach ulcer, cancer and premature deaths.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also harms other people in the vicinity. In the house, the health of the whole family, including the children and babies, and even the unborn child, can be badly affected by the "side-stream" smoke and passive-smoking, ie, forced inhalation of polluted air caused by uncaring smokers. In public enclosed places, it harms even more people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigarette smoking also contributes to economic losses, both to the individual and to the nation, as a result of chronic illnesses and loss of productivity, to say nothing of accidental fires which cause loss of property and even lives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigarette smoking may relieve tension in some smokers. But it really benefits only the tobacco industry and its advertisers, and paradoxically the Government. To maximize sales of cigarettes and profits, the tobacco companies frequently embark on promotion exercises and spend huge sums on advertisements in order to induce and entrap impressional adolescents into trying the first puff. Advertising themes are subtle. They are usually associated with high society, economic and professional successes, romance, popular games and exercises.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1971, Government has taken some small steps to discourage smoking in public places. But though the number of smokers in Singapore has dropped since
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 1984, these steps have nevertheless not been able to prevent many of our young men and women from getting hooked onto cigarette-smoking. This may be because of peer pressure, so-called "colour-OK", family influence, ignorance of the harmful effects of cigarette-smoking, and so on. But the influence of tobacco-promotion advertisements is certainly most important.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill will go only some way to help protect our impressionable young men and women from subtle cigarette-smoking promotion advertisements. Many of such cigarette-smoking promotion advertisements still come through in popular foreign magazines and other publications. And lest we forget, also from TV and radio of surrounding countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemptions in clause 3(2) and in Clause 6 of the Bill offer exemptions which big cigarette-smoking promotion advertisers will certainly make use of to circumvent the whole exercise of prohibition. It can be anticipated that more cigarette-smoking promotion advertisements will appear in channels permitted in the exemptions. And since many foreign publications and TV shows enjoy popularity among Singaporeans, it would mean that the whole purpose of the Bill is almost negated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if Government intends to cut off harmful cigarette promotions from our people, it should seriously consider plugging these exemption loopholes. One way is to censor or blackout in some way all the cigarette promotion advertisements in foreign publications that come into Singapore. The other way is to get SBC to put up Cantonese serials in Singapore to counter the Cantonese serials from foreign countries. But is the Government serious about prohibition of cigarette-smoking advertisements? I believe this is a big question mark.
  <br>5.00 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today cigarette smoking is on the downward trend in the United States and the United Kingdom. But it is spreading in the developing countries in the Third World and this problem seems to be getting more and more serious. Cigarettes sold in the developing countries contain more nicotine and other noxious ingredients
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> than the cigarettes sold in the United States and the United Kingdom. But the Government has not done much to stop the imports of such noxious cigarettes. We should prohibit and ban the import of cigarettes which contain too high a noxious ingredient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, the United States Surgeon-General reported that "cigarette-smoking is clearly identified as the chief preventable cause of death in our society and the most important public health issue of our time." In Singapore, the Government has emphasised the importance of public health and the prevention of diseases. Our Health Education Department has done a good job. And now, they have announced the extension of the smoking ban to public access areas. Although unwelcome to smokers, this will certainly help to protect the health of many non-smokers who constitute more than 80% of our people. This is to be applauded. But all this may not be enough, as some Members of Parliament have mentioned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing, in my opinion, that the Government should do is to cut down or reduce the social tension in our free-enterprise system which has caused many people to take up smoking. It is precisely because of this social tension in our society that cause many people to smoke. Of course this would entail a good deal of reforms and even changes of policies, and it would take a long time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, many people believe that the Government should do more than mere prohibition of cigarette advertisements. They regard cigarette-smoking as an addiction which, in many ways, is no different from other types of drug addictions. If Government could take such strong action against the usage and trafficking of drugs like heroin, opium and others, and is even preparing legislation to impose the death penalty for offences connected with opium, cocaine and ganja, etc., then for the good of all the people, the Government should impose an immediate ban on the imports of all cigarettes containing nicotine above a certain amount, followed by a step-by-step imposition of cuts in imports of all cigarettes into Singapore. This would certainly improve the general health of the whole population
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and go a long way to protect our young men and women from taking up the cigarette-smoking habit. This would also reduce to a minimum the pool of Singaporean cigarette-smokers who cannot give up the habit. Of course, the Government's loss in revenue would be more than fully compensated for by the improved health of the whole population and the generally increased productivity of our people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, Mr Speaker, Sir: would the Government be prepared and willing to accept my proposal, first, to impose a ban on imports of the more noxious high-nicotine content cigarettes, followed then by a step-by-step ban on the imports of all cigarettes? Or does the Government want to shirk its responsibility in the matter and do nothing in this direction by hiding under the excuse of free enterprise and free market?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will respond to what I have said.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, first, I would like to thank all the hon. Members who have spoken up to fully support the amendments to the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan Soon Bee, Member for Pasir Panjang GRC, has given a very accurate and thorough description of implications and consequences of smoking. Smoking has implications not just for the smoker himself but for the family, the friends, the people around him and definitely has a tremendous impact on the economy. That is why we are having such a strong programme to reduce the rate of smoking. Several Members, including Mr Chiam and Dr Lee Siew-Choh, have asked about whether the smoking rate has gone up. The rate of smoking has gone down significantly. The import of tobacco may not have gone down, but that is partly due to the fact that much of the cigarettes are bought by the tourists as well. Therefore, with the tremendous increase in tourist arrivals the sale of cigarettes would have gone up significantly at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point is whether the rate of smoking amongst our citizens has gone down and that rate has gone down very,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> very significantly. I quoted the figure just now - 23% in 1977, today 13(r)%. The rate of smoking today in Singapore is probably amongst the lowest in the world, if not the lowest. It is far lower than in any of the other developed countries. Although, as Dr Lee said, the rate of smoking in the developed countries has gone down, they are still a long way from where we are today and the smoking rate is still in the range of 30-odd per cent in many of these countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Aline Wong is correct in saying that the advertisements in Singapore cannot be shut out completely because we have such an open economy. The same concern has been expressed by Mr Chew Heng Ching. Sir, our concern is to make sure that we minimise the access to advertisements in Singapore. For advertisements that come in through the air waves from radio stations, from TV stations in the neighbouring countries, there is nothing we can do about them. As regards imported publications, at the present moment the imported publications are sold largely to subscribers. So in terms of readership it is quite limited. But we will definitely be looking into what we can do to reduce their impact.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the impact on tourists from our various programmes, the aim is not to convert tourists who are smokers to non-smokers. That is not our job. But our job is to make sure that the cigarette smoke of our tourists and local smokers does not have the opportunity to impact drastically on our local non-smokers. Therefore, air-conditioned restaurants where the smoke is being re-circulated have been placed under the extended restriction which will be effective on 1st November 1989 by the Ministry of the Environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it is possible for such restaurants to be exempted if they have a separate ventilation system, I will convey the suggestion to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to offices, the restriction on smoking in public areas is meant to cover places that are frequented by members of the public. These people go there for various businesses. But for the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> management and staff of offices, I think they have the ability to restrict smoking in their own areas if they want to. This is a choice which at the present moment we are quite happy to leave it to them. If the office staff feel that their colleagues who are smoking are irritating them, then they should speak up and work out with the management of their offices on how to minimise the number of people who are smoking there or to give them certain opportunities to smoke in their own little office, for example. But that is something we should leave to the private sector to work out on their own.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam made some statements about national servicemen picking up smoking while they are serving national service. If I recall, Mindef is quite aware of our national priorities to minimise the rate of smoking amongst young people and Mindef has taken a very active role in working with the Ministry on this programme. They have also cooperated in terms of educating the national servicemen on the dangers of smoking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to section 3 (2), Mr Chiam has stated that there is a contradiction in accepting the contributions to charity of tobacco companies whilst we are discouraging them from advertising. Sir, we never turn down any contributions to charity from any company as long as they do not use that contribution to further their aims. There is nothing wrong with that. If they are prepared to sponsor a big event and not use that sponsorship to promote their products, I think there is nothing that should prevent us from accepting their contributions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Siew-Choh has come out with a whole array of points, many of which have only a peripheral relevance to smoking. He stated that people smoke because of the social pressures. Sir, there are many ways for people to defuse the tensions from pressures which are either induced by work or by other factors. Smoking may not be one of them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main approach that we must take towards smoking is one of education. Control of advertisement is part of the multi-pronged approach that we are taking. But the main approach at the end of the day
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> must be our public health education programme. Singaporeans are intelligent people and that is why as a result of the public health education programme, the prevalence of smoking has gone down so significantly in the last 12-15 years. We will continue to intensify our education programmes. We will continue to review ways to make it more effective, review ways for us to reach out more effectively to various sectors of the population. One of the key sectors that we are concentrating on is, of course, the younger people. Because if we can educate and discourage them from taking up smoking, then they will never become smokers. And that is the only way to go if we are trying to achieve our aim of making non-smoking a norm in Singapore. With that as an objective, we will be investigating, reviewing, and looking for new ways to pass on the message to our people of why they should not be smoking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also talked about the dumping of cigarettes with high nicotine and high tar content on Third World countries, and he stated that the Singapore Government had done nothing about this. Sir, he is wrong. Earlier in the year, we have already informed the tobacco companies that we are implementing limits to the nicotine and tar content of the cigarettes which they can import into Singapore. The limits that we have imposed are about the lowest in the world and that has made the cigarette companies quite unhappy. The ban on the import of cigarettes above those limits will come into being at the end of this year. We have given them enough lead time to prepare and to make sure that the cigarettes that meet our specifications are available.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it is possible to ban all imports of cigarettes, this is a step that is not feasible at all. Cigarettes are unlike heroin or cocaine. Those are addictive drugs which have a tremendous impact on not just the takers but our society, because they inevitably lead to crime and other problems. But through our education programme, we will try to reduce the number of smokers and thereby as the numbers, shrink, the peer pressure and the public pressure on them will, in the end, result in our being able to achieve the norm of non-smoking in Singapore. At the end of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> day, there will still be a few people who are die-hards and who will still smoke for various reasons. We cannot stop them, but we can make it very difficult for them to harm other people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].

  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade> *The motion reads as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 113), approves the reclamation by Government of the foreshore and seabed at Telok Ayer Basin and Marina Bay containing an area of about 38 hectares as shown coloured pink on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 4/89" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 23rd October 1981, this House approved the reclamation of about 21.7 hectares of the foreshore and seabed off the Town of Singapore to provide valuable land linking Marina South with the financial belt of Shenton Way and the Golden Shoe Area. However, that reclamation plan was not proceeded with mainly because the master plans drawn up by the two design consultants involved further reclamation and there was no immediate urgency then to adopt either of the plans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of several major development projects in the Downtown core, for example, the Ocean Building extension, the Republic Plaza at Raffles Place, the Downtown core, particularly the prime commercial areas of Shenton Way and Raffles Place will eventually be fully
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> built up. We, therefore, need to start planning for the expansion of the City. Besides, the various development projects, which include recreational and food developments, a golf driving range and Marina City Park will be fully completed in Marina South by the end of the year. Accessibility to these development projects and traffic circulation in the area will have to be improved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will know that recently, the details of the project to create a new downtown were announced by the Senior Minister of State for National Development and Home Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, the Ministry of National Development proposes to proceed with the reclamation of about 36.2 hectares of the foreshore and seabed off Marina South to allow for the gradual extension of our city core around the Marina Bay and about 1.80 hectares near the Merlion to accommodate a pedestrian mall as part of the waterfront promenade linking Tanjong Rhu to Marina South and the Singapore River.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board will undertake the reclamation as agent of the Government. Works on the reclamation, estimated to cost $177.7 million, will commence in the third quarter of 1990 and will be completed in three years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 113), approves the reclamation by Government of the foreshore and seabed at Telok Ayer Basin and Marina Bay containing an area of about 38 hectares as shown coloured pink on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 4/89" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.
