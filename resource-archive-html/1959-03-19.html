<div align="center"><b>INVESTIGATION INTO LEAKAGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF SECRET INCOME TAX</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INFORMATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Commission of Inquiry)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question (18th

March, 1959),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, in view of the leakage of secret income-tax

information as evidenced in the Assembly debate on  the

4th of March, 1959, and in view of the resulting public

anxiety  regarding  the safety of  all  the  secret  or

confidential  information  about  the  general   public

entrusted  to the Income Tax Department, this  Assembly

is  of  the opinion that a Commission of Inquiry should

be  appointed  to investigate into and  report  on  the

circumstances in which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2259</b></font><br><br>



particulars of file No. 47909/GS of the Income Tax

Department became available to a person not entitled

thereto.-(Mr Lee Choon Eng).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>10.02 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday we condemned those who were responsible for

the leakage. I know that all hon. Members in this House

as well as all right-thinking people of Singapore will

join us in such condemnation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I certainly feel, Sir, that we do not only

deplore such a class of people but also the other side

of those who are involved. I am referring to those who

have urged or who have been using such officials to

make them divulge such secret information. Those who

corrupt the civil servants are also guilty of that

offence. Between the two, those who have bribed or have

attempted to corrupt these people should deserve

greater punishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many laws in Singapore concerning this. I

know that if a person should bribe a police constable

and if that matter is reported, then that person too

will be punished by the law. I feel that, as this

matter is of such grave consequence, those who are

involved should also be punished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information before us is that the hon. Member for

Tanjong Pagar has come forward with such information.

Where has he got the news? Who has been instrumental in

getting that news? Who has been edging on the civil

servants to be disloyal to the Government which they

serve?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it from higher officials who have had access to

the files, or was it, as alleged by the hon. Mr

Thomas, by way of bringing files in and out and

somebody who was responsible or who has had access to

the files having a look at it



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas (Nominated)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Point of explanation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I want to say that I did not allege

anything  yesterday  (that  I  recollect)  at  all.   I

described  various possibilities but I did  not  allege

how  the  particular leakage of the information  coming

out  from the Income Tax Department came about.  I  did

not allege any particular method by which it got out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am grateful for his

explanation, Sir. But whatever it is, this  concerns  a

matter  which, we would say, is top secret. The  people

who  have access to such files are few. People who have

influence over such files are fewer still. We would say

that,  in  all probability, it might be those who  have

always  been passing information from one side  to  the

other - from  the  Government side to the Opposition,  or

from  one party to the other. That may be so. I am also

just  suggesting a method whereby it may be leaked out.

If  such  were  so, it should be fully investigated.  I

personally have a very low opinion of those who indulge

in  such  operations, if such men have no honour,  they

should be better out of the political field or even out

of our own country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have men who say that their whole life is devoted

towards promoting the welfare of Singapore. Now we have

information that there are quite a number of people who

are not. We demand complete loyalty even from those who

come  to live with us and want to become citizens.  Who

wants  to  set examples to them? We want to  make  them

feel   that  they  are  following  leaders   who   have

integrity,  and  who are going to make them  feel  that

they  are  living with leaders in whom  they  can  have

faith and to whom they can even close their eyes and be

led  along.  But  if we have leaders  who  force  civil

servants  who  have  all the time  been  loyal,  to  be

disloyal,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>



who  have all the time been cheating on procedures when

secrecy  is essential, then such men. I would say,  are

the very scum of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Sir, that the Commission of Inquiry, when

it inquires into this matter, should have this question

foremost in their minds, to establish the identities of

those  who  have  made  possible the  leakage  of  such

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point, Sir, that I would like to mention is

that, on this side of the House, we want an inquiry. On

the  Opposition side, we have one Member  who  did  not

want  the  inquiry to carry on. Similarly, Sir,  during

the  sitting early this month-the 4th of March -we also

had  the  Opposition Party, the People's Action  Party,

taking  a  similar stand of wanting to have an  inquiry

and  then  wanting to drop it. If a matter is  of  such

importance  that  a  Commission of  Inquiry  should  be

called upon, then that inquiry should carry on.  We  do

not want just to indulge in speculation. We do not want

to  establish any allegation where possibly there is no

truth. In an instance like this, Sir, we know that  the

matter  is wrong. It must be investigated and  we  must

get  to the bottom of it. Similarly. Sir, in the  other

inquiry  we know that it would be wrong not  to  pursue

it,  because there could be innocent parties who  would

be  involved  and who would be blamed in this  Assembly

where  there is privilege; but if they have an inquiry,

they may prove their innocence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring up this point, Sir, because I feel in the

other  inquiry, too, allegations have been made  as  to

how  the  funds came about. But I would say, Sir,  like

the Member for Tanjong Pagar, that there is no crime in

receiving  any  political gift. What  he  is  concerned

about  is  whether  the  funds came  from  any  foreign

sources.  I  am certain that even if there was  such  a

gift,  and  even if people did help the  former  Labour

Front-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member was

correct  up to the point where he mentioned the  former

inquiry or the former motion in passing. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>



he  seems to be developing his argument on those  lines

and,  of  course, he is going very, very far from  this

present motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am grateful for your guidance,

Sir, I was saying that the difference between those two

cases is that we want to get at the truth. I have faith

in all inquiries. In passing also. Sir, I would like to

mention  the  inquiry that looked into  the  matter  of

corrupt  practices,  involving  the  political  figures

during  the Cairnhill by-election. There, we find  that

the  inquiry  gave us a picture that  it  was  not  the

accused  that was right. Neither the accused was  right

nor  those who were accused were right, in fact,  there

was  blame  apportioned to so many people. Some  people

may  take  it that, after a court of inquiry, when  the

findings are not in their favour, that court of inquiry

is  not  good.  But I am of the opinion  that  when  we

appoint  a  court  of inquiry we must  abide  by  their

findings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain, Sir, that this court of inquiry when

appointed  will  reveal many other  things  of  greater

interest  to the people of Singapore. It will also  expose a great deal of intrigue and false allegations  in

one  case,  and probably reveal the true  substance  of

what we want to find in other cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this leakage I feel is not just a leakage. I

think  it  is also a system of spying amongst your  own

friends,  amongst your own people. If this system  were

allowed to carry on and be fostered, there would  be  a

time  when we should not be able to speak to our  next-door neighbour nor even to our children. There would be

no secret whatsoever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had instances of this in Singapore most

recently.  The rot is slowly setting in. We  must  stop

the  rot.  Cure it, or throw it out of Singapore  as  a

method alien to this land, as a method that will create

a lot of mistrust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, Sir, in Singapore instances of people using

their  political influence and asking their drivers  to

go against their employers when the employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>



probably  have  not  even a single complaint.  We  have

again, Sir, in unions, where spying is going on, giving

information  to parties or political parties  that  are

not  in  their  favour or the unions, and  where  union

officials  get  into great trouble with  the  political

power in the City Council. We have much more than that.

The  rot does not just end there. We have, even in  the

major  political  parties in Singapore,  officials  who

impart information to Opposition members, telling  them

their  inner secrets and giving them all the ammunition

to shoot at the party they lead!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, Sir, demands absolute loyalty of its

citizens to the state. Anybody who is not loyal to this

land  should  go to lands where their loyalty  belongs.

But  he  should not clothe himself in sheep's clothing,

and  come and mingle with us to destroy us. This motion

has  arisen from the allegations made by the leader  of

the  People's Action Party. They have much explanations

to  offer to the people of Singapore. They have much to

let us know who those involved were. We do not want the

people of Singapore just to stop thinking at the income

tax  level of the inquiry. We want them to think  of

their own lives, of the lives in the community, of  the

friends they have, of the children they have. Are  they

going to have that spying system coming to Singapore to

destroy them? I am certain the people of Singapore will

take  this matter seriously. They must retain here what

they  have today and not go back to the time of Syonanto, as Singapore was called during the occupation, when

they were afraid. You were ruled by fear. You just  did

not  know  when  the  Kempeitai, the Japanese  Military

Police,  would  take  you away  from  your  home,  just

because you inadvertently said something unpleasant  to

the ruling power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Sir, that it is time the people of Singapore

should  wake  up  to  eradicate those  who  are  always

instigating  men  against men, race against  race,  and

doing a great disservice to this country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inquiry must go on. The truth must be got

at.  Whether  the truth is pleasant or unpleasant,  let

those  who  are  responsible for all  these  things  be

punished most suitably.



<br><br>10.18 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, it is

surprising that a Member from the Government back bench

is  bringing  up the motion. In my opinion,  it  is  to

censure the Government. Information was leaked out from

the Income Tax Department and the Minister in charge is

a  Government  Minister - the  Financial  Secretary.  The

Financial  Secretary should take the  necessary  action

for the leakage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when you bring in a motion, that automatically

means  you  are  censuring the Financial Secretary  and

subsequently the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will support this motion. It is not because of

the  calling for an inquiry. It is firstly, because  it

is censuring the Financial Secretary and the Government

for  their incompetence and bungling. Secondly, for the

leakage  of  information. It is admitted that  a  civil

servant  has  leaked  out certain  information  and  he

should  be  punished. I agree, but let us evaluate  the

information  against the crime he  has  committed.  The

information  released was that our former Minister  for

Education had received $500,000 from some source. Well,

to receive $500,000, he must have sold some information

or  render some service to foreign people, otherwise no

fool is going to give him $500,000 for nothing. He must

have  made  a promise to give certain service  to  that

foreign force. But what is the service? Service against

the interests of the population of Singapore. So it  is

a  question of selling the service of 1,500,000  people

and  receiving $500,000 by an individual - one  Minister.

So when you count the Civil -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just wondering whether the hon.

Member  is  anticipating the findings of the Commission

of  Inquiry  that is to be set up. Because  if  he  is.

perhaps he is straying away from the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, before I started talking I had

submitted  that  it was an allegation. As  this  motion

involves  a  leakage and what was the  content  of  the

leakage, I was forced to say something about that. If I

had anything to do with the Government who are going to

be  responsible to the Commission for the  findings  or

the  judgment, I would rather commend the man  who  had

leaked  out  that  information  than  reprimand  him  .

Because  through  that  information,  the  citizens  of

Singapore  had  gained certain information  that  their

interests  were  to be sold for a few hundred  thousand

dollars,  by  a  Minister, and it is the  Minister  for

Education and the Minister responsible for leakages-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Sir, in the Member's speech he says it was

as a Minister that the sum was received. I do not think

that  that  allegation  was made  in  this  House.  The

allegation  made  was  that  he  received   it   as   a

politician, as a leader of a political party.  Now  the

hon.  Member  is  imputing that he  received  it  as  a

Minister, which means that the Government was  a  party

to it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That strictly, of course, is not a point

of order. It is a question of degree. Whether or not  a

Minister  is responsible for some dereliction of  duty,

and  whether  the Government itself is to  blame  is  a

matter  of  opinion. I rule that it is not a  point  of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, I still submit then, leave alone

the  Inquiry  Commission, does the House  consider  the

seriousness  of that offence? One party,  that  is  the

civil   servant,  committed  an  offence  by  revealing

certain information. But we must also consider what was

that  information. How does it affect the interests  of

the people? Actually, we all admit that that particular

information was to the detriment of 1,500,000 people-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is now

anticipating  what the findings might be.  I  think  he

should not proceed on those lines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, I shall not proceed on that any

further.  But  my only comment is that,  comparing  the

seriousness of the information of the leakage  and  the

seriousness  of the substance contamed,  I  think  that

that  civil  servant has done a duty to the  people  of

Singapore.  The particular civil servant  who  revealed

that particular information - I must tell him that it was

an  offence and that he did something wrong - but you see

the seriousness of the information that he has given to

the public of Singapore. And it is my opinion that that

civil  servant,  having regard to the information  they

received from him, has done a service to the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br>10.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I have

really been shocked to hear the proposition put forward

by the hon. Member for Farrer Park that a civil servant

who  has  signed an oath of secrecy in respect  of  all

matters  committed to his charge should be entitled  to

judge - and this is the gravamen - from the nature of  that

information whether or not he is entitled to produce it

to any third unentitled party. I hope the House, in the

interests  of the integrity of the civil service,  will

join  me  in  repudiating in no  mean  terms  any  such

suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Mr Francis Thomas has suggested that

there is a lot of ado about nothing in this matter  and

that  there  is  really  no  distinction  between   the

leakage, which is the subject of this motion,  and  the

type  of Press leakage, which I must agree with him  is

all  too  common.  But I think there is  a  fundamental

difference between these two. It often happens that the

Press  by  their own means are apt to obtain access  to

information  or a Government intention or  proposal  in

advance  of  the  time when the Government  intends  to

release it. That may be at times embarrassing.  But  it

does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>



go  further  than that. But I do suggest  to  him  that

there  is a very great difference between that type  of

leakage and a leakage where there may or there may  not

have  been a deliberate breach of his oath by  a  civil

servant,  and  where  the public  are  entitled  to  be

assured   that   any  information  made  available   in

connection  with their income tax assessments  is  kept

secret, not just for a few days, but for all time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. friend the Financial Secretary will, I have

no  doubt,  be informing the House that as soon  as  it

became  clear that there had been a leakage he at  once

put  in  hand a departmental investigation. But I  must

point   out   to   the   House  that   a   departmental

investigation,  and it is not yet complete,  does  have

its  limitation. Where the parties concerned are solely

members of the department or Government servants,  then

it may be possible to clear the matter up and arrive at

the  truth.  But where there are members of the  public

concerned, they are not of course compellable witnesses

for the purpose of a departmental investigation, and if

the  information  is particularly in  their  possession

which  would  enable  an inquiry of  this  kind  to  be

brought   to   a   successful  conclusion,   then   the

departmental investigation can be completely frustrated

if  they  are not willing to come forward. Hon. Members

will  remember that that was the situation in  relation

to  the  investigation  of the leakage  of  examination

papers in the Chinese Middle School examinations. As  I

see it at present, it is still a matter for speculation

as  to  how this leakage occurred. It may have  been  a

matter  of  carelessness; it may have been a matter  of

negligence,  or it may have been that a  civil  servant

was  deliberately responsible. The matter clearly needs

to be explained and the public anxiety to be satisfied.

If  the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar is taking part in



this  debate  later,  I hope he  will  deal  with  that

particular point.



<br><br>10.29 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, there are two points that  I  would

like to speak on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First with regard to the Department. There is need

for  confidentiality of information in the  Department.

There has been public concern over the disclosures that



were  made at the last sitting on 4th March and  it  is

important  that  the name of the Department  should  be

cleared.  In  view  of  the  requirement  for  official

secrecy  in  the  Ordinance, I formed an  investigation

team  to  institute a departmental inquiry. It  started

only last week and it is therefore not in a position to

report.  Hon.  Members  will  be  quite  aware  of  the

limitation that this team will be faced with as it  has

to  depend  upon voluntary evidence. It is  not  likely

that  it  will make a positive report. However,  should

the  Assembly  decide that a Commission of  Inquiry  be

formed,  the report of this team, when submitted,  will

be made available to the Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take this opportunity to clarify the

misunderstanding that has arisen out of my answer to  a

supplementary question asked by the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar  on 3rd March? I refer to a cyclostyled  copy  of

the  statement that was circulated to the hon. Members.

The hon. Member asked:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will the Financial Secretary tell us whether the

Minister in question personally saw the Comptroller  of

Income  Tax, who is now away on leave, and as a  result

of that interview investigations were dropped?"



<br><br>My answer was:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is not correct."



<br><br>The intention of my answer was that investigations were

not  stopped  as a result of the interview between  the

Minister  and Mr Holloway. I was quoted  by  the  hon.

Member  to  have  said  that Mr  Chew  never  saw  Mr

Holloway  and this statement was repeated, I think,  by

the  Member  for  Changi yesterday.  I  would  like  to

clarify the position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> What is the

position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> As explained, my answer was in

reply to your question that-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Did Mr Chew see Mr Holloway?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> No, I took the question as a

whole, but I think the hon. Member took my answer as an

answer  to  a part of the question, which  was  not  my

intention. Whatever is the truth of the matter,  I  did

not state that Mr Chew never saw Mr Holloway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

Will  the  Financial Secretary do us  the  courtesy  of



stating,  as  a matter of fact, that according  to  his

information  now,  Mr Chew did see  Mr  Holloway  but

that, in his opinion, was not the direct reason for the

stopping of the inquiry? Is that the position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained,

my answer was in reply to the hon. Member's question as

a whole.



<br><br>10.33 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, as twilight over this Assembly,

there is a streak of insanity in the air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looting took place in a protected area. The looting

was  known  by someone outside the protected  area  and

Members  of  this  Assembly, who  are  supposed  to  be

representatives of the people, held up their  hands  in

horror and in mock indignation, not at the fact of  the

looting  but at the fact that it was known outside  the

protected area, We did not hear the Member for  Queenstown  or  the Member for Paya Lebar or the  Member  for

Serangoon, when the issue of the $500,000 was  debated,

but now the cry is for shame that that should ever have

been   made  known.  Sir,  it  was  a  calculated   and

deliberate act when I read out the file number to prove

two  things - that it is one thing for the Government  to

expect  loyalty  from civil servants, but  that  it  is

another   thing   when  the  Financial  Secretary,   in

pursuance  of  the  orders from his elected  Ministers,

makes  a  statement  which he  knows  to  be  partially

incorrect. We did not expect that kind of conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is almost an air of comedy about this

motion.  This is a Government matter. If the Government

wants  to  have a Commission of Inquiry,  there  is  no

necessity to move a motion in this Assembly.  Press  on

with it, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>



this of course is a diversion. Everybody was aghast and

flabbergasted  that this thing should have  been  known

and  the  best way of distracting attention is to  talk

about how it came to be known. Sir, at the proper  time

and  in the proper place, we shall let it be known  how

it  came  to  be  known. But I will say  this:  if  you

expect,  as  we expect, integrity in the  service,  you

must  have Ministers to set the pace. Anyone  who  goes

into  any  of the Government Ministries can  smell  the

decay and feel the sense of collapse of morale. That is

bad, because we have to run the same machine and it  is

our  duty to stiffen up the morale. That was the reason

why  we  gave  the  file  number.  Does  the  Financial

Secretary  realise  that  anybody  can  pick   up   the

telephone - but: not now, because there is such a jolt in

the   Income  Tax  Department  that  nobody  will   say

anything - and say, "I am Mr So and So. Will you  please

give  me  my file number?" And they do. The Income  Tax

Department  literally speaks to  the  public  over  the

phone and gives a man's file number. I have tried  it,

before  they made this an issue. How do I come to  know

this?  I can tell the Financial Secretary and the Chief

Secretary  a  few  other  things.  I  know  that   this

departmental inquiry has been going on, as it ought  to

be without waiting for a resolution of this Assembly. I

know  that  Mr  Teo  Kah Leong  and  Mr  Pepper  (the

Comptroller-General of Income Tax) have  been  doing  a

departmental  inquiry,  and  I  know  that  they   have

shortlisted it to three or four gentlemen. I would like

to  inform  them that they have got the  wrong  people.

They  are  not  involved. How do I know it?  It  is  my

business  to  know what is going on in this Government,

otherwise  we would not have survived. I say  this:  we

will keep on knowing what is going on right to the end,

and  it is because we know what is going on that  I  am

going  to move the next motion which is down for debate

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no objections to a Commission of

Inquiry. I think the Chief Secretary knows exactly what

the results will be. I am only sorry that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>



Government,  instead of taking the bull by  the  horns,

and  making  the  decision themselves, have  chosen  to

allow  a  Back-Bencher  to  moot  the  point  in   this

Assembly. In the course of this Inquiry

- be  it  one or two - let it never be forgotten that  our

sense  of  morality should not get perverted. What  was

really  disgraceful was the deliberate lie  and  denial

before  we produced the evidence. I spent a great  deal

of  the  time of this Assembly at its last  sitting  in

giving  details just to make sure that this  House  and

the  public  understand, Sir, that before  we  make  an

assertion of fact, we have ascertained its accuracy. In

my position as leader of an Opposition political Party,

I get a lot of information - some confidential, some very

confidential, and most highly explosive. I do  not  use

it  unless  I  am sure of it. I will just give  you  an

example, Mr Speaker, Sir. The moment the motion on Mr

Chew Swee Kee was on, I received many letters giving me

more  details of that transaction, it was  a  political

gift.  We  thought  well  of  the  civil  service,  and

believed they acted properly. Therefore, they must have

satisfied themselves that it was a political  gift  not

liable  to  income  tax. But according  to  information

which I have now received from the post, it says,  "You

can  check  it up by advertising so and so and  then  I

shall  cross-check  and  prove further  by  giving  you

further information."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> On a point of order.

Sir.  The question of the $500,000 is now in the  hands

of  a  Commission of Inquiry. Is it in  order  for  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar now to review facts which  may

prejudice the findings of that Commission?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> My understanding is that facts have not

as  yet been revealed. They have been threatened to  be

revealed. If they are revealed, then of course that  is

wrong.  The  moment  we reach the stage  of  a  threat,

perhaps the Member for Tanjong Pagar will not step over

the brink.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2272</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not profess to be as clever as

Mr  Dulles at brinksmanship. But we go as far  as  we

can  justify ourselves. It is only when we have  cross-checked  our information and we are positive  about  it

that we make a firm assertion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few foolish remarks were made yesterday about

civil  servants  being threatened  to  give  all  their

secrets.  I  do  not think the Member  for  Paya  Lebar

understands what the business of Government is. I would

like  to make our position quite clear. If and when  we

are  the  Government, the civil service  will  have  no

secrets from the Ministers. It is the business  of  the

Ministers to run the Government, not the civil service.

and if the Member for Paya Lebar knew what the business

of  Government  is, he would not have been  responsible

for such an inane remark as to suggest that it is wrong

for a Minister to know what is happening.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose the word "inane" in

that  context must be unparliamentary. I ask  the  hon.

Member to withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with respect, I

am  not suggesting that the hon. Member is inane. I  am

suggesting  that the remark is inane,  but  if  you  so

rule, then so be it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose that if a remark

emanates from an hon. Member, the hon. Member  must  be

tainted with that remark, and therefore I ask the  hon.

Member to withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

withdraw  it;  but nevertheless I should  have  thought

that  the elementary principle of the law of defamation

says that you cannot impute stupidity in a man but  you

can  always impute stupidity in the remarks that he has

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not believe that the Government even now

know what they are doing. I believe they have blundered

into  something which is completely unnecessary. It  is

not  our  business in this Assembly to bring  down  the

democratic  system. We have had four years of  a  half-trial in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2273</b></font><br><br>



a baby Austin with dual-control, and we are about to

shed the driving instructor and take over. I was

prepared not to press for a Commission. My Party took a

decision at a Central Executive Committee meeting after

the Chief Minister's offer to allow Mr Chew to resign.

We were prepared to forego the trials and tribulations

and the ordeals of the disclosures that are bound to

take place. That will not only disgrace Mr Chew, but

will disgrace the whole of the democratic process. Due

to some uncontrollable impulse, the Chief Minister in a

fit of anger said, "Let us go on with it." Now he

thinks that since everybody on his side is getting into

dirt, why not try and get the Opposition and the civil

service into it also? I ask him to remember this.

Ministers may come and Ministers may go, but it is our

business to see that the institutions which we are

establishing survive, and it is not our business to try

to bring these institutions into disrepute. I welcome

the remarks about people of integrity leading the

country. I often feel that the Member for

Serangoon - whatever his other failings - is not a

dishonest man, and I think he should be the first to be

distressed to discover that the Minister for Education

was not the man of integrity that he would have liked,

in order to give morale and tone to the service which

he led. As a result not only of this disclosure but

also of a series of misdemeanours which took place in

his Ministry - perhaps through no fault of his - the whole

of the education service and all parents whose children

are in school have lost faith in the Ministry of

Education. One and a half million cannot be accounted

for. Defalcations-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think probably the Member for

Tanjong Pagar is wandering from this motion. We are now

on disclosures in the Income Tax Department and not on

disclosures in the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is quite so, Mr Speaker, Sir,

but I wanted to endorse the point made by the Member

for Serangoon, that if you want a service with tone and

morale, you have to set the pace as a Minister. If you

engage in mercenary activities and leave your political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>



duties and responsibilities by the side, then you, as

the political head, must be responsible for the

consequences that are bound to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry if this disclosure has

frightened - according to the Member for Changi - corrupt

diplomats from foreign countries. I hate to believe

that there are corrupt diplomats from neighbouring

countries. Unless it is proved to the contrary, I

believe them to be honest men of integrity. But let no

one be under the same misapprehension as the Member for

Paya Lebar is that a P.A.P. Government will not know

what is happening. The Chief Minister told us in this

House that he did not know Mr Khaw Kai-Boh had already

become an entitled officer and was going to quit. I did

not believe him. I did not believe him because I could

not believe that the Government can go on without

knowing what is happening. I did not want to embarrass

the Chief Secretary yesterday by asking whether he knew

about the five others who applied and one who had

become entitled. I did not want to press for their

names. If and when it is necessary after the elections,

we shall know what we want to know. But if you want the

system to succeed and if you want men to assume

responsibility, then you must give them full control.

If you run a baby Austin with the driving instructor

always changing into reverse gear when you want to move

forward, then verily you must crash.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry for the Government. They never had a

chance and the Chief Minister ought to know why. But I

will say this for him and his Ministers. We are

grateful to them for one thing. They opened Pandora's

box. We know what is inside. We know every turn in this

maze and we hope that when it is our turn to lead, we

shall lead with firmness, resolution and purpose.



<br><br>10.51 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when a piece of

cake is thrown at a group of persons, the ensuing

behaviour of that group shows their maturity. If they

scramble for the cake and during the scramble they

knock things over, the world sees that they are but

children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>



If  they are adults, they will realise the consequences

of  their  actions. They will realise that the knocked-over  things are more important than the piece of  cake

for  which  they  scramble; and today we  are  in  that

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take stock of Singapore today, Sir. We have had

over  100 years of colonialism. After the war, we  have

had  a  few years of colonial stooges nominated to  the

Legislative    Council    but    not     having     any

responsibilities. Now, the elected Ministers have  gone

through  a  difficult  period during  these  last  four

years,  Sir, not only because the baby Austin is  dual-controlled - as the Member for Tanjong Pagar said - whereby

certain  powers  are  with the  elected  Ministers  and

certain  powers  are  not, but also  because  the  hon.

Member and his Party have not made things easy for  the

people  of  Singapore and for the Government.  Memories

are not short, Sir. We have gone through riots. We have

gone  through all sorts of difficult periods.  We  have

gone  through a period of tension with our neighbouring

countries - with the Federation of Malaya - all because  of

certain members of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this scramble for power, the P.A.P. are

willing to sacrifice what is most important of all, and

that  is the democratic system. We have lost all  sense

of   values.  Today,  we  are  being  judged  by  other

countries  in  the world according to our actions,  and

our  actions  in  the past do not  show  that  we  have

reached  maturity.  Sir,  a  sense  of  proportion   is

important  in  political behaviour. Unfortunately,  the

P.A.P. do  not seem to realise that. The  hon.  Member

made  a  call  for sanity, Sir. That call appropriately

fits his own Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually boasted that it was his business to know

what  was going on in the Government and thereby showed

that he condones this method of spying. It is certainly

his business, as an Opposition Party Member, to know of

Government policies and to oppose or support them as he

pleases;  but it is certainly not his business  to  get

people to spy into confidential files of the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2276</b></font><br><br>



which  are entrusted to Government departments, because

that is the root of good government. If the rot sets in

and  if  every  bit of information that any  Government

department holds is available for use by politicians or

by  unscrupulous persons, then where do members of  the

public  stand, Sir? How can we then have any confidence

left  in  the  Government of the  country  and  in  the

politicians  who  may form the next Government  of  the

country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member posed the question: "Why have a

motion in the Assembly? The Government themselves could

have appointed a Court of Inquiry." The purpose of  the

motion  in  this  Assembly  is  to  see  how  perverted

thinking  could  be, how the Members of the  Opposition

would individually react to this despicable conduct  of

human beings in spying and passing on secrets entrusted

to  them.  We have seen today - I am sorry,  Sir,  and  I

speak  more in sorrow than in anger - the reaction of  my

former  colleague, Mr Francis Thomas. It  is  strange,

Sir,  how  people change overnight. I do not  know  the

reason  for this sudden change overnight of a  man  who

was  violently  opposed to the P.A.P. But  besides  his

political way of thinking - he may have fallen  for  the

P.A.P. way of thinking-he opposes something that nobody

in  his right senses would oppose and he condones  what

seems to be despicable conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chew Swee Kee never thought fit to confide in

me about the money matters brought up in this House. He

thought  fit to confide in Mr Francis Thomas  who  was

the  first Vice-President of the Labour Front  at  that

time.  I was the second Vice-President then. But if  he

had confided in me, I would have thought twice before I

gave   out  something  that  was  confided  to  me   in

confidence.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I ruled out that disclosure as

being  the  personal conduct of an hon. Member  outside

this  Assembly, and therefore it cannot be referred  to

under  the  Standing Orders except upon  a  substantive

motion. It is personal conduct outside the Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2277</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> As you please, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this scramble for power. At what price are

we  to  get this power? Are we going to get that power

at  the  price  of sacrificing the livelihood  of  the

people? This has got to be thought of,

and  a person who is a responsible person will  think

deeply before he takes action which will undermine the

whole life of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is an indication of the methods of the

People's Action Party when they are in the Opposition,

I  do  not know what will happen when they are in  the

Government. We already see the happenings in the  City

Council  and  They  have aroused a  lot  of  fear  and

resentment  in  the hearts of the general  public  who

understand the deep significance of their actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the democratic system can only work if both

sides  play the game. So far we find in England  that,

however  bitterly the Parties oppose each other,  they

stick  to  the  rules and they play the game.  If  one

Party  does  not  play the game, then  the  democratic

system  will collapse and the hon. Member for  Tanjong

Pagar  knows it full well; he is out not to  see  that

the  democratic system works, but he is out to  get  a

one-Party  rule,  That  is not  a  statement  made  at

random.  I  base that statement, Sir, on three  facts.

One  is  the goings-on in the City Council when  peons

can  be  asked to come in as an inquisition  team  and

give  evidence against a Councillor on a motion  which

has  no  relevance  to the personal  conduct  of  that

Councillor. I dread to think what would happen  if  we

had  a  Speaker  here in the next Assembly  Session - a

Party  man - who allows peons to come into  this  House

and  give  evidence against Assemblymen. Is  that  the

essence  of  democracy?  The  second  basis   for   my

statement  that the P.A.P. are out to have a one-Party

rule  is  the  fact that the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

jibed at me two months back in this House when I moved

amendments to certain Bills connected with industries.

He  jibed  at me, Sir, saying that it was a  come-down

for  me  to have moved those amendments and I  replied

that I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>



was  no  dictator. Now that again is  the  essence  of

democracy.  If a Minister or a person responsible  for

the  conduct of the affairs of a country is  satisfied

from representations made, from whichever sources they

may   be - whether   from  the   Opposition   or   from

outside - that  what he intends to do is not  ultimately

going   to  benefit  the  country,  and  that  certain

amendments are necessary, it is his duty to make those

amendments  irrespective of whether he loses  face  or

not.  That is the essence of democracy, but the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar does not understand that. He  jibed

at   me  for  making  those  amendments  when  I  felt

satisfied that the amendments were necessary. It is no

shame,  Sir, to own up that one can be wrong at times.

A human being has his weaknesses and the human element

is present in every form of action of a human being. A

Minister can be wrong, a Government can be wrong,  and

individuals can be wrong too. But it is the essence of

democracy, that when your actions are going to have an

effect  on  the  livelihood  of  the  people  and  you

recognise  that  you  are wrong,  you  must  make  the

changes  and the kudos should go to the man who  makes

the  changes  voluntarily by himself, rather  than  be

forced to do so. And to be jibed for doing that, shows

the mentality of the person and of the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor, Sir, is the oft-repeated boast of

the  hon.  Member  for Tanjong Pagar about  his  Party

organization.  He has said very often,  "We  have  the

organization." The basis of his democracy  talk  rests

solely  on the fact of the Party organization, not  of

what  the  people want, not of what the people  think,

but  rather  on  the Party organization  to  fool  the

people  into  voting for them. Sir, that is  something

that  can  be  developed into a thing  that  could  be

detrimental to the people. Not only Communism has that

system,  Sir,  we had it in Nazi Germany,  in  Fascist

Italy,  and  to a certain extent we have  it  even  in

Spain  now under Franco. Once you get people with  the

thought  that  "It  is  the  Party  organization  that

matters,  and  nothing else", you have a system  where

you  cannot even talk to your neighbour. You dare not,

because you can never know what your neighbour might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>



be - whether he might be spying on you and relaying  what

you  have  said to the Government agent. You  dare  not

even speak to members of your own family! Your children

may  be  spying on you and telling their teachers,  who

may be Government agents, of what you have said. Again,

Sir,  according  to the Member for Tanjong  Pagar,  the

essence of democracy is the Party organization,  but  I

say  it  is  not.  It is the people voluntarily  giving

their   opinion  through  the  ballot.  Not   a   Party

organization that works like a machine and  drives  the

people    to    give   votes   through    intimidation,

through - maybe the word is "hostage", though there is  a

much worse word, Sir, but I do not think you will allow

me  to use it - or lure of gold or promise of power.  The

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar may say  that  he  is  non-Communist, and I believe that he is non-Communist.  But

non-Communism  is  not the end. A man  can  be  a  non-Communist and yet be a dictator. The Japanese  are  not

Communists,   and  yet  during  their   occupation   of

Singapore,  the  people  suffered  because   of   their

dictatorial methods, like the Kempeitai's.  Hitler  was

not  a  Communist; in fact, he fought Communist Russia,

and yet the people under Hitler were not happy. Sir, it

is  not only a matter of whether you are a Communist or

not,  but a matter of whether you are really a democrat

or  not.  You  can  be a non-Communist  and  yet  be  a

dictator.  You can grind the people under the  heel  of

dictatorship.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has been

talking  in  waves like a graph - he goes away  from  the

motion and then comes back to the motion! I ask him  to

try  and confine his remarks to the motion, or in  some

way relate his remarks to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir. My emotions

sometimes overtake me where the interests of the people

are  concerned,  and  I admire the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar who controls his emotions in order to control the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2280</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this House during the last debate, the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar boasted about his methods of getting

information  from  the Government departments,  and  he

said  this about the Minister for Commerce and Industry

(Hansard cols. 2135 and 2136):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has had four years working with the civil service,

but I know more about how he runs his Ministry than  he

does himself. His Permanent Secretary is my colleague."



<br><br>Sir,  coming  from  the leader of the  Party  is  this

accusation against his own colleague. Though,  Sir,  my

ex-Permanent  Secretary is in the Opposition  political

Party, I, as a sincere and honest man, will say this: I

have always held a high opinion of Mr Byrne and of his

integrity. And I am sorry, Sir, that his own colleague,

the leader of his own Party, indirectly accuses him  of

divulging information from the Ministry of Commerce and

Industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister in the debate on the matter

of  a Police Officer retiring with compensation, at the

last sitting of this Assembly, said, in cols. 2131-2 of

the Hansard:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely, they and their families and their families'

families will not be so foolish as to cast their  votes

to  bring  into  power a Government whose  policy  is

going  to  be detrimental to their security  and  their

well  being. Their fate is in their hands. They  should

bestir themselves."



<br><br>That  was  no threat. That was just an advice to  those

people  who  do  not like this dictatorship  system  to

bestir  themselves and take advantage of the democratic

system  by  casting  their  votes  according  to  their

conscience and their liking. That was twisted, Sir,  by

the  hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar in his reply in col.

2134:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I would ask the civil service, since the Chief

Minister was ill-advised enough to tell them how they

can oppose the P.A.P."- oppose the P.A.P.! In the

elections!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to remember this. Keep your politics and your

personal views out of your service. If you take the

Chief Minister's advice"-



<br><br>The advice was to vote for whom they like-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and try to down the Government because you do not

agree  with it, then that Government will not  tolerate

it.  Take  the advice of the Opposition: Do  your  duty

because  that  is  right;  do  not  try  to  'fix'  the

Government."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>



Now, Sir, that, read by anybody, seems to be a threat - a

threat  to the civil servants - "If you do not  vote  for

the  P.A.P. and try to fix the S.P.A. Government, then

you beware!" If that is not the interpretation, and the

interpretation  is  that  you  must   be   honest   and

straightforward to the Government of the time, and  not

to  try  and  'fix' it, or try to embarrass  it  or  do

anything against the

Government, then the action of the person who gave all

these  leakages about the Minister was an  action  that

could be interpreted as 'fixing' the Government in that

sense of the word. As such, that action cannot then  be

condoned by any Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some mention was made by, I believe, the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar,  of "looting wildly  in  protected

places",  or  words  to  that  effect.  "There  was  no

shouting from the Government Backbenchers. Now they are

out  to  find out how it was looted" - or words  to  that

effect,  Sir  I have not got the exact quotation.  Sir,

once  looting takes place, it is just as important also

to  find  the  causes of the looting and to  catch  the

looters, so that there will be no more looting  in  the

future.  Therefore, it is as important to find out  not

only what has been looted, but also to find out who has

been  the looter. And if the P.A.P. do not follow these

principles, then  a different government  will  be  in

power.  The  hon. Member's own words in the  past  have

clearly  indicated that they intend  to  be  much  more

harsh on persons who try to 'fix' their government. Let

us  have  a  sense  of sanity, as the hon.  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar wants us to believe that he would like to

have. Let us try and work this democratic system  in  a

fair  manner.  Today, we find many  countries  in  Asia

started  the democratic system that was handed down  to

them  on a platter - a written constitution - England never

had  a  written  constitution, a  written  constitution

embodying  all  sorts of safety for its  citizens.  And

what is in the hands of these countries today? They are

in  the hands of military governments although we might

call  it  "a  benevolent dictatorship".  We,  Sir,  are

trying the same experiment here. If we want to succeed,

we have got to play fair



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2282</b></font><br><br>



on  both sides. If we do not want to succeed, then  the

world  is  going to laugh at us, and we  will  probably

find  that our constitution may be suspended, or  riots

might start all over again, or the Federation of Malaya

might  have  to  step in in some place,  because  their

security  may  he prejudiced due to our  actions  here.

Things  which certainly will not be beneficial  to  the

people  of  Singapore  and to  their  livelihood  might

happen.  Then  let  us  at all  times  in  our  actions

remember that the purpose of politics is to enhance the

livelihood  of the people, and therefore  the  economic

conditions  of the country should be the first  thought

to be given to.



<br><br>11.12 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I consider that a Commission

of  Inquiry as suggested by my hon, friend, the  Member

for  Queenstown, is very reasonable in connection with

the  disclosures  made by the hon. Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar in his speech on the 4th March. Sir, to quote his

famous words (Hansard col. 2155), he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, the facts are there. First, for the benefit of

the Financial Secretary, we will just tell him that  we

have got all the cards on the table. Mr Chew's file is

G.S. 47909."



<br><br>Sir,  it is not reasonable to have information of  this

kind  coming from a person who is not entitled to  that

information.  I feel that a Commission  of  Inquiry  is

fully   justified,  in  view  of  the  fact  that   any

departmental  inquiry  would  be  inadequate  for  that

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think, Sir, that this is of national

importance  and cannot be just left with a departmental

inquiry. I was amazed when the hon. Member talked about

the  civil service. At one stage, he praised the  civil

service and at another he condoned the offences of  the

civil service. I regard the attempt made at the sitting

on the 4th March, as an attempt to demoralise the civil

service at the present time. This time is the time when

the  civil servants must be given encouragement to keep

up  their  morale and to enable them to continue  their

service  impartially with the incoming  government.  No

government of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>



any  type repeated that, if they came into power,  they

would  keep the civil service neutral, but on the other

hand,  attempts  will be made to demoralise  the  civil

servants.  It  was  an  indiscretionary  act  which,  I

believe,  is regrettable indeed. At the same  time,  we

must   get  down  to  the  bottom  of  the  truth   and

investigate  into  all the matters connected  with  the

leakage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I consider that the previous motion calling for

a  Commission of inquiry and this one are related,  but

surely  the  objects of the two are different.  I  felt

that a Commission of Inquiry called for by the previous

motion  was  justified, and similarly  I  feel  that  a

Commission  of Inquiry is also justified in this  case,

because  this is of national importance and any  effort

by  the  civil service to do such an act, as  had  been

done,  should  be  nipped in the bud  as  the  incoming

government expects the civil service to be  of  a  very

high  calibre and it cannot have any black sheep in  it

to  spoil its fair name. Sir, I sincerely support  this

motion.



<br><br>11.16 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar said that it was

not necessary for this motion to be moved, and that the

Government  could appoint a Commission of Inquiry.  The

fact that this motion is brought before this House is - I

forgot  his  very  words - that it  is  nothing  but  an

election  stunt. Sir, the hon. Member who  tabled  this

motion felt very strongly about this disclosure, but he

did not take part in the debate on the motion which was

brought  up at the last sitting by the hon. Member  for

Tanjong Pagar calling for a Commission of Inquiry.  The

Back-benchers did not take part in that debate  because

they  did not know the facts of the case and they could

not contribute to the debate at all; it was left to  me

to reply on behalf of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, as usual, was

carried  away  by  his eloquence. He said  these  words

which are very significant: "If and when we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>



are  in the Government, the civil service will have  no

secrets   from  the  Ministers."  And  he   said   this

particularly in the context of a debate on  an  alleged

disclosure in the Income Tax Department. The Income Tax

law is very, very clear - there shall be no disclosure to

anyone, not even to the Government of the day. And  how

firm  that Department has been can be gauged  from  the

fact  that  when one Ministry instituted investigations

into allegations of corruption, it came up against  the

Income Tax Department which refused to disclose even to

the  Government the facts, or whatever facts there are,

that  are made available by the person concerned  under

the Income Tax law. And yet the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar  would have it that "Law or no law,  we  are  the

supreme  power, and we do what we like." That, Sir,  is

rather disturbing to the public of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has since said something more about

Mr  Khaw Kai-Boh. I told him I was not aware that this

officer became an entitled officer until November, when

he  sent  in  his notice of resignation.  He  found  it

difficult  to believe me. I am not worried  whether  he

believes me or not, but that is the truth. He  did  say

one  thing,  Sir,  "Let our sense of morality  not  get

perverted."  And  yet he disclosed in the  same  speech

that  he has a lot of information at his disposal, that

he could use it if he felt inclined, but he did not use

it  because  he felt that it was not necessary  in  the

interests  of  the civil service or of his  Party.  But

surely,  Sir,  if  he had such disclosures  and  if  he

wished  to  maintain an independent civil service  with

integrity, he could have reported such misdemeanours to

the  Government,  and  the Government  would  have  the

opportunity  to look into the allegations  of  wrongful

acts  and  thereby  help to protect the  civil  service

which  he  himself hopes to take over  at  the  general

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed lamentable that as we - get nearer to

the  general  elections,  it  is  inevitable  that  our

political  opponents want to indulge  in  mud-slinging,

and  it  does happen that in this clamour for power,  a

lot  of casualties take place along the line. The  hon.

Mr  Francis  Thomas  yesterday, in  his  speech,  made

certain disparaging remarks regarding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>



the  manner  in  which  my office  treats  confidential

documents. For the record, I would like to state that I

am  not  aware that there has been any leakage from  my

office since its setting-up. I am satisfied, Sir,  that

the Confidential Registry in my office is out of bounds

to  unauthorised persons and Government personnel.  If.

as  the  hon. Mr Francis Thomas has alleged, this  has

not  been so, I am indeed very surprised that he should

only  now  choose to divulge this after he has resigned

his  Ministerial  office and after he has  crossed  the

Floor. He had every opportunity of bringing this matter

to  my  notice, or, if not, at least to my  Secretary's

attention.  But he did not choose to do so. Of  course,

now  that he is on the Opposite Bench, he has not  lost

much  time  in  regaling us with some  of  his  dubious

reminiscences   regarding  our  alleged   actions   and

omissions. But then we are well aware that Mr  Francis

Thomas  himself has his own ideas of how  to  safeguard

confidential information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another motion coming up immediately

after  this  and, as the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar

has  said, he has a lot of disclosures which  he  would

like  to make when he moves that motion. I would rather

wait  until  those disclosures are made  before  I  say

anything further.



<br><br>11.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

there is much for me to reply, as my Chief Minister and

my  colleagues  have covered most of  the  points.  But

there  is  one  thing: from this debate I have  learned

something more than what I actually knew. We  all  know

that  politics  is  dirty. Everyone of  us  knows  that

politics  is  dirty. But the surprising thing  is  that

after  this  debate I learn that politics is  so  dirty

that it can put a country at stake. It has come to this

stage - our country now is at stake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here politicians who are honourable Members,

like  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar and the Member  for

Farrer  Park,  coming to this House to connive  at  and

abet an offence which both of them were fully aware and

fully



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>



know is against the law. They have come here to express

that  they are prepared to encourage civil servants  to

disclose secret and confidential information. Such  are

the honourable Members that we have in this House!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, our country now is at stake. We have

now  come  to the conclusion that there is a  political

Party  prepared to plant stooges in the civil  service.

We  now  come  to know that there is a political  Party

that   is  politically  corrupt  and  prepared  to   do

anything.  For this, Sir, I now come to the  conclusion

that  I  must  warn  the people of  Singapore,  in  the

interest  of  our country, that they must  realise  the

consequences  of having such politicians if  they  vote

the  wrong Party into power. They must now vote  wisely

and  properly. It is only a matter of two months before

we go to the polls, and if they vote wrongly, they will

find that they have voted traitors into the Government,

traitors  who  are prepared to betray  our  confidence,

traitors  who  are prepared to betray our country, and

traitors who are prepared to betray our people and sell

our  country.  Are we going to have such a  government?

Sir,  I warn the people of Singapore, all citizens  who

have a right to vote to vote wisely, whoever he may be-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Not to vote for Lee Choon Eng!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - at least, whichever Party that

comes into power, we do not want traitors, traitors who

are   prepared  to  disclose  secret  and  confidential

information which they have come, to know through their

official  capacity. The Member for Serangoon  correctly

stated  that it is only people with influence and  with

positions   who  are  able  to  get  such  secret   and

confidential information. As a man-in-the-street,  can

he get such confidential information? Certainly not! It

is  only  those who are in high positions that can  get

such  information.  Then,  if  only  people  with  high

positions  can  get  such  information,  how  did   the

leakages come about? I am quite sure if such people can

leak out information, they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>



always  in the habit of leaking secret and confidential

information either from the Government to the  enemies - as  I  have  stated, it is a betrayal of trust - or  from

Party  to  Party.  I  was very  horrified  to  hear  in

yesterday's  sitting that Mr Francis Thomas  disclosed

that  there  was  leakage  even  from  the  Council  of

Ministers. It is really surprising and horrifying.  Was

he  not  a Member of that Council of Ministers? If  so,

then  was it not his duty to report such a leakage,  if

there had been any? I really cannot understand. In  all

my four years in this Assembly. I have not heard of any

leakage from the Council of Ministers. But today an ex-Member of the Council of Ministers comes here and tells

us  that  there  was even leakage from the  Council  of

Ministers. It was his bounden duty to report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am allowed, Sir, I would like to amend my

motion,  but  since I am not allowed, I would  ask  His

Excellency  to  extend the terms  of  reference  of  my

motion,  so that the disclosures by Mr Francis  Thomas

of the secret information from the Council of Ministers

should  also be investigated into. How come Mr Francis

Thomas did not report those disclosures?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has not given way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, he also said that he was not

happy  about this motion. He does not want a Commission

of Inquiry because it is not necessary. I could see the

reason why he does not want a Commission of Inquiry. We

recall,  Sir, that during the year before last,  during

the Budget sittings, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>



knew   that   a   restaurant,  which   was   Government

controlled, did not pay rent which came to a  very  big

amount.  Sir,  if  Mr Francis Thomas  is  prepared  to

accept  Commissions of Inquiry, another  Commission  of

Inquiry may come up to find out why Mr Francis Thomas,

as  a  Minister, did not call for an investigation into

money that was not paid by that restaurant.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. On weighing those remarks, it

seems  to me that the hon. Member is, firstly, straying

very  far  away  from the motion, and secondly,  he  is

making  an  imputation  which,  of  course,  is  highly

disorderly. If in fact there was an imputation, he must

withdraw that imputation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was just a

passing  reference, but if it pleases you.  Sir,  I  am

prepared to withdraw it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar said that he mentioned

that  file  number because he wanted to expose,  or  to

prove  two  things. That is, he wants  loyalty  in  the

service,  and  he emphasised again and again,  even  in

introducing  his  motion about the  $500,000,  that  he

wants   a  loyal  service.  In  another  motion   about

Malayanisation, he also emphasised loyal service.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Loyalty to the PAP, only!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Then where is the loyalty when he

is prepared to connive at and abet an offence, when the

law  says  that under an oath of secrecy no information

should  be  revealed or disclosed to  any  unauthorised

person?  Where is that loyalty he is expecting to  get,

if  his  Party  comes into power?  He  is  prepared  to

encourage his own officers to go against the  law,  and

if  he calls himself a legislator, then let us see  how

he enforces his law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point he mentioned was that it is very simple

to   pick  up  a  telephone  and  ask  the  Income  Tax

Department, "What is my file number?" I may agree  with

him  on this point. It is quite simple. "Hello, is that

the Income Tax Department? I am so and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>



so.  May  I have my file number?" But that file  number

may mean nothing. It is the seriousness of the contents

of  that  file that is involved. It is not G.S.  47909.

What  is that G.S. 47909? But what is recorded in  that



file  No.  G.S. 47909 is involved, not that figure.  He

may  even  have a four-letter digit lottery or whatever

it is with that number. It refers to nothing at all. If

he  thinks that he can depend on that lucky number, let

him  depend on it. But we are involved in the  contents

that are recorded in that file. How did the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar get to know all those things, Sir?  This

fact  is really shocking. As I said, since politics  in

Singapore has become so dirty, our country is at stake,

and  I would like to emphasise once again that when the

people go to the polls, they should vote for the  right

Party,  and  not  for  a Party in which  there  may  be

traitors.

Absent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question accordingly agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in view of the leakage of secret income-tax

information as evidenced in the Assembly debate on the

4th  of  March,  1959, and in view  of  the  resulting

public  anxiety regarding the safety of all the secret

or  confidential information about the general  public

entrusted to the Income Tax Department, this  Assembly

is  of the opinion that a Commission of Inquiry should

be  appointed  to investigate into and report  on  the

circumstances  in  which  particulars  of   file   No.

47909/GS of the income Tax Department became available

to a person not entitled thereto.

<div align="center"><b>(Call for)</b></div>



<br><br>11.40 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this is positively the last performance, and I hope to

set a more serious tone in this debate. Those who have

come here hoping that we are going to pull the House

down will be disappointed, because it is not our

intention to pull the House down. But we are gravely

alarmed that in their Gotterdammerung our Ministers

have no quite the stability and judgment which we

expect of them when the lights go out on this

Government. It requires a great man to go down coolly,

quietly and sanely. When one goes down, there is an

almost irresistible impulse to pull everything down.

We saw it in 1956. I did not much admire the tactics

and techniques of the Chief Minister, but I have

always thought him to be a tough little man who could

take it. But I discovered that, when the time came and

everybody rushed for the lifeboats, he, the Captain,

also showed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>



an  inclination to get on the life-boat. Therefore,  I

thought it was imperative after the last sitting, that

we  should  put  the issue back on a sane  and  proper

basis.  He  said  in the course of that  sitting  many

things.  But  none of them was more  damaging  to  the

Government and to the confidence which we have in fair

and  free elections than his one interjection - that  he

intends to play dirty politics. It is one thing for an

ordinary Member of this House to say that he is  going

to  resort to dirty methods and dirty politics. It  is

another  thing when it comes from the Chief  Minister,

even  though it was in a fit of anger, in a moment  of

madness.  For  that reason, we assessed the  situation

and  we  decided to table this motion. Two things  can

happen after this motion. We can go back to a sane and

stable  basis  on  which political issues  are  to  be

fought out; or we go off at a tangent, round the bend,

and  have a real, all-in wrestling bout with no  holds

barred for the next two months. The outcome of such  a

contest must mean a lot of unhappiness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up till now we are in control. The Chief Minister is

in  control  of the apparatus of State  to  a  certain

extent,  and  we  are in control of the  direction  in

which  the contest shall be pursued. But once  certain

things happen and all the brakes are released, then we

go  tearing round the bend. I do not want to see  that

happen.   For  that  reason,  I  hope   that,   as   a

demonstration  that  he  intends  to, play  the  game

according  to  the rules, and not go  in  for  Siamese

boxing,  first, that he will retract his statement  on

dirty  politics; secondly, that he will also  withdraw

what he said about a secret meeting which he said took

place  between him, me and the Secretary of State.  As

for  dirty  politics, he has indicated that  that  was

said in a fit of anger. As for the other, he knows  it

is  a  falsehood. However, I want to  put  this  issue

plainly to him: that if it has to be all-in wrestling.

then we will trade blow for blow to the very end.  But

we  believe  that  he, despite everything,  would  not

recklessly embark on such a course. For that reason, I

wish to couch my language in the course of this debate

in sober terms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what has happened is past. But what will

happen  after this is another matter, because today  is

positively  the last sitting of this Assembly,  and  in

the  next  few  days there will be no more  Legislative

Assembly  where  questions  can  be  asked  or   issues

debated.  We were confident in November last year  when

we  moved  our  motion that there should  be  elections

after  the 2nd April, 1959; that we should dissolve  on

or  before the 2nd; and I did not force the issue about

the Ministers who had been appointed, because they were

Members  of this Assembly, continuing in office without

an   Assembly.   It  is  true  that  in  constitutional

practice,  after  Parliament  is  dissolved,  Ministers

continue  on a caretaker basis until the elections  are

over. But when the Chief Minister said, "I am going  to

play the game in a dirty way", then I say we have cause

to   ask   ourselves  whether  or  not,  wittingly   or

unwittingly, he may, in fact, allow dirty  politics  to

be  played in this election. I indicated earlier  that,

had  we  not known what was going on, the P.A.P. would

not  have survived. Right now we know exactly  what  is

going on, and we are, frankly speaking, disturbed  that

when  the time comes for the final round of the contest

men  who  should  make momentous decisions  only  after

careful reflection and consideration are acting in fits

of pique and anger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday there was wild talk that the Minister for

Local  Government,  Lands  and  Housing  was  going  to

dissolve  the City Council, because he was  angry  that

some minutes which he had demanded had not been sent to

him.  Yes. He told the Press, but he told them to  keep

it  quiet and confidential. One reporter did not,  much

to  the chagrin of the reporter of the other paper  who

discovered he had been scooped the next day.  But  even

this paper did not disclose the full extent of this mad

talk.  I do not believe even now that the Minister,  on

sober  reflection, would wish to take such a  momentous

decision  so  light-heartedly. Even if he  did,  it  is

doubtful whether his other Ministers would acquiesce in

that decision. Even if they did, it is doubtful whether

the ultimate official responsible, namely, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>



Governor, will be a party to it. Therefore, if and when

that  happens, we must assume that all have  acquiesced

in that, and have calculated the consequences. What are

the  consequences? If nothing happens between  now  and

Nomination  Day and between Nomination Day and  polling

day, then I say the odds have already been settled. But

what  I  fear  is that people in moments  of  impending

defeat  act  like desperadoes. They might dissolve  the

City Council in the hope that there might be some civil

commotion which will give them a magnificent excuse why

votes  should not be cast and the elections  postponed.

All   this   becomes  very  dangerous  and  unpleasant,

because, technically speaking, it is no breach  of  the

constitution for this Government to carry on until  the

2nd  of  July, three months from the date of compulsory

automatic dissolution of this Assembly, namely, the 2nd

of April, bringing it to the 2nd of July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November, when I moved my motion, we were

confident   that,  whatever  their  shortcomings,   the

Government  and the Ministers would play  according  to

the  rules of the game. Frankly, now I am not so  sure,

not  because we think that we would lose if it  is  not

played according to the rules of the game. However  the

game  is played, I believe the result is the same.  But

if the game is played the dirty way, then the aftermath

is  unpleasant. I do not, for one moment, suggest  that

there  are going to be trials as what happened in  Cuba

or  in Baghdad, but if people get injured - as they were

injured  in  Kallang;  two of  my  Party  members  were

stabbed - well,  if they were killed in  outlying  areas,

then a lot of unpleasantness must follow. And we do not

want Castro trials here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore ask the Chief Minister whether he would

not  seriously  consider that, in view  of  the  public

alarm  which he has caused by what he said at the  last

sitting,  he  and  his  Ministers should  vacate  their

offices during the period of the elections. Sir, let us

be  honest  and  realistic about it. We know  that  the

Ministers  are hard-working men, but we also know  that

the administration will carry on exactly the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>



without them. The Chief Minister is looking after three

portfolios - Chief  Minister,  Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare, and Minister for Education. I do not think the

schools  have suffered as a result of the loss  of  the

former  Minister  for Education. Another  Minister  was

well  enough  to  attend  a banquet  for  the  Duke  of

Edinburgh  but not well enough to attend a  sitting  of

the   Assembly.  He  recovered  well  enough  to  issue

statements  to the newspapers, but not well  enough  to

attend the final sitting of this Assembly. Nobody is in

any  doubt  that,  because of the  heavy  stresses  and

strains on his nervous system over the last four years,

it  would be unkind to expect him to do much work now.

Therefore, I would suggest that if not much work anyway

can  be  expected before Nomination Day,  certainly  no

work  at  all  is  possible after Nomination  Day  when

electioneering proper begins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no objection to the Minister taking leave

with full pay prior to retirement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Very generous!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There is the illustrious example of

the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya. He has

openly  acknowledged that he wanted to  go  campaigning

for  his Party. He has taken leave and will retire from

his  post  as Prime Minister. We have no objections  to

our  Ministers doing likewise in order that  they  will

devote  their  undivided  care  and  attention  to  the

election. If that is not possible, then I say, much  as

I  detest having to say it, that the driving instructor

should  put  the brakes on, because the pupil  has  not

learned  in four years and it is reckless to allow  him

to career along the public highways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say point-blank that had our survival as a Party

and  as  a  movement  depended on the  wisdom  and  the

judgment  of our illiterate Ministers alone,  we  might

not  be here today to make this plea for clean and fair

elections. I would say, having decided to allow  us  to

continue  right  up till now, it is  the  duty  of  the

driving  instructor  to see that the  driving  is  done

according to the Highway Code.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Ministers continue - I do not say that they

themselves  will  indulge in any  illegal  or  unlawful

activities -  there  are bound  to  be  cases  of  minor

misuse, and sometimes major misuse of power. I  give  a

simple  illustration. The Chief Minister at the Kallang

by-election  was  moving  in and  out  of  the  polling

stations with ease to supervise and see how the polling

was  going on. I was the election agent of my candidate

and  I  could not enter the polling stations.  That  is

just a minor instance. I do not suggest that he went in

and coerced anybody to vote for his side. But I did see

him enter the polling stations, something which I could

not  do, even as an election agent. I happened  to  see

it,  Sir. Election agents were not allowed to enter.  I

was  an  election agent, too, and I was not allowed  to

enter.  We  all  know  that, however  impartial  police

officers  are,  if  Ministers turn  up  at  the  police

station  on  behalf of the people in the lock-up,  they

are bound to be polite, because it is their duty to  be

polite. I am not suggesting that the Ministers will  do

it,  but  I  am seriously suggesting that some  of  the

characters  to be found in not too distant  association

with  some  Ministers are quite capable of doing  these

things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I say nothing is lost if they publicly

divest  themselves of their power, positions and  their

prestige  and influence by vacating their office  until

polling day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would remind the Chief Minister about this. He

has  indicated to me that he is prepared to  set  up  a

liaison  committee  as a guarantee of  fair  play.  The

Chief   Secretary  shall  be  the  Chairman   of   that

committee,  and each Party in this Assembly shall  have

one  representative  with direct access  to  the  Chief

Secretary  on  all  complaints  of  partiality  by  the

police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is prepared to go thus far; if he is prepared

to  acknowledge that, in fact, there is concern because

of  his intended or unintended remarks, then I say, let

us   publicly  take  a  position  which  is  not   only

unassailable but appears manifestly to be unassailable.

If  they  vacate their office or give us an undertaking

today



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>



that they will take leave after Nomination Day, then  I

am quite prepared to accept that. But if they say, "No,

although  we  cannot do anything, any useful  work,  no

momentous decisions to be taken other than those  which

the  Minister for Local Government, Lands and  Housing,

talked to the Press about, we still must -"



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> On a point of

information, Sir-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> I would like to ask the hon. Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar to which Press I talked  about  the

suspension of the City Council?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> To the Straits Times and the

Singapore Standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid </b>rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. That

is a deliberate lie.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the Hon.

Minister  meant that the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  was

telling a deliberate lie, or whether the Straits  Times

or  Singapore Standard was telling lies. If it  is  the

latter,  of course, he is in order, but if  it  is  the

former, he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> It could be both, and it could be

only the Member for Tanjong Pagar, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister, of course, is

completely out of order. He knows he is out  of  order.

This  is the last sitting, I might remind the Minister,

and perhaps he would like to withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> As you please, Sir, I withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am not in the least perturbed,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  whether  the  Minister  for  Local

Government, Lands and Housing thinks that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>



it  is the reporter or I that has misconstrued him. But

I  am  reassured that, at a public forum, on  a  public

occasion,  he  is sufficiently conscious of  the  moral

rights and wrongs of the case to say it was a lie if it

was said. That is enough. In other words, he knows that

it  is  (1) an act fraught with danger; (2) despicable;

(3) not to be embarked upon recklessly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid </b>rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> I was only asking the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar how he got the information when he  said

that  I  did  say such and such a thing to two  leading

newspapers in Singapore. But at the same time,  Sir,  I

did  not  give  any  indication  to  him,  or  to  this

Assembly,  or  to you, Sir, that I will  not  take  any

action  in  any  matter  in connection  with  the  City

Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If ever I need justification for my

motion,  this is it. In other words, when  the  shilly-shallying  is  over,  a responsible  Minister  of  this

Government  is  now saying, yes, he is contemplating  a

highly hazardous piece of political chicanery. Sir,



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the heat is on! I think

the  word  "chicanery" in that sense is unparliamentary

and I think the hon. Member should withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, may I, with your leave,

withdraw that and substitute the word "adventure"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure this House that it is our firm and

determined  resolve  to play this game  peacefully  and

clean. We have nothing to lose by doing anything  else.

The  odds are with us, and we are confident that if  we

play the cards down to the last one, the score will  be

on our side.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sure?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Whether the City Council be

scrapped or not is a matter of indifference to  us.  We

shall  see  that there are no civil commotions  and  we

shall see that there are elections, unless the Governor

is  to  be  proved a liar when he said, in reply  to  a

message  from this Assembly, and an Address  from  this

Assembly,  that  there  will be elections - polling  will

take  place 60 days from the date of dissolution.  That

is  what is most important. If polling does take  place

60  days  from the date of dissolution, be it tomorrow,

the  day  after tomorrow, or at the end of  this  week,

then we are satisfied. But if it does not, and there is

unpleasant  gossip  that perhaps it  might  not  be  so

because conditions may not permit it, then I say it  is

just sheer folly, because if they wanted to prevent  us

from  winning they should have done it earlier - in 1956.

1957 - but not after 1958 and into 1959, for the tide has

run  out  and the sands are glittering in the  gleaming

sun that is to rise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Chief Minister frankly to meet my point.

All I really want - and if what he says can be taken  at

face value, he also wants - are clean and fair elections.

I say I do not care what form of guarantee it takes. If

we  are satisfied that there will be elections and they

will be fair and clean, we shall rest content.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in view of the public disgust and loss of

public  confidence in the Government  as  a  result  of

recent   disclosures.  This  Assembly  calls  for   the

immediate resignation of the Government and the holding

of General Elections.



<br><br>12.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

first reaction on receiving this motion in the name  of

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar was this. I asked  myself

what was the purpose of the Member for Tanjong Pagar in

moving this motion at this juncture? I tried to analyse

the  reasons, like a surgeon undertaking a post-mortem.

What  makes  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  at  this

juncture  want  to shorten the life of  the  Government

when  it  has got a few more days to go? We  know  that

Government is committed to hold the elections - if  I  am

wrong,  I  hope  the Chief Minister will correct  me - on

31st May. Sir, I came to the conclusion that the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  is again seeking  to  turn  public

interest away from a matter which is concerned with the

national  movement of our country. Sir, the man-in-the-street in every nook and corner of Singapore knows  too

well  that  the  $500,000 story is already  a  foregone

conclusion. Sir, the public seem to have lost  interest

in the disclosure of the $500,000 gift, but the general

topic  after the disclosure of 4th March is whether  it

is  true  or  false  about the meeting  on  the  famous

subversive clause 30 which bars the ex-comrades of  the

P.A.P. from taking part in the elections. Sir, I regret

that  the ex-Member for Cairnhill is not with us today.

The accusation of double-crossing was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>



actually  raised  by  him. Sir, I quote  from  Hansard,

Volume  2,  No.  24,  column 1736.  The  ex-Member  for

Cairnhill said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The P.A.P., it is notorious, is extremely anxious to

deprive  its  left  wing of the  very  people  whom  it

pretends to befriend. We kiss Devan Nair, we kiss Devan

Nair  on both cheeks, and wait for Lennox-Boyd to  hang

him from the back!"



<br><br>Sir,  I  am  sure hon. Members can recollect the  reply

from  the Member for Tanjong Pagar. At column  1738  of

Hansard, Volume 2, No. 24, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think he understands that when serious charges of

double-crossing,  charges  that  we  have  cheated  the

people, most of the people, most of the time..."



<br><br>That  was the answer to the accusation of the ex-Member

for Cairnhill, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me the purpose of the motion in the name of

the Member for Tanjong Pagar is mainly to switch public

notice  from the famous by-election. Sir,  if  a  smear

campaign is going on, you can even say that the  Member

for Changi receives money from American capitalists and

Chinese Communists and that he is a political bankrupt!

Maybe this is the only time for me to move an amendment

to the motion to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, in view of the public disgust and loss of

public confidence in the Member for Tanjong Pagar as  a

result  of recent disclosures, this Assembly calls  for

the  immediate  resignation of the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar."



<br><br>But,  Sir, I know that you will rule out this amendment

and  therefore  it is useless for me to seek  political

capital at the expense of the Member for Tanjong Pagar.

For the sake of national unity, I do not intend to move

a motion censuring the Member for Tanjong Pagar. Today,

the  people  of  this  country are  not  interested  in

whether  the  Member for Havelock  or  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar will become the Prime Minister. What  the

people  are  interested  in is  when  can  they  really

achieve  their national aspirations and  100  per  cent

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how many of us here are honestly interested in

international affairs? A global war can develop in  May

if  the  Berlin crisis cannot be solved. How many  hon.

Members  here  are really concerned with  our  economic

position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>



which  is  threatening  to  collapse?  Unemployment  is

increasing. Factories are closing down one by  one  and

yet we find the Member for Tanjong Pagar, the leader of

a  well  organised  political party, leisurely  playing

such  dirty  politics by bringing  up  this  motion  to

censure the Government and to demand its resignation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help but support the comment of the Chairman

of the Workers Party that if this motion were two years

earlier,   the  situation  would  have  been   entirely

different.  Sir,  unfortunately,  two  years  ago,  the

relationship between the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  and

the Chief Minister was too good. They went hand in hand

to  bring  back  the famous clause 30, and  if  I  were

seeking  more  political capital, I would also  censure

the Member for Havelock who was also connected with the

famous  clause 30. But, Sir, I do not wish to do  that.

For  the  last four years, I learned nothing  from  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..one thing we never unlearn is that if you want to

be a force, you have to be clean."



<br><br>That  is  from Hansard, Volume 3, No. 24, column  2177,

but  now I begin to doubt the cleanliness of the Member

for Tanjong Pagar when he double-crossed in respect of

the famous clause 30.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, it is the duty of the Member for Tanjong

Pagar to prove how clean he is, how the disclosure came

before  the  eyes of the public; because, Sir,  I  have

gone  through the Hansard of the 3rd and 4th  March.  I

have  tried to trace the reason why the mover  of  this

motion moved it, yet I only found in Volume 3, No.  24.

column 2178:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We do not want to embarrass the whole of the

Government  as  a  result of investigating  Mr  Chew's

affairs.  The Chief Minister knows exactly how  I  feel

about the matter."



<br><br>Again  the relationship between the Chief Minister  and

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar is still good. They  know

exactly. The Member for Tanjong Pagar said only  a  few

days  ago that he had no intention of embarrassing  the

whole   of   the   Government  as  a  result   of   the

investigation - that means the disclosure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, in the Hansard, how many times

did  he repeat that the disclosure is no crime,  no

act of illegality, and that there was no suggestion

of  a crime having been committed? Yet we have this

motion before us. This morning when the hon. Member

for  Tanjong Pagar moved a motion, maybe he did not

intend  to  link  this  motion  with  the  $500,000

disclosure.  What he is interested in is  what  the

Chief Minister has said, "If he plays dirty, I will

play dirty in the coming elections." If that is the

case,  Sir,  what  is the extent  of  dirt  in  our

politics?  The hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  said

that  it is not a fact, yet he seems to accept  the

challenge - "If you play dirty, I also  know  how  to

play  dirty."  Since  the hon. Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar is so confident in accepting the challenge of

"dirty politics" that is coming into this Assembly,

therefore  the purpose of this motion  is  part  of

dirty politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since dirty politics is coming into being, I

think  it  is best for me to give some truth  about

what  has been going on during the last four years.

The  national aspiration of this country  has  from

time  to  time  been  quoted by  various  political

leaders.  In May 1956, Sir, - I hope you can remember

it - on  the day when the constitutional talks  broke

down,  I  had an unexpected call that very midnight

from the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar and the hon.

Member for Bukit Timah. They kindly offered to call

a  Press conference for me to denounce the Lib-Soc.

I can still remember the exact words of my reply. I

said,  "It  is  very kind of you to  make  such  an

arrangement. My English is no handicap to me  since

I  know very little of what has happened in London.

But please allow me, after the Press conference, to

disclose  that this Press conference  was  actually

arranged  by  you."  Sir,  of  course,  this  Press

conference never materialised. The hon. Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar and the hon. Member for Bukit  Timah

knew  that  I  have the prestige of  the  Singapore

delegation; I have the national unity of the people

of  Singapore at heart. And I refused such  a  kind

offer.  If I would kill Lib-Soc, I would be killing

it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore, but never in London. Sir,  that  is

part  of  dirty  politics. I have another  example,

Sir - citizenship which was also denied, as given  in

the  Hansard  of  27th April, 1957.  We  know  that

citizenship was one of the items in the  Agreement,

but  I  never  expected that the idea  was  happily

supported by the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  to

oppose this item's inclusion in the agenda.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The motion is moved,".. . in

view  of  the  public disgust and  loss  of  public

confidence in the Government as a result of  recent

disclosures".  The word "recent",  I  take  it,  is

recent - just before the sitting today - and it  looks

as though the hon. Member for Changi is making it a

little  more recent. I suggest that he is  going  a

bit  too far from the motion, and I ask him to  try

and  keep as close as possible to the terms of  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, it seems that the 1956

talks are rather far from this motion. I will quote

a  recent  one - I do not know how recent  you  will

consider  it - the case of Lim Ching  Joo,  a  motion

moved  by  the hon. Member for Queenstown  charging

the  Special Branch with cruelty and torture. I was

supposed  to  have  seconded  the  motion.  I   was

informed by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  that

the Chief Minister said that Lim Ching Joo's wounds

were self-inflicted - a part of Communist tactics  to

embarrass the Government. Sir, all these I  treated

as strictly confidential. It is not our duty really

to  break the rule which politicians usually  think

of.  But, nevertheless, in Singapore today politics

is   not   personal,   and  the   frustration   and

disappointment is widespread.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back to the famous clause about the

subversive elements. The Nanyang Siang Pau and  the

Sin  Chew  fit  Poh gave headline  news  about  the

French  News  Agency's  story  that  "the  Colonial

Office  spokesman denies the meeting  took  place."

Therefore, the P.A.P. spokesman issued a statement,

"We  are  very pleased with such a denial from  the

spokesman of the Colonial Office." Sir, why  should

the Colonial Office choose such a crucial moment to

give  our  Hon. the Chief Minister a slap,  "He  is

telling lies!", and the Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>



Minister  is  hurt? Sir, to me the  appointment  of  a

Commission  of  Inquiry into the $500,000  is  not  as

important as the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry

into  the leakage from the Income Tax Department.  But

still more important than this is the setting up of  a

Commission of Inquiry to investigate into this "dirty"

subversive clause. This is most important. The  people

of  Singapore  are anxious to know how dirty  politics

is, and how long politics has been double-crossing and

manoeuvring  in this country. "We are  loyal!  We  are

proud  of  our comrades in Changi Prison!" Sir,  these

are  merely  crocodile tears, and are not  from  human

beings! I have a file here; a "Crocodile" brand file!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I sincerely and humbly demand the

withdrawal  of  this motion because, if  I  may  be  a

little  rude, Sir, it is not only bad and  selfish  of

those who make it a political stunt, but the important

thing is that they are seeking to destroy our national

unity,      thereby     deepening     the     rift - the

differences - among our people - between the rich and  the

poor,  the  Malays and the Chinese. Do they know  that

there  might be an open clash as a result of  twisting

the charge that the U.M.N.O., which merely accused the

P.A.P.,  are  anti-Chinese? We  know  the  P.A.P. are

seeking  the  support of our Malay  brothers - once  you

wear  a  songkok, then you are a Malay - to support  the

P.P.S.O.  (Preservation of Public Security Ordinance).

Woe  to the Federation of Malaya! Sir, all these  make

me  think that the motive of the mover of this  motion

is  most  deplorable. They are only  seeking  personal

glorification  and Party interests, and  not  for  the

welfare or the interests of the people of Singapore or

even for a Greater Malaya as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second reason for demanding the withdrawal of

this motion is this. Do not create a bad precedent  in

the coming election campaign through this motion which

is irresponsible, unfounded, and unnecessary. The life

of  the  Assembly runs for only a few more  days.  The

date   of  the  general  elections  has  been   agreed

unofficially. And yet we have this motion! I quote one

example.  I attended one election rally of the  P.A.P.

and I heard the speech of one P.A.P. speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>



Mr Yong Nyuk Lin, the General Manager of the Overseas

Assurance  Company Limited. He accused the  S.P.A. of

being   supported  by  capitalists  from  abroad   and

locally.   What  is  wrong  with  the  S.P.A. boxing

supported  by  capitalists? As the hon.  Member  said,

"Mr  Chew Swee Kee should probably have said, 'I have

got  the money. So what?'" It is the same thing,  Sir,

who  is Mr Yong? This may only be a coincidence. They

all come from a multi-millionaire banker's family. The

hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar and Mr Yong  Nyuk  Lin

are married to the same daughter - oh, no, no, different

daughter-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must from now on

confine  himself to the motion. He has kept  wandering

away  ad  lib,  and I have given him  enough  rope.  I

suggest that he should now come back to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, May I apologise? I only

wanted  to  quote  an example of  the  dangers  if  we

continue  to  conduct  our  political  activities   or

political campaigns to such an extent. As a result  of

the  nature and motive of this motion, I am forced  to

mention  that it is wonderful that a multi-millionaire

banker can produce two brilliant sons-in-law!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third reason for demanding the withdrawal of the

motion   is  this.  The  P.A.P. have  been  boasting,

especially  the  hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar,  from

time to time that they are genuinely supported by  the

masses.  Therefore, they are confident they will  come

into  power and the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar will

be  Prime Minister, as we have heard this morning.  It

is  my  business to know income tax. Let me take  this

opportunity to assess how genuinely and how  popularly

the  P.A.P. are really supported by the masses.  They

called  for  a boycott of the welcome to the  Duke  of

Edinburgh,  which  the hon. Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

thought would be fully supported and would succeed. He

has  every confidence in moving this motion to request

the Government to resign, quickly and much earlier, so

that he can become Prime Minister. Sir, I tell



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>



you it is not that simple. The public are not so simple

as  they  were a few years back. The call for a boycott

of  the  welcome  to His Royal Highness,  the  Duke  of

Edinburgh, was a failure. They should have learnt  this

lesson  and thought over why the boycott was a failure.

It  is  because we have failed to bring about  national

unity.  It is not a matter of who can become the  Prime

Minister.  We really must succeed in bringing  all  our

people  to  realise  one aim - to  achieve  our  national

aspiration - but  not  merely to ask this  Government  to

resign  quickly so that someone can step in  to  become

the  Prime  Minister. The whole motive  of  the  motion

looks like that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the call to boycott the Duke of Edinburgh

could   be  supported  by  all  political  Parties   in

Singapore in order to challenge the symbol of  colonial

power,  then  what  was the result? Unfortunately,  the

hon.  Member  for  Tanjong Pagar can  never  see  that.

National   unity  and  national  interests   are   more

important   than  personal  glorification   and   Party

popularity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I wish the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  can  accept my humble advice in the interest  of

the  people  and  for the unity of  this  country,  and

withdraw  the  motion.  If not - I beg  your  indulgence,

Sir - maybe  I am too small to issue a challenge  to  the

almighty  hero of Tanjong Pagar - but let  me  extend  my

humble invitation to him to come to Changi constituency

to  answer the accusations which I put forward today in

this  House. Let me then answer him in public.  Let  me

answer him without any protection or privilege. Let  me

repeat all the allegations, all the accusations,  which

for  years  I  have levelled at him, in  front  of  the

public,  in  front  of the people  of  Changi.  Sir,  I

consider  this motion selfish and unnecessary.  I  also

have  a  strong doubt as to the integrity and sincerity

of  the  hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar in the  national

struggle.  I now wish to withdraw the remarks  which  I

made about the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>



In  Hansard, Volume 2, No. 24, column 1780 - this  is  my

only  chance  to  withdraw this  remark - "this  Assembly

could  lose hundreds of Lim Cher Khengs but  could  not

afford to lose the Member for Tanjong Pagar...". Sir, I

wish,  with  your permission, to substitute now,  "that

this  Assembly could lose hundreds of the  hon.  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar but could not afford  to  lose  the

Member for Changi."

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

doubt that public confidence has been shaken because of

recent  disclosures,  and that there  has  been  public

disgust  at the sorry state of Singapore politics.  But

the People's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>



Action Party cannot set itself up on a pinnacle  as  if

it  had  not  contributed to this feeling  of  disgust.

However, it is not my desire to add to the mud-slinging



at  recent sittings of this House. What we want to know

is  this. What proposals has the Chief Minister got  by

which  his Party and all political Parties, inside  and

outside this House, can together ensure, as far  as  we

possibly  can, individually and collectively,  that  we

shall  have  clean  elections, quite  apart  from  the

provisions  of  the Ordinance recently passed  in  this

House?  We on this side of the House are ready to  make

our contribution, but the initiative and responsibility

at  this  moment  lie with the Chief Minister  and  his

Government.  Surely this is the kernel of  this  debate

and  the  sooner it is satisfactorily answered  perhaps

the  better for the dignity of this House, both now and

in the future.



<br><br>3.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech

this  morning, the Member for Tanjong Pagar  tried  his

best  to pin me down to saying that I would not  embark

on  an  adventure  that would dispense  with  the  City

Council. He even alleged, very wrongly though,  that  I

had  indicated  to some reporters of the Straits  Times

and of the Singapore Standard that I would do so. Well,

Sir,  to  put  matters in their proper  perspective,  I

never  said any such thing to any reporter, be  it  the

Singapore  Standard or the Straits Times, or  for  that

matter,  even  Moscow's Pravda. But at the  same  time,

Sir,  I  will  not be drawn into the P.A.P. trap  into

tying my hands vis-a-vis the City Council so long as  I

am  the Minister concerned. It is my duty to the people

of  Singapore  to  see  that the City  Council  is  run

properly and for the good of its inhabitants,  and  not

for  any  political Party or its stooges.  I  will  not

shirk my responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the cumulative damaging effect of the

various  actions of the present City Council since  its

inception  in December 1957, and in view  of  the  many

representations which have been made to me from time to

time,  not  only from the general public but also  from

many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>



of  the  City Councillors themselves and from the  City

Council  Staff  Unions, I have come to  the  conclusion

that  the  City  administration in  the  hands  of  the

present  Councillors has reached the  point  where  the

public interest demands serious consideration by me  as

to  whether  I  should intervene or  not.  I  therefore

intend  to  take  all  such  Steps  should  I  deem  it

necessary  in  the  public  interest,  irrespective  of

whether  the People's Action Party accuses me of  doing

so  for  political ends or not. As far as the  People's

Action Party is concerned, anything we on this side  of

the  Bench  do  has a political bias - not so  with  them

though,  even when they institute a People's Court  and

the Gestapo system in the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to the motion before the House. Why

has the leader of the People's Action Party brought  it

up  at  this late stage of this Assembly's life? Is  it

because   he  really  and  honestly  fears  that   this

Government would play dirty politics? Does he sincerely

and  honestly believe or think that we would do  so?  I

will  tell you why, Sir. The reason is this. The longer

the  elections are delayed, even for a week, mind  you,

the  worse  it would be for the People's Action  Party.

They  know this, and the leader of the People's  Action

Party  knows it as well as I do. We all know  that  the

stock  of the People's Action Party has fallen  in  the

market. The people no longer believe in them, and  that

applies to everyone, from the rich towkay right down to

the humble hawker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cuddling of the hawkers by the People's Action

Party  cannot deceive them. The hawker is no  fool.  He

knows this, he can think, and he also realises that all

this  P.A.P. talk about educating the hawkers prior  to

elections  could  only end up in  the  jailing  of  the

hawkers  after  the elections. Yes, Mr  Speaker.  They

know  what  will  happen  should  the  P.A.P. win  the

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, the direct attack of U.M.N.O. on

the People's Action Party for their non-Communist stand

has not helped them at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate interrupting the Hon.

Minister,  but he appears to be making a  speech  which



ought  to be made on a different occasion. We are  now,

of course, debating a motion that the Government should

resign.  We are not debating relations between U.M.N.O.

and P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for

your guidance. But at the same time I think this is one

of  the reasons why the P.A.P. has put in such a motion

before the Assembly, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Of course, there is nothing to

prevent  the Minister from just mentioning  in  passing

these  matters, but only very briefly.  But  he  cannot

develop them.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Thank you, Sir. Well, Sir, it is

only  after my Party's all-out exposure of the People's

Action Party that the people of Singapore are beginning

to  realise that in the situation in which Malaya is in

today, the word "non-Communist" is synonymous with pro-Communist,  and  to  me, Sir, a non-Communist  is  more

dangerous than a full-blooded Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these factors, Sir, have compelled the People's

Action  Party  to demand an immediate election  of  the

resignation of the Government. Any further delay  would

naturally  mean loss of votes to them. It  is  good  to

hear  the leader of the People's Action Party say  that

the  P.A.P. will not start any riots or strikes  during

the  forthcoming  election campaign even  if  the  City

Council is suspended. In fact, Sir, only the other  day

at  a mass meeting, the Member for Tanjong Pagar warned

his  supporters not to involve themselves in  any  such

monstrous occupation. In October 1956, the same warning

was  given  over and over again by the same  honourable

gentleman. Then what happened? We had our riots and  we

had  our  strikes. I do not know, Sir, whether  today's

assurance  by  the People's Action Party leader  was  a

coincidence.  But  somehow  to  me  it  rings  a   bell

somewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me warn the P.A.P. or someone who

know  them very well - we call them party atas pagar  (it

is a Malay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>



term) - the  Party on this side of the House  will  fight

the  elections clean. We know the People's Action Party

tactics  and  we also know how able they  are  and  how

vicious  they  can  be if it means  a  life  and  death

struggle for them. Sacrificing their own comrades means

nothing to them. What more sacrificing their opponents?

Let me warn them again, Sir. Play your cards clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Sir, the public is disgusted. The public has

lost confidence, but not in this Government. The public

is  disgusted  and has lost confidence in the  People's

Action Party.



<br><br>3.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

motion reads,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, in view of the public disgust and loss of

public  confidence in the Government  as  a  result  of

recent   disclosures,  this  Assembly  calls  for   the

immediate resignation of the Government and the holding

of General Elections."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have the recent disclosures got to do with the

present Government, the S.P.A., I do not know. If there

is any money received, it is not by this Government. It

was  received by the Labour Front Government. I,  as  a

member  of  the S.P.A., know that the S.P.A. Government

had  nothing  at  all to do with using  money  from  an

outside source.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was disclosed in this House by the hon. Mr

Francis Thomas that during the elections of 1957,  when

the  Labour  Front  had the unholy  alliance  with  the

P.A.P.,  money was received at that time,  but  no  one

revealed the secret. For all you know, Sir, the  P.A.P.

may  have had a share in it themselves, and that is why

nothing  was said. As far as I know, and as a member  I

know  nothing and it has not come to my knowledge  that

this   Government  has  received  money  from  outside.

Perhaps the P.A.P. and the Labour Front know very  well

that  since  the  S.P.A. are not receiving  money  from

outside,  it is no use sticking with them. They  cannot

get  anything so it might be just as well for  them  to

reveal  the  secret for their own gain. This  is  dirty

politics  at its very worst. I say that the  motion  is

brought up only to wash



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>



dirty linen for their own gain and this Government  has

got nothing to do with it whatsoever.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

should like to make reference to one part of the speech

made  by  the  Member  for Changi.  He  mentioned  that

because  the  Colonial Office had denied the  statement

made  by the Chief Minister, the leaders of the  P.A.P.

had  applauded  and patted themselves on  their  backs.

But, Sir, having studied history for some time - and I am

still  interested  in  history,  especially  diplomatic

history - I think I can tell you, Sir, that even if there

had  been  a  conference between the three of  them-the

Chief  Minister, the Member for Tanjong Pagar  and  the

Colonial Secretary, Mr Lennox-Boyd - the Colonial Office

would  have no such record. As far as I know,  official

records  do  not  put down such things  that  happened.

Official records in the Colonial Office would not  have

recorded this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us here believe what the Chief Minister said

and some of us know, Sir, that there can be no official

record  in  the Colonial Office. So the statement  from

the  Colonial  Office  in London is  neither  here  nor

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the motion, Sir, "recent disclosures"

was  mentioned.  Without going very far  back - only  the

last  sitting on the 4th of March - four important things

were  disclosed.  First,  the  $500,000;  second,   the

conveyance of confidential information from Mr Francis

Thomas  to the Secretary-General of the P.A.P.;  third,

the subversive clause; and fourth, the Income Tax file.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those four disclosures, Sir, have indeed shaken some

of  our  confidence, not in the Government but in  some

politicians.  Some  had stooped  so  low  as  to  cause

disclosure  of  a  secret  file  from  the  Income  Tax

Department.  One  had  stooped  so  low  as  to  convey

confidence put in him to a Party in the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems a bit strange, of

course,  that  the Deputy Speaker should be  called  to

order. But I think the Deputy Speaker must know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>



that  certain  of his remarks have already  been  over-ruled, directly if not indirectly, and he ought not  to

have  passed  those  remarks. Will he  please  withdraw

them?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> I doubly apologise, Sir, I will not

comment any more on these disclosures. But I would like

to ask - what is the meaning of the word "public" in this

motion?  It is not the "public" of Singapore. The  word

"public"  used in this motion must mean the  P.A.P. - the

P.A.P. without  Marcus  who  has  just  resigned.  The

disgust  is  with the P.A.P. and the loss of confidence

also is with the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to close by reminding this House,

and the whole of Singapore, of the warning given by the

Member for Queenstown - to ask the people to vote not for

the  Party that has not done the right thing,  not  for

the  man that has not done the right thing, but to vote

for  the  Party  which is working in the  interests  of

Singapore as a whole.



<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

so  much breath and time have been wasted. What is  the

idea? There is going to be an inquiry into the $500,000

matter.  There  is  going to be  an  inquiry  into  the

leakage of income tax information. Sir, I think  it  is

premature  to  say  that the people  of  Singapore  are

disgusted and have lost confidence in the Government.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you dangle a

high-powered motorcycle in front of a youngster who has

used  a  push-bike, you will see the  reaction  on  his

face.  He just cannot contain himself. He wants to  get

on  that  motorcycle and make use of the power  at  his

disposal.  That, today, is exactly the  position  which

the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar is in. He just cannot

wait.  He wants to become Prime Minister as quickly  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar often talks and

behaves in this House and outside as if he is the equal

of Nehru or Mao Tze-tung or any of the world leaders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often, Sir, in this House talk of Singapore as a

country. Maybe we are setting our sights too high. Let

us get down to earth and realise what we really are. A

tiny speck of an island with great nations all around

us. Do not let us fool ourselves into imagining for one

moment that we are a country. We are not a country. Do

not let us fool ourselves into imagining that our Prime

Minister in the next Government can ever be the equal

of even the smallest of the Prime Ministers of the big

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we aspire to? What is our future? We went to

London not to ask for independence, because we

recognised that Singapore as a sovereign independent

nation is just nonsense. We recognise that at best our

future lies in integration with the Federation of

Malaya, and when we reach that goal, we just become a

tiny portion of the mainland of Malaya. There will be

no more nonsense about having a Prime Minister in

Singapore and a Cabinet. We realise that Singapore has

not the wherewithal to become a sovereign independent

nation. We realise that we can never be a country by

itself. Then why should our politicians put on airs?

Why should they not get on with their real business of

looking after the community's interests? It is a

community, not a nation or country, though I have been

guilty of using that word often in excited debates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the getting on with the business of

governing and enhancing the interests of the people,

how much contribution to that have the Member for

Tanjong Pagar and his Party made in the last four

years? The Member for Tanjong Pagar and his Party feel

that their elected representatives are there for

political purposes only. They do not realise that the

people elect representatives to further the interests

of the people in all fields - educational, medical, and

especially in the economic field. Until the last three

or four months, I had been responsible in this House

for goading the Member for Tanjong Pagar into speaking

his mind on economic matters. What does he feel about

measures that the Government adopts for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>



the bettering of the economy? Absolutely-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If he will attend the mass rally of

the People's Action Party on Sunday at the 5� m.s.

Serangoon, he will have a first-hand report of the



economic policy of the Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> That I am sure I will have, Sir,

at a late stage, when the elections are near. But when

a man is elected to the Assembly, where the economic

policy of the island is being debated, whether he is in

the Government or in the Opposition, his constituents

expect him to participate in it, to give his views, to

contribute to the economic betterment of the whole. But

so far, Sir, the P.A.P.'s representatives in this House

have kept aloof. I do not know why they have kept

aloof. Perhaps it is because they have no economic

policy or perhaps they have no inclination to

participate in mundane matters concerning the daily

lives of the people. They set their sights only on

political power. What the people expect is for them to

participate in those discussions which contribute to

the causes which make Singapore tick today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they seem to think that they are elected only

for a political purpose. Now what could that political

purpose be? Could it be the spread of Communism? The

Member for Tanjong Pagar has time and again said that

he is a non-Communist and that his Party - the remnants

after August 1957 - is non-Communist. I am inclined to

believe him personally, Sir, that he and certain

members of his Party are non-Communist. Then, Sir,

could the political purpose be a nationalist purpose in

the context of Singapore which is not a nation? Let us

call it "nationalist" for the sake of using that word.

In that case, what does nationalism demand? It demands

a bettering of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>



the  economy  of the country. It demands looking  after

the interest of the population. But they have not taken

part  in  any of the debates until recently on  any  of

those  subjects. Either the Member has been out of  the

House  or he has just sat quietly through. Even  during

the  Budget sittings, or when policy speeches are  made

by  the Government for the coming year, the hon. Member

has not talked constructively on any of these subjects.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Minister would like

to  assist  the  Chair by relating his remarks  to  the

motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Certainly, Sir. My remarks are

intended  to show that there is a bad intention  behind

the motion moved by the hon. Member.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is perfectly in order, if

the  hon.  Member  will just, in passing,  mention  all

these  matters.  He seems to be going much  too  deeply

into these matters for the purposes of this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I bow to your ruling, Sir. My

understanding of this motion is that this is  a  motion

of censure on the Government at this late stage, and  a

motion  of  censure  on  the  Government  moved  by  an

Opposition  political Party can only have  a  political

motive and, therefore, in defending the Government,  if

I  can  expose  the motive of the Opposition  political

Party, I will have succeeded in having a fair debate on

the  motion  and  justifying why the motion  should  be

thrown out.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not, of course, stopping the

Minister from doing just exactly what he seeks  to  do.

What I am stopping the Minister from doing is going too

much  into  detail. In other words, he is debating  the

conduct of the Member for Tanjong Pagar in this  House,

which is wrong, of course.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you, Sir, I have said that

nationalism  then cannot be a motive,  because  I  have

given  the reasons when you stopped me, Sir. What  then

can  be  the real political purpose that they  have  in

mind? Have they designs on the Federation of Malaya  as

a whole and not just the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>



tiny  island of Singapore? If that is so, I  think,  in

political  fairness, they should come out strongly  and

say,  "We intend not to govern Singapore but to  govern

the  whole of Malaya." Beyond that, Sir, I cannot think

what  other political purpose they could have.  Perhaps

the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  may,  in  his  reply,

enlighten  me and the public of Singapore  so  that  we

will  know exactly where we stand with the P.A.P.,  and

perhaps,  if his motives are laudable, I am  sure  that

many people will then support him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You want to join too?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Not until I know what the P.A.P.

stands for. At the moment, all that the people know  is

that  the  P.A.P. goes round in circles with  lightning

enmeshed  in  it,  but the P.A.P. has  never  come  out

openly with what its ultimate political aim is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I sincerely believe that this motion is intended

to make political capital and the intention of the hon.

Member   at   the  beginning  was  to  make   political

capital - to hit the nails into the coffin, so to  speak,

after he had exposed the so-called $500,000 scandal  in

this  House and to capitalise on that. Evidently today,

Sir,  he  has  shown that that was not his purpose.  At

least  he  claimed that that was not his  purpose,  but

that his real purpose was a sincere fear - a sincere fear

of this democratic Government which has not in the last

four years used its powers as the P.A.P. has been using

its powers in the City Council in the last two years! A

sincere  fear  that this Government  would  act  in  an

undemocratic manner!



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, it is not my intention to speak on

the  substantive motion except in so far as it concerns

a  matter which was mentioned by the Member for Tanjong

Pagar   in  moving  the  motion,  and  that   was   the

understanding  he has had from the Chief Minister  that

he  was  going  to  propose  setting  up  an  All-Party

Committee  to assist in overcoming the difficulties  to

which the hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>



Member  referred. I understand that it is the intention

of  the  Chief Minister to make such a proposal  and  I

would like to make it clear at this stage that it  will

be  important, in my view, that the terms of  reference

of such a Committee should be very clearly drawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister intends to propose that there

should  be  a Liaison Advisory Committee on  which  all

Parties   taking  part  in  the  elections  should   be

represented  and which would sit under my chairmanship.

I  think,  Sir, that such a body could prove  extremely

useful  and very valuable. It could indeed do the  sort

of  thing that we have recently been engaged on, in the

matter  of agreeing on the regulation of the number  of

posters  to  be  used  and matters  of  that  kind.  If

undesirable  practices appear  in  the  course  of  the

elections,  then  that will be a very  useful  body  in

which  it will be possible to reach All-Party agreement

that  those practices should cease. Similarly, it  will

be  a suitable body with which to maintain liaison with

the Commissioner of Police on his responsibilities, the

difficulties he is incurring, and so. Finally, it is  a

body which could act as a forum in which allegations of

incidents  and so on can be aired and, one would  hope,

the truth arrived at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Member for Tanjong Pagar, in referring to it,

suggested - I   am   not  sure  if  I  am   quoting   him

exactly - only  one  term of reference,  that  it  should

investigate complaints of partiality on the part of the

Police. I myself, Sir, know of no ground for suggesting

that  the  Police  have  been,  or  would  be  in   the

forthcoming  elections, in any way  partial.  Moreover,

even  if  there  were  any occasion  for  investigating

accusations  of  that kind, it seems to  me  that  this

would be a very inappropriate body to do so. Inevitably

the Parties sitting on it would be partisan and, in the

case  of at least one and possibly in the case of  two,

they  would in fact be the aggrieved Parties and  would

therefore  not  be a very appropriate body  to  sit  in

judgment. I must also point out that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>



Police  have the responsibility of enforcing  law.  The

law  is  enacted by this Assembly and we  have  made  a

number   of  amendments  to  the  Legislative  Assembly

Elections Ordinance with a view to ensuring as  far  as

we can clean elections. The Police will do all they can

to  ensure that the law is enforced, or if there  is  a

breach of it, that they bring the offenders to justice.

But  the Police in this matter are responsible  to  the

Law  itself; the power conferred upon them is conferred

by  law; it is not a delegated authority, and it  would

be  quite wrong for me, as the Minister responsible, to

direct  any  particular policeman in carrying  out  his

duties,  whether  it was to arrest or to  refrain  from

arresting anybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only conclude, Sir, by saying that I do believe

that  a body of this kind could be very useful provided

we  all understand what its functions are going to  be,

but I do not think that its primary function should  be

to  provide the answer to the question: "quis custodiet

ipsos custodes?"



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

motion demands the resignation of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will first dwell on the resignation. The

Labour Front Government should have resigned when their

three  Members  left  them and  they  were  left  in  a

minority. The Labour Front Coalition Government  should

have  resigned when their architect, the  former  Chief

Minister  and  leader  of  the  Party,  left  them  and

resigned  his  Chief Ministership.  The  Labour  Front

Government should have resigned when there were only 15

Members on the Government side and 17 on the Opposition

side.  The Labour Front Government should have resigned

when  there  were  only  ten  elected  Members  on  the

Government side and 15 on the Opposition side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Including the expert!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, they talked of democracy and

democratic  government, but because of their  lust  for

power, they hung on to power and position and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>



threw  democracy  aside. It would have been  honourable

for  any Party to go to the people and say, "Look here,

if  you want us, elect us back because we are now in  a

minority  and  therefore we cannot run the Government."

But  with the Rendel Constitution as an excuse and  the

support  of three ex-officio Members and four Nominated

Members,  they  carried  on the  so-called  "caretaker"

Government  and it lasted from June 1956  right  up  to

now! This has not been for the benefit of Singapore  or

its  people.  The  result  was  a  Budget  with  higher

taxation   to   off-set  spending   on   holidays   and

entertainment. The public have to foot the bill. Let me

ask them:

what is left of the prestige of the Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their resignation should at least have come

about  when  the  elected Members of the  Labour  Front

betrayed  their voters and left their Party.  They  now

call  themselves the S.P.A. Government. Let me ask you,

Sir:  how  many elected Members on the Government  side

are of the S.P.A. Party label? None! There are only two

elected   Members  on  the  Government  side,   Sir - the

U.M.N.O./ M.C.A. - who are still with their own  Parties.

The others are not, and therefore the Government has no

business  to  carry on as the Government of  Singapore.

The public have lost confidence in them and the test is

very  near, not far away. I am sure that if they  stand

for  elections, they will lose their deposits,  because

the  voters today are conscious. They know who and  who

has  done what and what, and which Party has done  most

for  their  benefits. They are not going to  be  bought

with a flush of money this time. Those days are gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is this: if the Government resigns,

who  is  going to run the Government? May I  ask  this?

When  the  Ministers were away, either on  holiday,  on

business or on leave, who ran the Government? And  this

has  happened very often. The Government was run by the

Permanent  Secretaries, and there were also  three  ex-officio  Members. They could run an interim Government.

We  could  also have an All-Party Government  say,  one

Member from each Party, or something like that. But  it

is not fair that the Members of the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>



Government should stick to their posts after the 2nd of

April  next  when this Assembly is dissolved,  for  the

simple reason that they no longer represent the people.

The  second  reason  is that the other  day  the  Chief

Minister talked about playing dirty politics.  Sir,  my

colleagues  and I on this side of the House have  never

tried  to play the fool with one Party or the other  as

the    Labour    Front   Coalition    Government    had

done - friendship and breaking with the P.A.P. We are not

throwing  mud at either of them and it is for  them  to

settle  the business of the disclosures that have  been

made.  As  a  Party, we feel that the coming  elections

should be clean and honest, without the Ministers using

any   influence  in  their  canvassing.  Sir,  if   the

Government  does not accept this motion, I request  His

Excellency the Governor - not only him, Sir, but  I  also

request Mr Lennox-Boyd, the Secretary of State - that as

this  is  the first election of the State of  Singapore

when all the Members of the Assembly will be elected by

public  franchise, please assure us clean elections  by

not  allowing  any Ministers to use their influence  on

the voters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the S.P.A. is dead. We do not want

to  flog  a dead horse. It is no use, the public  knows

it.  And  in  order that clean elections  may  be  held

without any influence by anyone, I would like,  at  the

end  of my speech, to move an amendment to this motion.

I  hope  that the amendment will be acceptable to  both

sides  of  the  House, especially the  leaders  of  the

P.A.P. and that of the Government, because  it  is  in

fairness  to the general public as a whole. The  public

could  then vote without influence by anyone or by  any

Party  remaining in office. I am rather surprised  that

the  hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar was rather sober  in

his  speech when he moved his motion; possibly he still

has some love for the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other day in one of the recent Assembly

sittings, I said I might move a motion. I did not do so

as  it  will  be  the  duty of the next  government  to

inquire  into the assets of Ministers, etc. I now  wish

to  make a passing remark as to why I did not bring  up

that motion. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>



next  government should appoint a Commission of Inquiry

to investigate into the assets of the Ministers, and so

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move an amendment to the

original motion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the word "calls" to delete "for the immediate

resignation  of  the  Government  and  the  holding  of

General Elections."



<br><br>and to insert the words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the resignation of the Government on 2nd April,

1959, on the completion of its four-year term of office

under the Rendel Constitution."



<br><br>I  mean,  by this amendment, that on the completion  of

the  four-year  term  of the Rendel Constitution,  this

Assembly  will be dissolved, and with that  dissolution

goes the present Government, so that new elections  may

be  held - a clean and impartial one without influence by

anyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would suggest, in order that the

present debate will not be trammelled in any way,  that

hon.  Members who wish to speak on the main motion  can

also  now  speak on this Amendment. At the end  of  the

debate,  this  Amendment could be put, and  a  Division

taken  if  necessary. And if that Amendment is carried,

of  course, the main Question, as amended, will be  put

again. If it falls, then the original Question could be

put. I only suggest it, because if the Amendment is put

now,  the  debate from now on will be confined  to  the

Amendment.  If hon. Members feel that the suggestion  I

have  put  up  is for the convenience of hon.  Members,

then  we  will do it that way. Is there any  dissenting

voice?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir. Does it

mean  that  we shall not speak on the Amendment  except

incidentally,  and  that  there  will   be   only   one

opportunity  to  speak  except for  the  mover  of  the

motion? Is that correct, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is, of course, up to the Members who

have  spoken up to now to consider whether or not  they

wish to comment on this Amendment. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>



they  wish to comment on this Amendment, then of course

my suggestion must fall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Member for Changi gesturing



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Member for Changi who has

already spoken wish to comment on the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I will have to propose the

question on the amendment. The hon. Member who moved it

has completed his speech, I take it?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Not yet, Sir, I have only a few more

words to say.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the hon. Member will complete

it, and move his amendment formally.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The only last words which I want to

say  to  the voters are these: When you vote,  remember

that  the people whom you last elected spent over 1,200

days  on  holiday at your expense, and you had to  foot

the bill. Do you want to elect such people again?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any seconder? No seconder? Then the

amendment  falls. The original Question then is  before

the House.



<br><br>3.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought that

some more heat would have been generated before I would

be  called  upon to stand up and reply  to  the  points

asked  of  me  by the hon. mover of the motion  and  to

refute  the  allegations made by Members on  the  other

side  of the House in regard to the activities  of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it will be easier for me to touch on the

last  speaker  first. The hon. Member  for  Telok  Ayer

wants  to  go down on record his last famous speech  in

this   House - on  his  particular  hobby   horse:   this

Government  should have resigned two  years  ago!  This

Government  should  have died,  because  they  had  ten

elected  Members against fifteen elected, or 15 Members

against 17 Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the unfortunate thing is that all that he has

spoken  on just now and all that he has been  speaking

on time and time again has just disclosed a lamentable

ignorance  of constitutional law. I am Chief  Minister

not  because of SPA. I am Chief Minister because I  am

able  to  have the confidence of the majority in  this

House,  and  by  virtue of that I am  Chief  Minister,

whether I am in the Labour Front, the SPA or any other

party.  By  virtue  of  my  being  able  to  get   the

confidence  of  the majority of the  Members  of  this

House,  I  remain  Chief Minister. He  could  have  me

removed  in 1956, or even much earlier than  that.  He

did not do so because he knew he was not strong enough

to  do so. Then why must he feel a bit sorry? One must

not worry about the bleatings of a weak man during the

last  few  days of his membership in this Assembly.  I

remember,  Sir,  so many years ago when  he  was  then

contesting the elections, the poor hon. Member had  to

come  to my house early in the morning to wait for  me

to wake up. He said: "Please, Lim Yew Hock, tolong la,

saya  tidak  boleh  menang, tolong, tolong."  I  still

remember  the date. But let it be. That is all  right.

Even now, Sir, I do not know who is the leader of  his

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanglin made a very sober speech

and  to the point, which demands a direct answer  from

me.  But when the hon. Member for Telok Ayer moves  an

amendment  without anybody wanting to  second  him,  I

think, in a democracy, if a man just shouts and shouts

alone, he is therefore useless and not wanted. That is

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Chief Secretary, has

explained  to this House how he proposes to have  that

committee working in liaison with him. If the  working

can  be  improved upon, I am sure the Chief  Secretary

will welcome suggestions for improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we come now to the main speech. The mover of

the  motion has said that he hoped he would set a more

serious tone in this debate, and for that I thank him.

I shall see to it that whatever I say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>



should  be in a more serious tone, and that it  should

not only be serious but should also be truthful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot understand the reason why the hon. Member

found it necessary to move this motion. I did not know

at  first when I received notice of this amendment.  I

thought  that here again his Party are trying to  play

politics, for they know that this is going to  be  the

last  sitting of this Assembly and they know that  the

elections will take place in due time. I wondered  why

it was necessary for the mover of this motion to table

a motion here like this, and to call on the Government

to   resign   when,  constitutionally  speaking,   the

Government remains in a caretaker capacity  until  the

next  Government  comes in. But  now  I  know.  It  is

because  of the unfortunate words I used, and  I  must

admit that those words were unfortunate. But you  must

understand,  Sir, at that time when I said  all  those

words, I was really greatly distressed. I will try not

to  be  distressed again and I will be careful of  the

words I use so that hon. Members may not have any more

fears  as to what I mean and as to what I do not mean.

I think he made a reference to those few words of mine

which  were  spoken under great stress. Let  me  quote

from  Hansard,  Volume  3, No.  24,  columns  2164  to

2165 - just one sentence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If one side can play dirty and begin to be dirty, I

shall  play the same game and do it too, and  let  the

country and the world and God decide."



<br><br>Now,  I did later on in my speech qualify what I meant

by  dirtiness. I said the hon. Member was dirty to the

extent  that  he  broke a promise. Therefore,  to  the

extent that he broke a promise, I will break mine, and

let  God decide whether I am dirty or he is dirty,  or

whether we are all dirty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> God forbid to say!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Then I went on to explain, well,

shall we say, at that time I was really distressed and

said: "Now, Sir, the subversive clause was put in as a

result  of  the hon. Member and I seeing the Secretary

of State for the Colonies." He said it was a downright

lie, and he was called to order, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>



was  not  allowed to say more. I also did not  say  any

more.  I  left  it  at that because suddenly  I  became

sober.  If one can be dirty, I think it is quite  right

that  the other side should not be as dirty or dirtier.

If  a  little  bit  dirty, tidak apa (never  mind).  It

cannot be helped. You have already lost your head.  You

have said it. Let it be. Now, I must ask two questions.

What  did I mean by the word "dirty"? What I meant  was

that  since he could break his promise given to  me,  I

could  jolly well break my promise given to  him.  That

was  all. To that extent, the word "dirty" in my speech

should be qualified. Nothing more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been in office as Chief Minister since 1956,

and, indeed, I am rather proud of my record. No one can

say  that  I  have been dirty in my dealings  with  the

public,  not  even with the Members of the  Opposition.

Not   at   all,  Sir, In  fact,  I  have   been   most

accommodating. I have helped the Opposition to survive.

If  I had not done so, I do not know how the Opposition

would have been able to survive until today. Would  you

call that dirty politics? Definitely no. It is not only

clean  politics but it is politics of the highest order

to  help even your Opposition to survive! And yet  they

crow today and say they are going to throw me out!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I was asked - let me use the proper words, which

are  much better - if I would "withdraw the statement"  I

made  about  the secret meeting. I think I  said  about

fifteen  words,  just  fifteen words.  "The  subversive

clause"  and when I came to the word "Colonies"  I  got

the  hon.  Member's interjection and  he  called  me  a

"downright  liar". Then you pulled me up  to  order.  I

only said about 15 words, Sir. But the hon. Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  in his reply, I think, said  about  150

words. I am still satisfied with my 15 words. I do  not

wish to say more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Chief Minister will give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2328</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He can reply, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Chief Minister has not given way.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The hon. Member, being the mover

of the motion, has the right of reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But I want your reply!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I said 15 words should be

sufficient.  I did not want to expand on them.  I  have

said 15 words. I do not see why I should withdraw those

15  words, especially when the hon. Member himself  had

used  about 150 words to say that I was wrong. Then  in

that debate last month, I really learned something from

him.  Let  me see. Here it is. He was saying about  Mr

Newell.  This  is what he called in Latin,  "Suppressio

yen  suggestio  falsi".  I  throw  the  words  back  at

him - Suppressio yen suggestio falsi. I said 15 words. He

said  150. That is all right. Let it be. Let the public

decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member, Mr R. C. H. Lim, said that

there  was a denial in the Chinese papers. There is  no

denial  from the Colonial Office. There was no comment.

"No  comment" was the answer. But not a denial. And  it

is  because, unfortunately, I had used the word "dirty"

in  a  speech when I was really emotional that  I  have

made  the P.A.P. most unhappy and most fearful, and  as

they say, fearful that I will be really dirty. One must

not  judge  a man by just what he has said. One  little

slip  should  not, and must not, damn  him.  Judge  his

actions  for  the past three years. Have  I,  as  Chief

Minister,  done  anything that could  be  described  as

dirty politics? I believe I have not. In fact, I am  so

proud that I can go to the polls tomorrow and say:  "On

my record I come back to you as I am. Pass judgment."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I thought you are changing

Divisions!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He said therefore that he feared

we  might play dirty politics. He said we were going to

indulge  in it - because I had said so. Therefore,  these

elected Ministers must resign. And now he says: "Though

I  have been running down the Colonial masters for  the

past four years, today it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>



is all right. Let the Colonial masters run the show for

two  more months." Or it might be because after the so-called denial in the Nanfang press he thinks:



"Oh,  the Colonial Office is now with me. It is now  my

friend.  So  wonderful.  I am now  the  friend  of  the

Colonial  Office. Therefore, I can trust  the  Colonial

officials now. But I cannot trust Lim Yew Hock; nor can

I trust M. P. D. Nair, nor can I trust anyone who is an

elected Minister." I must try to keep this speech on  a

sober  note.  Sir,  he then tried to  explain  how  the

Ministers can use influence during the elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Which they did!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We have not used our position in

any   way  to  influence  the  proper  running  of  the

elections. We have not. He may mention that I was  able

to walk into the polling booth when he was not allowed.

I do not know whether this is a little lesson to him. I

went in as one of the polling clerks to replace another

polling clerk, and sat down there. He was asked,  "Will

you  go  out?  I want to sit here. I want  to  see  how

things  are going on here." And I went in as a  polling

clerk  with a statutory declaration. I went in as  one,

and I also had a chit from the candidate to say that I,

"Mr  Lim  Yew Hock is a polling clerk." Oh, he  cannot

believe  me. Surely he cannot. I do not expect  him  to

believe  me, in fact, I have said many things which  he

will  not believe, although many things I did have been

enjoyed by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say this, Sir, I can deny in the most emphatic

terms  that my elected colleagues on this side  of  the

House  have  not always been clean in all  their  work.

They  are  not  here  to use their  position  or  their

influence to upset any elections. We will also  all  be

very busy fighting the elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Exactly, why do you not take leave?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar was heard without interruption.  Perhaps

he  will  allow  the Chief Minister  to  speak  without

interruption.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2330</b></font><br><br>



I  had  hoped my opening remarks would have set a  more

serious tone in this debate. Result - interjections.  "So

do  not believe what I say, but please judge me by what

I  do."  We will do that. We will judge him by what  he

does instead of believing him in what he says. He calls

on  us to resign so that we can - not use our position to

influence  the  elections. How  can  we  influence  the

elections?  The election machinery is in the  hands  of

the  Chief Secretary. He runs the police, and  he  runs

the Elections Office. We have no say in the matter. But

it  was suggested that we could interfere and could  go

to  the  police stations. My God, I would like to  know

which  Minister goes to the police stations and thereby

lowers   his  dignity?  No  Minister  goes  to   police

stations.  He  has just to tell the Chief Secretary  of

anything that he hears. He does not walk into a  police

station. He need not have to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could we ever accept such a motion, Sir? "That,

in  view  of  the  public disgust and  loss  of  public

confidence  in  the Government . . .". Public  disgust,

well,  the  hon. Member for Changi has tried  to  prove

that  all  the disgust, if there ever is any, has  been

disgust  of  the  P.A.P.'s  activities,  not   of   the

Government. Loss of public confidence - yes,  there  has

been -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister </b>resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I wish the Chief Minister can

clarify some more in this House on what I meant by

"P.A.P. activities" when I commented on this motion.

What type of activities?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I think what the hon. Member

wants is just for me to repeat his speech again. I do

not think we have the time, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Clause 30!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Well, the hon. Member is

concerned about clause 30. I had my say, and the hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar had his say. I am sure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2331</b></font><br><br>



he will have a say again in his reply. But as I say,  I

have  learnt  a  little  bit  of  Latin - suppressio  yen

suggestio falsi.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we would like this last sitting to close

on  a  friendly note, a friendly exchange between  both

sides  of  the  House, and let us  leave  this  sitting

feeling happy and clean for the fight that is to  come,

instead  of  going out with our faces sour,  with  each

staring  at the other and saying "Ugh! What next?  This

move  is your move. I will make the next move." I  hope

it will not be necessary-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, may I make a point of

clarification?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> During his speech, he mentioned me as seeking help for the Telok Ayer constituency. Does

he not remember that I have worked for him in Havelock,

and that he is not registered any more there?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I have, Sir, I think not only has

he worked for me for Havelock, in fact, he helped me to

get  into Havelock. Without him I might have failed.  I

might have lost even my deposit-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> No joking, Sir!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I might even have lost my

deposit!  But, Sir, I do not think that  he  need  have

come  to  my house at 6 o'clock in the morning and  sat

until 9 o'clock just to help me, Sir, I do not think it

was necessary. No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> No time!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, now we are going into a new

era. We are going to have internal self-government  and

the  last  few days have given the public an eye-opener

as  to  the  things that are to come.  I  do  not  know

whether  they are good or they are bad. But all  I  can

say  is  that  it  is  a challenge  to  the  people  of

Singapore  to  wake  up  to their responsibilities.  If

things go wrong, they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>



themselves  to blame. They will not have, as  they  had

before,  the  Colonial bogey to keep on  whipping;  for

everything  that  went wrong, it  was  Colonialism.  No

more.  It will be they themselves who will have  to  be

responsible  for what they get, for what they  do.  The

danger  is definitely there. There is that grave danger

that  the  new  constitution might go  into  the  wrong

hands.  There  is that danger. It is a calculated  risk

which  we all take. But I do urge all Members  in  this

House,  representatives of all political parties,  that

if  they  want  to fight a common enemy, they  must  be

strong,  they must be together, they must put  national

interests above all other things. Of course, I am  sure

I  am  not appealing to the P.A.P., because the  P.A.P.

say they are going to be the next government. They need



not  have to worry about all these things. But to those

who  are not in the P.A.P., those who believe that what

has  been  happening in the City Council today  is  not

good  for the country, those who believe that all these

things  that have been happening in the last  few  days

are  not good for the country, to them I say, "Wake up!

Wake  up and fight! Do not be so mesmerized. Do not  be

so  frightened.  Remember we must  place  the  national

interests above everything."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we all can appreciate the importance of national

interests,  there is no need for us to  come  here  and

sling  mud at one another. And while we are doing that,

we  will  then have to repent at leisure that  the  new

constitution has gone into the wrong hands.



<br><br>4.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am speaking today

exceptionally  for the Labour Front  with  a  directive

from  my Party. In earlier days we normally left  Party

members  in  the Assembly extremely free. But  on  this

occasion, my Party has had a meeting and has  passed  a

resolution  and I am speaking in accordance  with  that

resolution. The terms of the resolution I need not give

in  detail. They referred to the matter which had  been

referred  to in the debate already today, to  the  fact

that the present S.P.A. members of the Assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2333</b></font><br><br>



have obviously changed their party names. They referred

to   the  Chief  Minister's  unfortunate  reference  to

playing  dirty  politics, and they said that  in  these

circumstances   it   was   undesirable   and    against

commonsense for the Government to continue in office to

the full possible length it might otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that this matter would have been

the  subject of a resolution moved by myself if  I  had

been able to find a seconder, and if I had been able to

clear  it with my Party in time. Unfortunately,  I  had

many  things  to attend to. It was not reached  on  our

Party's  General Council agenda until Sunday, the  15th

of this month, by which time I was out of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Mr Speaker, Sir, to read from a debate

of 1956, because I want to assure the House that what I

said  then  has been my attitude to political  problems

throughout my ten years in political life and  that  it

will be my attitude in this debate as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can achieve nothing if we allow ourselves to be

dominated   by   a  senseless  fear   of   our   fellow

Singaporeans.  Nor can we achieve anything  if  we  are

dominated  by  the  equally senseless  consequences  of

senseless fear, and that is the vain conceit  that  our

own  person, our own Party, our own community or  class

contains  in  itself all that is wise and all  that  is

trustworthy and all that is worth while. It is not  so.

I  disagree with many people, but I always recognise in



them  that they have some good intentions and that they

have  some wisdom; and we must all recognise  that.  No

doubt  we  shall  often profoundly disagree.  We  shall

criticise  each other. We shall attack each other,  and

it  is right that that should happen because it is part

of the natural basis of democracy. But beneath all that

criticism and attack on the Party system there does lie

an    absolutely   fundamental   sense   of    national

brotherhood,  a sense of mutual trust in  each  other's

good  intentions. We have got to hold fast to the faith

that  our political opponents are trying to do what  is

right,  even when we are convinced, in fact, that  they

are doing what is wrong. We have got to accept that, at

bottom,  they too are seeking the welfare of  Singapore

and  not  its destruction. Any politician or  Party  or

community which tries to separate itself from the sense

of  national  brotherhood and to retire into  suspicion

and distrust and self-conceit is blind to the challenge

of Merdeka."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member identify that?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Yes, indeed, Sir, it is Vol. 1, No. 29,

the  official Hansard for Thursday, the 5th  of  April,

1956.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Column?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. Columns 1844-5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said those words, Sir, I said them as a result

of  quite long experience of politics. I quoted in  the

papers  recently from another speech of  mine  about  a

year  later,  1957,  when  we  debated  corruption  and

politics  where I said that I had seen a good  deal  of

the dirty side in the political life in Singapore, that

is,  mixed up with quite a number of dirty politicians;

some,  I was happy to say, had crossed out of political

life, others are still with us. I said it had not  been

pleasant but I saw no alternative and that is  a  fact.

We  have to live together in Singapore whether we  like

it  or  not. If we do not live together, we  shall  die

together.  Anybody  who builds up sectional  fears  and

distrust is doing a very grave disservice to Singapore.

It  was partly because of that that I thought the Chief

Minister was going far down that path. In view of  what

his  Party had sat down beforehand, I crossed the Floor

of  this House, because I felt that he was going beyond

the  point  at  which the national interests  could  be

served.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this debate we heard a great deal of distasteful exchanges and I do not want to add to them.

But  I  must try to justify the point of view which  my

Party  has put forward and which I myself have said.  I

am  not trying to make any innuendo or to say any  more

than  precisely what I say. But if I do appear to  make

any  innuendo, Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that  you  will

stop  me  and I shall welcome your stopping  me  and  I

shall  apologise sincerely. I am not trying to say  any

more  than  precisely what I say and  I  am  trying  to

choose my words with the greatest care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe that there has been some loss of

confidence in the Government. On the 3rd of March,  the

hon. Member for Queenstown spoke to the effect that  it

would be a very good thing if foreign investors in  the

transport industry had their legal position taken away;

and we have not yet had any categorical denial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>



from the Front Bench of the Government. The Front Bench

of   the   Government  has  not  said  that   that   is

emphatically  not  their policy and that  there  is  no

question at all of depriving foreign investors  of  the

protection  of  the  law. I do not believe  it  is  the

intention  of the Chief Minister or any other  Minister

to  deprive foreign investors of the protection of  the

law. But they had not, as a Party, nor as a Government,

been  able, in fact, to control one of their own  party

members,  one  of their own Government supporters,  who

wished  to say that for what reasons he best knows.  He

has  said  it  and that word can be quoted  by  anybody

against   Singapore  to  frighten  away   any   foreign

investor, and the Government has not been able even  to

repudiate  it  as a policy, let alone  to  control  him

beforehand and prevent him from saying it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> If the hon. Member is referring to

what  I said, as far as I can recollect, I do not think

that  I  have  ever referred to foreign investments  in

this country in my speech on 3rd March.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not think that we need debate it

again,  Sir. The hon. Member's speech was to the effect

that  the Singapore Traction Company should be  reduced

to the same terms as the Chinese bus companies where at

present   it  has  a  privileged  position  under   the

Singapore Traction Ordinance. I was perfectly aware  of

what  he  said, and the implication obviously was  that

they  were expatriate capital and therefore they should

not  be  protected  by the Ordinance under  which  they

built up their company, established their interests and

provided transport services to Singapore. It is a  very

arguable point of view, but it is not a point  of  view

which  is going to serve Singapore to argue here  at  a

time when you need more employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2336</b></font><br><br>



and  not less, and where you must import capital if you

are going to expand employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give that example, Sir, because if the Government

Front   Bench  cannot  effectively  control  its  Back-Benchers  on matters of importance, it does  inevitably

breed  a  loss of confidence in the public, the friends

of  Singapore and people overseas. It is my belief also

that  a  very  new  Party like the  Singapore  People's

Alliance  inevitably has some weaknesses of control  at

the subordinate levels. The Chief Minister is, I think,

the  President of the Party as well as the head of  the

Government,  and  I  suppose  that  on  him  falls  the

responsibility for the control of the Party, but I have

my  doubts. What is more, many people in Singapore have

their  doubts  whether in fact  he  would  be  able  to

exercise  control  over  the  Party  during  the   very

excitable period when the elections are coming. My mind

goes back, Sir, to the Kallang by-election when Tun Lim

Yew  Hock  was personally in control of the conduct  of

that  by-election.  I am making no innuendos,  Sir,  at

all. I am simply stating a simple fact that there was a

criminal  assault on some P.A.P. workers in  the  Jalan

Besar  area;  that apparently the thugs  who  made  the

assault   travelled  in  a  Labour  Front  office   car

registered in the name of the Labour Front to  be  lent

for the purposes of that by-election, and that that car

was held by the Police for some weeks for investigation



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think probably the hon. Member

will  agree  that  he is going a little  far  from  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am sorry, Sir, if I am straying far

away. I am only trying to indicate the dangers which  I

foresee  coming up again. Perhaps I can  come  to  more

recent  disclosures, Sir, I had a telephone  call  last

night from a man who is an old Labour Front member  and

who  refused  to join a new Party. He with his  friends

were subjected to some intimidation towards the end  of

last  year.  Last night he was assaulted in  the  Jalan

Besar  area  and had to go to the General Hospital  for

treatment. I have not -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the hon.

Member is blaming the Government for that incident, but

the  motion is merely a motion asking for the immediate

resignation of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I am trying to deal with

the  loss  of  public  confidence.  The  point  of   my

reference was that as soon as that telephone call  came

to  me, I had other people asking me, "Is it true?  Has

this  been  done?"  I  do  not  say  that  it  has  any

connection at all. As far as I know, the incident  took

place  in or near some liquor shop and it may  well  be

nothing more than a brawl over a bottle of beer. What I

am  saying  is  that the public mind is  disturbed  and

those who remember the Kallang by-election will believe

that  this was a political assault; and that, Sir, does

indicate  a  very  grave  loss  of  confidence  in  the

Government.  I am not wishing to link in  any  way  the

Chief  Minister with this incident or with the  earlier

incident. I am only saying that he has not, in my view,

got  full control of some of those who wish to  act  in

support  of his Party. He apparently had not  got  full

control  over Mr Chew Swee Kee. I do not  wish  to  go

into this thing at great length, but Mr Chew Swee  Kee

apparently had $500,000. I knew nothing of it until  it

was  revealed in the Press, but apparently  the  S.P.A.

knew  nothing  about  it. Mr Chew  Swee  Kee  was  the

Minister  for Education of the S.P.A. and was a  member

of the Party, and apparently was not sufficiently under

control to let the Government know what he was doing or

let  the  Party know or let anybody know  that  he  was

apparently acting in the name of the Party, or else his

funds  would  have been subject to tax. The  suggestion

that  they were Labour Front funds is merely ludicrous.

Everyone  knows  that the S.P.A. took a  long  time  in

actually  achieving birth and that it was substantially

formed  some  months before the formation was  publicly

announced.  The suggestion that Mr Chew Swee  Kee  was

collecting  funds  for  the Labour  Front  and,  having

collected the funds, he suddenly changed his  mind  and

joined the S.P.A., is just absurd.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2338</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there again there is a lack of control within

the  Government  and the Party and that  is,  I  think,

dangerous because if a wrong action does take place  at

some  subordinate  level without the  approval  of  the

heads  of the Party or of the Government, nevertheless,

once the action has occurred, it will be very difficult

for  them  to disown it and to try to take  the  strong

action  that  ought to be taken, to try to ensure  that

the  man who has done wrong is not in any way protected

but  that he should receive, if anything, more rigorous

treatment because he has abused a position of trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very happy, Sir, when the Chief Minister said

that  his unfortunate remarks on 4th March were not  an

overall intention to countenance dirty politics  or  to

use  dirty political methods, but that they were merely

spoken  in  a sense of distress at a time when  he  was

under great stress and that he was only referring to  a

particular thing that he was going to do. He felt  that

the  leader of the P.A.P. had said something he  should

not;  so  he was also going to say something  which  he

should  not  as  well, and I hope  his  denial  of  any

further  purpose was strong enough to leave no question

in the minds of some of his supporters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another aspect of confusion, as it

appears to me, in the background of the S.P.A. and  one

which  again, from what I hear, is causing  a  loss  of

confidence  in  the wisdom of the Front  Bench  of  the

present Government. There have been references  in  the

newspapers to a proposed students' observation  mission

to China. I know very little about it. According to the

newspapers,   the  Students'  Unions  of  the   Nanyang

University and the University of Malaya said, "This  is

all  nonsense. There should not be any such observation

mission organised by somebody who is not himself in any

way  a student." The organiser, according to the Press,

is  a man who has for many years worked very closely on

the  Central Committee of the Labour Front. He left the

Labour Front at the time the S.P.A. was formed. Whether

or  not  he  is a member of the S.P.A., he is certainly

sympathetic   to  the  S.P.A. and  has   gone   around

canvassing on their behalf and he is trying to organise

this students' observation mission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>



to  Red China. I say nothing at all against it, but

if  the  S.P.A. is going to take  a  strong  anti-Communist  line,  then  I presume  they  will  have

something  to say about this students'  observation

mission.  It  is  time they did. They  should  make

their  position clear. Are they for it  or  against

it? What does it all mean? What are they trying  to

do? I do not think that they should let Mr Lee Yew

Seng  try  to build up support amongst the students

on  the  basis of giving them a free trip to  China

whilst,  at  the same time and on the  other  hand,

they  are  attacking  them for  being  not  hostile

enough towards Communists. It appears that there is

a  possibility of confusion of thought  over  this.

This  is  not  child's play. This  is  not  sitting

around a table playing cards or mahjong, trying  to

outsmart  the other man. This is a time  when  very

grave decisions have got to be taken. The future of

1�  million people and of many more still  to  be

born  rests on the next few months to some  extent.

It  has not been a creditable exhibition very often

in  this  Assembly, Sir, and it is  not  surprising

that the public do not always treat the proceedings

of the Assembly with the respect that they ought to

get.  The corruption debate of 1957 ought  to  have

convinced the public beyond question that all sorts

of  extremely wrong things were going on  in  local

politics,  and  yet the shock of surprise  and  the

twisting  and turnings which have followed  further

revelations show that that debate made very  little

impact on the mass of the people at all. It is only

now  that they are beginning to wake up to some  of

the  possibilities  of the folly  and  muddle  that

people can create in politics. The main achievement

of our recent debates has been to throw dirt on the

faces of everybody possible, to do as much harm  as

we  can to the reputations of political leaders. If

that  process goes on, as it has gone on  steadily,

the   only   result  can  be  the  destruction   of

democracy.  All  the  leaders  will  be  disgraced.

Everybody will say, "For heaven's sake, let us have

somebody who has got a serious interest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>



and  is  not merely wasting his time shouting  rude

words   like  a  street-corner  little   boy."   If

democracy   breaks   down,  there   is   not   much

alternative  but some less free form of  government

which might make very deep changes in Singapore and

make  us less happy than we have been in the  past.

Now,  the dirt has been cast in this debate and  in

the  last few weeks in the Press, things have  been

said. The Minister for Local Government, Lands  and

Housing  first seemed to say that he would  not  do

anything  to the City Council, because  they  would

not immediately send him their minutes and then  he

seemed to say that he would do something to them. I

do  not  know what was in mind. He did not make  it

very  clear  but at least he has not said  anything

that is going to be very reassuring to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult, Sir, for me to feel that if the

Government remain in office for the next two months

they  will  not command the confidence of  all  the

public  in the way that they ought to. We ourselves

in  this Assembly have pointed out in July 1957 the

very   great  extent  of  corruption,  wrong-doing,

malpractice  and all sorts of things  which  should

not  have occurred in elections. We have all  borne

testimony  to  it with the unanimous  vote  of  the

Assembly. There it is in the record. But now we are

coming  to a much more important election-not  just

the Cairnhill and Tanjong Pagar by-elections-but to

an  election  under  a  new Constitution  in  which

320,000   new  citizens  are  to  vote;   under   a

Constitution  which gives new powers  to  the  most

important election yet. Consequently, the heat will

be  all  the  greater.  And  can  the  public  have

confidence  in  an Assembly which itself  has  said

that  all the elections hitherto have been  corrupt

and  have been full of improper practices and  gang

activities and all the rest of it? Can it really be

said. "Well, of course, it does not apply to any of

the    Ministers   or   any   of   the   Government

Assemblymen."? I do not think they can, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say a few brief words on the

sociological background of these elections. In 1954

the Labour Front gave



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>



its principles and aims; one of the principles was the

removal  of unjust disabilities fettering any  section

of   the   population,  and  another   aim   was   the

establishment of citizenship - full political rights - for

those  who wish to make Singapore their home  and  the

object  of  their loyalty. Whilst it was expressed  in

general  terms,  what was in mind  obviously  was  the

large  number of China-born Chinese who had  lived  in

Singapore,  contributed  very notably  to  Singapore's

development  and  expansion and  prosperity  but  who,

until the Labour Front wrote that down and put it into

practice  as a Government policy, and secured  it  for

the  people and created a Singapore Citizenship,  they

had  no political rights. And it was the Labour Front,

with  the  assent and support of all other Parties  in

the  Assembly, which opened the door and  said,  "Come

in, brothers. Come in and join us. We are all citizens

together,  citizens of one fair City. We are  brothers

together; we will not keep you out any more.  Come  in

and take your share of the powers, the responsibility;

take  your  full  political  rights."  And  they  came

in - 320,000.  Well, every one can see what that  meant.

it meant an enormous shift in the balance of political

power.  In the past, political leadership was confined

by   and  large  to  the  English  educated.  It   was

necessarily  confined in the past to those  who  could

speak  English at a fairly high level.  In  fact,  the

political  Parties  were  largely  controlled  by  the

English  educated  and  the part  of  the  non-English

educated  was  to  support the  English  educated  and

secure political power for them. But when we put  that

decision  of  the  Labour  Front  in  1954  into   our

principles  and aims, we said, "That is wrong  and  it

has  got to stop. There must be equal citizenship  for

all." And we said it, and we did it. It was right.  It

is  not  going  to  be easy. It has made  an  enormous

change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the sociological facts in Singapore is that

you  have  still  not established a  single  Singapore

culture.  There  is even some cultural strain  between

the  English educated Chinese and the Chinese educated

Chinese - not  deep,  yet  getting  less,   I   believe.

Policies  have been sound and right; steps  have  been

taken in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>



last  few  years  which  have  helped  to  narrow  any

division  and  to unify and not to split  more  widely

apart.  Things  have been going well. There  has  been

marked improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one controverting factor. That is the

very  rapid  expansion  of the  population.  There  is

inevitably  going to be a period of reduced prosperity

for  Singapore.  The trade figures  may  improve;  the

number of investments may improve.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the hon.

Member  could relate all those remarks to  the  motion

before the House. Perhaps the hon. Member is so  taken

up with the subject that he forgets that the motion is

for the Assembly to call for the immediate resignation

of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do apologise, Sir. This is a point

which cannot be made except at considerable length. It

is,  to  my  view, relevant. But if you think  it  has

taken  excessive  time, then I must  drop  it  without

attempting to make it short, because to make it  short

would inevitably misrepresent the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only say that there is an aspect in the

propaganda  line which has been followed, not  by  the

Chief  Minister but by some members of his Party,  and

which  could be damaging and could be very  dangerous,

and  that  is  by seeking to drive further  apart  the

Chinese  educated and the English educated to cause  a

split  in national unity. People are talking about  it

here  and there. Word comes back to me from the people

who  like to keep me informed of what is going on, and

there  is  that little feeling of doubt as to  whether

there  is  some attempt to drop back from the decisive

citizenship law, and to say, "Well, we gave too  much.

Perhaps we ought to withdraw it." But I do not believe

that  danger exists in any very deep sense, but it  is

one  point of possible explosion, and it is one  which

is liable to become heated as things are said and done

during the pre-election period. If things are said  by

a  man speaking as an individual, then they carry  his

individual  weight behind them. If they  are  said  by

anybody who has the rank of a Minister, they do  carry

very great weight with the large number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>



of  the  public,  because  the  name  of  Minister  has

acquired  very high qualities of power in the minds  of

the public. Even as an ex-Minister, I get people coming

to  me  and imagining that I have a quite unreal degree

of  power which even a Minister would not exercise. But

they  still think that I have some power even though  I

am  not  a  Minister now. And statements  can  be  made

which, as they pass round in the coffee-shops and  come

back to the plank and attap huts, are misunderstood and

are  taken  as constituting statements of the intention

of the authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I only wish to conclude by urging that the

Ministers should resign. I do not have any quarrel with

them.  I  myself resigned my Ministry with a  sense  of

relief,  and I wrote to the Chief Minister to say  that

we  had  disagreed  in  the past without  any  wish  to

disagree   again  and  there  would  be   difficulties,

political  strains, in the future. I also said  that  I

should  remember, I did remember and I would  remember,

the  very  valuable  and courageous services  which  he

rendered to Singapore in the past three years;  he  had

done  a very valuable job in many ways, and I hope that

though  there  would be disagreements, they  would  not

destroy  old  friendships - I say  that  to  all  my  old

friends  on  the Government Benches - and if I  disagreed

with  them, I would say so; and if they would say  what

was  wrong, I would try to put them right, but I  would

not  let my heart be filled with anger against them nor

will I conduct any election campaign to try to build up

the  forces  of  anger and quarrelling as  a  means  of

getting  votes.  Those  things could  be  very  bad  to

Singapore and still more bad for ourselves. When I  say

the Government should resign, I see no loss to them  in

resigning except perhaps a small loss of saying, "Well,

the  P.A.P. called on us to resign, and we  have  done

what   the  P.A.P. asked."  That  I  suppose  is   the

difficulty,  but  that seems to be  the  only  possible

loss.  There is no work for them to do now;  occasional

routine letters will come up for signing; there will be

some matters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2344</b></font><br><br>



which are quite a good thing for Ministers to look  at.

But  there is nothing which cannot wait for two  months

or are so important that must be taken as a Ministerial

decision  of  policy.  The decisions  perhaps  will  be

taken,  but  they can be taken perfectly  well  without

having  a  Minister's statement or the  Ministry's,  if

necessary. Then I suppose the three official  Ministers

could carry on. But I do not think the Ministers should

remain  as  Ministers. There is the power and  prestige

and  influence  of  Ministers during this  pre-election

period.  Even  if they themselves are most scrupulously

careful  in  every  possible way to act  in  the  right

manner, the only result will be that they will make  it

very  difficult  for themselves to win  the  elections,

because   they   have  to  withdraw  themselves   from

perfectly harmless election activities. And in spite of

that,  there will still be many uncontrolled supporters

in the background who will make use of their names, and

the  people know it. It has been done all the  time:  a

man goes around and says, "I am working for Mr So-and-so.  Do  this. Do that." Whether he is working or  not,

nobody can tell, and until the elections actually start

he  would  not even have to show a credential from  his

candidate.  And  what can you do about it?  Nothing  at

all. But  the name of the Ministry is there,  and  the

name of the Minister can be used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think anybody, Sir, would feel that the

Government's  staying  in  office  serves  any   public

purpose, any necessary purpose. It will be hard for the

public  to believe that if they do stay in office  they

are  staying in from a sense of dedication and service.

The public will be tempted to say, "They think they are

more likely to win the next elections if they stay  in,

than  if  they come down from their pedestals and  join

the common man, and fight the elections as common men."

I  do  not  think it will help them at all to  win  the

elections,  but I think there are dangers in  Singapore

today  which ought to be avoided, and I hope  that  the

Government will help to avoid them by resigning in  the

very  near  future  and standing for the  elections  as

modern citizens and not as Ministers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this motion is an astounding one and it created so much

astonishment when it was first published in the

newspapers that the people of Singapore expected quite

a lot of allegations against the Ministers, the

Government, and other very damaging remarks (according

to the P.A.P.) of gifts of hundreds of thousands of

dollars. But up to now it has reached an absolute anti-climax. Is there any justification whatsoever for this

motion to be filed in this manner, "That, in view of

the public disgust and loss of public confidence . .

."? What disgust is there? What loss of confidence? The

mover of the motion has not been able to cite a single

case of disgust. The only thing that has been brought

up again is the question of the half a million dollars,

and I would have been happy to leave it with a

Commission of Inquiry; but as the hon. Mr Francis

Thomas has brought it up again, I must speak on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are happy to abide by the findings of a Commission

of  Inquiry, and our Party is pressing for it; and  the

result, I am sure, will be given even before Nomination

Day. We are quite clear that our Party, the S.P.A., has

nothing  to do with it. The only Party that has  to  do

with it is the Labour Front, and when we look upon  the

circumstances under which this money was  received  and

disclosed by Mr Francis Thomas in September 1957,  and

the  result of the receipt of that money from a foreign

source  in  order to combine the P.A.P. and the  Labour

Front to fight the Liberal-Socialists, then we can  say

that  the  Labour Front is and must be responsible  for

this money, and not us. And what was worse - in spite  of

the  money being used to purchase support by one  Party

or  by the other, there was absolute treachery, and one

Party was torpedoed. In spite of the treachery that was

practised  by the P.A.P. when it made a pact  with  the

Labour  Front,  the Vice-Chairman of the  Labour  Front

can, in this Chamber and in the last two days, stand up

and  support the very Party which has let it down. That

I  cannot  understand. That is beyond my comprehension.

If we take away that item which is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>



now  before  the Commission of Inquiry,  what  else  is

there  for the Government to answer? Mr Francis Thomas

made  the most unconvincing speech in his life in  this

Chamber.  I do not know why he spoke without confidence

and  so  shakily. Perhaps he crossed the Floor  on  the

wrong premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not good at throwing wild allegations, and

making  conjectures like the hon. Member for Changi.  I

am  usually  very brief, and try to speak home  truths.

But sometimes home truths hurt. For instance, Sir, when

the  hon.  Mr Speaker stopped the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  for saying that my remarks were inane,  he  said

that  my remarks were stupid. Sir, truth does hurt when

it  reaches home. I want to let this meeting end  in  a

spirit  of goodwill and try and keep it on the tone  on

which it has been fought throughout today. This is  our

last  meeting here, and I hope everyone of us who  will

be  meeting again in the field of elections will do  so

with  clean  hands and good heart. Let the  better  man

win.  Do  not let us go out of the way to try and  hurt

the  other  by damaging his character. I can  tell  you

from my own experience that that will not pay, and I am

sure  the people of Singapore are much wiser than  they

were  four years ago, and will cast their votes in  the

right way.



<br><br>5.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what a publicity

stunt  and  what a political stunt! When my motion  was

debated  yesterday and this morning, I was  accused  by

the  leader  of the PAP., the hon. Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar,  and  Mr Francis Thomas, that I  was  trying  a

political  and  publicity  stunt.  My  Party  was  also

accused  of  trying to have some political stunt.  Now,

Sir, both these Members, the leader of the P.A.P. and Mr

Francis  Thomas, know the constitution very well.  They

know the Rendel Constitution. So is there any necessity

in  bringing in this motion here today? If there is  no

necessity,  is it not a political stunt of the  P.A.P.?

Why  then  accuse  me  when  my  motion  calls  for   a

Commission of Inquiry into the leakage?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the debate I heard this afternoon, Sir, it

appears  that Members of the Opposition have  the  same

feeling  that this motion should have been  brought  up

two  years ago. If that is so, why is it that no Member

of  the Opposition has had the courage to bring in this

motion?  If  it  is the feeling of any  Member  of  the

Opposition that this motion should have been brought up

two  years  ago, then a Member should have  brought  in

this  motion,  and then throw the Government  out.  Why

wait  until  today? Again I say that it is a  political

stunt because the election is coming near. It is only a

matter  of  two months away. So they say, "Let  us  try

some  political stunt to smear our opponents",  and  in

order  to  smear  their opponents, the political  Party

might gain power. That is why this motion is brought in

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar knows very well

that if this motion were accepted, we would have to  go

back   to  the  position  where  the  running  of   the

Government would be in the hands of His Excellency  the

Governor and the three officials. Now, during the  four

years  that  he has been here, he has been against  the

Colonial  power,  and  he  has  been  against  Colonial

government. But now when elections are a matter of  one

or  two  more  months, he prefers to  have  a  Colonial

government.  What a political stunt! What a  somersault

stunt  of  the P.A.P.! Sir, the Chief Minister  in  his

reply  to  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar qualified  his

words,  that "I will also be dirty. If you  try  to  be

dirty,  I  will also try to be dirty". And he qualified

those  words by saying that "if you, as an hon. Member,

cannot  keep your promise, I will also try not to  keep

my promise, and be as dirty as you are."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. are so much of a political bankrupt

that  they are afraid of this little word "dirty".  The

Chief  Minister has never indicated that  he  will  use

force  just  by his having said that word "dirty".  The

Chief  Minister has never indicated that he will arrest

the  P.A.P. stooges and their members. So why must they

have  that fear? Is it not a guilty conscience?  It  is

only the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>



accused  person; it is only the wrongdoer who  fears  a

thing. If you are not a wrong-doer, and if you have the

courage,  why  then should you be afraid of  that  word

"dirty"? The S.P.A. will never go to the polls  with  a

dirty  mind.  We fight clean, and we will always  fight

clean. I am quite sure every Member on this side of the

House will fight the elections clean. It was, and it is

the  P.A.P.'s motive to fight the elections dirty. They

have already fought elections dirtily, and that is  why

they  are  so  scared and so afraid that  if  they  are

really  dirty, the Government might use force on  them.

If not, why should they be afraid?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is surprising that Mr Francis Thomas comes today

to  say  that he supports the motion calling  upon  the

Government to resign forthwith. In his statement, where

he explained in the Press why he had crossed the Floor,

he made a few remarks which I cannot understand. One of

the remarks is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did not think it would be good for Singapore to

smash  the  then Government, which with all its  faults

was doing a good job."



<br><br>This  appeared  in the Straits Times of Saturday,  14th

March,  1959. Even though he knew of the faults of  the

Government, he admitted that the Government was still a

good  Government. He, at that time, did not  intend  to

press  for  the resignation of the Government.  Neither

did  he think fit to smash the then Government. Further

down, Sir, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government was already discredited; Singapore's

good name was already damaged; the Labour Front"-



<br><br>Not the S.P.A.-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"was already disgraced by the actions of its former

leaders."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, is not Mr Francis Thomas a leader of the

Labour  Front? If so why did he make the statement?  If

he  then felt that the Labour Front had already damaged

its  reputation, he was still a member  of  the  Labour

Front,  and a Minister of the Labour Front. Why had  he

not  called  upon his own Government at  that  time  to

resign?  Why wait until today? Why support  the  P.A.P.

and try to curry favour and get married to the P.A.P.?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further went on, Sir, in the same paper:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did not think it would be good for-Singapore to

smash the then Government"-



<br><br>repeating what he had said previously-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"which with all its faults was doing a good job.

Instead, in January, 1958, I got Tun Lim Yew Hock  and



the  other  Labour Front leaders to  promise  that  we

would  make  a  real effort to clean up the  party;  I

accepted  appointment  as secretary  general  for  the

purpose of cleaning it up and reorganising it."



<br><br>Secretary-General! Is it not a very  high  appointment

in  a  political Party? Is it not his  duty  then,  as

Secretary-General of his own Party, to clean it up? If

he, as Secretary-General, could not clean up his Party

then, who is at fault? Why then come along now and say

that  the Government must resign, when it has  only  a

matter of one or two months to go?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, he further said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By the middle of 1958, it was obvious that the Labour

Front would not be cleaned up as promised. Instead the

Labour  Front  ran a very dirty election  campaign  in

support of its candidate at the Kallang by-election."



<br><br>Now, Sir, if he knew very well at that time, that  is,

in  the middle of 1958, that he could not clean up his

Party,  it  was again his duty to resign. Mr  Francis

Thomas  was a school teacher before he came into  this

Assembly. After coming into this Assembly, he became a

Minister,  and a Minister carries a salary of  $2,500.

Was  it because of the $2,500 that he was not prepared



to  resign?  If it is so, let him be frank enough  and

say so. Why wait until today? He is now of the opinion

that  if  the Government remains in office for another

two  months  the  people  of Singapore  will  have  no

confidence   in  the  Government.  If  they   had   no

confidence in the Government, it would not have  stood

until  today,  and if the Government can  stand  until

what it is today, the Government will be able to carry

on for another two months until a new Government comes

in.



<br><br>5.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I certainly

feel  that this is in contrast to the City Council  in

December  1958 when, at its last meeting, pleasantries

were exchanged. Today, Sir, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>



find that there has been a lot of mud-slinging. This is

not right, and I would urge everyone of us here to try

not  to  end this meeting after this four-year session

on  a  note  of anger or hatred. But let  us  part  as

friends  and  go  to the elections and  see  the  best

people  win.  So far as I am concerned,  I  have  been

attending many of the All-Party meetings. I think  the

last    All-Party    meeting   was   one    concerning

posters-drawing up regulations for the poster campaign

that  is to come. We on this side of the House do take

in  opinions of all other Parties, especially when the

matter concerns everybody. Not only did we discuss all

matters  concerning posters very sanely, but  we  also

gave everybody ample opportunity to amend, add to,  or

subtract from all those regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reply to the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar's

anxiety,  that in all probability things  may  not  be

right with the Ministers at the helm, I would like  to

say  a  bit  more. This motion coming in at this  hour

does  not seem right. All along throughout these  four

years there had been opportunities when the Government

could  have been opposed, and there was at one time  a

real danger of the Government toppling over should the

Opposition combine their votes. We have read all  that

in the papers. There was some bit of truth in what the

Member for Telok Ayer had said about 15 Members on one

side  and 17 on the other. But I would like to  recall

those  incidents  at the time when Government  was  in

real danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has many a time been saved by the People's Action

Party!  That was three years ago, two years  ago,  one

year  ago, or four years ago. There is no denial  that

the Member for Tanjong Pagar was a very good friend of

the  Member for Havelock, and I think they  are  still

very  good  friends. I know that they  have  conferred

with  each  other on all important issues.  They  have

been old friends; they have come to conclusions.

successfully  and peacefully on so many  things;  they

have  trusted  each other throughout  all  these  four

years;  there is no harm in trusting each other  again

for the next two months. I would say that trusting the

Member for Havelock and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>



the  elected Ministers would be far better than leaving

matters with the officials. I think, if the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar withdraws his motion and allows  matters

to  rest  there,  it will be more in keeping  with  the

aspirations  of  the people of Singapore  and  his  own

desire throughout all these years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been doubts whether the elections will be

fought  clean  or  dirty. I would  like  to  say  that,

whether  it be clean or dirty, it will depend upon  the

leaders  of  all the political parties. The  Government

has  seen  fit  to appoint a committee with  the  Chief

Secretary as Chairman to look into such matters. And if

all  leaders are determined and will carry  out  their

promises  to  fight  the elections  clean,  then  I  am

certain there will be no dirt, or at least less dirt. I

have been really distressed by the spate of breaking of

promises.  Every  time you make your  promise  to  your

friends,  you  seem  to swear by anything - probably  the

coconut palm in front of your house! And you break your

promise  the  next  moment. What is said  in  the  most

serious  tone  and  in moments which you  should  never

forget  in all your life :s broken, just broken.  I  am

alarmed  at that, and I hope that whatever new promises

we  make, we should make it a point to keep them and to

honour them. The Member for Changi has touched on a lot

of  things  and on clause 30. I am touching on  it  now

because  I  happened  to be a member  of  the  five-man

delegation. There have been many questions put to me. I

have  not  uttered a word, and I want to make it  clear

here that I am not uttering a word on that matter.  It

has  been a promise. If somebody says something, it  is

up  to his own conscience to say whether it is true  or

not.  If  the other person is at the receiving end,  it

will  be up to his conscience to feel whether it  hurts

or  it  does not hurt. I, on my part, will keep  to  my

part of the bargain. Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of information, Sir!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, just now I was more than

pleased  to hear the Member for Serangoon touch  on  my

statement regarding clause 30. He said he was going  to

say  something more, but he had not uttered a  word.  I

have not heard any truth coming out from his mouth!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whatever I say

will be enough



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Clause 30!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Clause 30? Let the people who are

concerned sleep with their conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just now I was really distressed to hear what

our  hon. friend, Mr Francis Thomas, had  to  say.  I

certainly feel that he had said the wrong thing at  the

wrong  moment when he was in the wrong position. A  lot

has  been said about him by other Members, and I  would

say, "I shall add no more."



<br><br>5.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is verily

the  end,  and I do not think anybody in this House  is

sorry  to  see the end of it. Four years - some grew  up,

many  did  not.  Sir, I do not like people  talking  in

riddles.  In  this  last sitting I want  to  place  the

issues fairly and squarely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this new smear that the Member for Serangoon

is  trying that he was also a party to this magnificent

bargain; that he was also at this meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me get the position clear. According to the

Chief  Minister,  he  and I went to  see  the  Colonial

Secretary  and  we got clause 30 in. According  to  the

Member for Serangoon, he is keeping his mouth shut.  He

is not saying anything, but we can imply the worst. Let

us  get  the  facts  straight. I  challenge  the  Chief

Minister to swear on oath that I and he went to see Mr

Lennox-Boyd  to get clause 30 in, or to discuss  clause

30, or to see Mr Lennox-Boyd at all. He knows that  it

is not true, but he was not big enough to be-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Serangoon was so very cagey about what he was going  to

say  or  what he was not going to say. He sounded  more

like an old gypsy lady looking into the crystal ball. I

would ask him to take his crystal ball home, polish  it

up, and perhaps meet us at election time at the 5� m.s.

Serangoon,  as  we are going to hold an election  rally

there this Sunday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to get these facts clear. Through all the

twists and turns of the last four years, there was  one

mistake  I  never  committed,  and  that  was  to  give

hostages, and the Chief Minister knew that I was not  a

stupid man. But he did not know that I thought that  he

was  a very wily operator and never gave him a hostage.

I  think the words which he said at Queenstown, when he

went  down  to open some private meeting at  some  fire

station, and which were reported subsequently in Monday

morning's newspapers, were the absolute truth.  If  you

call  me a fool or call us fools, we will not deny  it.

That  is  true, because he was left carrying the  baby.

Sir,  I  make  no apologies for this. I  am  completely

unabashed  that, partly from moderation of  policy  and

partly   through  ability  in  gauging  our   opponents

accurately, we have survived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister is different from his predecessor.

His predecessor was a flamboyant, flashy man, who likes

to  shout and who likes to mess up things - very messy!

The  present Chief Minister is different. He is  quiet,

small,   unobtrusive,  cracks  jokes,  plays  practical

jokes, puts balls into pockets and takes them out.  But

he  is a very deep fellow, and I knew that. I say  this

to  him. I am sorry that he was left holding the  baby.

But  he  knew  very well that when he  opened  fire  in

October 1956, he had been outmanoeuvred by the British.

That  is  the real position. From then onwards  it  was

check  and counter check on the chess board.  Today  he

knows  as  well  as  I do that we  have  been  able  to

establish a position where we can only be scrubbed  off

the race, not by him, but by the British. He could have

scrubbed us out in 1957, but he did not. For that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>



we  have  to  thank  Mr  Gerald  de  Cruz,  Organising

Secretary, who advised him that he could absorb us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put the issues fairly and squarely before we

go to the polls. The Chief Minister knows we are a non-Communist  force,  in fact, a vital and  dynamic  force

better   than   his.  But  because   we   cannot   make

accommodation  for  him,  he  has,  on  the  one  hand,

appeared  to smear us as Communists, and on  the  other

hand, tried to ask the Communists not to support us  by

saying   I   went  with  him  and  did  a   dirty   and

dishonourable thing. Since he is going down anyway, why

not   bring   the  whole  house  down?  He  is   beyond

redemption.  So why not implicate me? I put  the  issue

very  fairly to him. It is not sufficient to  kill  Lee

Kuan  Yew, because the P.A.P. is a movement bigger than

Lee  Kuan Yew. It has got more than Lee Kuan Yew. I say

this  too:  that if in four years he had  succeeded  in

making a coherent group out of his collection of prize-fighters, he might have got somewhere, but he did  not.

Finally cornered, he says, "All right, on the one hand,

in  fact, Lee was an anti-Communist who conspired  with

me  with  the Archbishop of Colonialism"; on the  other

hand, at the end of his speech, he says, "Ah, but watch

out,  all  good nationalists! Let us come together  and

bang  the  P.A.P.!" Make up his mind. Which way  is  he

going  to shoot? Because the Communists are not  kidded

in  this. They know exactly what we are, what we  stand

for,  what  we are going to fight for. And neither  are

the British kidded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, before we depart - many of us perhaps never to

return - that we have understood what has been happening.

Why  we  had such a motley collection of people in  the

last  Council, and why there was no improvement in this

present one. The reason was because in 1945 the Malayan

Communist Party led the anti-Colonial movement, and all

those  who  hated  Colonialism were absorbed  into  it,

including  a  number of my personal friends.  In  1948,

there was an armed revolt and they led an anti-Colonial

struggle, and we had the first assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>



of  handpicked  men - weak, wishy-washy types  who  never

made  the  grade, except the Member for Havelock.  The

British  gave a further concession in 1951. I had  the

privilege  of being an election agent for  one  of  the

candidates.  If  ever the British believed  that  these

sort  of  people  were going to build  a  fortress  for

democracy  in  this part of the world, they  must  have

been extremely stupid. But then, at that time, they had

the   Rt.   Hon.   Mr   Malcolm  MacDonald   as   High

Commissioner,  and  he  praised  Bao  Dai  as  a  great

democrat.  So I expect he believed Mr C. C. Tan  would

have been an even greater democrat. Came 1955, and they

were all swept into the limbo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front did not win because it was a

powerful force. The Labour Front won on the pure  anti-Colonial, anti-Colonial stooges movement. And I will be

the first to admit that when the P.A.P. wins, it is not

because of the strength and organisation of the  P.A.P.

alone. Behind it lies the whole history of the struggle

against the British, and now a struggle for the destiny

of  this  country. It is no use for the Chief  Minister

trying at this stage to switch his horses and say, "Ah,

but you know, Lee is really an anti-Communist with us."

The  Chief Minister fights the Communists on paper,  on

books and manuscripts handed to him. I see all kinds of

books when we go to conferences in his office. I do not

think that I am breaching any Official Secrets Act when

I  say that one of them is called Positive Thinking  by

some moral rearmament fellow. I say that we should  all

do some positive thinking now. I have not read the book

but I am sure that it will do everybody a world of good

to  read  such books. The Communists have no  illusions

and  they know what the P.A.P. stands for. They do  not

have  to be told by the Chief Minister what the  P.A.P.

is,  what its leaders believe in, and what its  leaders

intend to do. In fact, they know better than the  Chief

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>



what  we stand for, and so does the British Government.

In  four  years, all the cards have been  laid  on  the

table  and  the  reason  why  I  say  there  is  now  a

distinction  between  the  British  officials  and  the

elected  Ministers is because one is calculating  on  a

long-term  basis and the other is calculating  for  the

morrow. The British fully understand that we are  anti-British, that we are anti-colonialism, and that we will

do a lot of things which they will find unpleasant. But

they  also understand, whether they like us or not,  we

are the only force outside the Communist group that  is

able  to  muster  mass support - the only coherent  group

that  does not have to apologise for itself. No  P.A.P.

members in the leadership have hurled recriminations at

each  other. That is the first lesson in the A.B.C. of

politics.  I  will never denounce my colleague  and  my

colleague   will  never  denounce  me,   whatever   our

differences. Because we have a higher common  political

objective. But these people on the opposite  side  have

only  one  objective. It is not a political  objective.

Their  objective  is loot, and when  the  loot  is  not

shared properly, then there is trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Chief Minister that we can go to the

polls and take on any smear he wants to start. But I am

glad  at  least that he realised that he spoke  out  of

turn  when  he  said that he was going  to  play  dirty

politics. Now he has qualified it by saying that it was

just talk. He meant that since I had breached a secret,

he  was  going to breach a secret. That is a falsehood.

There  was no breach of any undertaking I gave him.  He

offered  a Chew Swee Kee resignation if I went soft.  I

had  a  full  Central Executive Committee meeting  that

afternoon  to make a decision, because we do  not  make

these  decisions by ourselves, and I went back  with  a

mandate  to tell him that if he resigned, we would  not

press for the Commission but we would have to state the

facts.  What happened was that he found the  facts  too

painful and he said, "Right, counter by a smear."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that there had not been a denial from the

Colonial  Office. Sir, let me read him  the  A.F.P. of

11th  March - not that it is all that important  whether

there  was  a  denial or not. He knows, to begin  with,

that  I  was not such a stupid man. I am still friendly

with him. I never quarrel with people for no reason. He

is  unlike Mr Marshall. He is the quiet stiletto type.

Mr  Marshall takes a big stick, chases you around  and

threatens to beat you; and when the awful moment comes,

he  drops  the stick. But it is not so with  our  Chief

Minister. He carries a knife and he likes to do a  neat

clean  job,  like that [Indicating]. The last  thing  I

would  give  him  was  a chance to  plunge  the  knife.

However, this is for his information:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attention herewith. Re-run of exclusive item for

Singapore Press. Colonial Office denial. London,  March

10, A.F.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonial Office today categorically denied

reports  appearing in the Singapore Press according  to

which  the  clause  dealing  with  subversion  in   the

Constitution of Singapore was inserted as a result of a

secret  understanding between the  Colonial  Secretary.

Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd, the People's Action Party leader,

Mr  Lee  Kuan Yew and the Chief Minister, Mr Lim  Yew

Hock...".



<br><br>I believe that the Chief Minister has been quick enough

to get back to the Colonial Office and ask the Colonial

Secretary  himself to keep quiet about  this.  One  day

when  the elections are over, Mr Lennox-Boyd  will  be

able  to tell the world whether or not he met the Chief

Minister  and  me at a secret meeting to arrange  this;

and  the  Chief  Minister knows in his heart  that  the

answer is 'No'. But he is angry because he has now  let

himself in for something really big in that he has said

that  I  conspired and that we perpetrated a  fraud  in

this  Assembly.  I went and fought the by-election  for

the  P.A.P., Sir, to justify the Constitution when,  in

fact,  Mr  Marshall was going to take the  Member  for

Havelock  for  a  run.  We knew  what  we  were  doing.

Furthermore,  he knew full well that, despite  all  the

civilities of life, there is a basic difference between

him  and  us,  of a degree so great as  to  make  it  a

difference of kind. I respect him because he has  guts,

whatever his motivations may be. Of the lot in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>



front  of us, there were only two persons who  did  not

take  the  fright. One was a foolish man, the hon.  Mr

Chew  Swee  Kee.  He  could fight, but  he  fought  for

different  reasons and different motives.  But  he  had

guts. The Chief Minister is another man. I know when  I

am  dealing with a man with guts, and I know when I  am

dealing with a coward. I know when I am dealing with  a

man  with  intensity of purpose, and I know when  I  am

dealing  with a dilettante. I do not want to waste  the

time of this House answering the Member for Changi  who

wants to challenge me. He should challenge the guy  who

is going to the moon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Come on!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is a waste of time. The Member

for  Bukit Timah and I looking him up in the middle  of

the  night!  Well,  I am glad that  in  his  dreams  he

imagined that he was such an important person and  that

we  did  try  to inveigle him into something  which  he

thought was dishonest. But all this is a waste of time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of order. Please allow

me  to  say  that what I said was true and  whether  he

likes  it  or  not,  he  can  meet  me  in  the  coming

elections,  whether he chooses to fight  me  in  Changi

or - as I have repeated it many times - anywhere.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot find the point of order.

I  know  that the Member for Changi is very keen  on  a

certain challenge but that is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is not rising

on a point of order, he cannot hide behind rising on  a

point  of order. It must be a point of order.  Mr  Lee

Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there was, I

thought,  a supremely happy phrase used by the Director

of  Information  Services. He said appropriately  at  a

Rotary luncheon that we shall know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>



who  are  the donkeys and who are the thoroughbreds  on

Nomination  Day, and I should hate to be ruled  out  of

order  if  I  were  asked to classify  the  Member  for

Changi.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As I was saying-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Changi is very

anxious to clarify something. May I then remind him  of

Standing Order 30, paragraph 4, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Member who has spoken to a question may again be

heard to offer explanation of some material part of his

speech  which has been misunderstood; but he shall  not

introduce new matter."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar sits

down,  the  Member for Changi claims that he  has  been

misunderstood in some material part of his  speech,  he

can then speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That may well be so, Sir, because I

do not understand donkey language.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is getting very

near  the edge. I do not suppose it is proper to allege

that the hon. Member speaks donkey language. I ask  the

hon. Member to withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker, Sir, if you

think even such an oblique reference objectionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as the Members on the other side are

concerned,  they  think they are fighting  a  group  of

individuals. They think if they knock out Lee Kuan  Yew

or  besmirch him, or knock out Ong Eng Guan,  they  can

pack  us  up. It is not Lee Kuan Yew whom they have  to

fight.  They have to fight a coherent group  which  has

built  up  a  movement  that has  got  people  who  are

prepared to work, to make it into a movement.  And  the

British understand this. That is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>



reason  why we survived. They understand that  if  they

snuff  us out, then the one decent group that has  been

able  to muster and rally support and recruits will  go

over. If not us, those who follow us would go over  and

join the Communists and bang the system. The fight here

in  Singapore  and  in the Federation  is  a  fight  to

preserve the democratic system. On that we are  agreed.

We  talk  of democratic forces. Mr Chew Swee  Kee  was

one.  The  tragedy  of those who talk about  democratic

forces in reference to anti-Communism is this: that the

word   "democratic"  is  not  synonymous   with   anti-Communism,  because otherwise they would have  to  avow

Syngman  Rhee as the most democratic man in the  world.

Nobody  pretends that. If you are relentlessly  pressed

until finally you have no support but the corrupt,  the

crooked, who only want money, who are prepared  to  use

their  power  positions  ruthlessly  to  maintain   the

"democratic" system and suppress the Communists, then I

would say the battle is lost. The battle in Malaya  has

not  been  lost. In my opinion, whether we  succeed  or

fail in the end will depend upon whether we can recruit

people into the movement. And when I say people,  I  do

not mean scallywags, rogues and vagabonds. I mean those

who  are  prepared  to  stake  their  lives  and  their

energies for a cause. If all the able people coming out

from  your  Chinese Middle schools, from Nan  Ta,  even

from  the  University of Malaya, opt for the  Communist

movement, then I say in ten or fifteen years' time  the

battle  is  near-lost. Then you  have  the  Member  for

Cairnhill   shouting  about  democracy  and  democratic

force,  when  one of his supporters has just  had  some

trouble  with somebody at the Esplanade. Then you  have

an  inquiry by the Elias Commission, and all  kinds  of

curious things happen. When you reach that point,  then

naked military dictatorship is upon us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This position has been thrust upon us. If we were

given  the choice, we would have preferred to  work  on

the  ground  for many more years to build the  movement

up,  because he who runs the country and holds the  gun

is at a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>



disadvantage.  I  explained  all  this  to  the   Chief

Minister  in October 1956, when he opened fire  with  a

double barrel, and he said, "Oh, it is not the British.

It is I that is doing it." He took the gun and fired! I

do  not  think he knew what it was all about. I believe

he now begins to understand that he lost the propaganda

battle.  That when he opened fire and lost, his Special

Branch  told him, "They're Communists." The  people  on

whom he opened fire and their friends were able to turn

it  and  say,  "He  opened  fire  on  Chinese  culture,

civilization,..." etc., etc.; till today he  is  trying

to  explain that he did not do that. But the battle has

already  been  lost!  That is why  we  are  really  not

interested  in whether they call themselves  S.P.A. or

any other alphabetical combination; the battle is over,

disappeared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned because the problem for us is not

the  winning of the elections but the survival  of  the

system after having won the elections; because if we go

the road that the Labour Front, the S.P.A. and the Lib-Socs  travel, then verily we shall perish as they  have

done.  But  whatever the odds, I can assure Members  on

the  Government side of this: that what happens in five

years'  time - win  or  lose - we would  not  make  such  a

disreputable  sight. We would, if we have  to  go  down

after five years for holding the gun with the Tunku and

his  troops in the north, the Communists on the ground,

the   British  squatting  over  us,  we  would  do   so

honourably,  we  will not yelp. I have  no  desire  for

power.  The last thing we want to do is to grab  power,

because  this  is not a playful matter.  Power  is  not

something  to  be  bargained for and  handed  over  the

counter.  It  has to be fought for, held  and  won.  My

honest admission is that, although vis-a-vis the  whole

lot of these so-called S.P.A., Lib-Socs, and what-have-you  can  just be knocked out with the rap of a finger,

it is another thing in fighting the Communist movement.

You  do  not fight it just by guns. The Chief  Minister

believed he was fighting it by just knocking-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All this is very interesting, but

perhaps the hon. Member would try and relate it to  the

motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Perhaps, Mr Speaker, Sir, if you

will bear with me in what is perhaps the last sitting

before we do our courtesies to you, you will appreciate

that I am really putting the cards on the table, as I

had intended to do from the beginning. And



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member will be

the  first  one  to  assist  the  Speaker,  as  far  as

possible, by keeping to the Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I will be the first one to assist

you in your duties, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time Members opposite talk, they talk about

individuals. The tragedy with them is that  after  four

years,  they are a collection of individuals. Mr  Chew

got  $500,000 and went away. When lie went  away,  they

all said, "I know nothing about it." He got away as  an

individual.  But  that  is not the  way  to  build  the

political force. There are no individuals in  the  P.A.P.

When  you fight one, you fight all. And that is what  a

lot  of  people  are discovering. When  you  fight  the

Mayor, you fight the whole Central Executive. When  you

fight Lee Kuan Yew, you are not fighting Lee Kuan  Yew;

you  are fighting the whole organized movement  of  the

P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like them to be a Right-wing force-organized,

coherent-like  the  Tory Party  who  have  a  full-time

organisation  who  can churn up pamphlets,  catch-words

like "property-owning democracy", ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what do they come out with? Wang Tsun Hao,

Secretary-General: according to the Member for  Queenstown,  whoever  is  the Secretary-General  must  be  an

important fellow. I believe Mr Wang Tsun Hao  must  be

an  important  fellow. First, he mounted  the  Workers'

Party platform, and he denounced the Labour Front. Then

something went wrong; it did not look good; and he  did

the opposite.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member must

realise that all this is completely irrelevant  to  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will just

bear with me, you will find the relevance of it when  I

nail it at the end. Sir -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Possibly the hon. Member had

better start nailing it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well, I shall put the first nails

in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why we decided to call for the

Government's  resignation  is  because  we   found   it

difficult to believe, after the exhibition of the Chief

Minister  on the 4th of March, that he would  play  the

game  according  to the rules of the Constitution.  And

when  the pressure became acute, and the boat began  to

sink,  even  if  he  did not do so, the  collection  of

unsavoury  people in his Party surrounding his  members

in  this Assembly who are all very savory people, would

use  unsavoury methods in his name. He knows that! That

happened  in Kallang. I did not accuse him of arranging

for the Labour Front car to be fortuitously loaded with

iron  bars and bicycle chains, and for two of our chaps

to  be stabbed in Jalan Besar. I knew he had not. If  I

believed for one moment that he had anything to do with

it,  there  would have been a hue and  cry.  I  quietly

acknowledged that he perhaps knew nothing about it. But

those  things were done in his name, and they could  be

done, because so-and-so could say, "Ah, don't worry; we

have  got  the Chief Minister. He will settle  anything

for  you." That is a fact, and he knew it. He said, "We

never  use  our  Ministerial  positions."  Perhaps  not

consciously.  We always put in favourable  construction

on  their actions. The Chief Minister said he  went  to

one polling station in the capacity of a polling agent.

Sir,  I think that is a very dangerous remark to  make,

because,  to  my  knowledge, I saw  him  walking  to  a

polling station, look around, and come out. And I,  the

election agent of the opposing candidate, could not  do

it, because I was not a Minister! But never mind, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of today's debate only confirms what for a

long  time we have already suspected. We are not saying

that  his side consists all of evil men who want  evil.

But  I say there are many dangerous characters and,  in

times  of  crisis, they would resort to dirty  tactics.

And  he  will  not be able to stop them. And  he  knows

that. Sir, the point is: it is our duty to see that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>



whatever happens, after the elections there are  stable

and  sober  conditions. The last thing we  want  is  an

aftermath and a blood-bath. We do not want to embark on

a  witch-hunt. I am pressing this point.  This  is  the

last  sitting. In the course of the election  campaign,

if  my Party members are injured, fingers are cut  off,

then  it will be impossible for me - I will not be  able,

nor  will my whole Committee be able - to put the  brakes

on; and we will then go down on the slippery slope of a

witch-hunt and a vendetta. We do not want that. That is

the  reason why I have tabled this motion. I  am  sorry

that  the  suggestion which I threw out in my  opening,

that they should vacate their office on leave prior  to

retirement, during the course of the election campaign,

was  not accepted. I did not want to press this  motion

if  I  could have a reasonable assurance that, in fact,

there  would  be  no Ministerial use  of  prestige  and

influence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am sorry to say that the conduct of the Deputy

Chief  Minister leaves a very big question mark  in  my

mind.  I  know he is not here; he is a very  angry  man

sulking  away in the C.P.A. Room. He is very angry  and

very  sulky because he believes, just because he and  I

are  also  good  friends, that I should not  state  the

truth.  He has good qualities, but he has one  failing,

and  that  is, he gets angry and talkative.  He  denied

that  he  told  the Press this, but after  I  made  the

statement this morning - I do not want to be involved  in

another  expose and prove the man a liar; nobody  gains

by that - he knew as well as anybody else that there were

two  people in the Gallery this morning (one  from  the

Straits   Times  and  the  other  from  the   Singapore

Standard) who confirmed at the lunch interval  that  he

had indicated - not in so many words that he was going to

fix  the City Council! After all, one could indicate  a

lot  of  things without words; otherwise animals  could

not  get  along with one another. Now, Sir, we  do  not

care.  By  all  means, "Let's fix  the  City  Council."

Magnificent! We have a first-class election  issue;  we

will  take a big stick to bang the Government  and  the

S.P.A. candidates with.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>



But  what  we want to avoid at all costs is  the  civil

commotion which may follow when the public feel  a  bit

perplexed, frustrated and angry. My purpose in bringing

it  out  today - the  purpose  of  my  Central  Executive

Committee, after we have had a discussion on this  last

night - was  to tell the public that such a thing  is  in

the  air;  that if it happens, they should  forget  it,

ignore it, and let the City Council be closed down. But

let  there  be general elections within sixty  days  of

dissolution.  Because  then we can  settle  the  parent

account. I am sorry the Deputy Chief Minister has  left

a big question mark in all our minds. We can appreciate

his anger; after all, much as I would deplore this sort

of  pique -  he  walked  out of, I  believe,  a  special

performance given in honour of the Duke because he  was

not given a chair-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is personal

conduct  outside the Assembly. The hon.  Member  cannot

refer to it at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Just because the Minutes were not

sent  to  him  as  immediately as  he  thought  he  was

entitled  to  have them, it does not mean that  he  can

just scrap the City Council. By all means scrub it! But

you  have to justify it. And I will say this:  that  we

know  what is going on, otherwise we would not survive;

we  knew yesterday what was on the boil. There was  Mr

Meadows  running  around; there was  the  Senior  Crown

Counsel  hovering  in  the  background.  They  were  in

conference. I also knew that Mr Carl Schubert,  Acting

Secretary  and Legal Adviser to the City  Council, had

gone  and  seen  a  D.P.P.,  who  confirmed  that   his

interpretation was the correct interpretation; that the

Council,  and not the Mayor or the C.A.O., should  give

the  Minutes. But these are all technicalities. We knew

something was brewing, and we wanted to nip it  in  the

bud. And this is the reason why we say it is absolutely

dangerous.  The brakes should be put on. If  the  Chief

Minister  allows the brakes to go off, then unwittingly

he would have embarked on a really hazardous adventure.

I do not know whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>



the  brakes  are going to be put on or not.  I  believe

they  will. That somewhat emotional exhibition  of  the

Deputy Chief Minister this morning probably has stifled

any  hope,  if  he had any, of getting his  Ministerial

colleagues to agree to embark on this perilous journey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But although we have stifled this one, there are

still two and a half months to go before polling day at

the  end of May. And then it could well be the  end  of

June  or the beginning of July. I do not know when  the

Government   intends  to  advise  the  Governor   about

dissolving  this Assembly. But the Governor has  stated

in  solemn  language that there will be polling  within

sixty days of the date of dissolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we come to the crux of the point: if the

British  are  prepared for international  repercussions

and the long-term repercussions of snuffing out a Left-wing  democratic movement, then I would  say,  "We  are

finished.  We  are out." We are prepared for  that.  In

which  case,  I say those who come after us  should  be

well  advised  to join some other Party.  That  is  our

position. We are not interested in obtaining power  for

the  sake  of power. As I have explained,  there  is  a

difference of degree between the Members in front of me

and  my colleagues, so great as to make it a difference

of  kind. Every one of my colleagues, when he goes into

the  arena,  is  losing  something.  They,  unlike  the

gentlemen  opposite,  know exactly  what  this  is  all

about. We saw Pandora's Box opened one by one till  the

smallest  and last box, and we are moving forward  into

position  to  take  over because  we  have  no  choice.

Because  it  is  the right thing to do by  our  people.

Because  if  we  do  not, a collection  of  scallawags,

rogues and vagabonds might get in, and then that is the

end of the democratic experiment, and all this nonsense

of  holding  elections  will  never  happen.  Then,  of

course,  the  British  are no  longer  responsible  for

internal security. Then we are all in the bag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the reason. Knowing full well what is in that

Box,  knowing full well that we may never  be  able  to

mount a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>



bigger  campaign at the end of five years  than  we  do

now, and fully aware of all the pitfalls, I suggest  to

the people of Singapore that we have a better chance of

success  of  making  the democratic  system  work  than

anybody  else. Because we know the price of  making  it

work does not depend on just locking up people who work

to  build up power, who work to build up popularity. If

the  Member for Serangoon had the opportunity  to  work

with  some of those who have been arrested and banished

as  Communists,  he would know the dedication  and  the

drive that they put on the ground-and they worked  like

demons.  And if he wants to compete, I believe  he  may

because  his  hands  are clean. He  is  a  simple  man,

although at one time I was afraid Mr Chew Swee Kee was

going  to subvert him. They went out of London together

and departed to some secret destination. I thought that

was   the  end  of  him.  I  am  glad  he  has  emerged

untarnished.  But he could not put up a fight.  Because

you must have drive, and you must believe in it to have

drive.  And  this Government on going down believes  in

nothing  but  survival, and for that reason  I  propose

that,  regardless of the voting on this Division,  they

should  seriously consider whether or not  they  should

not  put  themselves  in  an unassailable  position  by

taking  leave.  I say, if they want the money,  by  all

means get their pay up to polling day on leave prior to

retirement.  We all know it is retirement  anyway.  The

Tunku  has set an illustrious example. He says: "I  can

serve  the  people better working on the  ground."  The

Chief  Minister was so carried away as to  remark,  "We

will  all be so busy with the elections that we  cannot

use  our  Ministerial positions to exercise influence."

Well, if that is so, if that is the position honest  to

God,  then  what reason is there for remaining  in  the

Ministerial chair? This is the last sitting.  We  would

rather  have  left them alone because these  were  just

little things. The Chief Minister has now more or  less

desisted. But only for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>



the  time being. He keeps dithering on the brink. I  am

not  sure  whether  he is as good as  Mr  Dulles.  His

friends  may push him over the brink. I urge  him  even

after  we have departed from this Chamber to reconsider

whether he should not put himself beyond doubt and quit

Ministerial office after Nomination Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my motion was couched in what I

thought  was relatively restrained language. I did  not

bother  to  justify the disgust at the loss  of  public

confidence, because I think that was too obvious. But I

do  ask them in their last few weeks of office, not  to

bring   about  more  discredit.  If  they  only   bring

discredit  to  themselves, it  does  not  matter,  but,

unfortunately, their discredit may discredit the  whole

system  and the institutions through which subsequently

we  will have to work. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to  move

my last motion in this Assembly standing in my name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the hon. Member for Changi claim to

allowing me to clear up certain points.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is not the Speaker who

is kind! It is the Standing Order that is kind!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, parliamentary language is

very  complex. It is just like the crocodile who cannot

understand the language of the donkey! Now,  the  mover

of  the  motion, Sir, touched on three points  which  I

wish  to  make clear. One is the secret of the midnight

visit - we   never  said  "no"  or  "yes".  Second,   the

opposition  of  citizenship  to  be  included  at   the

Conference in London in 1956. Third, the brother of the

hon.  Member  for Bukit Timah, Mr Lim Ching  Joo,  who

charged the Special Branch for a great deal of torture.

All  this I put forward and invite the hon. Member  for

Tanjong Pagar categorically to state whether it is true

or not. He not only failed to answer-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Probably the hon. Member for

Tanjong Pagar understood very well. The only trouble is

that, I think, he did not reply to those points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is on a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is not that I did not reply. I

stated  that  it was so baseless, that it came  from  a

person whom I consider inappropriate to reply to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That supports the idea that the speech

was very well understood.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, maybe his story of David

against Goliath is not true. But maybe the hon.  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  is  a  coward  not  to  accept  an

invitation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we have had enough of

that.  Obviously  the hon. Member  for  Changi  is  not

rising  under  the appropriate Standing Order,  and  he

<div align="center"><h4>TRIBUTES TO MR SPEAKER</h4></div>



<br><br>6.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before moving

the adjournment, I beg leave to say a few words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure I speak on behalf of all

Members  of  this House when I say that we are  greatly

indebted  to  you  for the calm, unbiased  and  skilful

manner in which you have presided at all sittings, both

as  Speaker and as Chairman, inside this House  and  in

many Committees of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been truly fortunate in having you as Speaker

from  the  very  beginning to guide, correct  and,  not

infrequently,   restrain  us,  thereby  enabling   this

Assembly  to  conduct  itself in  a  manner  which  has

excited  respect and admiration for the institution  of

parliamentary debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By your ever-patient and tactful handling of the many

difficult  situations, you have succeeded  in  bringing

about  a  high  standard  of conduct  and  debate,  and

instilling into all a respect for the Chair, which,  in

turn, has bred a respect for all decisions given by the

Chair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure hon. Members of this House will associate

with  me  in  these expressions of sincere appreciation

which  have been fully earned. If at times we had  been

inclined to be trying or difficult, it was not prompted

by  disrespect  but by emotion which, on  a  number  of

occasions, some of us were quite unable to contain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It augurs well for the future of Singapore and our

hopes for a truly democratic Government that under  the

new Constitution you, Sir, will also preside as Speaker

when the new Assembly comes into being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like also, Sir, to place on record, on behalf

of  all Members of this House, our sincere appreciation

of  the services and assistance which the Clerk of  the

Legislative Assembly and his staff accorded all Members

during this and previous sessions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

place  on record the deep esteem we have felt  for  the

way  in which you have conducted your high office.  You

have endowed it with the dignity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>



and  solemnity with which many of us on  the  Floor  of

this House have not been able to endow our seats.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we would also like to

associate ourselves with the remarks made by the  Chief

Minister and the leader of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Leader of the

Labour Front, may I pay my tribute as well for the very

high esteem we have for the Chair?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, all this is a little out of

order. In ruling these remarks out of order, may I  say

that  I  am  completely overwhelmed  by  the  kind  and

generous  remarks of hon. Members? I can only say  that

my  task,  which has been exacting at times,  has  been

made   easier   by   the  goodwill,   cooperation   and

understanding of hon. Members, and I am sure that  with

these  ingredients any future Speaker will find  little

difficulty  in maintaining the dignity and prestige  of

this Assembly.
