<br><br><div align="center"><b>Committee</b></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 323-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment proposed - [29th July, 1957] - In page 245,

to  leave out lines 31 to 40, and lines 1 to 12 in

page 246. - [Mr John Ede].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed

to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Chairman, to recapitulate

what  I  was  saying  yesterday.  I  very  briefly

pointed  out that Singapore was passing through  a

period  of transition which has involved,  amongst

other  things,  the Malayanisation  of  the  civil

service. I will go on from there. The machinery of

Government  has been deprived of a certain  number

of  officers with experience and ability,  and  to

the  extent  that  those officers  have  gone  the

machine is temporarily reduced in its capacity for

work.  That loss will be made up rapidly  as  new

officers get their training and experience  but  I

want  to point out that the machinery of the civil

service   is   confronted  not   only   with   the

traditional  tasks,  the old tasks  which  it  has

always carried out, but that two new aspects  have

imposed additional strain on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is now for the first time

working  under the direct control of  a  political

Party,  a  political  Government,  which  has  its

specific  programme  to carry  out  and  which  is

seeking to carry it out. And this inevitably means

a  great  deal  of  additional and  new  work  and

sometimes  work of new kinds, and that  is  a  new

aspect which has not been in Singapore before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a new tempo, and this is a more

unfamiliar  idea to Members of the Opposition.  In

the  past,  broadly speaking, all policy decisions

had to be funnelled, channelled, through the Chief

Secretary's Office. Now decisions can be taken  at

the   ministerial  desk  in  many  cases  and  the

consequence is that work moves a good deal faster.

We are now in my own office dealing with various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2434</b></font><br><br>



matters  which in some cases have been  coming  up

annually for five or six years, but since we  have

a  ministerial system they, are now  getting  into

their  final stage although there was no  sign  of

their ever approaching a final stage before.  This

also  has imposed new strain on the civil  service

and  I  would  like to say, Mr Chairman,  that  I

think  Singapore is very much indebted  indeed  to

its    civil   servants.   They   have   responded

magnificently  to  the needs of Singapore  in  the

last two-and-half years. They have done a fine job

and  I  am sure they will go on doing a fine  job.

But  let  us  not  impose on them any  unnecessary

demands.  Let  us  try to be realistic  about  the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall have to say a word again on the next item

on  the Order Paper, the proposed new clause after

clause  17,  so  I will not labour this  point.  I

shall  only say again: do not be unrealistic about

these   transitional  provisions;  the  Opposition

should not set up ideals of what should be without

taking account of what actually is, because at the

time  we are living in now, the problems are  very

considerable  and  an  unrealistic  or  artificial

approach  will  only magnify the problems  without

bringing them any nearer to solution.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, yesterday

the Hon. the Chief Secretary commented on the time

taken  between the First Reading and  the  present

debate.  It  has been a long time of course;  that

means there has been all the more time in which to

get  the  house in order for the District Councils

and the new City Council, and to have organised  a

more  sensible scheme. The Hon. Minister has  just

spoken, Sir, that at the ministerial level  things

now  go much faster than they used to do, but that

is  a  point  we see no evidence of in respect  of

this  Bill  at all. He said, too, that unnecessary

demands are being imposed on civil servants. These

unnecessary demands are being imposed by  altering

boundaries  unnecessarily instead of leaving  them

alone,   and   the  complications   are   of   the

Government's own making.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2435</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Secretary also said that the

reference  to  a  period  of  four  years  by  the

Minister was a reference to administration by  the

Rural  Board and not to clause 323 which  we  have

before  us.  But column 343 of the Report  of  the

Select  Committee will show that in fact  this  is

not so. The Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The provisions of clause 324, [as it was then]

I  should  like  to stress to the  Committee,  are

transitional and discretionary. Read  in  relation

to  sub-clause (4), it clearly indicates that this

is purely transitional legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear, Sir, that the Government feels

that  at  least  during  the  first  term  of  the

district  council, there should be  this  sort  of

arrangement.  It also thinks that the transitional

period  will not last the full term of  office  of

the new district council, that it is not going  to

last for all time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Sir, in answer to the question which we

asked  as  to what the elected representatives  in

Katong  are  going  to do on the District  Council

when the administration is carried out by the City

Council, all he had to say, so far as I understood

him, was that for the period December of this year

to March 1958 when district council elections will

be   held,   there   will  not  be   any   elected

representatives  at  all.  That  seems  to  us   a

somewhat  cynical  answer and  it  reaffirms  that

Katong   will   be   a   no-man's-land   with   no

representation  for a period of four  months,  and

very  futile representation thereafter. This seems

to us to be the negation of a solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you turn, Sir, to the last sentence of the

Government White Paper, page 9, you will  find  it

stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Local Government administration in any area is

intimately connected with the day to day lives  of

the inhabitants living therein and it is but right

that  they should have a say in the election of  a

local government body depending closely upon their

support, and whose decisions should pay due regard

to  their  wishes concerning their  happiness  and

well being."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these words have turned to ashes in view of

the  Labour  Front's  action in  introducing  this

clause  323.  It seems to me that these  are  mere

"apple-tree" promises, and it gives  us,  Sir,  an

extremely   bad   start   to   district    council

administration  to have this absurd  situation  of

representatives sitting on one council and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2436</b></font><br><br>



administration being carried out by  another.  The

City  Council  apparently is to administer  Katong

under  ministerial orders. What interest  can  you

really expect the City Council to take when it  is

acting  under ministerial orders, and it  is  only

for  a  short period of time before Katong  leaves

it?  And  what interest will the District  Council

take  in  Katong if, to begin with, it has nothing

to do with its administration?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister for Commerce and Industry

suggested  a  few  days ago that District  Council

meetings  would be nothing more than a tea  party,

where people sat round a table and have an amiable

chat while the officers deal with all the work. It

certainly would be a mad hatter's tea party as far

as Katong is concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> I made no such suggestion, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, perhaps the term "tea

party"  was not used but the suggestion given  was

that there was going to be a jolly little causerie

in  these  District  Councils and  no  work  would

really be carried out. There would be a nice  chat

about  drains and that sort of thing, and all  the

work  would be done by somebody else. That is  not

our  view of the way in which the District Council

work should be carried out, and it is not followed

either  in  the White Paper or in this great  Bill

which  now includes District Councils in the rural

areas  which  is  not  of course  in  the  present

Municipal  Ordinance. The thing  is  simply  this,

Sir,  that  if Katong had been left  in  the  City

Council this nonsensical Heath Robinson device  of

clause 323 would not have to be availed of.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think the hon. Member is still

wide  off the beam, Mr Chairman. Surely the point

is  that,  although Katong obsesses his  mind,  in

fact  the District Council will cover a very  much

larger area than Katong, which is just the nucleus

or  hard  core  around which  the  whole  District

Council   will  be  built,  and  the  transitional

provisions   will  be  necessary,  in   any   case

presumably  during the period in which  the  whole

system is being readjusted. His other favourite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2437</b></font><br><br>



area, the Ulu Pandan section and the Clementi Road

divided  down the middle - all this tragic  business

about  the farmers on one side and the farmers  on

the  other having different electoral laws - is  the

same  sort  of  thing.  We  do  need  transitional

provisions  of  some sort. He  has  the  idea,  we

gather,  that the Government somehow could  create

out of the air a full and complete pre-judged, pre-estimated,   pre-thought-out,   pre-planned    and

provided  system  with all the officers,  all  the

buildings  and the equipment. He would like  that;

and  if we cannot do it at once then, he says,  do

not  do  anything at all; let us go to  sleep  for

another 10 years and let things go on as they are.

That  is  what the hon. Member for Serangoon  said

earlier,  that it did not matter if we did  delay;

if  we  could not do it the Liberal-Socialist  way

then  let us do nothing at all, let us let  things

slide   and  have  further  delay.  That   is   an

inconsistency - we  have  been  attacked  first  for

delaying  City Council elections and  now  we  are

attacked for trying to get them on. This  sort  of

argument is really rather frivolous, Mr Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did make the point when I first stood up about

the  extent  to  which public servants  are  being

subjected  to  very heavy strain and  pressure  in

this transitional period. As far as I can see, the

objective  of the Member for Tanglin is  still  to

demand that they should be reallocated in some way

immediately  so  as to make it clear  that  Mr  X

works  for  one  Council and  Mr  Y  for  another

Council  and  so on. He still does not  appreciate

that  you  cannot do that by a momentary decision.

You  have to study records, you have to examine  a

man's  confidential files - a whole  mass  of  civil

service  work  has to be done before  you  finally

decide where Mr X is to go and where Mr Y is  to

go,  and  that Mr X is to go up or down and  that

kind of thing. There is an enormous amount of work

to  be done in the offices though, of course,  the

Opposition  does not see it. But it does  see  the

results  of  it,  and then it complains  that  the

results are not what they would have been  if  the

Opposition had had to do it. But I wish  the  hon.

Member would get a little more realistic in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2438</b></font><br><br>



his  approach  to  these  problems  and  not  keep

putting  up  his  rather  unspecific  demand  that

nothing  should be done about Katong and therefore

nothing should be done about anybody at all.



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  agree with my colleague that to exclude  Katong

from  the  City limit would be a very  unwholesome

way of adjustment. As we know, Sir, in the City we

are  going to have a City Council and as  a  whole

the City Council will be concentrating its efforts

on  how  to  improve the area within its  control.

Katong  is to be thrust on to it by these  powers.

It  will just carry on, as we say, in the line  of

obligation,  but I doubt that there  will  be  any

effort  made to improve conditions in the District

of Katong. It has now become the responsibility of

none  of  the Councillors and in that  case,  Sir,

Katong  may just have the existing facilities  and

no  more. There will be no further improvement  on

it.  The  people will not get better services  for

paying  the same amount of rates, and all  in  all

enjoy no further facilities at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of delays, and accusations of not

delaying  as  propounded by the Hon. Minister  for

Communications and Works, I think  that  it  is  a

confession of the inefficiency of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Anybody who is at the helm of

things  could have made the whole matter go faster

or  slower.  It is not right to put the  blame  on

anybody  else  but on itself. It has the  ultimate

power.  It has all the instruments behind it,  all

the  civil  service which has  to  carry  out  its

policies.   And  if  it  had  thought   about   it

carefully, all these things would have  gone  very

smoothly. It is lack of thought, lack of planning,

lack  of timing, that placed a strain on the civil

servants. The pressure which the civil service  is

experiencing now is the making of the  Government.

It  is  not  that the civil service is not  worked

harder,  but  that it is not used properly.  Civil

servants, I would say, are just like machines.  If

the person at the wheel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2439</b></font><br><br>



who  drives the machine is not efficient  probably

the  machine  will bog down and stop.  Who  is  to

blame - the  machine  or the person  at  the  wheel?

Certainly  I  would like to lay the blame  on  the

person at the wheel and not the machinery. Only  a

bad workman quarrels with his tools!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee divided: Ayes, 9; Noes, 19; Absent,4.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 323 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clause (immediately after clause 17)-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to introduce a new

clause to be inserted immediately after clause 17:



<pre>

"Appointment      (1) A  District   Council  shall, with the

 of District   concurrence  of  the  Minister,  appoint  fit

 Council       and proper persons to be Secretary, Treasurer,

 Employees.    Health Officer, Assessor, Engineer, Architect

               and    Building    Surveyor   and   Cleansing

               Superintendent.



                  (2) Persons appointed  to such posts shall

               not be removed  without the  consent  of  the

               Minister.".

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up, and read the First time.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I move, "That the clause be read a Second time."





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2440</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this clause and the two other new clauses

which we shall move later are of course to a great

extent inter-related in that they do refer to  the

setting  up  of  proper  administration   of   the

District  Councils,  and I hope  I  shall  not  be

considered to be irrelevant if I do to some extent

in  a general way range over the subject matter of

the  two new clauses because I hope possibly  that

by doing that we may be able to shorten the debate

and concentrate on the general principles as we go

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue really seems to be this, that for

some  reason the Government has been unwilling  to

write into this Bill clauses that are necessary to

make the District Councils largely autonomous;  to

give them powers over their staff, powers over the

list  of posts, powers over their finances through

the  constitution of a District Council  fund.  We

have heard from the Government Benches that it has

had great difficulties in getting everything ready

for  these new District Councils; whether that  is

justifiable delay or not we have debated it and we

need   not  go  too  far  into  that  point.   But

nevertheless  I  think the Minister  said  in  his

speech a week ago that it was in sympathy with our

intentions  in having these clauses  written  into

the  Bill,  where  in fact they will  have  to  be

written  in  in  any  case in due  course  if  the

District  Councils are to operate as we  all  wish

them  to  operate, and even the Government  wishes

them to operate. What we do not understand is  the

reason why they cannot be written in at this stage

because,  as I say, even if there has to  be  some

delay  in  bringing in the implementation  of  the

autonomy of the District Councils in full by March

1958,  by the introduction of these clauses - having

them  on  the Statute Book from now - the Government

is still covered perfectly adequately by clause  1

(2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Governor may appoint different days for the

coming  into  operation  of  different  Parts   or

provisions  of  this Ordinance  and  may  in  such

notification  declare that any provision  of  this

Ordinance  shall  not apply to  District  Councils

until  the Minister by notification in the Gazette

declares that it shall so apply."



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2441</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there you have in clause 1 (2) powers whereby

in  any  case you need not bring in these  clauses

which  we  are considering now, particularly  this

one   on   the  appointment  of  District  Council

employees. You need not bring these into effect in

fact  until  you are ready. The Minister  at  some

stage, I think, did say that it might be that  one

District  Council,  the Katong  District  Council,

could  be  got  working  on  an  autonomous  basis

earlier  than the other two. Surely the very  fact

that  you have these clauses written into the Bill

would   mean  that  you  could  bring  them   into

operation in respect of the first District Council

to be properly organised under clause 1 (2)?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulties therefore seem to be very slight

indeed.  It seems to me that if those clauses  are

there, then we on this side will be more satisfied

that  every  effort  is  being  made  to  put  the

District Councils on a proper footing as  soon  as

possible. We have talked about four, five  or  six

months, or even quite a short period after  March,

when at least one of the District Councils can  be

put  on  a proper basis, but let it be remembered,

Sir, that for a short period after March - or it may

be  a  long period of some months - there will be  a

change in our Constitution and there may very well

be,  and  we  hope  there will  be,  a  change  in

Government, and it may be that there will  not  be

adequate  time  over a period of  months  for  new

legislation to be carried out. And there  will  be

an  excuse for a delay in putting into effect what

at  all events must be put into effect as soon  as

possible.  And  so  by  using  clause  1  (2)  the

difficulty is avoided; when everything  is  ready,

whatever  period it may be, the operation  can  go

forward smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Chief Secretary said only

yesterday,  he  conceded,  that  the  staff   were

available and that all arrangements have been made

for the staffing of the District Councils. If that

is  so, there should be no difficulty in accepting

this clause. There might, Sir, I agree, be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2442</b></font><br><br>



some  small  argument  as to whether  a  cleansing

superintendent is really necessary in  a  District

Council  when you have a health officer, and  that

possibly you could cut out the superintendent  and

leave  all  health aspects including cleansing  in

the  hands of the health officer. If that  is  the

difficulty in the way of the Government  we  would

of  course be glad to accept an amendment of  that

nature,  so that if there is any officer  in  this

list  that  we  propose who does not square  quite

with  what  perhaps  would  be  necessary  in  the

District  Councils, an amendment can  be  made  at

this stage with the greatest of ease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we on this side are somewhat suspicious, I

regret to say, as to the reasons for the delay  in

putting  these new clauses into the  Bill.  It  is

most  desirable that we should have the  machinery

working  by March or as near March as possible  so

that the District Councils are as near as possible

autonomous  from  the start. Now if  the  Liberal-Socialists or the People's Action Party was to win

a   majority  in  the  elections  to  a   District

Council-or any other Party was to win a  majority-the Government could be (I do not say it would be,

but  it could be) deliberately obstructive so long

as  it had all the powers resting in its hands. We

are  suspicious, I say, Sir, because on Friday two

Ministers  declared with glee that no impartiality

could  be  expected in a Labour  Front  Mayor.  We

therefore now know what to expect in the  District

Council with a non-Labour Front majority,  and  we

know  the way possibly the nominated members would

be appointed. The Government has shown its hand in

this  matter and we think, for this reason  alone,

that  these clauses should be incorporated in  the

Bill at this juncture.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The new clause is intituled

"Appointment  of District Council Employees."  The

Question  is,  "That the clause be read  a  Second

if  the  debate  does  range  over  the  next  two

amendments, the new clauses

intituled  "List  of Posts" and "District  Council

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I hope I shall also be allowed by  you to range over the subject

matter of  these new  clauses together because, like the Member for

Tanglin,  I think that will shorten the debate  on

the succeeding new clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government does agree, as the Minister

indeed  pointed  out,  with  these  amendments  in

principle,  but  they  cannot  be  introduced   at

present  and  they  are  premature.  Members  will

appreciate, Sir, that it is not possible to create

independent   and  100  per  cent  self-sufficient

District  Councils  overnight.  We  have   to   be

practical.  Government has repeatedly stated  that

these District Councils will be run for an interim

period, after their establishment, on Rural  Board

lines.  Since  they will be largely  dependent  on

Government  for funds and staff, therefore  it  is

not   unreasonable  for  their  finances   to   be

subjected to ultimate Assembly approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the new clause 17, as I have

said  before, and which I think has been said also

in  the  explanatory note, the  District  Councils

will  have  their  staff, who will  be  Government

servants.  Government will provide the  staff  for

the  District Councils for an interim  period  and

therefore  this  clause is unnecessary.  They  are

Government servants and the appointments  will  be

made  by  Government.  They  will  be  subject  to

Government salary schemes,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2444</b></font><br><br>



promotions  and  transfers.  When  these  District

Councils  become autonomous, they will have  their

own independent staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the particular clause as it

stands   at  present,  I  have  two  points,   two

comments, to make. One is that it is even wider in

its  application than that which has  been  agreed

upon  with  regard to the City Council.  There  we

restricted  the clause to cover certain  heads  of

departments  only,  like the City  Engineer,  City

Health Officer and City Assessor; but this clause,

as  it reads, has wider application. For instance,

if  you take the word "Engineer", it may mean more

than  one  type  of  engineer. It  could  mean  an

Assistant  Engineer  also, but  that  is  not  the

intention.   I   think  this  clause   should   be

restricted  like  the one on the City  Council  is

restricted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again you have to bear in mind that in the

City Council these posts already exist, whereas in

the District Councils they need not necessarily be

so.  For instance, there might be a combined  post

of  Secretary-Treasurer instead of  two  different

posts  of Secretary and Treasurer. I think in  the

Penang City Council, and if I am not mistaken also

in  the  Malacca  Council,  there  is  a  post  of

Secretary-Treasurer.  Here  we   are   trying   to

anticipate things by saying that there should be a

Treasurer and a Secretary. These things will  have

to  be  left  to the District Councils.  They  may

decide  to  have, for the time being, a Secretary-Treasurer, not two separate posts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again we do not know how the District

Councils  will  call these posts  when  they  have

their own staff. We do not know whether they  will

stick  to  the word "Engineer"; they may call  him

"District Engineer" or "Chief Engineer". The  same

with  the Health Officer - they may prefer  to  call

him  "District  Health Officer" or  "Chief  Health

Officer".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the clause immediately after this new clause,

entitled  "List of Posts", we agree in  principle,

as  I  said, that the District Councils should  be

autonomous,  but  here again it is  premature.  On

this  particular clause the proposer seems to have

forgotten   to  say  how  such  appointments   and

promotions to all the posts in the list  shall  be

made. If you just introduce this clause and accept

it,  it  will  be  like  making  an  amendment  in

isolation. You create a list of posts but  you  do

not say how promotions and appointments are to  be

made,  as you do for the City Council. I think  it

is made under clause 12.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the new clause immediately after clause 101 as

it  stands,  as  I say for an initial  period  the

District  Councils  will be  run  on  Rural  Board

lines,  and in view of this intention to run  them

on  Rural  Board  lines  while  they  are  largely

dependent  on  Government revenue and  until  they

become financially viable, this new clause  as  it

stands  is  contrary  and  inconsistent  with  the

provisions  of  the  proviso to  clause  16  which

already  stands part of the Bill. The  new  clause

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All moneys received by a District Council by

virtue  of  this  or  any  other  Ordinance  shall

constitute  a  fund  which  shall  be  called  the

District Council Fund and shall together with  all

property  which  is or may become  vested  in  the

District  Council  be  under  the  direction   and

control  of  the District Council subject  to  the

provisions of this Ordinance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 says that all these properties of the

District Councils during this interim period  will

be Crown property. The proviso to clause 16 on the

constitution of District Councils says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided always that...in any case where, by

reason  of the exercise by a District Council,  of

any   power,  function  or  duty,  discretion   or

authorization,  by  this  Ordinance   imposed   or

conferred upon or exercisable by that Council, any

land  or other immovable property has been  vested

in or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2446</b></font><br><br>



would  be  vested in or acquired by that  Council,

such  land or other immovable property shall  vest

in  or  be  acquired by the Crown, and  the  Crown

shall  have  the  sole right of selling,  letting,

granting or leasing...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this new clause after clause 101 is

passed  now,  it will also be wholly  inconsistent

with  clause  103. In this new clause, sub-clauses

(2)  and (3) mean that a District Council will  be

responsible for the drawing up and approval of its

own  budget,  whereas clause 103  means  that  the

budget  is  to  be submitted to the  Minister  for

ultimate  incorporation into the Colony Estimates.

If  the  intention in this new clause after clause

101  is  to make District Councils operate now  as

financially   autonomous  bodies,  this   solitary

clause  by itself falls woefully short of what  is

necessary  to achieve that end. For instance,  the

proposer  does not make provision for the disposal

of  moneys  received in respect of the  funds  (we

have the corresponding clause 68 in respect of the

Municipal Fund), on how to invest such moneys  and

on  the  mode of preparation of the budget.  There

are  also other matters which must be looked  into

before  we  can make District Councils  autonomous

and have their own district funds.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is therefore no point in inserting

these new clauses now, and on the strength of what

the  Member  for  Tanglin says they  need  not  be

brought into force now. The reason why we say they

should  not be brought into force now,  that  they

are  premature, is that they are really amendments

in  isolation. Other provisions should also be put

into this Bill, if you want to make these District

Councils  autonomous  in financial  dealings.  The

financial  arrangements as long as they are  going

to  be  run  on Rural Board lines as envisaged  in

this  Bill, are a simple, practical and  necessary

procedure  for an initial period in  view  of  the

District Councils' dependence on the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already stated - I repeat that

again, Sir - that when these Councils have been  set

on their feet, and have become financially viable,

amending legislation will be introduced to  enable

them  to  function  independently  like  the  City

Council. The clauses which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2447</b></font><br><br>



Member  has proposed can then become part of  such

legislation. I do not know why he has stressed the

word suspicion. There is no suspicion; we are only

being practical. To include them now in this  Bill

is to make them amendments in isolation serving no

purpose whatever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Sir, as long as these District

Councils  are to be run on Rural Board lines  with

regard to staff, vesting of property, revenue  and

expenditure,  I  say  the  clauses  on   financial

procedure which we have provided for in  the  Bill

are  a  practical, sensible and necessary  way  of

letting  the District Councils operate. For  these

reasons, Sir, I oppose the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, what the

hon.  Member for Tanglin is putting forward  today

is only a question of principle, and whether these

District  Councils  should  be  allowed   to   run

autonomously  or, as the Hon. the Chief  Secretary

has  said, with great timidity, is just a question

of approach - whether we are prepared to launch into

a  real  democratic system of local government  as

soon as possible or to delay this indefinitely and

run  all the three District Councils in the manner

the  Rural  Board  has been  run  or  as  advisory

councils. It is on principles that we are  talking

about  now and any consequential amendments  which

the  Hon. the Chief Secretary said must  be  made

will  have  to  be  made  if  the  principles  are

accepted.  There is only the question of  approach

to  this  matter today - whether we are prepared  to

try  out District Councils and launch them as real

district  councils,  or just to  approve  District

Councils in principle and let it take five or  ten

years to mature or to bring into effect.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, the underlying

fear  in  the  mind  of  the Opposition  that  has

emerged  throughout these four days of  debate  on

this  Bill has been the fear that the Labour Front

Government  may be unfair if the local  government

bodies  are  filled with other Party members.  And

the  Member for Tanglin has highlighted this  fear

today by giving us an example of what might happen

if the District Councils had a majority of Liberal-Socialist  Councillors.  Sir,  that  fear  of  the

Liberal-Socialists is a credit to the Labour Front



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2448</b></font><br><br>



in that they have confidence that the Labour Front

will  be returned as the government in the  coming

elections. We thank them for that, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also did mention that two Ministers had

said  that  Ministers could not  be  impartial.  I

think,  Sir,  that  if that was not  a  deliberate

twisting   of   what  I  and  the   Minister   for

Communications and Works stated, it must have been

a  big  misunderstanding on the part of the Member

for Tanglin. What I stated and my colleague stated

was that Ministers could not be impartial to Party

programmes  and Party platforms - not in  individual

matters: in individual matters Ministers  must  be

impartial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point, Sir, arising out of this

debate on the amendment which the Member seeks  to

move, and that is that the amendment states that a

District  Council shall, with the  concurrence  of

the Minister, appoint fit and proper persons to be

Secretary,  Treasurer, Health  Officer,  Assessor,

Engineer, Architect and Building Surveyor  and  so

on.  Supposing the District Council does not  feel

the  necessity  of appointing an architect  or  an

assessor, that it feels it could make do with  the

City  Assessor  and share the cost of  that  post?

This  new  clause which the Member seeks  to  move

makes  it  imperative  that the  District  Council

shall appoint such officers and shall create  such

posts,  so that this would mean that the  District

Council  concerned  would be  forced  to  go  into

expenditure which it might not necessarily want to

go into.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, the reasons given by

Members   of  the  Government  Benches   for   not

accepting this new clause, and by implication  the

next  two, seem to us extremely flimsy ones.  They

are quibbling points rather than points bearing on

the  necessity  of  proper administration  of  the

District  Councils. The Hon. the  Chief  Secretary

stated that the term "Engineer" might be taken  to

refer  to  the chief engineer or the head engineer

or the senior engineer, and that perhaps we should

have a Secretary-Treasurer; and the Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry  said  that  the  District

Councils   shall   appoint - it   should   not    be

obligatory; and so on. In other words,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2449</b></font><br><br>



it  is quite clear that the Government has not the

faintest idea what officers are to be appointed to

the  District  Councils. Surely at this  stage  it

should  have a clear intention of what it intended

should   operate  under  this  Bill?   I   suspect

sometimes  that  it  is because Government  cannot

produce  the  staff  to man the District  Councils

properly,  and being in this dilemma of course  it

cannot  commit  itself to having any  officers  at

all!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Secretary also mentioned that

the  new  clause on list of posts  as  tabled  was

incomplete,  and  that it would  mean  sub-clauses

would  have  to be added to it if  it  was  to  be

satisfactory, following clause 12 of the  Bill  in

respect of the City Council. We are quite aware of

that, Sir. We have put down the main, salient sub-clauses  of these clauses as a matter of principle

and it follows of course that they should be fully

completed  if the Government accepts the principle

involved, and we agree that if these clauses  were

to  be accepted there would have to be changes  in

other  clauses of the Bill. We are quite aware  of

that,  Sir, but that is the work of the Government

to do: it is not the business of the Opposition to

bear the work of legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is really all I have to say, Sir,

but  we  have not had an answer to the fundamental

point  which I have made, and that is there  seems

to  be  no reason why these clauses should not  be

written  into the Bill here and now when  you  are

completely and adequately covered by clause 1  (2)

whereby  the  Governor may appoint different  days

for  the coming into operation of different  parts

or  provisions of this Ordinance and may  in  such

notification  declare that any provision  of  this

Ordinance  shall  not apply to  District  Councils

until  the Minister by notification in the Gazette

declares that it shall so apply. And it does  seem

to  us that because use is not being made of  this

very admirable umbrella under which the Government

can  shelter,  that  there  is  the  intention  of

delaying the autonomy of the District Councils  as

long  as possible. The Chief Secretary stated that

in any case they could not become autonomous until

they are financially viable. When is that going to

be? We on this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2450</b></font><br><br>



side  of  the House fully realise that,  to  begin

with, Government will have to subsidise, with  the

approval  of this Assembly, the finances of  these

District  Councils probably up to 60 per  cent  of

its  revenue, and that being the position,  if  we

are   going  to  wait  until  these  Councils  are

financially viable, then we will have to wait  for

decades.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> About six weeks ago, Mr Chairman,

the  hon.  Member for Tanglin regarded  it  as  an

insult  to  the  elected  representatives  on  the

District Councils if they were not given the  full

staff from the very start. That was six weeks ago.

Since  then  he has had the benefit of  hearing  a

debate  in  this House and heard some  words  from

myself  about being realistic, and it is no longer

an insult - we can now shelter under the umbrella of

clause  1 (2). In short, we are to put this  thing

in but not to operate it.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. I was only

suggesting a way out for the Government out of its

dilemma.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> In suggesting a way out, to take

refuge under an umbrella, he is seeking a way  out

for himself from a change of ground, from what  he

resisted  as an intolerable insult six  weeks  ago

but   now   accepts  as  a  perfectly   acceptable

manoeuvre;  to satisfy his demand that  we  should

have  something written into the Bill but also  to

say,  "I  realise this cannot be done but we  will

have  it  written in just to show that I have  not

made  a  mistake in putting it down on  the  Order

Paper."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we go on to the principle of autonomy, which

is  a  favourite  word on the other  side  of  the

House;   but   principles  must  have  practicable

application. Let us imagine that you wish to  have

an  engineer in each of the District Councils.  He

must  have equipment, staff, a maintenance  depot,

otherwise  he  will not be able to  function.  All

this  will have to be provided before you  appoint

him, otherwise you would be paying him salary  and

he could not do anything. We do not know precisely

yet  what the District Councils will want done.  I

do  not  think  that the Opposition will  accept - I

certainly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2451</b></font><br><br>



would not accept myself - that the District Councils

will do no more than what the Rural Board has done

or  that  they  will do precisely what  the  Rural

Board has done. They will no doubt have their  own

ideas  because  these will be  the  ideas  of  the

people living in those districts. And therefore if

this  proposal  to  have, say, an  engineer  means

anything,  it means that we should now  beforehand

commit  the  Councils to expenditure on  equipment

and  to  lay out a staff which may not be what  in

fact they want and which experience may show to be

unsuitable.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sort of administrative point which

the Opposition completely fails to grasp. They see

some  admirable principle and of course  it  is  a

very sound thing indeed that the District Councils

should have the proper staff to carry out the work

that  they want done and everyone agrees that that

is  the  intention; that intention can be achieved

but  it will not be achieved by putting down empty

clauses and then operating under clause 1 in order

to  make  the clause of no effect and then perhaps

to  take  the clause out again and say, "Well,  on

consideration, the District Councils tell us  that

they  do not particularly want these people.  They

would like to have something different. They  find

that  the Technical Assistant level is enough  for

the  engineering work for the time being  or  they

find  (as the hon. Member himself said) that  they

want  to  combine  the  Health  Officer  and   the

Cleansing  Officer  or  any other  combination  of

functions." The hon. Member is apparently prepared

to   foresee  at  all  stages  what  the   elected

representatives in the District Councils will want

to  do.  I think he is unable to foresee it except

insofar  as there may be Liberal-Socialists  under

his  orders  or  under  directives  of  his  Party

managers or controllers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make one little further point.

The  hon. Member said that it is expected that the

Government cannot produce the staff to manage  the

District Councils properly. I think he used



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2452</b></font><br><br>



the  word "manage" - my notes have "manage".  But  I

think  there  again he is under an  administrative

misapprehension. It would be possible and it  will

be  possible, I think, as far as the staff  of  my

own   Ministry  is  concerned,  for   the   Senior

Executive  Engineer  (Rural) and  those  who  work

under  him  to  meet  the needs  of  the  District

Councils for the first part of their term. He  can

deploy the staff so as to meet their needs, if  we

keep  the  existing structure in which the  Senior

Executive  Engineer will be the advisory  Engineer

who would attend the Councils when wanted and give

them  the  benefit of his advice, in the same  way

that  the  Rural Board makes use of the  Executive

Engineer  now. But if you were to try to break  up

his  organisation and fragment it and share it out

amongst  the  different Councils, you  might  well

find  that in fact you got less work done and  not

more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, if

District  Councils are going to be set up  without

having  their  own civil servants,  engineers  and

technical  people  to help  them  but  are  to  be

dependent on Government to supply all these needs,

then I say that the elected District Councils will

be  no more than glorified rural district advisory

committees.  At present, Sir, the Rural  Board  is

dependent on Government for all such officers like

architects, surveyors and health officers to carry

out  its work. Then you have on the district level

the  advisory committees. The advisory  committees

are  supposed to be representing the people  of  a

district.  The  members put their heads  together,

produce an idea and say, "We want a certain bridge

built." That suggestion will then come up  to  the

Rural Board which may reject it or the Rural Board

may  accept  it and put up its recommendations  to

the  engineer. Then Government, on the other side,

may  say, "We do not want to have it built." There

you  are,  you  will have all these  frustrations.

Even in the case of an idea being accepted at  the

level  of the Rural District Committee now by  the

Rural  Board, it will take a very, very long  time

for it to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2453</b></font><br><br>



implemented. I have known of cases - we  will  take

the  simple  case of stand-pipes - where  the  rural

people  asked  for  standpipes.  The  Rural  Board

agreed  to that but it took a very long  time  for

the  standpipes to be installed. In this  case  of

standpipes,  of  course, it is not the  Government

that  is carrying out the work, but the work falls

on  the City Council Water Department. Here  I  am

using  this as an illustration, Sir, to show  that

if  you  do not have your staff, you will  not  be

able  to  carry out work satisfactorily. You  will

never  be  able  to  answer the  people  whom  you

represent  as  to why there was  a  delay  or  why

certain principles having been accepted had  never

been put into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if Government thinks that this is a good

system, then I believe that the people coming into

such   a   district  will  be  faced   with   more

frustrations. I would like Government to  consider

very  carefully the suggestions put  forward  from

this  side of the House that the District Councils

must  be autonomous and that they must have  their

own staff. We put this forward not because we want

to  redraft the whole lot of the amendments but as

an eye-opener to Government telling it that it has

failed  in  this  instance and  that  it  has  not

realised what is important to the people,  if  you

are  going  to make democracy work. I  would  like

Government  to  consider  this  point  very,  very

carefully indeed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, I think perhaps I can

relieve  the Member for Serangoon of  one  of  his

worries.  He has referred to the very,  very  long

delays  it  takes  to carry out certain  types  of

works and he fears that these delays will be worse

unless  the  District Councils are fully  equipped

with the sort of staff that the Member for Tanglin

has  envisaged.  I think it is only  fair  to  say

this,  that  a  very large number  of  the  delays

derive  not from lack of capacity to do  the  work

but  from  other types of causes. The  Member  for

Tanglin  will recollect writing to me, I think  in

April or May - thereabouts anyway - about a lady  who

had some fruit trees on her plot on a site through

which  a  road  had to pass and he wrote  to  say,

"Could she not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2454</b></font><br><br>



allowed  to stay on the site until August so  that

she  could gather the fruit harvest before she had

to be evicted and moved to a new area?"



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I have not had an answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> That is a proper and reasonable

request  for an Assemblyman to make on  behalf  of

people residing in his electoral division but when

you  add  all  those sort of things together,  the

fact  is  of  course that the road  does  not  get

built,  in that particular case, he only  referred

to  one lady. I have the file with me actually:  I

have been looking at the draft answer which he has

so  long  been waiting for. There are a number  of

families  on  this road site; people having  their

fruits,  their pigs, their houses or their  little

factories: for one reason or another they  do  not

want  to  move  off the land where they  are  and,

consequently,  the road does not go  through.  The

Member   for   Serangoon  is   frequently   asking

questions - which should be directed  of  course  to

the  local government authorities and not  to  me;

but  I  try  to answer them when I can  about  the

stretch of Yio Chu Kang Road between the Serangoon

Garden Estate and Thomson Road. Well, there again,

we are trying to get the road widened and improved

but  unfortunately we cannot get the sites cleared

and  we cannot get the road work done because  the

people  are living right up against the  sides  of

the  road; you have to move people out of the  way

and  interfere  with their normal way  of  living.

That  is a difficult and slow process. It  is  not

lack of capacity there which is preventing us from

improving the road. It is the inability to get the

use of the site and get on with the job. That sort

of   thing  applies  to  a  great  deal  of  work,

particularly in rural works. That is  one  of  the

big  factors  that  makes delay.  It  is  not  the

inadequate   capacity  of  the  Senior   Executive

Engineer (Rural) but the inability to get the  use

of the land and get on with the job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and disagreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, in the circumstances, I do

not propose to move the other two new clauses.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That disposes of all clauses. Amendments to the numbers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2455</b></font><br><br>



of  the  clauses in the Bill consequential on  the

deletion of clauses 284 and 287 will be made as  a

matter of course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Schedule-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 246, line 28, to leave out from

"Singapore" to the end of line 48 in page 249 and

insert:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"within the limits of the City of Singapore as

constituted under the provisions of the Municipal

Ordinance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of this amendment is quite simple,

Sir. It is to leave the City Council boundaries as

they  are and not to play about with them  in  the

way  in  which the Government proposes. There  are

three  areas mainly involved and I need not repeat

them because we have become somewhat familiar with

them during the course of the last few days, but I

must  refer you first in respect of Katong to  the

McNeice Report which is often called the Report of

the  Committee on Local Government,  at  paragraph

143, where it is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have noted that in and around Katong there

exists  an  area  of  individual  character,   the

population  of which consists almost  entirely  of

locally born people who have firm roots planted in

the life of Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think, Sir, that that is a very admirable

sentence, that it very truly depicts the  position

of  Katong  and that it is an entirely homogeneous

area  and,  having stated that, we  find  it  most

extraordinary  that  the  next  step   which   was

proposed by the Committee on Local Government  and

accepted  by the Government itself was  to  divide

Katong  precisely into two, down  a  little  drain

that  leads to the sea just beyond Haig  Road  and

Kampong Amber. Why, having established the premise

which  is  a perfectly true one that Katong  is  a

homogeneous area, do you then split it neatly into

two:  one  area  in the District Council  and  the

other   in  the  City  Council?  That  it  is   an

unsatisfactory  arrangement  can  be   seen   from

paragraph  154 of the Report of the  Committee  on

Local Government which is in the nature of a  sort

of  apologia  for  the  decision  that  they  have

reached when they say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The naming of the Eastern district has proved

particularly difficult and a majority of the

Committee have compromised in proposing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2456</b></font><br><br>



the  name 'Katong-Changi'; two members  of

the  Committee  prefer the name  'Siglap'  on  the

assumption that the administrative centre for  the

district  will eventually be sited in  the  Siglap

area."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that once you start dividing Katong into two,

you  get  into  the embarrassing position  of  not

knowing  what  to call your new District  Council.

Katong-Changi  was  one  effort  and  Siglap   was

another effort but the Government decided that the

area which comprises Siglap, Changi, Ulu Bedok and

part  Katong  should  be called  Katong.  Now,  it

appears then that the other half of Katong to  the

west  nearer the city will have to be called  some

other name and we will find that we are faced with

an  illogicality  which I am sure people  visiting

Singapore  will not be able to understand:  Katong

Park  and the well known road Tanjong Katong  Road

will  no  longer be in Katong. The  only  argument

that we can find for the reason for expelling half

Katong  into the District Council area is  because

of the necessity of finding a town to allocate, as

it  were,  to this new Direct Council and  I  will

read to you, Sir, if I may, columns 342 and 343 of

the  Select Committee's Official Report, what  the

Minister had to state on this particular matter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the fixing of boundaries, it was thought the

new  town for Bulim would form the hub of the  new

Bukit Panjang-Jurong district council, the one  in

Yio  Chu  Kang  the hub of the Serangoon  district

council  and the one in Woodlands would eventually

form the hub of the Bukit Panjang district council

when  that  area is divorced from Jurong.  So  the

Committee thought that the suburban town of Katong

would  in itself form the hub of the Katong-Changi

district  council. It is not stated in the  Master

Plan  that  there should be a new town  in  either

Changi or Katong districts."



<br><br>Now, from that sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not stated in the Master Plan that there

should be a new town",



<br><br>so  it is not stated in the Master Plan: therefore

there  cannot be one. It appears that the Minister

and  the  Government have become a  slave  to  the

Master  Plan which has dictated this absurdity  to

them.  Has the Government even approved the Master

Plan? - we do not know. It has certainly not  been

approved on this side because the proposals in the

Master  Plan  have never been brought  before  the

Assembly  for  debate and approval.  The  Minister

stated that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2457</b></font><br><br>



the  town  of  Katong would form the  hub  of  the

District  Council; it would, in fact,  be  on  the

outer rim with, I think, rather a flat tyre as far

as   organisation  is  concerned.  Katong  is  not

central to the District. It is already married  to

its  other half nearer the town and the whole area

has  been  brought  closer  to  the  city  through

Merdeka  Bridge and Nicoll Highway. To  order  the

inhabitants  of Katong to look eastward,  when  by

nature  they look westward, is the act of a Canute

telling  the  tide to recede. So  we  can  see  no

reasons at all for this particular kind of  hybrid

arrangement in the east side of the rural area  of

this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Bukit Panjang/Pasir Panjang area,

a  rural  area which it is intended to bring  into

the City Council area straightaway, as I have said

before,  the  normal procedure is to  extend  city

boundaries outwards as urbanisation increases  and

not to go in the reverse direction. To bring under-developed  areas  into the city  before  they  are

ready   is   a  wrong  method  of  approach.   The

Government have used the argument that rural areas

should be nursed by a gradual process before being

launched  on  to the sea of complete  autonomy  in

rural  affairs and yet this argument is completely

nullified by leaving out the nursing period in the

case  of this particular area. The move, in  other

words,  is  completely premature and it also  goes

against  the argument of the Government in  saying

that  they  disapprove  of  the  City  and  Island

Council  arrangement because  the  people  in  the

rural  areas who have been brought into  the  City

Council  area  as  representatives  on  a   single

council  of local government for the whole  island

will  be swamped by the people in the city.  Well,

here  is  a  City  and  Island  Council  case   in

miniature in which these people in the rural areas

are  being brought into the City Council area  and

they  would  of  course be rather swamped  by  the

other  representatives on the City Council whereas

they  could have played their full part  in  local

government  affairs if they had  remained  in  the

Pasir Panjang District Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other point which we referred to

previously - the question of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2458</b></font><br><br>



languages - that  farmers and  shopkeepers  in  this

area  do  not  speak Mandarin and so it  would  be

difficult  for  them  to find their  own  personal

representative  in that area. They would  probably

find someone imposed on them from outside who will

stand in this area for election. It would be  much

more difficult for them to find somebody who could

adequately  represent  them,  despite  the   whole

principle  on which we are going that  the  people

living   in  the  area  should  elect  their   own

representative whom they know and whom they trust.

That   is  the  basis  of  all  things  in   local

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there is this peculiar situation in the

Braddell Road area of another homogeneous  farming

area  being  split into two because  this  farming

area is to be found on each side of Braddell Road.

Anyone  who  drives down Braddell Road knows  very

well  that  there are vegetables  being  grown  in

quantity in this particular area on both sides  of

the road and for a long time they have been within

the City Council area as a homogeneous group. Now,

they  are  to be split neatly into two because  of

the  boundary that follows Braddell Road: one-half

to  the  north  will go into the District  Council

area  and  one-half to the south will go into  the

City  Council  area. One could have understood  if

the  whole  of  that area had been  put  into  the

District  Council area because it  is  in  fact  a

rural  area.  That  would have been  logical  and

comprehensible but that it should  be  split  into

two is not comprehensible at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, that concludes the points that I would

like  to  make  about these three changes  in  the

proposed limits to the City Council area and I see

that  the Minister for Health has now returned  so

that  he can give us the benefit of his wisdom  as

to the splitting of his own constituency into two.

I am sure that that was not an election promise of

his two years ago.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Chairman,  Sir,  I had hoped that the  Member  for

Tanglin would withdraw his amendment to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2459</b></font><br><br>



section   of  the  Bill  in  view  of  the   other

amendments connected with this question of  Katong

and Ulu Pandan which have not been accepted by the

Assembly. I do not think I have very much  to  add

to  what  I have already said earlier on  at  this

sitting but I would like to reiterate again,  Sir,

that  with  regard to Katong, it is  thought  that

Katong   will  develop  sooner  than   the   other

Districts  and  will provide  a  model  for  other

District Councils in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other question of the homogeneity of

Katong  and  of the splitting of Katong  into  two

Districts, here again, the canal which leads  from

Geylang  Serai to the sea is an old city  boundary

and could be regarded as an extension of the Green

Belt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, I do not think I have anything more to

add  to what I have already said. All the pros and

cons have been debated in the Select Committee and

if  one  were to read the Official Reports of  the

Select   Committee,  it  is   very   obvious   why

Government has decided that the District of Katong

should  be split into two and also with regard  to

Ulu Pandan where we have taken in some areas which

the  Member for Tanglin said were very much  rural

areas, but then, on the other hand, development is

going  on there at a very great speed and  if  one

were to look at a map of that particular area  now

he  would realise that more than half of  the  new

City  Council area which is now being embodied  in

the  City  Council is more highly  developed  than

some of the City Council areas within the city.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> It was

interesting, Mr Chairman, to hear the Member  for

Tanglin  referring to Katong as  my  constituency.

The  Member for Tanglin has been an ardent opposer

of  this  particular clause in  the  Bill.  For  a

considerable   time   he  has   argued   it   most

extensively  in  the  Select  Committee  and   yet

neither  he  nor any other Member of the  Liberal-Socialists  has  been  able  to  induce  a  single

resident of Katong to make any representations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2460</b></font><br><br>



to me at all. I meet the people  there  at

sessions weekly including Lib-Soc members and  not

a  single  person in Katong has yet approached  me

expressing any opposition at all to this and I  do

not see how it can be said that I have not kept my

election promises. The Liberal-Socialists have not

been able to induce a single resident in Katong to

make representation to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is

astounding  to me that the crucial point  of  this

debate  should  have  such  little  arguments   to

support  it.  The  Minister for Local  Government,

Lands  and Housing was so optimistic as  to  think

that  our  Party would withdraw such an  amendment

particularly  when he must have seen  the  support

that  has  been  given us in the Press  unless  he

chooses  not  to read what is against his  Party's

policy.  It  seems  to  me that  if  there  is  no

argument at all against the submission so ably put

up by my learned Friend, this amendment before the

House  should be completely carried  and  what  is

worse  the  Minister for Health whose constituency

is  Katong  comes  up and says that  everybody  in

Katong  is against this simply because he has  not

received  one complaint or one demand to  let  the

boundaries  stay  as they are. One  would  enquire

whether he really lives in Katong or whether it is

because  his constituents have given up  faith  in

him  and  have come to see our representatives  in

this area instead of him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far, no argument has been raised and I

submit that Members of this Assembly should accept

this amendment.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> I am afraid that the Member

for Paya Lebar seems to think that we have not got

a  reply  to the amendment proposed by the  Member

for  Tanglin. In fact, we on this side do not like

to repeat what we have said over and over again in

this debate.

<br>FORM OF DECLARATION OF<br>

ACCEPTANCE OF OFFICE OF MAYOR.<br>

<br>

(Section 9)<br>

</div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, ............... a duly elected member of the

City  Council of Singapore, having previously made

and  delivered  my  declaration of  acceptance  of

office as a Councillor in due form and as required

by  the  Local  Government  Ordinance,  1957,  and

having  been  elected Mayor of  the  City,  hereby

declare that I take upon myself the office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2462</b></font><br><br>



of  Mayor  and will duly and faithfully fulfil  my

duties  as  Mayor to the City and to the  citizens

thereof  according to the best of my judgment  and

ability.

<pre>

                                                             .........................

                                                              (Signature of Declarant.)

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declared before me this..........day

of.........., 19....

<br><br>...............................................<br>

(Signature and description.)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be found in the Third Schedule on

page  263  that  there is only a  single  form  of

declaration  of acceptance of office which  simply

states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I ............................... having been elected a ..................

hereby  declare  that I take the  said  office  on

myself  and  will duly and faithfully  fulfil  the

duties  thereof  according  to  the  best  of   my

judgment and ability ....................".



<br><br>That  is  the form of declaration for Councillors.

Now,  when  the City Councillors have  given  that

form  of  declaration, they then proceed with  the

first meeting for the election of a Mayor and,  as

that is laid down with great clarity in the Bill - I

think  it  is clause 9 - we feel that when  we  have

gone through the process of electing a Mayor, then

there  should  be  a special form  of  declaration

which the Mayor should make under sub-clause  (11)

where  a  Declaration is in fact  required  to  be

made. Sub-clause (11) of clause 9 states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Councillor elected as mayor shall not act in

such  office  unless  he has previously  made  and

delivered  to  the  Secretary  a  declaration   of

acceptance  of office of mayor in Form  A  in  the

Third Schedule to this Ordinance".



<br><br>Now, it seems quite clear to us that, Sir, because

of the position the Mayor holds, he should make  a

special declaration of acceptance of office and he

should  not  repeat the declaration, that  he  has

already  made previously, of acceptance of  office

of  Councillor.  In  view of the  remarks  of  the

Minister  for Commerce and Industry two  or  three

days ago to which I referred earlier this morning,

I  think  it  is all the more important  that  the

Mayor  should  declare  that  he  will  duly   and

faithfully fulfil the duties as Mayor to the  City

and  to the citizens thereof according to the best

of his judgment and ability.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Government

accepts  this amendment but would point out  that,

in addition to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2463</b></font><br><br>



the  consequential amendments already noted, there

will of course be certain others in clauses of the

Bill  and  in  marginal  notes  where  forms   now

lettered B to G have to be re-lettered C to H.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Consequential amendments will be

made.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, might I just make one

point,  Sir? I think that there should be  another

consequential amendment, after what will now be  B

(Form of Declaration of Acceptance of Office)  the

words  "of Councillors" should be added. I do  not

know whether that is a consequential amendment  or

whether it is a major amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Form actually refers to a Form

which   is  required  by  section  20.  The   word

"Section"  and the figure "20" will  appear  under

Form  B and section 20, I think, refers to an oath

of a Councillor. Perhaps that would suffice?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> It does, Sir. It is only that in the new

Form A, as accepted, we have the "office of Mayor"

specifically stated but I thought perhaps it would

be better to have "of Councillors" on Form B.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> These titles, of course, are not

part  of  the  Bill  and if  the  Government  side

requires   an  amendment  of  that  nature,   that

amendment can be made as a matter of course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third Schedule, as amended, ordered to stand part

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth Schedule-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I do not propose to move

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In page 273, line 8, after "nuisances", to

insert "including noise".]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would, at this stage, seek your guidance on

another  matter.  I  wish to  recommit  a  further

clause - clause   144 - to  the   Committee   of   the

Assembly.  I am not quite clear at what stage  one

moves.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The relevant Standing Order of

course is Standing Order 54 (1). The motion must

be made before a Member rises to move the Third

Reading of a Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2464</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth Schedule ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill, as amended on recommittal, be

reported to the Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported, with Amendments.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Recommittal</b></div>



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be recommitted in respect of clause

144.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this clause 144 is one which we were dealing

with indirectly yesterday when we were considering

our amendment to clause 143 on the question of the

width  of private streets. I have had the  benefit

of  having  this considered by the Hon. the  Chief

Minister  and the Attorney-General to  whom  I  am

very   grateful.  I  think  we  have  come  to   a

compromise on this matter which, while it  is  not

entirely  suitable to us, does go a very long  way

to  meeting  the  point we have in  mind  on  this

question  of ensuring that owners or occupiers  of

premises  bordering on streets that are less  than

36  ft. wide would, through this amendment we  now

propose,  have a chance of having streets declared

as public streets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I second it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

mentioned  by  the Member for Tanglin,  there  has

been  a  discussion  on this particular  amendment

which he moved to clause 143. As a result of  that

amendment,  agreement  has been  reached  that  we

recommit  clause  144.  The  Government  does  not

oppose the recommittal of this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee:



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 144-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 143, line 31, after "may", to insert

"whether  at the request of the owners of premises

fronting, adjoining or abutting on such street  or

otherwise".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2465</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I do not think that there

is  anything I wish to add to what I have  already

said  on  this point. It is simply that now  under

clause  144  whereas I pointed out yesterday  that

only the local authority could take the initiative

in  getting  a  private street declared  a  public

street,   it  now  becomes  possible   with   this

amendment   that  owners  of  premises   fronting,

adjoining or abutting on such street can take  the

initiative to the extent of requesting  the  local

authority  that such street be declared  a  public

street.  As  I  said, I am very  grateful  to  the

Attorney-General  for  looking  into  this  matter

seeing how it could be drafted and to the Hon. the

Chief  Minister for meeting what I think is rather

an important point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the

Government accepts the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 144, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill, as amended on recommittal, be

reported to the Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported, with an Amendment.



<div align="center"><b>Third Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Third Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, I beg

to  move, "That the Bill, as amended, be now  read

the Third time."



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> I

second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to make

a long speech on the Third Reading of the Bill. It

must  be  made  clear  that the  Liberal-Socialist

Party   has  voiced  its  disagreement  and   will

continue to do so on certain important clauses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2466</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not satisfied with the dictatorial manner

in  which the new city limits are being introduced

nor   with  the  limits  themselves.  We  are   in

disagreement  regarding the number of  councillors

on   the  City  and  District  Councils  and   the

inclusion  of nominated members. The  powers  over

rating  in  the  new areas given to the  Ministers

are,  we  feel, wrong when differential rating  is

already  a  power  in  the  hands  of  the   local

authority,  while the transitional  provisions  in

clause  323  relating  in particular  to  Katong's

administration  is  a  mockery  of  democracy.  We

disagree with the loan policy in clause 81 and  we

consider  the failure to include clauses regarding

District  Council  funds, officers  and  posts  an

indication  that the Government's new  policy  for

the rural areas falls short of its promises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, however long and tedious this four

days'  debate on the Bill in Committee  stage  may

have  seemed, their importance as a  part  of  our

democratic Assembly procedure has been proved  and

perhaps  has  been shown in no previous  Bill.  As

early   as   the  first  day,  the  Minister   for

Communications  and  Works,  in  an  outburst   of

impatience  unworthy of him, accused the  Liberal-Socialists of filibustering and suggested that the

issues  had  been debated in Select Committee  and

why   should  we  waste  any  further  time.   The

Government's  well-known  desire  to   steamroller

things  through  this House has  never  been  more

overtly  demonstrated and it has made us  on  this

side all the more determined to carry out our duty

of  Opposition. In point of fact, never  have  the

functions of the Opposition been better shown than

in  this  Bill.  Government has been  pushed  into

accepting  amendments  to about  15  clauses:  two

started  by  the  People's Action  Party  and  not

completed by them (that Party has shown an  almost

total lack of interest in the Bill itself) and the

rest  by  the Liberal-Socialists, and  that  is  a

complete  justification  of  our  procedure  under

Standing Orders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter I must touch on because it goes

to  the very basic principles on which this  Local

Government Bill is founded. Nothing has  horrified

the   Liberal-Socialist  Party   more   than   the

unashamed   confession - indeed,  it   was   not   a

confession   but  a  proud  pronouncement - of   the

Minister for Commerce and Industry backed  by  the

Minister  for Communications and Works, who  ought

to  know  better, that the Mayor,  if  he  were  a

Labour  Front  Mayor, would not  hold  his  office

impartially: you fight the election apparently  on

a  Party  ticket and if you become the Mayor,  you

follow the Party programme and the Party line.  In

other  words,  according to the  Labour  Front,  a Mayor elected by them will sit in the chair and give his rulings on the Bill, on Standing  Orders

and  on  by-laws not impartially but in accordance

with  Party direction. Bias and prejudice of  this

kind   would   make   a  mockery   of   democratic

institutions and would bring all the work put into

this great Bill to nought in a matter of months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that if ever any amendment of the Liberal-Socialist was justified, our amendment not to

allow  the Mayor a vote has been shown to  be  so.

Well  as  we  know the Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry, we did not expect such cynical  contempt

for  impartiality in persons of high office as  he

has  expressed, an impartiality which the Liberal-Socialists  regard as axiomatic.  The  failure  to

accept our amendment on this point in the light of

the  debate it produced would be alone  enough  to

make  us  view parts of this Bill with  disfavour.

Fortunately,  a Labour Front Mayor  will  now  not

eventualise  because the people  of  this  country

will  not vote for a Party with such a policy  and

such an outlook.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> How do you know?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, in dismissing this unpleasant taste

from one's mouth, I would like to congratulate the

Minister  for  Local Government for steering  this

difficult Bill through all its long stages to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2468</b></font><br><br>



a  conclusion even if we on this side cannot agree

with  a good deal of it. Indeed, it is clear  that

he does not agree with much of it himself and that

it  is  purely a Labour Front Bill because he  has

rarely  risen to speak in defence of it  and  only

the Labour Front Members have defended it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Lastly, I would like to thank you, Mr

Speaker,  for  the patience with  which  you  have

assisted Members of the Opposition first in Select

Committee and in this House over difficult matters

of procedure, in which your known impartiality has

been invaluable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can well

understand   the  stand  taken  by  the   Liberal-Socialists in this matter. The Member for  Tanglin

says  that,  insofar  as the amendments  which  he

proposed   and  which  were  lost,  the   Liberal-Socialists will still maintain the same  stand.  I

can  understand that feeling. In fact, it  is  the

only  stand that the Liberal-Socialists  can  take

but I would like to suggest to him that we too  on

this  side of the House have views of our own.  If

our  views  do  not coincide with  theirs,  it  is

ridiculous  to  suggest that  we  are  dictatorial

whereas if they keep on dictating to us and we  do

not  accept their dictatorial attitude,  they  say

that  they  are right and that we are dictatorial.

They   suggest  that  we  steamroller  everything.

Surely  it  is not so, Sir. The debate during  the

past  four  days has shown that the Government  is

very  anxious that this Bill should be  passed  as

quickly  as  possible so that elections  can  take

place  in  December as far as the City Council  is

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin also said that the

Government was pushed into accepting, I  think  he

said,  15 amendments. We were not pushed, Sir.  We

are  prepared to accept any amendments  that  have

merit   and  it  just  happened  that   these   15

amendments which we accepted had merit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like also to associate myself with

the remarks of the Member for Tanglin for the very

capable  manner  in  which you  have  handled  the

debate  for  the  last four  days  and  the  great

patience



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2469</b></font><br><br>



you  have  shown  us when so much noise  has  been

made; so much so that the last amendment in regard

to the inclusion of "noise" has been withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Speaker does not speak, of

course. He just says, "Thank you."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill, as amended, accordingly read the Third

time.
