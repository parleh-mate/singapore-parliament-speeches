<div align="center"><b>TELECOMMUNICATION AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Free market competition)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Communications why

the  Telecommunication Authority of Singapore  is  against  free

market competition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for Communications on

what  grounds the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS)

will   disapprove  a  tariff  reduction  package  or   permanent

promotion  proposed by a mobile telephone operator  and  whether

the  TAS  has in the past rejected any proposal for  price  cuts

submitted by either SingTel Mobile or M1.

<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr S Iswaran</b> asked the Minister for Communications what

is  the  rationale  behind requiring telecommunications  service

providers  to seek approval from the Telecommunication Authority

of  Singapore for changes to their charges and whether there are

plans  to  discontinue with this practice  when  the  market  is

further liberalised from 1st April 2000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Minister for Communications

why  the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore considers  the

latest price cutting by SingTel Mobile anti-competitive and  not

in line with the free market policy practised by the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

ask Question No. 1, let me declare my pecuniary interest as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>

I  am a director of Singapore Power Ltd.  Singapore Power is one

of the partners of StarHub.  Question No. 1, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos. 1

to 4 together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, since its formation in 1992, TAS has

actively and consistently adopted a pro-competition approach. It

is   committed   to  fully  liberalising  the  telecommunication

industry  to  ensure Singapore's competitiveness  and  to  allow

consumers  to  enjoy the benefits of competition,  ie,  a  wider

range of quality services and products at competitive prices. In

line  with  this  philosophy,  TAS  has  liberalised  the  basic

telecommunication  services  market  earlier  than  planned,  by

bringing  forward the expiry of the monopoly licence of  SingTel

by 7 years from 2007 to the year 2000 at a cost of $1.5 billion.

It  opened the mobile phone and paging market in 1997.   It  has

further liberalised the mobile services market from April  2000.

The  Internet  services market has been completely opened  since

last year.  The basic services market will also be opened up  to

further competition from April 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In liberalising the market, TAS has a duty to ensure that

the competition is sustainable or healthy. It has to ensure that

incumbents  do  not  adopt anti-competitive  measures,  such  as

predatory pricing, to keep out competitors. This is to safeguard

the  interests of consumers in the longer term by ensuring  that

we  do  not regress to the former monopolistic situation. It  is

especially  important  in  an industry  like  telecommunications

where significant natural barriers to entry already exist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent developments in the mobile phone market serve to

illustrate this point. There are only two players in the current

mobile communication market. Until such time when there is  more

and  freer  competition  in the market,  TAS  needs  to  approve

operators'  proposals to ensure that (1) they do not  engage  in

predatory pricing,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>

ie,  operators  which enjoy certain monopolistic privileges  are

not  using these to unfairly drive out other market players  and

(2)  they  do not lock consumers into schemes that prevent  them

from switching operators freely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS has not rejected SingTel Mobile's proposal in this

particular  case. What it has said is that the  proposed  scheme

was  unclear  in some respects, and that SingTel Mobile  has  to

revert with more details to address TAS' concerns. These include

whether its loyalty programme is sustainable, and whether tie-in

conditions would be imposed on subscribers to prevent them  from

switching  operators when the market is further  liberalised  in

year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If SingTel Mobile can satisfactorily address TAS' concerns,

TAS will allow such a scheme to be marketed to the consumers  as

permanent.  But until it is approved as a permanent scheme,  TAS

has to ensure that SingTel Mobile does not mislead its consumers

by  marketing  it  as a permanent scheme, when it  is  currently

approved  as a promotion only  valid till March 2000.    Let  me

say  that  TAS  has since received clarification  and  financial

information from SingTel Mobile on its loyalty programme. TAS is

satisfied with the clarification and the business case and  will

approve  the loyalty programme as a permanent scheme.  TAS  will

be issuing a formal announcement later today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS encourages any proposal that will benefit consumers in

the  long  run.  However, in keeping with its  role  to  protect

consumer interests, there have been past instances where TAS had

disapproved  schemes  or proposed modifications  to  schemes  to

prevent  customers  from being tied down  or  having  to  suffer

penalties  for switching operators.  In some cases,  competitive

services  had  been  bundled  with  monopoly  services,  to  the

disadvantage of competitors without monopoly rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS will take a progressively relaxed regulatory stance as

the  telecommunication industry is further liberalised from  1st

April next year. However, it will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>

continue to impose minimum service standards, as well as minimum

safeguards  to protect the consumers and maintain  an  oversight

role   over   market  developments  to  ensure   a   sustainable

competitive environment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, has TAS any plan to

carve  up the market, ie, set a maximum cap on the market  share

for  the different carriers?  The second question is: should one

of  the carriers fail because the marketing of their products is

not  as well as the other carriers, will the Government bail out

that  particular carrier so that there will always be  this  so-called choice for consumers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it is not possible for TAS to set

market  caps  for  any player in the market.  This  is  for  the

individual players to work out, ie, for them to go and  gain  as

much  market share as possible within the rules of the  game  as

set  out,  in other words, there is no anti-competitive  pricing

especially   when  the  incumbent  operator  has   got   certain

monopolistic privileges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question which the Member asked was whether the

Government would bail out an operator.  The answer obviously  is

no.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the  Minister whether his Ministry has plans to issue  more

licences  for  mobile phones.  If there are, when will  they  be

implemented, what is the market size in Singapore and whether it

can sustain more than two operators at the moment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as the Member is aware, although the

mobile  phone  market has two operators, with effect  from  next

year, there will be another mobile phone operator in the market.

This was as a result of a competitive tender that was issued  in

1998. TAS was prepared to issue up to two more licences.  But as

the  Member  may recall, one of the successful bidders  for  the

licence had to withdraw for various reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no plans at the moment for Government to issue

any more mobile phone licences. But the situation is a very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>

fluid  one and we have not indicated categorically that we  will

not  be issuing any more licences.  In other words, as and  when

the  situation requires, we are free to issue more mobile  phone

licences but it must necessarily be after the year 2000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, following up from my previous

question, does it mean that in that case TAS will make sure that

prices will be held at a certain level until such time there are

three  or  more carriers who will then compete in a free  market

with  less regulation?  This means that ultimately it can  still

lead  to market failure because one can have a strong competitor

which then becomes a monopoly again.  What would TAS do in  that

case?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the main issue in this case is

whether  the  strong operator or the incumbent  operator,  which

enjoys  certain  privileges that the  other  operator  does  not

enjoy,  is  making use of this privileged position. Today  there

are  two operators; one has got certain monopolistic privileges,

the other has not.  Until such time as the playing field is more

even,  it  is  necessary for the regulator to  ensure  that  any

changes  or any new pricing schemes or any new market practices,

for  that matter, must be under scrutiny.  This does not suggest

that  prices  cannot  go down.  In fact,  as  I  have  announced

earlier,  after  looking at the application and  making  certain

queries and receiving clarifications from the applicant, TAS  is

now  satisfied that the new pricing scheme does not in  any  way

affect  the other operator.  Neither does it tie consumers  down

so  that  they  do not have the flexibility or  the  freedom  to

change   operator  come  April  2000.   Having  received   those

clarifications,  TAS is quite happy to approve the  new  loyalty

scheme with lower prices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister is aware of Marketing

101.  Price is only one of several practices in the market.   If

price is the only determinant, then all of us will be driving  a

Suzuki  and not a Mercedes-Benz.  Quite clearly, the  amount  of

marketing  effort  or advertising expenditure has  a  tremendous

impact on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>

market  share.   The  question I want to ask  the  Minister  is,

hypothetically, will TAS control a carrier if it wants to give a

phone  free  of  charge,  for example?   Will  TAS  control  the

marketing  expenditure of the different carriers  to  make  sure

that one will not over-spend to create a larger market share?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chng, may I remind you that you are not

permitted to ask hypothetical questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, will the Minister clarify

the  Government's response to a perception in some quarters that

the  TAS' current requirements are in part to protect the market

for new entrants in the mobile and fixed line industry?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the decision to license a third

mobile operator has been made.  This third mobile phone operator

will commence its operations with effect from April 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the two current operators strive to capture whatever

market  share  they can with their current innovative  marketing

strategies,  it is important for TAS to ensure that  come  April

2000  the  market place will be a level playing  field  for  all

players - first, second and third operators.  It is no use  for

us  to  issue  a licence for a third operator when at  the  same

time,   the  existing  two  operators  are  allowed  to  capture

customers and penalise them if they were to switch. If there are

any loyalty programmes that are being put in place by either  of

the  operators  today to maximise their market  share,  that  is

perfectly  all right, so long as come April 2000, customers  are

free to switch.  That is the key point, that there is no penalty

involved in the switch.  If they want to have loyalty programmes

for  one, two, three or four years, that is perfectly fine.  The

new operator will have to contend with that but it must also  be

able to bring customers on board because such customers are  not

tied  down  by the existing loyalty scheme.  This ultimately  is

for the benefit of the consumers.  If we allow a situation where

the  two  operators currently tie up all the consumers,  we  are

back  to a duopoly situation.  Then what is the point of issuing

a third licence?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come year 2000, customers will have more choice and TAS

wants  to  ensure  they will be allowed to  switch  easily  from

whatever loyalty programmes they join today. The purpose of  the

requirement  by  the  regulator  to  approve  any  such  schemes

beforehand  is ultimately with the benefits of the consumers  in

mind.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Minister  then confirm that beyond April 2000 therefore  any  of

the three operators would be able to state any price or have any

kind of loyalty programmes they want without any regulation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I indicated earlier, as the market

becomes freer and as there are more players, the regulator  will

not  need  to  have the strict oversight role that it  currently

has.  This  will  be progressively relaxed as we  have  a  freer

market situation and as the consumers become more savvy and more

discriminating  in their choice.  In other words,  they  do  not

look at just the short-term.  It is fine to say, "Let us have  a

free-for-all  now.   I want to enjoy the benefits  today."   But

they must be sophisticated and savvy enough to realise that they

must  also be able to enjoy the benefits of competition  in  the

longer  term,  in other words, that competition is  sustainable.

Those are the conditions under which the regulatory regime  will

and should operate beyond April 2000.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> I would like to ask

the  Minister  whether  the  regulator  is  being  unnecessarily

cautious  in this regard, for example, if the operator wants  to

cut prices, to automatically allow the operator to do so, and if

there  are  any conditions attached, such as loyalty conditions,

to  ensure  that the operator makes this clear that there  is  a

note  in  this regard that there would be a third operator  that

comes in in the year 2000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think this is what the regulator has

sought  to  do.  The regulator has not said  that  you  are  not

allowed to make these filings.  What the regulator has said  is,

when you make the filing or want

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>

to  make  a  public  announcement, make it clear  that  this  is

subject   to  approval.   If  you  want  to  have  such  loyalty

programmes, you must let the regulator know what are the precise

terms and conditions before you implement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue that we could let them implement first and

then  take  retrospective action thereafter.  This  is  possible

except that it can be a little messy, if, for example, customers

are  tied in by contract to loyalty programmes and then you have

to  unwind  later  on.  On hindsight, at this  stage,  TAS,  the

regulator,  feels  that it is better to make the  clarifications

before  implementation, rather than after.  But as I said,  when

the third operator comes in, subsequently even fourth, fifth  or

more,  the  market will be in a much more competitive situation.

The  regulator can then take one or two steps backwards and  the

consumer can then be depended upon to make those choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, where there are only two operators, as the

experience  has  shown  in many other countries,  in  a  duopoly

situation,  you  have  to ensure that the  major  operator,  the

incumbent operator, does not make use of the privilege  that  it

has to push aside competition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Could the Minister inform the House how TAS'

regulatory  requirements  compare with similar  requirements  in

countries  which  are at a comparable state  of  development  in

their telecommunications industry?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I have here a list of the regulatory

bodies  overseas  that  have  similar  requirements.   OFTA   in

Hongkong,  OFTEL  in  the  UK,  ACA  in  Australia,  they   have

established similar policies to what TAS has put in  place.   In

fact,  I  had been told that Hongkong Telecom, for example,  was

actually  ordered by OFTA to stop anti-competitive  prices.   In

1998,  they were fined for engaging in widespread illegal  anti-competitive  practices in that year. Later, in  September  1998,

they  had to make similar announcements and take similar action.

In  the  UK,  over the past two years, OFTEL had to  investigate

complaints on British Telecom, again the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>

incumbent operator, for engaging in alleged predatory prices for

both  Internet  services  and fixed line  services.    In  other

words,  this  is not something unique to Singapore.   There  are

similar  experiences in many regimes where markets are  starting

to  liberalise, and you have  a situation where you do not  have

many players in the market.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Does the Minister agree that this whole

incident,  particularly  in terms of the  public  communication,

could have been better handled?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I asked that same question myself. I

asked  TAS  why  is  it that they came out so strongly,  as  the

headline  put it, "to slam the two operators". I went into  some

detail  about  this because I felt that it was,  as  the  Member

pointed  out,  totally unnecessary.  TAS informed  me  that,  in

fact, when they were asked for clarification, all they said  was

that  the two service providers should seek TAS' approval before

they announced their proposals, in other words, make it clear to

the  public  that these are subject to approval  so  as  not  to

mislead the public. That is all.  I thought that was a perfectly

reasonable response to the query.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I was surprised to see that it became something of a

furore, first of all, starting with the headline that "TAS slams

the  Friday shoot-out".  Thereafter, it was also quoted that TAS

felt  that  the operator was either too quick off  the  mark  or

could  be  misleading the public.  I am told that such  comments

were  not  actually made at all although they were  ascribed  to

TAS.  I  believe  that  clarification has  been  made  with  the

reporter  concerned.  Yes, I agree that it  is  much  ado  about

nothing.   This is really a storm in a teacup. I hope with  this

explanation, the public will be more aware of the reason  behind

TAS'  actions, that there is no such thing as a free meal,  that

even  though  prices do come down, they must ensure  that  their

interests are safeguarded in the longer term and that it is TAS'

responsibility  at this stage, as the regulator,  to  make  sure

that this is so.

<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANCE RENDERED TO HARDSHIP FAMILIES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr S Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr S Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for Community Development

if  he  will  indicate  the recent trend  on  hardship  families

seeking  help  from  his Ministry and the  kinds  of  assistance

rendered to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, families who require financial assistance  can

apply  under  various  schemes,  among  which  are  the  interim

financial scheme or Public Assistance Scheme (PA), the Rent  and

Utilities  Assistance  Scheme (RUAS)  managed  by  the  National

Council of Social Service (NCSS), the Small Families Improvement

Scheme (SFI) or given interest-free loans for skills training or

upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry's quarterly figures for 1998 show an upward

trend  in the number of applications under the various financial

assistance  schemes. In the first quarter (January-March  1998),

there  were 637 applications.  In the last quarter, it  rose  to

998  applications, and this represents a 57% increase.  The bulk

of the increase came from applications for PA and RUAS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry's schemes are complemented by a network of

schemes  available from other Government departments, hospitals,

grassroots organizations, NCSS, VWOs as well as the  CDCs.   The

Ministry  also refers families to these agencies for  additional

assistance  as  required and my Ministry also works  with  other

Government   agencies   to  help  these  families   with   other

difficulties  such as payment of rental or mortgage  loans,  job

placement, application for school tuckshop stalls and access  to

services such as legal aid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is closely monitoring the trends of cases

requiring  help  but it will continue to work closely  with  the

other  agencies and support and help families who are  in  need.

We  will  ensure that there are sufficient funds to support  any

future increases in applications under these various schemes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> May I ask the Minister what

steps  are being taken by the Ministry to reach out to  families

that are less well-informed?  Could he also tell us the profiles

of the families that are seeking help?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I am afraid that I do not have

the  data  available  right now.  The Member  could  send  in  a

further  question  if he wishes.  As regards  reaching  out,  we

leave  it to the various family service centres and our VWOs  to

reach  out to the ground because they are on the spot  and  they

will  be  the  ones  who are better able to  reach  out  to  the

families who are in need.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, in view of the quite

significant   increases  in  the  number  of  applications   for

assistance,  has  the  Ministry  sufficient  staff  to  actually

process the applications expeditiously?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> For schemes which are under the

Ministry directly, we have enough staff to handle them.  As  for

the  other schemes, the RUAS, for example, is handled  by  NCSS,

and  when  we refer to other Government agencies and  the  VWOs,

they will have their own staff to process these applications.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask

the  Minister  whether there is an income  level  threshold  for

applicants?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> For public assistance schemes, we

have  certain income levels.  I cannot tell him now.  But  there

are.   We  apply  these quite liberally.   For  others,  it  all

depends on the circumstances of the family.  If they are  really

in  need  of  help, we will give them, regardless of the  income

level.   For example, a person earns beyond a certain  level  of

income  but  at  that particular moment, he may  need  temporary

help,  eg,  under RUAS, we do give such help at that  moment  in

time, because it is a temporary help.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister who finally makes

the decision as to whether a family is to get any assistance  or

not?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> For Public Assistance, it is the

Ministry.   But  for  the other assistance  schemes,  RUAS,  for

example,  as I said, it is administered by NCSS.  So  NCSS  will

make  the  decision and for other assistance  schemes  which  we

refer  to other Government agencies, they will make the decision

on whether the application will be approved or not.

<div align="center"><b>COST OF HAJ PILGRIMAGE BY APPROVED TRAVEL AGENTS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Hawazi Daipi -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To ask the Minister for Community Development and

Minister-in-charge  of Muslim Affairs (a) what  is  the  average

cost  of  going on the haj pilgrimage for the coming haj season;

(b) whether the cost is too high, considering that airlines have

lowered  their  airfares;  and (c)  how  the  Islamic  Religious

Council (MUIS) ensures that approved travel agents which provide

haj packages do not profiteer, especially at a time when workers

have been called to make sacrifices by accepting wage cuts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Question No. 6, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> The cost for the haj pilgrimage for

the  coming season, excluding airfare, ranges from about  $4,400

to  $6,650.   These are based on quotes sent  in  by  28  travel

agents  or  GSAs.  The lower range of $4,400 is  actually  lower

than the lower range last year.  If you include the airfare, the

packages will range between $6,710 and $8,960.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airfare for a return trip from Singapore to Jeddah by Saudi

Airlines or Singapore Airlines has not changed for the last  two

years and most Singapore pilgrims travel by these two airlines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS's role in haj matters is regulatory and supervisory.

It  ensures that there are sufficient approved travel agents  to

provide  competition,  and that the services  offered  by  these

travel  agents  are  delivered as promised.   It  also  sends  a

medical team to look after the pilgrims while they are in  Saudi

Arabia.  However, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>

does  not  determine  the prices offered by the  travel  agents.

Travel  agents have to compete among themselves to  offer  their

best prices and services to travellers.  Several years ago, MUIS

requested  travel  agents to offer budget  economy  packages  to

cater  to  cost-conscious pilgrims, but they were  not  popular.

This  year, in response to MUIS's request for travel  agents  to

offer  economy packages, one travel agent is offering an economy

package which affected about 100 pilgrims out of 3,000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister whether GSAs have not been granted approval to date, as

a  result of having breached MUIS's guidelines or standards and,

if so, how many over the past few years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, over the past three years, four

established  GSAs  were  not  granted  approval  to  manage  haj

pilgrims for one or more of the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) financial mismanagement;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) deviation from the haj tender package;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) poor performance; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) not in accordance with the tender specifications. In other

words,  what they submitted are not in accordance with  what  we

specify in the tender.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, is there a large number of withdrawals

in the upcoming haj as a result of the economic crisis?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, from the numbers that we got from the

travel agents, 173 out of 3,000 who registered for the 1999  haj

withdrew their applications due to economic reasons.

<div align="center"><b>SPECULATIVE INTERESTS IN LOW-PRICED SHARES AND WARRANTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  the  Government will act to cool the speculative  fever

and protect the investing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>

public,  in  view  of the increase in speculative  interests  in

recent  months in low-priced shares and warrants traded  on  the

Stock  Exchange  of Singapore where prices and volumes  of  such

shares  and  warrants have increased sharply  with  no  apparent

reasons and sometimes accompanied by rumours.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  there has been a marked increase in interest in low-priced

shares  and warrants over the last few months.  Most of the  top

volume  counters have been shares and warrants with prices  less

than $1.  These shares and warrants also make up nearly all  the

top  gainers  in  recent months, although the stock  market  has

declined  since  mid-January, and the prices  of  warrants  have

fallen back more sharply than the general market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several factors account for this interest in low-priced shares

and warrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Investor sentiment in Singapore has improved, along

with sentiment in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) After the larger stocks chalked up substantial gains, the

interest  of  retail investors has shifted to low-priced  shares

and warrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Several recent company mergers and acquisitions have fanned

rumours  of take-overs of other SES-listed companies.  Sometimes

the  rumours persisted despite repeated categorical  denials  by

the companies concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-priced stocks are not necessarily good investments. Ten

cents,  cheap, cheap, is not the right approach.  For  the  same

dollar  amount, an investor can either buy more units of a  low-priced  stock,  or  fewer units of a higher-priced  stock.  1000

shares  costing  10 cents each in a mediocre  company  will  not

necessarily  outperform 10 shares costing $10  each  in  a  good

company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrants are sophisticated financial instruments. Investors who

buy warrants must understand the mechanics of how they work, and

the  principles which determine how much the warrants are worth.

A warrant may be low-priced, not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>

because  it  offers good value for money, but  because  it  will

expire  soon  and  has  a high exercise price,  which  makes  it

unlikely  for  the underlying share to trade above the  exercise

price before the warrant expires.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious investors should consider the company's fundamentals

such  as its earnings, assets, management, prospects and  price-earnings  ratio  before making investment decisions.  Those  who

speculate  in  shares and warrants, or trade on market  rumours,

should realise and accept the attendant high risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stock Exchange will ensure that the stock market operates in

a  fair and transparent manner.  It will enforce rules requiring

listed   companies   to  disclose  price-sensitive   information

promptly  and truthfully.  It will not tolerate illegal conduct,

such as insider trading or market manipulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the SES cannot intervene in the market, or influence

prices  of  shares  and  warrants.   Investors  must  judge  for

themselves whether the price is right. If necessary, they should

obtain  expert advice before acting, whether buying or  selling.

They  have  to  make their own decisions and take responsibility

for the consequences.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, may I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, in

view  of  the present-day modern communications, in cases  where

the  speculative fever is prompted by unfounded rumours, whether

the  SES can ask the company to issue an immediate statement  on

either the Internet, the Teletext or press agencies like Reuters

and  Bloomberg, rather than to wait till the end of the  day  or

even ask for suspension of the shares?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I think it depends on the situation, but

there are cases where an immediate statement will be helpful.

<div align="center"><b>LIBERALISATION OF BANKING SECTOR TO FOREIGN COMPETITION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether there are other plans to speed up and further liberalise

the   banking  sector  to  foreign  competition  following   the

recommendation  of  the Monetary Authority  of  Singapore  (MAS)

International Advisory Panel.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the MAS is liberalising the

domestic  banking  sector, to allow greater  access  to  foreign

institutions and a freer play of competitive forces.  This  will

achieve three objectives:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it will encourage banks to provide efficient and

innovative services, comparable to the best available  in  other

major financial centres;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it will nurture a group of robust local banks who

measure  up  against leading international players operating  in

Singapore and abroad; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it will encourage strong and well-managed foreign

institutions to expand their activities in Singapore, and take a

stake in the growth and stability of our financial system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I announced in July last year that MAS would progressively open

up  the  domestic  banking sector over  five  years.   When  MAS

briefed its International Advisory Panel (IAP) on its plans, the

IAP  agreed  with MAS' policy of liberalisation.  The  IAP  also

agreed on the importance of having strong local players after we

liberalise.   However,  the IAP felt that  five  years  was  not

ambitious  enough, and recommended the MAS consider speeding  up

the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS is now working out the specific liberalisation measures

and  will  take the IAP's views into account.  It will  probably

keep the five-year time frame,

but  take  bolder steps in the earlier years.  We will  announce

the programme of liberalisation soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS is reviewing all restrictions in the domestic retail

sector, including limits on opening additional branches, setting-up  off-premise ATMs, participating in shared-ATM  networks  and

offering  Electronic  Funds Transfer at  Point-of-Sale  (EFTPOS)

services.   MAS is also reviewing rules governing foreign  banks

granted  offshore licences, to see how reputable offshore  banks

can have greater access to the domestic market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, foreign banks already have wide access to Singapore's

banking  sector.   They  compete  freely  with  local  banks  in

wholesale  domestic banking, offshore banking, and treasury  and

capital market activities, but face restrictions in the domestic

retail  market.  Foreign banks account for more than a third  of

total resident deposits, and 45% of loans to resident borrowers,

nearly  half.   They  also account for  the  vast  bulk  of  the

business  with non-residents; in fact, 86% of deposits  of  non-residents  and  95%  of loans to non-residents.   Foreign  banks

enjoy a larger market share in Singapore than elsewhere in Asia,

or in any major financial centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, MAS intends to liberalise the banking system

further,  as  this  is  the best way to  upgrade  the  industry,

develop  robust  local  banks,  and  enhance  our  role  as   an

international   financial  centre.   We   will   not   open   up

indiscriminately,  and risk the high prudential  standards  that

our  reputation depends upon.  Instead MAS will provide  greater

access to foreign banks with strong global track records,  sound

credit  ratings,  and a demonstrated commitment  to  Singapore's

financial system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market analysts and rating agencies consider Singapore banks the

soundest  and best in Asia.  Our banks operate efficiently,  and

offer  high  quality  retail  banking  services.   However,  the

banking environment is being transformed, in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>

region and globally.  Existing franchises and market shares  are

being challenged.  Players who do not adjust quickly and develop

new capabilities quickly risk losing their positions altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition, not protection, is the only way to develop strong

local  banks  which  measure up against the  best  international

players.   Our  banks  must make this leap to  make  the  grade.

Unless  they  gear  up  now to hold their  own  against  greater

competition in an open domestic market, they will not  be  ready

to compete for opportunities in Asia as the region recovers over

the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that more than one Singapore bank will develop a

significant presence in Asian and international markets.  To  do

this,  Singapore  banks  must provide innovative  and  efficient

personal financial services comparable to the best retail banks,

and  strengthen their capabilities in corporate banking and non-traditional, fee-based businesses.  No bank can be strong in all

areas  of  banking. Some local banks will choose to  specialise.

But  to  compete, they all have to use capital more efficiently,

and  cut costs by farming out back-room operations that  can  be

more  efficiently  performed  outside,  just  like  the  leading

international  banks do.  Most important, they need  to  attract

the  best banking talent available, whether locally and  abroad,

put in place systems to reward and motivate top performance, and

build outstanding management teams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that several local banks have already announced and

started implementing plans to prepare for the new era.  They are

alive  to  the  changing business environment.  I  am  therefore

confident  that  the  liberalisation  will  result  in  a   more

competitive  banking industry, stronger local institutions,  and

better service to customers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I like

to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether there is a need to help

local  banks  now to cope with the consequence of liberalisation

that is going to come sooner than later.  Do they need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>

Government  assistance, for example, to  face  the  competition?

Because there is a fear that with foreign competition, they  may

lose out their market share.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I am not sure what the Member

means  by "assistance to cope with competition".  The Government

does not operate banks, not even DBS that operates commercially.

And the best spur to banks to compete, to upgrade and to improve

is  competition.   You  just look at what has  happened  in  the

telecommunications business.  There was a long  discussion  just

now.   It has arisen because we have opened up the market and  a

tremendous  energy has developed, and innovations,  new  trials.

Once  in  a while, people have to be reined back but it is  good

that  we are reining them back, rather than having to prod  them

forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks are slightly different because if there is too much

excitement, some mishaps may happen and a lot of depositors will

get hurt.  So we have to be more careful.  What we can do is  to

give due notice, make our policies quite clear, liberalise, make

sure  that  the rules are fair and not overly onerous  to  local

banks,    because sometimes the local banks point  out  that  in

some respects, we are even harder on them than on foreign banks.

So  we  have  to be even handed and then we have  to  allow  the

market  to  do its work.  And if you read what the  local  banks

have  been planning, announcing and changing over the  last  few

months, I think that the transformation has begun, because there

have  been some mergers.  DBS has gone with POSBank, Keppel Bank

with Tat Lee Bank.  There have been changes in their strategies.

They  have  brought in new personnel.  They have  announced  new

plans.  They have focused on returns to shareholders.  They have

focused  on new services and new ways to deliver these services.

I  think that competition is doing its work.  Singaporeans often

say  that they should be allowed to flower on their own and,  in

the  next breath, ask what is the Government doing to help  them

to flower.  I think we just allow it to happen.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Will the Deputy Prime Minister clarify if

the MAS would prohibit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>

the  start-up  of a non-bank, not necessarily a foreign  player,

payment clearing house, particularly for Internet payments?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is something we would have to look

at carefully.  We will have to consider the specific proposal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether

any check is kept over the increasing charges and fees levied by

banks for services?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many banks

in  Singapore. I think there are four or five big local ones and

20-odd  foreign full-licence banks.  Any bank which is  charging

him too much, he should just take his custom elsewhere.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> I would like to ask DPM whether

there  are presently regulatory restrictions preventing  foreign

banks  from tapping on the local ATM network which today is  the

widest  but serving only local banks.  If there are, would  this

be removed or made more accessible to foreign banks?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The local ATM network is a private

sector initiative.  The local banks are the shareholders.  So it

is  really  up  to them whether they will bring   in  a  foreign

partner.  If he had read their sentiments, I think they are  not

very  favourably disposed to this idea.  We do have restrictions

on foreign banks establishing off-premise ATM machines.  This is

one of the things which we will be actively reviewing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> I would like to ask

DPM  whether, in the process of opening up the financial sector,

he  would  require  the  local institutions  to  meet  the  same

reporting standards as the big international firms that we would

like them to operate in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We are doing that already, and a

Committee   chaired  by  Mrs  Elizabeth  Sam  last   year   made

recommendations which have been accepted, and which  will  bring

our banks' reporting standards up to the norm in developed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>

countries.  They are not quite the very best practices, but  the

norm  in developed countries.  The banks have already done that.

They  have published their hidden reserves which have never been

done before.  These were treated as top secrets.  I see OCBC has

announced  that  they will give details about  their  land  bank

which is another old top secret.  We are changing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I come back to my question? Is the DPM

aware that these increases of fees and charges are all, first of

all,  agreed among the various banks through the Association  of

Banks and they all implement them?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure what

fees and charges ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> For services.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Different banks have different fees and

charges imposed.  They settle their own.  There are a few  items

which  are settled with the Association of Banks.  For  example,

there  is an agreement amongst the banks that they will not  pay

interest  on  checking accounts.  I think that must  change  and

banks will have to be free to do that.  It is really up to  them

what  interest they pay.  The Member cannot have it  both  ways.

He  will  remember recently there was a problem with  a  finance

company  which  was  levying  a penalty  interest  on  a  hawker

stallholder   whose mortgage was in default. There was  a  great

clamour  for the Association of Finance Houses to set the  rules

and   make  sure  nobody  charges  too  much.   Sometimes,   the

Association has other rules which are not to the liking  of  the

Member.  So we have to decide which way we are going to go.   In

general,   the  approach  should  be  competition  rather   than

coordination.

<div align="center"><b>ENGAGEMENT OF PRIVATE FUND MANAGER</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

what  is  the  progress in engaging a private  fund  manager  to

manage public funds.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the outplacement of

public  funds to external private fund managers is part  of  the

Government's  effort to develop Singapore into a  premier  asset

management   hub.   It  is  a  catalyst  to  encourage   leading

international  fund  management companies to  locate  or  expand

their  operations  in  Singapore.   Asset  management  companies

receiving  public  funds to manage are committed  to  increasing

headcount  and  funds  under management, including  non-resident

funds,  in  Singapore.  They are also expected to introduce  new

investment capabilities and activities in Singapore.   This will

expand the breadth and depth of our asset management industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February last year, the Government of Singapore

Investment Corporation (GIC) announced that it would  place  out

S$25 billion over the next three years to external fund managers

who  have offices in Singapore.  As at end-1998, GIC had  placed

out  a total of $16.9 billion to  fund management companies with

offices  in Singapore.  Of this amount, $6.8 billion was  placed

out  in  1998  as a whole.  In other words, over  the  next  two

years,  1999  and  2000, we will be placing  out  about  another

S$18.2 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1998, MAS announced that it would place out

S$10 billion over the next three years to external fund managers

with offices in Singapore.  MAS then followed up to meet 36 fund

management   companies  to  brief  them  on   details   of   the

outplacement and application procedure. Of the $10 billion,  MAS

expects to place out $2.5 billion this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also encouraged statutory boards and

Government-linked  companies (GLCs) to place  out  their  excess

funds to external fund managers.  According to an MAS survey  of

28  statutory boards and GLCs last year, these statutory  boards

and GLCs (excluding MAS and GIC) had placed out a total of S$4.1

billion  as  at  30th June 1998 to external fund  managers  with

offices in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Can the DPM tell the House what kind

of  rate of return we are getting for those funds we placed  out

up to end of 1998?

<div align="center"><b>INTERNET RELAY CHAT FACILITIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use by perpetrators of rape and molest offences)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (i)

what  is  the  number  of cases of rape, or  molest  or  related

offences  which  resulted from the perpetrators  making  contact

with  the  victims through Internet Relay Chat facilities;  (ii)

whether any of the perpetrators have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>

been  caught;  and  (iii)  whether  there  is  an  intention  to

prosecute  the  Internet Service Providers for facilitating  and

abetting these offences.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng</b>

<b>Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, the first

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) related sexual offence, an outrage  of

modesty  case, was reported in April last year. As at  end-1998,

the  only additional case was a rape case. The offenders in both

cases have been arrested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number of offences resulting from IRC is

relatively small, Police  takes them very seriously because  the

victims were young.  They were 13 and 11 years old.   Police  in

December  1998 issued a press release to warn IRC users  of  the

dangers  involved  in meeting strangers they  have  corresponded

with  on  the  IRC,  and  to  remind parents  to  monitor  their

children's movements and educate them on the dangers of chatting

on the IRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no evidence in the reported cases which suggested

that  the  Internet Service Providers abetted the offences.  The

solution is for parents to educate and supervise their children,

and  for the community to take their share of responsibility  to

prevent crime, as new fads like the IRC will continue to have an

impact on Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> In such

offences  when  the victims voluntarily met with  the  offender,

does  this  consent jeopardise the defendant's suit against  the

offender?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Ultimately, it is the act that is

in  question.  If initially, there is consent to the meeting,  a

rape  takes place or outrage of modesty takes place,  that  will

still  constitute an offence if the elements of the offence  are

present.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the ISPs, because they

have this added responsibility of making sure that the users  of

Internet  use  it  responsibly,  would  that  not  be  seen   as

facilitating the offences if they do not block such behaviour?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I think the IRC facilitates many

activities.   Ultimately, it is up to the users  to  be  careful

what happens from the usage of the IRC.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Will the Ministry of Home Affairs consider

making  it an obligation for the Internet  Service Providers  to

have some special service which would allow parents to block IRC

services, if necessary?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Ultimately, it is a matter of

education.   We  will monitor the situation.  Dr  Toh  has  also

asked  MITA an oral question on what is being done.  Ultimately,

I think everybody must be aware of the dangers of IRC.  IRC does

facilitate communication.  So before we block it out, let it  do

its  work  of helping people to communicate.  At the same  time,

all  users,  especially parents,  must be aware of  the  dangers

that can arise from their children's usage.

<div align="center"><b>(Legislation to regulate use)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Dr Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Minister for Information and

the Arts whether the Government intends to introduce legislation

to  criminalise  or  regulate the use  of  Internet  Relay  Chat

communications  infrastructure that lure  women  into  rape  and

molest situations.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, Internet enables people to communicate with each

other.   Services like the Internet Relay Chat, e-mail, Internet

telephony, video conferencing and others facilitate this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Broadcasting Authority, or SBA, regulates the

use  of  the  Internet for broadcasting purposes.  It  does  not

regulate  e-mail and Internet Relay Chat, which are regarded  as

private communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the dangers posed by services like the

Internet  Relay  Chat is not legislation or regulation  but,  as

Assoc.  Prof. Ho said, public education and common  sense.   SBA

will do what it can to educate the public on what is potentially

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>

harmful in the Internet.  However, this is not only for  SBA  to

do.   Parents,  teachers and community leaders  must  also  play

their part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the means used, anyone who lures women into rape

and molest situations is in serious breach of the law.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, for many

parents, the only thing they know about the Internet is  how  to

spell it and pronounce it.  Will SBA help this process by having

public   education  programmes?   I  think  the  press  releases

recently were not enough.  Will SBA also consider the question I

asked earlier on of Prof. Ho, ie, obliging the ISPs to provide a

family  service that allows parents to block off  IRC,  if  they

consider it unproductive or bad for the children?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> SBA will do its share of the

education,  but  this  burden cannot be on  SBA  alone.   As  to

whether we should ban IRC because some bad things happen on IRC,

I  think  that would not be a good move because relay chats  are

very  useful  for  a  whole  range  of  private  communications.

Whether  some  bad  things take place within relay  chats?   Bad

things  happen  on the phone line, through the fax  machine  and

through the postal system.  We cannot ban all these things  just

because some bad things happen within this medium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

Sir,   this  Bill  will  insert  a  new  section  8A  into   the

Presidential Elections Act to protect the Presidential Elections

Committee or PEC from law suits which may be brought in  respect

of  statements  made  by  the  Committee  in  discharge  of  its

functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PEC was established under Article 18 of the

Constitution.   The Committee serves two functions.   First,  it

has to certify that it is satisfied that a prospective

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>

candidate   is  a  person  of  integrity,  good  character   and

reputation.  Second, in the case of a prospective candidate  who

does  not  automatically  qualify under Article  19(2)(g)(i)  to

(iii) of the Constitution, the Committee has to certify that  it

is  of  the  opinion  that the prospective  candidate  has  such

experience  and  ability in managing financial  affairs  as  are

necessary for the office of the President.  This is an important

committee  performing an important task.  It should be protected

in its work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing its functions, the PEC may have to decline

issuing certificates of integrity, good character and reputation

or  certificates  of adequate ability and experience,  no  doubt

after  careful  consideration.  Such decisions  may  potentially

lead  to  legal proceedings against the Committee's  members  by

aggrieved prospective candidates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the proper discharge by the Presidential

Elections  Committee of its duties and functions, the  Committee

should be immune from legal proceedings in respect of statements

and  documents which it makes and publishes in discharge of  its

functions.   The  immunity will apply  only  to  statements  and

documents made and published by the Committee in discharging its

functions  under the Constitution.  It will not apply  to  other

statements  and documents.  The immunity will apply so  long  as

there  is  no  malice on the part of the Presidential  Elections

Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that even with this provision, the Committee will

be  as  diligent  as it has been in assessing all  applications.

And  also this provision is not an unusual one.  There are  also

other  laws  which  confer immunity of such a nature.   Auditors

enjoy  immunity  from defamation suits under the Companies  Act,

Futures  Trading Act and Commodity Futures Act.   Likewise,  the

Securities  Industry  Council  and  the  Monetary  Authority  of

Singapore  (MAS) enjoy immunity from defamation suits under  the

Companies Act and MAS Act respectively.  So, what more the PEC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite

agree with the Minister of State that this is an important  job,

especially  with the coming elections for the Elected President.

Good  men  and  good women must be free to do  their  job  which

includes assessing the possible candidates.  As the Minister  of

State  has  told us, there is a degree of subjectivity  in  this

test  to  assess  possible candidates  in  terms  of  integrity,

character  and  good  reputation, as well  as  for  ability  and

experience.   And  in this subjectivity, people  may  reasonably

disagree,  even  reasonable  people.   There  is,  as  such,   a

possibility  of defamation.  I think the Minister  of  State  is

correct  in saying that this should be covered for the  sake  of

the PEC doing its full job free from any hesitation or fear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out, however, that this is, therefore, a

creation  by  this  House of an exception to  normal  defamation

laws.    It   is   this  House  recognising  that   in   certain

circumstances,  there is a need for full and  free  comment  and

that  this  need prevails even where someone makes  a  negligent

mistake,  even  if the PEC would by error of fact say  something

wrong.   The exception we are creating will save them from  such

mistakes   unless   there  is  actual  malice.    That   is   my

understanding of this Bill.  But I concur with this need.  And I

believe,  as  I  spoke on the motion to look at defamation  laws

again,  that  increasingly this House  must  face  the  need  to

provide  a  full scrutiny of those who seek elected  office  and

allow  exceptions for that job to be done.  This is despite  the

fact  that, of course, with the Elected President, we  wish  the

best men and women to come forward to serve this country in this

important post.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support  this amendment.  As a result of the Elected  President,

we  have this piece of legislation and the rationale behind this

amendment is indeed worthy of support of this House.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>

It  is not a blanket immunity, as the Minister pointed out.   If

there is malice, the members have to face the consequences.  And

I  think it is important that the Committee which deals  with  a

very  important post in the land should be free  to  assess  the

suitability  of the candidates.  I am glad, and I am  sure,  the

Government  will do it again.  The most important  thing  is  to

appoint  suitable people, people of integrity who  will  examine

the  suitability of the candidates, because there is a provision

in  the  Constitution.   There may be  candidates  who  may  not

automatically qualify but who have to be certified by this body,

and  in this case I rise to support the amendment.  I was rather

taken  aback why this was not included earlier when the Act  was

first  enacted.   But  I see that since 1991,  there  have  been

various  amendments  and  I think the House  should  unanimously

support the move by the Minister.  Because, if we have to have a

committee   that   must  function  within   the   constitutional

framework, it is very important that the Committee must be  free

to  come  to a decision.  As I have said earlier, the  Committee

has got certain limitation.  With this, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank both Mr Rai

and Mr Tay for supporting the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I think the key, as Mr Rai has pointed out, is to select

the  right people for the job, and this is provided for  in  the

Constitution  where the Chairman is the Chairman of  the  Public

Service  Commission  and the members are  the  Chairman  of  the

Public  Accountants Board and a member nominated by the Chairman

of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights.  So that is the

key.   Once  you have the right people with the right experience

and  the  right standing to make the assessment, no doubt  there

will  be  some  element  of  subjectivity,  but  it  will  be  a

considered judgement of all three members looking at facts which

are  essentially furnished in the form by the applicant.  So the

point,  Sir, is that this clause will further help the Committee

in exercising considered judgement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay is right in that it is an exception to the law of

defamation.  But, as I have pointed out, this is not  the  first

time  we are doing it.  There are also other laws, although  the

laws  are more narrow in confining only to defamation.  In  this

case,  yes, the clause is wide enough to cover situations,  like

negligent mis-statements.  If you look at the functions  of  the

Committee, the possibility of it being liable or being caught in

a  situation where it has given a negligent statement  is  quite

unlikely.   So  the  main  thrust, as I  see  it,  will  be  the

possibility of defamation suits which, in any case, because  the

Committee  will continue to exercise considered judgement,  will

again be not likely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill.  -  [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CONTROL BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>1.40 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control of environmental pollution is now dealt with under

the  Clean  Air  Act  (which was enacted  in  1971),  the  Water

Pollution Control and Drainage Act (which was enacted in  1975),

certain  provisions  of  the Poisons Act  and  Part  VI  of  the

Environmental Public Health Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet new environmental challenges as our economy

continues to develop and move up the technology chain,  we  need

to  update  and consolidate these laws.  This will allow  us  to

legislate  certain pollution control requirements and  practices

which   are   now  specified  administratively,  and   add   new

provisions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Pollution Control (EPC) Bill, when

passed,  will repeal the Clean Air Act (Chapter 45) and Part  VI

of  the Environmental Public Health Act (Chapter 95), with  some

consequential  amendments to the Poisons Act (Chapter  234)  and

the Medicine (Advertisement and Sale) Act (Chapter 177).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in many developing countries, industrialisation

is  often achieved with little thought for the environment.   In

actual fact, it is not the environment which is the only victim.

Ultimately, the population suffers too, through the ill  effects

of a polluted environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the Government has not allowed industry to

compromise  our environmental standards.  We have regulated  the

emission   of  pollutants  from  the  various  industries,   and

instituted  proper handling procedures for hazardous substances.

We  require companies to incorporate adequate pollution  control

facilities in the design and construction of their manufacturing

facilities,  and  monitor  to ensure  that  these  are  properly

operated and maintained.

<br><br><i>Capping of Emissions of Pollutants from Industries</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's industrial landscape has changed significantly over

the  past 40 years.  Today, most of our manufacturing operations

are  of  a  world-scale.   Many of  them  handle  and  discharge

chemicals  which, if not controlled properly, can  pose  serious

threats  to our environment as well as to the health and  safety

of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the total pollutants emitted into the air today are within

safe  limits,  the amount of pollutants will increase  with  the

continued expansion and growth of our industrial sector  in  the

years  ahead.  We therefore cannot afford to be complacent,  and

must  ensure  that  we have adequate and appropriate  regulatory

powers to deal with any new environmental development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, my Ministry has tackled pollution problems

through  regulations made under various Acts.  For  example,  we

introduced the Poisons (Hazardous

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>

Substances)   Rules,  1986  under  the  Poisons  Act   and   the

Environmental  Public Health (Control of Noise  at  Construction

Sites)  Regulations, 1990 under the Environmental Public  Health

Act.  Such controls will now be consolidated into the EPC  Bill.

This  Bill  will  also  give my Ministry  additional  powers  to

control or prohibit the emission of any particular air pollutant

from any industrial or trade premises.

<br><br><i>Engagement of registered inspectors to check completed developments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, ENV officers carry out inspections of completed

developments    to   ensure   compliance   with    environmental

requirements.  To  encourage  self-regulation,  the  Bill   will

provide  for  the  engagement of registered inspectors  who  are

professional architects or engineers to undertake such checks.

<br><br><i>Putting existing practices into law</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, before major projects such as oil refineries,

petrochemical  plants and land reclamation are  implemented,  my

Ministry  will ask the developer to submit details of  pollution

control measures and, if necessary, risk assessment studies.  We

also  require installations using hazardous substances to  carry

out regular safety audits on the safe handling and management of

such substances.  Industrial premises discharging air pollutants

into  the atmosphere or trade effluent into the water-course  or

sewer  are  required to monitor such discharges,  treating  them

first,  where  necessary.  All these administrative requirements

will  now  be provided for in the EPC Bill and thus, be  legally

enforceable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will enable the Ministry to control air pollution from

sources  other than industrial and commercial premises, such  as

smoky  vehicles.   The  particulates  emitted  by  diesel-driven

vehicles  are very fine and a large proportion of them are  less

than  2.5 micron in size (and these are commonly referred to  as

PM2.5).   Our studies indicate that diesel particulates make  up

more than 50% of the PM2.5 in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>

our  air.   Studies  in the US and other countries  have  linked

PM2.5  to  an  increase  in respiratory diseases  and  increased

mortality.   The  studies indicate that it is  prudent  to  keep

PM2.5  levels as low as possible in order to protect the  health

of  the  population.   Poorly-maintained diesel-driven  vehicles

give  off  excessive  amount of particulates.  My  Ministry  has

worked  closely with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and  the

Traffic   Police  to  take  enforcement  action  against   smoky

vehicles.    Although  the  proportion  of  smoky  diesel-driven

vehicles  has gradually reduced over the years, the  number  has

nonetheless remained high.  My Ministry will continue to step up

enforcement  action against smoky vehicles in  Singapore.   This

Bill  will  result in my Ministry taking over from the  LTA  the

responsibility for enforcement against smoky vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will extend my Ministry's controls over noise from

construction  sites  and  other sources.   It  will  empower  my

Ministry  to  order  construction  sites  and  workplaces   that

generate excessive noise affecting residential neighbourhoods to

stop  work  if  they  fail  to comply  with  a  notice  to  take

appropriate measures to control noise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry vets building plans for compliance with pollution

control  requirements and gives its clearance  to  the  Building

Control  Division which then issues approval under the  Building

Control  Act.   The Bill will include provisions  requiring  the

direct submission of building plans to ENV for pollution control

purposes.

<br><br><i>Major provisions of the EPC Bill</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the major provisions that are being

introduced in this Bill.

<br><br><i>Use of Scheduled Premises (Part III)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduled premises are specified in the First Schedule. They

are industrial premises which store bulk quantities of hazardous

substances  or carry out activities that may cause  serious  air

pollution.  Clauses 6 to 9 require such premises to be  licensed

before they can be occupied or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>

used.  ENV will impose appropriate conditions in the licence  to

prevent  and control pollution of the environment and to  ensure

that   the   hazardous  substances  are  properly  managed   and

controlled.

<br><br><i>Air Pollution Control (Part IV)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 14 of the Bill deal with the control of air

pollution.  Clause 10 requires the occupier of any industrial or

trade  premises  to maintain and efficiently  operate  any  fuel

burning  equipment  and  any  air  pollution  control  equipment

installed  in  the  premises.   Clause  12  provides   for   the

introduction of caps on total emissions of air impurities.   Any

emission  in excess of such caps will be an offence.  Clause  12

also  allows  the  Minister to make regulations  to  control  or

prohibit  emission of air impurities from any other source,  eg,

motor vehicles.

<br><br><i>Water Pollution Control (Part V)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill deals with water pollution control and

these are covered under clauses 15 to 19.  Under clause 15,  any

person  who intends to discharge trade effluent, oil,  chemical,

sewage or other polluting substances into any drain or land  has

to  obtain  a  licence.   This clause has been  strengthened  to

incorporate  the  presumption that if there is evidence  of  any

discharge  of  trade effluent, oil, chemical,  sewage  or  other

polluting matters from a premises into a drain or land without a

licence,  the  occupier of the premises shall be guilty  of  the

offence  unless he can prove otherwise.  Clause 16 requires  any

occupier to treat such trade effluent before it is discharged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 prohibits the discharge of any toxic or hazardous

substance  into  any inland water.  Any person  who  contravenes

this  provision is liable on the first conviction to a fine  not

exceeding  $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not  exceeding  12

months or to both, and on a second or subsequent conviction,  to

a fine not exceeding $100,000 and imprisonment for a term of not

less  than  1  month  and not more than 12  months.   The  heavy

penalties, including mandatory jail sentence for the second  and

subsequent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>

convictions,  are  necessary  as  any  discharge  of  toxic   or

hazardous  substance  into  our  inland  water  will  not   only

contaminate  our limited water resource, but also  endanger  the

health and lives of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 empowers ENV to require any person who had discharged

any  toxic or hazardous substance or other polluting matter onto

any  land or into any drain or sea to remove and clean  up  such

substance or matter within a specified time. Clause 19  empowers

ENV  to  require  any person to take measures to  prevent  water

pollution  due  to  the  storage  or  transportation  of   toxic

substances   or  other  polluting  matters.   Currently,   these

requirements are enforced administratively.

<br><br><i>Land Pollution Control (Part VI)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 20 empowers the Minister to make regulations to

control  the pollution of land.  These would include regulations

to require remedial measures to be taken on contaminated sites.

<br><br><i>Control of land contamination</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In land scarce Singapore, land use is reviewed regularly to

ensure  optimal use.  Changes in land-use zoning may  result  in

industrial sites being re-zoned for residential, recreational or

other  developments.  Such land-use conversions have  not  posed

any  problems so far.  In some developed countries,  there  have

been  occasions  when  industrial land  had  been  converted  to

residential   use,   and  subsequently  found   to   have   been

contaminated only after the adverse effects on the health of the

residents showed up many years later.  By that time,  it  was  a

bit too late.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, owners of industrial land, such as JTC and the Land

Office,  require  their tenants to carry out  soil  studies  and

clean  up  contaminated land before the lands  are  returned  to

them.   This is done administratively.  My Ministry would advise

JTC  and  the  Land Office the procedure and standard  for  soil

studies  and  clean up.  This Bill will empower the Minister  to

make  regulations to require that land found to be  contaminated

will have to be made good before change of use is allowed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Hazardous Substances Control (Part VII)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 21 to 27 deal with the control of hazardous substances.

Clause  22 makes it an offence for any person to import, possess

to sell, sell or offer for sale any hazardous substances without

a   licence.   Such  substances  are  specified  in  the  Second

Schedule.  Clause 25 empowers ENV to require any person  keeping

any  hazardous  substance stored or kept in a premises  that  is

likely  to threaten the health or safety of any person or  cause

pollution  to the environment to remove the hazardous  substance

for  disposal in a proper facility.  Currently, this is enforced

through licensing control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 empowers ENV to require the owner or occupier of

installations that store, use or handle hazardous substances  in

bulk  quantities  to  carry out impact  analysis  studies.   The

studies  will  identify and quantify the risks of handling  such

hazardous substances in the installations and recommend measures

to minimise or prevent such risks.  The clause also empowers ENV

to require such installations to review and audit their existing

measures for the safe management of hazardous substances.

<br><br><i>Noise Control (Part VIII)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 to 30 deal with the control of noise from

construction activities and other works.  Clause 28 empowers ENV

to  impose requirements on the way in which certain construction

or  other  works are to be carried out in order to  control  the

level of noise emitted from those works.  Clause 29 empowers ENV

to prohibit any owner or occupier of any workplace from carrying

out or permitting any specified activities which may cause noise

to be emitted exceeding a specified level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV will be empowered to issue stop-work orders to construction

sites and workplaces which generate excessive and loud noise and

fail  to comply with a noise control notice issued by ENV.   Any

person who contravenes a stop-work order is liable on conviction

to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for every day during

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>

which  the order is not complied with, or to imprisonment for  a

term  not  exceeding 3 months or both.  The strong measures  are

necessary to ensure that construction sites and workplaces  take

practical  and  reasonable care to minimize  noise  nuisance  to

nearby residents, after ENV has advised them to do so.

<br><br><i>Licences and Industrial Plant Works (Part IX)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 31 to 34 contain provisions on licences and industrial

plant  works.   Currently, a person requires separate  licences,

permits  and approvals to carry out various activities, such  as

discharging  trade  effluent,  occupying  and  using   scheduled

premises,  importing  and  selling  hazardous  substances,  etc.

Under clause 31, he may apply for a single licence to carry  out

these activities.  This will greatly simplify administrative and

paper work, and improve efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 33, qualified persons are required to submit

building plans of industrial plant works to ENV for the issue of

clearance  certificates before such works can  be  carried  out.

Clause  33  also  allows  for such works  to  be  inspected  and

certified by professional architects or engineers registered  by

ENV for such purposes.

<br><br><i>Environmental Pollution Control Measures (Part X)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 35 to 40 contain provisions relating to measures for the

control  of  environmental pollution.  Clause  35  introduces  a

presumption that the main contractor of a construction  site  is

deemed  to have permitted the discharge of pollutants  from  the

site  or the open burning of construction debris on the site  if

such incidents happen.  He will be liable to the same punishment

as  the  person who actually commits the offence, unless he  can

show  proof  that he has exercised due diligence to prevent  the

offence  from  taking  place.  This will ensure  that  the  main

contractor  exercises proper control over the construction  site

and his workers and agents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 36 empowers ENV to require any person intending to carry

out any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>

activity  that is likely to cause substantial pollution  of  the

environment  to  carry  out a study on  environmental  pollution

control and implement such necessary preventive measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 empowers ENV to require the owner or occupier of any

premises from which pollutants are emitted to install monitoring

equipment  and suitable devices or systems to prevent or  reduce

the  emission  or discharge of such pollutants to  the  standard

prescribed  in  the  regulations.   This  again  is  to  instill

discipline and self-regulation in the industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38 empowers the Minister to make regulations to

require  any  industrial or trade premises or person  who  deals

with  hazardous  substances to take out and  maintain  insurance

against environmental risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 empowers the Minister to order premises which

emit  or  discharge air impurities, trade effluent or  hazardous

substances   which  are  likely  to  cause  pollution   of   the

environment or be injurious to public health or safety to:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) cease the process which causes such emission or discharge;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) cease such emission or discharge; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) carry out measures to collect, store and treat such

emission or discharge to specified requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for not complying with such an order is a fine not

exceeding  $100,000 or imprisonment not exceeding  3  months  or

both and a further fine of $2,000 for every day during which the

offence is continued after conviction.

<br><br><i>Enforcement (Part XI)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 41 to 50 contain provisions which confer on ENV powers

which are necessary for the enforcement of the Bill.  Clauses 43

to  45  give  authorised officers powers  of  investigation  and

arrest.  Such officers can interview and take the statement of a

suspected  offender or a witness of an offence under  the  Bill.

If such suspected offender or witness fails to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>

appear before the authorised officer as required, a warrant  may

be  issued by a Magistrate to secure his attendance.  Authorised

officers can also arrest and detain a person who is suspected to

have  committed  an offence under the Bill until  his  name  and

address can be correctly ascertained.  However, he shall not  be

detained  longer  than is necessary for bringing  him  before  a

court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 47 and 48 give authorised officers power of entry.

Clause  50  empowers authorised officers to search any  premises

suspected  of  storing or dealing with hazardous  substances  or

emitting  air  impurities or discharging trade effluent  without

permission,  and  to seize, seal or take samples  of  substances

found in the premises.  They may also require the production  of

records and documents and take photographs where necessary.

<br><br><i>Compensation, Damages and Costs (Part XII)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 51 to 64 relate to the recovery of compensation, damages

and  costs payable under the Bill.  Clause 51 provides  for  the

determination  of  the  apportionment  of  the  amount  and  the

question  of  liability of any compensation, damages,  fees  and

costs under the Bill by a court in case of dispute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53 imposes a charge on the premises for the recovery of

costs  and  expenses incurred by the Government under  the  Bill

which are payable by the owner of those premises.

<br><br><i>Miscellaneous Provisions (Part XIII)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 65 to 78 contain miscellaneous provisions. Clause

72  provides for offences under the Bill to be compounded for  a

sum not exceeding $5,000.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will enable my Ministry to deal with new

challenges  that  can  threaten the good living  environment  we

enjoy  today.  With  its  passage, my  Ministry  will  have  the

necessary  powers to ensure that Singaporeans will  continue  to

enjoy a clean and pollution free environment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for permitting me to speak on this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for a highly urbanised and densely populated city

state  such  as Singapore, the quality of the environment  is  a

crucial factor in our living standard.  In this instance, Sir, I

am  using  the word "standard" in the broadest sense,  not  just

economic   affluence.    In  fact,  without   a   high   quality

environment,  economic  affluence  may  come  to  nothing.   The

environment in Singapore, some one and a half years ago when  we

were  badly affected by the haze from Indonesia, is  a  case  in

point.  Yet, despite this motherhood truth, we still pollute our

environment.   Yes,  Sir,  we  are the  polluters  of  the  very

environment  that  sustains us and that is why an  Environmental

Pollution Control Bill is needed and this is why this Bill  must

be supported by all in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sir, if we are the polluters of the environment, then

surely to control pollution, we must start at the source of  the

problem.  Although it is beyond the provisions of this  Bill,  I

would  urge  the Minister to expend greater efforts to  minimise

the  generation  of  pollutants.  This means tackling  the  very

sources themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a social level, education plays a key role, especially

educating  the  young.  Parents, teachers and religious  leaders

must be brought into the picture to teach our future generations

that  environmental pollution is as sinful as the  most  heinous

crimes.    Such  values  must  be  made  part  of   our   future

generations' psyche.  In this respect, we, as adults,  must  set

good  examples for our children.  We must try, for our  sake  as

well as for their sake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I must hasten to add that Singapore is doing much in

this area.  The Ministry of the Environment, through its support

of  the  Singapore Environmental Council and the various "green"

non-government organisations and its "clean

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>

and  green"  programmes and campaigns, certainly  champions  the

environmental  cause.  I think the Government is  doing  a  good

job.  But good is not enough.  More must be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the industrial level, the Government has done very

little.   Other than giving vocal encouragement and  some  minor

financial  incentives,  the Government  has  done  little  else,

except for punishments.  In fact, Sir, this Bill under debate is

the  very example of this approach.  It is nothing more  than  a

series of "Thou shall not do this" and "Thou shall not do  that"

and "If thou disregard these edicts, thou shall be punished".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that this approach is not needed. All I am

saying   is  that  it  is  not  sufficient  to  change  habitual

behaviour.  Make no mistake about that; pollution is not because

one  wants  to pollute but because of personal convenience,  one

pollutes.   In  the case of industry, it is usually  because  of

convenience to the company and lower costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no reason why there cannot be financial incentives for

those  who are prepared to spend on equipment and procedures  to

reduce  pollution  at  source.   For  example,  why  cannot  the

Government  give  double tax deduction incentives  for  expenses

relating  to the attainment of ISO 14000 standards?  Why  cannot

individual   taxpayers   be  given  tax   deductions   for   the

installation of solar heating systems in their homes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government really wants to change the mindset of

Singaporeans with regard to pollution of the environment,  there

should be encouragement as well as punishment.  While punishment

is  needed  for  the  wrongdoers, what is  more  needed  is  the

encouragement   for  people  to  change  their   attitudes   and

behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I said that adults must set good examples for

children to follow.  Perhaps, I should also have added that  the

Government  should set examples for adults to follow.   However,

after  all  that  is said and done, despite being  an  urbanised

society  with a high per capita vehicle ownership,  the  world's

busiest sea port, a major hub for air transportation, a major

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>

petroleum  refining and chemical manufacturing centre and  other

activities   which  can  give  rise  to  heavy  pollution,   our

environment  remains relatively good and clean.   The  level  of

pollution  in  Singapore's  environment  is  below  the   limits

prescribed  by America's Environmental Protection  Agency  (EPA)

who,  as  I  believe,  has  one of the  world's  most  stringent

standards in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do want to take this occasion to

congratulate  the Minister and his staff for a  job  well  done.

However, this is not to say that they have done all that  is  to

be  done  and can therefore rest on their laurels.   As  I  said

earlier, they could do so much more for the environmental cause,

especially tackling the problem from other angles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the Bill itself, I find little to quarrel

with  it.   This is not surprising since the Bill is a piece  of

legislation to give power to the Government to enact  rules  and

regulations to prevent pollution of the environment.  The  devil

is  therefore  in the details and the enforcement of  compliance

with  the rules and regulations.  The legislative powers in  the

Bill  are  wide,  and  rightly so.  The  rules  and  regulations

arising from legislation will be tough with heavy, perhaps  even

draconian  penalties.   There is, however,  Sir,  pollution  and

pollution.   For  example,  air  pollution  may  originate  from

factories,  smoky vehicles or the burning of joss  papers.   Are

the culprits to be equally punished?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this Bill is passed, it will be in the hands of the

Executive to promulgate the rules and regulations and to enforce

compliance.  By the nature of the subject, the Bill is  long  on

principles and short on details.  I would therefore request  the

Minister  to  make a categorical statement that in carrying  out

the  duties  under the Bill, his Ministry's officers will  carry

the big stick but will walk softly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On air pollution, despite the Minister's comments on his

cooperation  with  the Land Transport Authority  (LTA)  and  the

assumption  of  certain responsibilities from LTA,  I  am  still

surprised that motor vehicles come simply under clause 12(5)  as

"any other sources".  After all, I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>

estimate that about half the particulation pollution in the  air

originates from vehicular sources.  Motor vehicles are the major

single source of pollution in this respect in Singapore and they

deserve  more attention than to be classified under  "any  other

sources".   Moreover, with the spread of motor vehicle ownership

amongst   the   public,   the   people   need   to   know   what

responsibilities they have with regard to pollution in the  form

of  more  specific items in the Bill.  The Bill should  be  more

specific on this.  Otherwise, we might as well have a Bill which

simply  states  that  this Bill empowers  the  Ministry  or  the

Minister to enact all regulations to control pollution from  all

sources, and that will cover everything if you do not want to be

specific about the items in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On water pollution, I would like the Minister to explain

the  reason for excluding the discharge of toxic substances into

the sea that is part of Singapore's territorial waters.  Surely,

the  sea  around  us is just as important as our  inland  water.

Perhaps,  it  is  covered under some other legislation  such  as

Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act.  Sir, if so,  then  this

Bill  is not complete in that it should include major items like

the  discharge of toxic substances into the sea forming part  of

Singapore's  territory.  I fear that with different  legislation

under  the  purview  of other Ministries,  things  may  fall  in

between stools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, clause 4 of the Bill empowers the Ministry to

authorise  town  councils and statutory  boards  to  perform  or

exercise  all  or any of the functions, duties and powers  under

the   Bill   and  the  regulations.   So  control  of  pollution

originating from items such as motor vehicles and discharging of

toxic substances into the sea could be part of the Bill with the

enforcement  of  compliance either delegated to other  competent

agencies  of the Government capable of doing the job or  in  the

case of smoky vehicles, by the Ministry itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 of the Bill provides the Minister with powers

relating  to land pollution.  Sir, would this provision  overlap

or conflict with the Environmental Public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>

Health  Act?  Would the powers and jurisdiction of the  Director

under  this Bill and the Commissioner of Public Health  overlap?

For example, toxic and hazardous wastes are currently controlled

under  the  Environmental Public Health  Act  (Toxic  Industrial

Waste) Regulations.  If these wastes contaminate the land, which

regulations  would  take  preference?   Perhaps  this  provision

addresses  a  gap  in the current regulations relating  to  land

pollution.  If so, could the Minister explain?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise pollution is probably the most difficult type of

pollution  to define and to enforce.  The reason is that  though

noise  levels  can be measured objectively, noise  pollution  is

relative.   In  other words, what may not be noise pollution  to

one  person could be pollution to others.  It all depends on the

general level of noise of one's surrounding and the level one is

used  to.   I am sure that one of the most difficult tasks  ever

performed  by  the  Ministry's officials is that  of  trying  to

persuade  one  of  two contending parties that what  the  latter

deems  as  noise pollution is not noise pollution as defined  by

the  Ministry's  regulations.  For example, if  one  is  unhappy

about noise, the Ministry officials will put a monitoring device

at the noise source.   If the measurement of the noise at source

is  below  the Ministry's limits, they will say that it  is  not

noise  pollution.  But to somebody who is not used to that heavy

level  of  noise,  it is certainly pollution.  Therefore,  I  am

saying  that in cases like this, there would be a difference  in

perception  simply because noise pollution is  a  very  relative

item.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in coming out with the standards relating to noise

pollution, I hope the Ministry would take into consideration the

neighbourhood in which the noise is being generated.  Instead of

just using one standard measurement of noise level at the source

of  the noise for all situations, the Ministry could perhaps use

differing measurements for different situations.  For example, I

would  expect that construction sites next or near  to  schools,

hospitals  and  residential  homes should  only  be  allowed  to

generate noise levels much lower than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>

those  sites further afield.  The hours of operation could  also

be  much  more  curtailed so as not to cause noise pollution  in

such neighbourhoods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 36 empowers the Director of Environmental Pollution

Control  to call for a study on environmental pollution control,

if  needed.  I suspect that such a study could be similar to  an

environmental   impact  assessment  report  required   in   many

countries  to  ensure  that  damage  to  the  environment  by  a

particular  development  is  minimal  and  acceptable   to   the

community.   Such a study could be time consuming and expensive.

I  would like to see the onus for calling such a study vested in

the Minister rather than the Director.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 is a new clause on the self-monitoring of one's own

pollution.   This  is a much-welcomed provision.   Increasingly,

industries  must  be required to self-monitor.   The  provision,

however, could be improved with several additions.  For example,

I think it should require the owner or occupier not only to self-monitor  but  also  to go through the results and  identify  the

infringements for the Ministry.  In this respect, I would expect

that  any  self-respecting company would not purposely  want  to

pollute,  but rather want to help prevent pollution.   And  this

definitely  would help the Director to do a better  job.   Also,

while  there are penalties for the unapproved alteration of  the

monitoring  equipment  or  system, there  is  no  provision  for

penalties  on submission of false particulars or for failure  to

submit  the  monitored data.  I think such provision  should  be

included.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also support the provision of enhanced penalties for

offences  relating to pollution.  It is time for the  Government

and  for  us  to  be tough on offences against  nature  and  the

community.   In  this  respect, clause 71  taken  directly  from

section  67 of the Water Pollution Control and Drainage Act  may

not  be adequate.  It may not be as effective as section  42  of

the  Hazardous  Wastes (Import, Export and Transit)  Act,  under

which  officers  of  the offending company are  presumed  to  be

guilty unless they can prove that they have exercised

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>

the  necessary due diligence of trying to prevent  the  offence.

This provision should be used instead of the current clause  71;

perhaps  if  not  now, then in subsequent amendments.   It  will

certainly  compel  the  officers  of  more  companies  to   look

seriously at preventing pollution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, environmental issues involve the whole community.

More  significantly, the community interest is increasing  these

days.  The recent furore in the possibility of a new golf course

on  the  banks of Kranji Reservoir is a case in point.  This  is

good  for  the development of a civil society in Singapore.   We

should encourage such a development.  I would therefore like  to

request the Minister to refer this Bill to a Select Committee to

ensure that all those interested in preventing pollution of  our

environment be given an opportunity to say their piece.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  moving  the  Second  Reading of  the  Amendment  Bill,   the

Minister has touched on  many areas.  However, I would  like  to

give my comments only on one aspect - noise pollution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an urbanised nation and we have progressed well in

the  past  three  decades. While we are  moving  into  the  21st

century,  we face bigger challenges ahead.  We want  to  develop

Singapore  into  an international financial centre.   In  public

transport, we want to have a world-class land transport  system.

In  public housing, we want to see every Singaporean own his  or

her own property.  In order that we would be able to attain such

objectives,  building  projects have  to  be  carried  out  very

intensively.  In the process, there is of course the problem  of

noise pollution, which is inevitable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, serious noise pollution will not only affect our living

environment,  our quality of life and our health  will  also  be

affected.   Workers who spend long hours in the noisy  worksites

are  bound  to  suffer adverse effects on their  health.  It  is

stipulated  that  the noise level for work carried  out  between

<br>7.00 am and 7.00 pm should not exceed 75 dba, and after 7.00 pm,

it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>

should  not exceed 65 dba.  Anyone who infringes this regulation

will  be  warned in the first instance, and if he  continues  to

infringe  this regulation he can be fined not more than  $10,000

or  imprisonment for more than 3 months, or both such  fine  and

imprisonment.   This  regulation may serve to  check  the  noise

pollution level at worksites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no restriction on the number of hours that

work  can  be  carried out at worksites.  In fact, work  can  be

carried  out  24  hours  a  day.  In the  day  time,  the  noise

pollution may be tolerated by the residents in the nearby  area,

but  in  the night time when the residents need to rest after  a

hard  day's  work,  the  noise pollution is  simply  unbearable,

particularly  if the work sites are very close  to  the  housing

estates.   For certain types of works, such as piling,  drilling

and  mixing  of concrete, the noise generated can be very  loud,

and  certainly very irritating. This will adversely  affect  the

lives  of  the  residents.  Normally, in  the  HDB  estates,  we

observe that, after 8.00 pm, our children will have to do  their

homework  and the adults need to relax and prepare for the  next

day's work.  For the elderly, particularly those who are not  in

good  health, they will require some quiet time to  rest.   This

noise pollution will cause a lot of unhappiness among the people

and very often we, MPs, receive a lot of complaints from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in my constituency, there are at the moment four

active  work sites.  I received frequent complaints  on  two  of

them,  one  at  Guilin  View and the other at  Hillview  Estate,

because they are very close to the HDB estate - as close as just

50  metres  away.  Noise pollution from these two worksites  has

disturbed   our  residents.   I  have  personally  visited   the

worksites  with the developers and our grassroots leaders.   The

contractors told me that they have complied with the regulations

set  down by the Ministry of the Environment.  But, one evening,

when  we  went down to one of the worksites, even the  developer

himself agreed that the noise was unbearable and that the  whole

living  environment  around the area  was  badly  disturbed.   I

requested  the developer to instruct his contractors to  refrain

from carrying out activities which are very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>

noisy  at  night.  He agreed.  From this, it can  be  seen  that

sometimes  the complaints by the residents are valid  and  their

requests are not too unreasonable.   In the day  time, the noise

is  there, but they put up with it.  But at night, they need  to

have some quiet time.  No doubt, building construction work  has

to  go on, but the living environment of the people must also be

taken into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three suggestions to make. First, at all worksites

which  are in close proximity, say, within 100 metres  from  the

housing  estates,  the  work should be  constrained.   In  other

words,  after  8.00  pm, the contractor  should  not  carry  out

activities which are capable of generating loud noise so as  not

to  affect  the living environment of the people.  For worksites

which  are  in the middle of nowhere, for example,  in  the  new

towns  or places far away from housing estates, there would  not

be  a  problem.  They can work round the clock, 24 hours a  day.

Just  now,  Mr Heng Chiang Meng  has also brought up  the  point

about  worksites which are near to hospitals and nursing  homes.

In those cases, the working hours should also be constrained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the measurement of the noise pollution index should be

carried  out more comprehensively.  For example, at  the  Guilin

View  worksite, after complaints by the residents, I  went  with

the  grassroots leaders and the developers to the worksite.   At

the worksite, we found that the noise level was within the limit

permitted  by the Ministry.  But when we went to the 9th  floor,

we  did not even need to take out the meter.  The noise was just

so loud that we were unable to converse with one another without

shouting.  It  was  obvious  that  the  residents  were  greatly

disturbed  by the noise.  I feel that when measuring  the  noise

level,  more  comprehensive measures should be taken.   This  is

because  at the lower floor, it may not be so noisy, but strange

enough, when you go to the higher floors, the noise level  seems

to rise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the contractors should be more careful in taking

measurements.  Perhaps

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>

some sort of device, like the speed limit detector on taxis, can

be installed.  On the taxi, once a certain preset speed limit is

exceeded, the device would set off an alarm to indicate that the

taxi  has exceeded the limit. Likewise, if such a similar device

can  be installed at the worksite to detect the noise level once

it  exceeds a certain preset limit, the alarm will be  triggered

off,  and the contractor will know he has to do something  about

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, all worksites are required to engage a safety officer

to  be  stationed on site. I feel that with some  training,  the

safety officer could also take on an additional duty of checking

on  the  noise  level at the worksite.  I think taking  up  this

additional  responsibility  is not a  big  problem  because  the

safety  officer  has to be personally present  at  the  worksite

anyway.  He has to ensure that all the safety measures are being

taken.   I feel that he could also do a good job in keeping  the

noise level down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister will look seriously into my

suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   pollution  is  a  common  term  associated   with   rapid

urbanisation  and industrial development. A recent report  shows

that  out  of the ten most polluted cities, nine are  in  China.

There  was  also a report that if nothing is done, in 20  years'

time, Hong Kong will be as polluted as Bangkok. In certain parts

of  India,  the air is so polluted that one could  smell  petrol

while  walking  in  the  street of the  city  of  Calcutta.  Air

pollution  does  not only exist in the developing  nations,  but

also  in  the western developed cities like Los Angeles,   Paris

and Rome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very fortunate that despite rapid urbanisation and

development  of  our  economy, the air  in  Singapore  is  still

practically pollution-free and well suited for human habitation.

We  have  to be thankful for the stringent pollution control  by

the  Government  which manages and controls  the  various  anti-pollution laws to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>

ensure  that we do not follow the footsteps of others who  trade

pollution for economic development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, the different aspects of pollution were

handled  by  different ministries.  For example, the control  of

hazardous  materials is administered by the Ministry of  Health,

the  Clean  Air  Act  is  administered by the  Prime  Minister's

Office,  and  water pollution comes under the  Ministry  of  the

Environment. The existing arrangement causes difficulty  in  the

management  and control of pollution. This is because  pollution

which violates one particular Act would also violate the others.

Take  the  example  of  discharge of hazardous  waste  into  the

watercourse that contravenes the water pollution regulations and

also  the  Control  of  Hazardous Materials  regulations.   Land

pollution  involves  evaporative  substance  which  will   cause

pollution to the air, the land and the watercourse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill presented for Second Reading today combines all

the  pollution  matters  into  one  Bill  to  be  known  as  the

Environmental  Pollution  Control Bill.   It  puts  all  matters

relating to the control of pollution into one Bill and it is  to

be  administered  by  one  ministry, ie,  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment.  As long as there is anything to do with pollution,

be  it  noise  pollution, air pollution, land pollution  or  any

dangerous  substance that exists and causes health or  hazardous

problem  to  the  public, it will be under  the  ambit  of  this

Environmental  Pollution  Control Bill.   With  this  Bill,  the

administration of anti-pollution matters under one ministry  and

one  Bill,  it is good enough to deal with all the culprits  who

cause  pollution  to our environment. To the  lay  person,  this

arrangement becomes very clear and easy for them. If there is  a

problem  concerning pollution, the Ministry of  the  Environment

will be the right Ministry to contact and to seek redress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on a few issues that have arisen

from  the  Bill.   In Part II,  clause 5(1) to (4)  exempts  the

Director  from personal liability.  We all know that the  action

taken  by the Director is based on good faith in preventing  the

outbreak of pollution that causes danger and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>

suffering to the public.  On certain occasions, the Director may

misjudge  and  his  subsequent action  could  cause  significant

financial losses to people if things like production machines or

processes  have  to be shut down.  If the Bill gives  a  blanket

protection to the Director who is fully exempted from  any  form

of  liability,  there  might be an occasion  where  a  wrong  or

convenient  decision  could  be made  which  causes  substantial

financial  losses  to the company and it  has  no  way  to  seek

redress  under  this particular Bill.  If the liability  of  the

Director  is  not  fully exempted, he could be more  careful  in

making  a decision in a borderline situation, and he would  also

examine   other  less  painful  alternatives  in  overcoming   a

pollution  problem.  If the officer is liable for his action,  a

more  sensible  decision and action would be  taken  in  such  a

borderline  situation which is not just based on the best  anti-pollution  measures  but also the interest of  others  could  be

taken into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Part IV mentioned about the prohibition of burning

combustible materials but it does not mention about  the  common

pollution  created  by  open  fire,  which  is  quite   commonly

practised  in  the  past at construction  sites  when  disposing

wooden  or  combustible construction wastes and  also  in  rural

areas  where  small  traders  burn  used  electrical  wires  for

recovery of copper. Could the Minister clarify these matters?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 18 (Part IV) mentioned about the provision to make

the  transportation  and storage of toxic and  polluting  matter

safe  as  required  by  the Director.   This  could  be  a  very

technical  matter  and  subjected  to  different  opinions   and

technical standards.  If there should be disagreement, the  Bill

does not say how the matter could be resolved.  When a violation

takes  place  and hazardous materials are released, the  maximum

penalty is $20,000. However, it does not say who should bear the

cost of cleaning-up.  In my view, the culprit should be made  to

bear  all  the  costs of the clean-up of the  pollution  he  has

created.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In air pollution, odour is one of the usual complaints by

lay people. It is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>

substance that creates an unpleasant smell but yet it might  not

be hazardous to health like other pollutants. The odorants could

be  introduced into the air in small amounts but the smell could

be  so  unbearable.  This  could  be  the  odorant  from  sewage

treatment  plants, fermentation of food from the food  industry,

solvents  from the application of glue and paint  and  from  the

tarmac  plant producing road surfacing materials.  In  my  view,

control of this type of pollutants is quite loosely regulated in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to relate one of my experiences. I used to

travel  along Jalan Boon Lay.  Every time I was irritated  by  a

strong  and  unpleasant smell.  I would  like  the  Minister  to

enlighten  the House how the situation I cited along Jalan  Boon

Lay could be improved after the passage of this particular Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not all the plants burn fuel. Take the example of a

concrete mixing plant in the premises of a pre-mixed company  or

in  a  construction site.  It is quite common that this kind  of

plant  emits  a  huge amount of particles during the  production

process  and  that  could  create a very  unhealthy  environment

either  in a housing estate or industrial estate.  I would  like

to  know how the Bill is able to deal effectively with this kind

of pollution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the area of water pollution, it does not mention

about one of the important aspects of pollution known as thermal

pollution.   In other words, it means that once  discharged  hot

water  goes  into  the watercourse, the thermal pollution  would

cause  serious pollution problems in the watercourse because  it

upsets  the  favourable living environment for  all  the  inter-related bio-organisms in the watercourse.  May I know which part

of the Bill deals with this specific kind  of problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 18 (Part V) empowers the Director to order the

removal  and  clean up of hazardous materials that  pollute  the

environment.  In many cases, we know that the clean-up  will  be

done by the Singapore Civil Defence Force.  If this is the case,

who should pay for the cost?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>

I  feel, just as I have said earlier, the culprit should be made

to bear the cost of the cleaning up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII deals with the licensing of people who trade in

hazardous substance, including hazardous waste.  I would like to

know whether the person collecting such waste must have adequate

facilities  to  treat  the waste before  a  licence  is  issued.

Otherwise, the consequence can be quite serious because it could

lead to illegal dumping or the export of the waste for financial

gain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to relate another example which may be

related   to  the  licensing  of  collection  of  waste.    This

particular example happened not long ago.  There was a big  fire

of  a huge collection of recycled wood in Lim Chu Kang.  It took

a  few  days for the fire brigade to put down the fire. In  this

case, luckily, the waste is not hazardous.  But we could draw  a

similar conclusion if the collector of waste does not treat  his

collected  waste  properly.  In my opinion,  the  recycled  wood

collector  was  given a licence to collect  waste  wood  and  he

charged  $40  for  every  ton of waste  wood  delivered  to  his

premises.    However,  the  licensee  did  not  have  sufficient

production  capacity  to recycle the wood into  some  marketable

products.  Perhaps, the fire "accident" helped to solve the huge

pile-up problem of this particular collector.   In this case, we

were lucky because this was not hazardous waste.  If it was, the

damage  to  the  health  of our fellow Singaporeans  would  well

exceed  anything that money could compensate.  I would like  the

Minister to clarify in what way a licence would be issued  to  a

hazardous waste collector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Second Schedule to the Bill, the ozone depleting

materials  are  listed.  I would like to know how  the  Minister

would  regulate  the  use  of  such  controlled  materials,   in

particular CFC 11 and CFC 113.  I ask this because CFC 11 is the

gas used in the production of polyform for packaging purpose and

also  for the cups and plates that we use in the hawker  centres

and  canteens.  Should  we regulate and discourage  the  use  of

polyform?  CFC 113 is the solvent used extensively in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>

electronic industry for the cleaning of printed wiring assembly.

What is the policy of the Ministry in encouraging the industries

to  phase  out the use of CFC 113 and to replace  it with  other

more environmental friendly solvents?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point I would like to raise is that the Bill

also  mentioned  about the qualified person and  the  registered

inspector.   Could the Minister enlighten the House  how  should

these qualified persons and registered inspectors be chosen?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in  principle, I support this  Bill  to  control

pollution  to  the environment, as it will further  improve  our

environment and hygiene, to the benefit of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is this Bill seems to give too wide and too

much  power to the enforcement officers of the Ministry  of  the

Environment.  People in the trade are worried that the  Ministry

officials  may  nit-pick and enforce these pollution  prevention

and  public health regulations in an inhumane manner.   If  that

is  the case, then the traders will have to spend a lot of  time

and money just to comply with the various rules and regulations,

and  live  in  constant  fear of being booked,  fined  and  even

imprisoned for infringement against any of these rules.    Faced

with  escalating business cost and intense competition from  the

neighbouring  countries, the traders often find it difficult  to

put up with the complicated rules and regulations of the various

Government departments.  They hesitate to develop their business

plans  and  even lose their original spirit of entrepreneurship.

This is indeed regrettable!   I therefore hope that the Ministry

of  the Environment will be more considerate to the traders when

they  enforce the various regulations.  They should not  neglect

the possible adverse effect to Singapore's effort to enhance our

competitiveness and to develop a creative business environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Lunar New Year is barely a week away. For

reasons well known to all of us, the market this year is not  so

good, and the coming year may

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>

well be another difficult year for us.  However, whether it is a

good year or a bad year, in accordance with Chinese customs  and

tradition,  we still have to create a flourishing  and  bustling

festive atmosphere for the New Year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is, during the Lunar New Year festive season this

year,  we may still be able to go to Chinatown to shop  for  New

Year  goodies,  and  bring our family  to  the  River  Hong  Bao

festival  to  soak  in the spring in the air, but  unfortunately

because of a new order by the Ministry of the Environment,  with

effect from this year, whether at Chinatown or at the River Hong

Bao festival, we will not be able to buy freshly roasted bak kua

or barbecued pork anymore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to know what is the rationale

of  the Ministry to ban the roasting of barbecued pork.  Is  the

roasting of barbecued pork causing environmental pollution?   Or

are there other reasons?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a society which is particular about presenting

facts   in   the  proper  perspective.   Whenever  a  Government

department promulgates any rules or policies, particularly those

that  have direct impact on the daily lives of the people, these

policies  will have to be clearly explained to the people,  lest

they be misunderstood as acts to disturb the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, assuming that the Ministry bans the

roasting  of  barbecued  pork  on the  ground  of  environmental

pollution, then I would like to know, among the problems of  air

pollution  in  Singapore,  what  percentage  is  caused  by  the

roasting of barbecued pork.  Or, more specifically, what is  the

air pollution index caused by roasting of barbecued pork?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the roasting of barbecued pork does not cause air

pollution, or the extent of pollution is negligible, then why is

the  Ministry banning the roasting of barbecued pork?  If it  is

said  that it has something to do with health problems, such  as

food poisoning or spreading of infectious diseases, then I would

like  to  ask the Ministry to provide the relevant data to  show

how many people had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>

actually  suffered  from  food poisoning  or  contacted  certain

infectious  disease  by eating barbecued  pork  roasted  at  the

roadside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the act of roasting is really causing serious problems

to  our environment and hygiene, then why does the Ministry  not

take  action  against the other acts of roasting,  such  as  the

roasting of chicken-wings, suckling pigs, otak, satay, etc?  Why

are  people still allowed to hold barbecue parties at  the  East

Coast  Park,  and  the  holiday chalets at  Changi  Village  and

Sentosa?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we often say we want to preserve our

traditions.  Yet, we are breaking our traditions all  the  time.

Like  the tossing of yu sheng or raw fish, the roasting  of  bak

kua is very much a part of the custom when the Chinese community

celebrates  the Lunar New Year in Singapore.  It is a  tradition

which  is  very  much  alive.   We should  cherish  such  living

tradition, rather than killing the tradition now and then trying

to  restore it a few years later for any intent or purpose.   It

is  always  difficult to resurrect a dead tradition.  I  believe

this  is  why  some learned people are strenuously opposing  the

Tourism  Board's  plan to transform Kreta Ayer  into  a  tourist

attraction which is neither fish nor fowl.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have side-tracked. Let me return to the subject. I feel

that  if the Ministry of the Environment does not have very good

reasons,  then  there is actually no need to ban  the  barbecued

pork sellers from roasting their pork in public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I urge the Ministry of the Environment

to review this policy and try to adopt more flexible measures to

enable  the shopkeepers or hawkers to provide instantly  roasted

steaming-hot barbecued pork to the consumers during this festive

season, so that we may still be able to salvage some moments  of

joy  and  happiness with the aroma generated by the roasting  of

barbecued pork, as we embark on another difficult year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me take this opportunity to wish Mr Speaker

and  all  Members  of  this  House:  Gong  Xi  Fa  Cai,   and  a

progressive new year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like many of the Members

who  have spoken before me, I share the view that Singapore  has

generally  a  good  record in environmental  pollution  control.

This  is  especially so considering we are a very densely  built

city  and  a  hub  of industrial activity.  This  has  not  been

fortuitous, not an act of fortune.  This good record is based on

a  combination of law, policy, administrative strength,  science

and  engineering.  When these come together, then it is possible

to have both growth and a good environment record.  And the Bill

is  a  further step in making sure this continues  even  as  our

economic growth seeks new avenues and industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, the Bill is a welcome Bill in an effort to

update  and consolidate different laws for air, water, hazardous

wastes, and to integrate the management under one Act, under one

Ministry,  and under one approach.  I have three basic  comments

as  regards,  firstly, standards; secondly,  the  approach;  and

thirdly, on some particulars of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the question of standards. As the Member, Mr

Heng,  said,  the  question  is in the  details.   When  we  set

control,  we  have  to  ask what standards  we  are  asking  the

Ministry  to enforce.  In this regard, I would like the Minister

to  clarify how Singapore's pollution control standards  measure

up  against  other  countries, and  particularly  the  developed

countries  and cities in these developed countries.  It  is  too

easy, I think, to look at developing countries to say that  they

are more polluted than us, and then to feel very self-satisfied.

As  we upgrade, for Singapore in the 21st century, we will  have

to  pitch  the quality of life that can compete with  the  best.

And  I  would ask the Ministry to constantly review and  upgrade

the standards when needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, in terms of standards, is the need for

best practices, given the limited space and a growing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>

population.  In other words, it is not just the standard we set,

but  the  practices and methods of production used by industries

and  by households, by all polluters or would-be polluters.  So,

in this era, where we are moving from low-end industries and de-emphasising  this  kind  of  production  to  the  upper  end  of

industries, such as chemical and pharmaceuticals, this can  also

be  a  source of pollution.  I would like the assurance  of  the

Minister that, together with the Economic Development Board  and

other  economic  agencies,  these questions  of  production  and

process are being thought of, even as we invite these industries

to  come  to  Singapore.   Because while  the  Bill  focuses  on

pollution control, that is, monitoring after the fact,  it  must

be  done in an investment friendly way.  This comes to my second

point, that of the approach of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, this Bill integrates, but we can question

whether  it goes far enough.  There may be on one hand too  much

details;  on another hand, there may be not enough breadth.   In

terms  of breadth, for example, while the greatest problem  that

Singapore has faced recurrently over the last decade is the haze

from Indonesia, this problem is of such a size that whatever  we

do  about  our  own vehicular emissions or bak kua  sellers,  or

whatever, these are dwarfed completely by the problem.   And  if

the Minister, I hope, recognises, this Bill does not go any step

towards helping us to deal with this problem, such as making the

Bill  apply  to  the act, and our regulations apply  to  whoever

pollutes our air, no matter where the pollution comes from.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other element in which this Bill may not go far enough

is  that  pollution control can sometimes be only an end-of-the-pipe  solution,  that  is, only after the pollution  is  already

generated, do we worry about where it is put.  There is a  need,

therefore, to control production processes further up the  chain

of  production.   There is a need to control use and  production

processes  and  to  integrate land use and planning.   Sustained

development  in  the  sense  requires much  more  inter-Ministry

coordination.  My understanding is that there is,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>

in   administrative   matters,  a  close  coordination   between

environmental  pollution  control under  the  Minister  and  his

Ministry and the land use planning authorities which fall  under

the  Ministry  of  National Development.  I would  ask  for  the

Minister's reassurance that this coordination will continue  and

in fact grow over the next decade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question in terms of approach relates to clauses

26 and 36 of the Bill.  Under these clauses, as the Minister has

said,   identified  persons  can  be  directed  to  assess   the

environmental pollution effects of their activities.  This is  a

welcome  step.   This takes us in a direction of  assessing  the

environmental  impact  of projects, or  what  is  known  as  EIA

(Environmental Impact Assessment).  However, while this  is  the

right  step,  my concern is that it does not go  far  enough  in

fostering transparency, public information and participation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trends in international environmental law and in

various  other documents from other countries suggest that  when

the public is informed, the public has access to information and

the  public participates, this helps both the polluter  and  the

public.   The public feels more ownership over the problem,  can

propose  solutions,  and the polluter feels  more  strongly  the

genuine  community  involvement in  asking  him  to  conform  to

certain standards.  The Bill, as it is drafted, leaves it  still

very  much  to  the Government to bring down the  stick  on  the

polluter.    And  it  does  not  actually  help   in   fostering

understanding among the public or a willing compliance from  the

producer.  I think that if we move towards greater transparency,

public  information and participation, Singapore  citizens  will

more  greatly  appreciate the hard work and the  very  necessary

work that the Ministry is doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question in terms of approach is that the Bill,

except for clause 37, still emphasises command and control, that

is, after a certain standard is set, inspectors and other people

must be deputised to make sure they are being met.  Clause 37 is

an exception because it emphasises the need for self-monitoring.

I think that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>

command  and  control methods are expensive  and  not  the  best

practice.  We need to re-emphasise self-monitoring and  we  need

schemes  for companies to find it in their interest to bring  in

the  right technology and consultants, if necessary, to  improve

their  processes  for both better environmental  protection  and

better efficiency.  This is not therefore necessarily a negative

game  where the Ministry punishes and the producers suffer.   Or

if  not, then the producers pollute and the people suffer.  This

can  be made into a positive game in which companies prosper and

the people are spared pollution.  But for this game to be put in

a  win-win  situation,  there needs to be  greater  emphasis  on

technology  and  consultancy.  There are some  existing  schemes

under  the Ministry.  I would urge the Ministry to review  these

schemes   and,  if  necessary,  to  ask  for  greater  financial

incentives  to  be  put  to  this  good  use.   These  financial

incentives I realise might not be under the Minister  but  under

his colleague, the Minister for Finance, or MTI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to specifics of the Bill. Clause 15

of  the  Bill  controls  trade  effluents.   I  would  like  the

Minister's clarification whether this relates only to industrial

or whether it extends to non-industrial activity.  Particularly,

I would like the Minister to answer whether this would cover run-off  problems  of fertilizers and pesticides from  land.   I  am

thinking particularly of the special problem posed by the  heavy

rain, given our climate in Singapore, on golf courses which  use

chemical  fertilizers and pesticides very near to the  catchment

areas  and reservoirs.  Additionally, in terms of that provision

of  water pollution, I would like the Minister to reconsider the

penalties presently imposed on trade effluents.  These are  set,

I  believe, at $5,000.  I think that trade effluent problems are

often infringed and $5,000 may be too low.  This is particularly

so given the importance of potable water in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as regards to clause 18, I commend the Bill in

wanting to make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>

sure  that  the power always exists for the Director to  require

the   removal  and  clean  up  of  toxic  substances  or   other

pollutants.  I want to ask the Minister, however, of  the  scope

of  this clause.  Because it seems to me the clause can be  read

quite sweepingly.  There is in America a very controversial  law

called the Superfund.  This requires polluters to clean up after

the fact, that is to say, what they did was not a problem at the

time  they  did  it.  But subsequently when standards  had  been

raised, they had to come back and clean up and to bear the costs

of  the clean up which were not factored into their equations of

production.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that clause 18 could be read in such a way

that where present regulations do not set standards or standards

are  relatively low, clause 18 might actually allow the Director

to  go back and require the producer or occupier of that land to

clean  up  to  a  new  and higher standard and  impose  cost  on

production, post facto.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clause 20 of the Bill, it is quite similar.

This relates to land pollution.  Some Members might recall there

have  been  some controversies in the past about land pollution.

This relates mainly to disused petrol station or chemical plants

or  other store houses of this kind of substances.  There was  a

perceived  gap  in legislation in the sense that the  pollutants

that  went into the land were not necessarily infringing so long

as they did not then impact on water or other areas.  Given this

gap,  clause  20  promises that there will be  new  regulations.

However,  if we read clause 20, it is really just an  indication

that  the Minister will make regulations.  There are no details.

I  would  like to ask the Minister whether he is able  to  share

with  us  some  idea of the details to forecast, for  both  land

users  as well as banks who hold mortgages over this land, their

possible liabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do support this Bill. An earlier Member, I think it

was Mr Heng, suggested that this Bill should be sent to a Select

Committee.   I do not share that view.  I believe this  Bill  is

largely   well-drafted  and  I  have,  from  past  acquaintance,

confidence the regulations of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>

Ministry  have been generally well-balanced.  But I  would  urge

the  Minister to consider, as Mr Heng also said, that the  devil

is  in the details.  And as such, when the regulations come  out

and  specific incidents come out, I would urge the  Ministry  to

consider having a much greater public access and a dialogue over

these  specific regulations and incidences, rather than  have  a

Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, let me first start by thanking all

Members  who have spoken and very strongly supported  the  Bill.

Let me first reply to Mr Heng Chiang Meng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng has asked that in tackling the pollution problem,

we  should  start at source, and one good way  is  to  start  by

educating the young and having the adults set the example.  Sir,

I  totally  agree with him, which is why we have a  very  active

programme of involving the schools in environmental issues.   In

fact,  many of the schools now have environmental clubs  and  we

will continue to encourage those which do not have such clubs to

form them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has commented that the Bill sounds like a

punishment  Bill.   The  Bill stipulates  what  the  owners  and

occupiers must do, but it does not really provide any incentives

to  help  them comply with the requirements. Sir, he  is  right.

This  is a Bill to control pollution, which is why it stipulates

all  the requirements, in terms of pollution control.  There are

incentives.    But  the  incentives  are  contained   in   other

legislation and I will go into them afterwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng asked that we should differentiate the punishments

because  the range of polluters is so huge and the circumstances

of  the pollution are also very varied.  Sir, indeed, we will do

that.   The  law stipulates the maximum in which the  punishment

can be levied.  But in levying the punishment, we will take into

consideration the circumstances and the sort of polluter.   This

is something which has been in practice and will continue.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked why the Bill did not include specifically

things  like  motor  vehicles since  the  pollution  from  motor

vehicles is quite significant.  Sir, in drafting the clause,  we

opted  to  give  a broader description.  It is  not  just  motor

vehicles because down the road, there could be other sources  of

pollution  which we will be looking at.  This description  gives

us  maximum flexibility.  But in ensuring that the message  goes

through  very  clearly, I have spent quite some time  describing

why  diesel  particulates are dangerous to health, and  this  is

going to be one of the key points that we are going to focus  on

in terms of pollution control on motor vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked whether the Bill applies to sea pollution.

Sir,  the Bill applies to pollutants discharged into drains  and

the  definition of "drains" would be watercourses and rivers  as

well  as the sea shore, in essence.  So land-based discharge  of

pollutants  into the watercourses that end up in the  sea  would

still  be  caught within the ambit of this Bill.  But  pollution

from  ships  is not covered by this Bill.  Pollution from  ships

would  be covered under another Act, which is the Prevention  of

Pollution  of the Sea Act and this is administered and  enforced

by MPA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng talked about noise pollution. Again, because of

the varying circumstances and locations where noise pollution is

emitted, there should be a varying standard applicable  to  each

situation.   Sir,  indeed that is the case.  We  have  different

permissible noise levels for different locations.  For  example,

areas near to the homes for the aged and hospitals would have  a

much  lower  permissible noise level than, for example,  a  site

that is in the middle of nowhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng also expressed concern that since there is a

provision  that  is  very much akin to the environmental  impact

assessment  study requirement, the power to order  the  carrying

out of such a study should be vested in the Minister rather than

the  Director.   Sir,  there  is no need  for  that  stipulation

because  even when the Director makes an important  order,  that

order  normally would have to be cleared by the Minister  before

it is finally issued.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about punishment for persons or companies

that  submit  fraudulent data.  Yes, we have the self-monitoring

equipment  and  we  are supposed to check.   What  is  there  to

prevent  the  companies from tinkering with the  data  and  then

submitting  false  data?   Sir, the companies  are  required  to

submit  the  data  from  the self-monitoring  equipment  to  the

Ministry  for certain operating periods.  If they go and  doctor

those  data,  they will be guilty of committing a crime  and  we

would definitely take action against them.  I must say that,  so

far,  my  Ministry  has  not encountered any  company  that  has

submitted doctored data to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng talked about noise and he made three

points  that  for  work sites near homes,  the  work  should  be

constrained after 8.00 pm and that after 8.00 pm, no work  which

emits loud noise should be allowed.  Sir, in fact, we do have  a

requirement that after 7.00 pm, the noise level from work  sites

would have to be greatly reduced.  So, in fact, we have gone one

step further than what Mr Ang has asked for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked that the noise be measured at an

appropriate  level rather than just on the ground  level  as  in

certain circumstances, the ground floor may be fairly quiet, but

if  you  go to the upper floors, it may be very noisy.   Sir,  I

take his point and I will ask my officers to look into that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked that since most work sites will have a

safety  officer, we should perhaps make the safety officer  also

responsible  for looking into the noise level emitted  from  the

work site.  Sir, my Ministry is now looking into the concept  of

an  environmental control officer.  We should look into  various

environmental aspects relating to work sites, such  as  breeding

of mosquitoes.  I will ask my officers to see whether one of the

duties could also be to monitor the noise level.  But we want to

be  careful  not to overburden the construction sites  with  all

kinds of requirements.  The thinking is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>

that,  at the present moment, the environmental control  officer

can also double up as a safety officer.  Therefore, it is not  a

requirement for an additional person to be employed  but  really

to broaden the role of the safety officer who is already working

there.  We will look into his suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has cautioned against exempting the

Director   from  personal  liability  and  with  this  exemption

provision, it may encourage the Director to make a wrong or easy

decision  at the expense of the company.  Sir, I can assure  him

that,  with  or  without  the  exemption  provision,  Government

officials  take  their job very seriously and they  always  make

decisions  in  good faith.  The Environmental Pollution  Control

Bill  has got very broad and serious implications.  I can assure

him  that the Director is definitely a person who would take his

job  very seriously and would ensure that the decisions are made

in a very balanced manner.  The first priority must be of course

to  safeguard the health and safety of Singaporeans.  It may  be

an  expensive  control measure, but if the  pollutant  is  death

threatening, we cannot take the easy way out and say, "Well, let

us  use  a cheaper equipment and let them pollute the air."   We

will  always  have to make sure that the first  priority  is  to

safeguard  the  health  of our people and  to  ensure  that  the

standards are reasonable standards.  We should not go for  ideal

standards  which  will of course require very heavy  investment,

much heavier than is necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I want to tie this in to what Mr Simon Tay has asked on

what  sort  of  standards  we are  using.   We  are  basing  our

standards on those of the developed countries.  For example, for

air   quality,   our   basic  standard  is  the   World   Health

Organisation's  long-term goals for air quality.   Many  of  the

developing  countries are not close to that  yet,  but  we  have

already  adopted  that  standard as our standard,  and  this  is

supplemented by the US Environmental Protection Agency's primary

air   quality   standards  as  well.    In   fact,   these   are

well-researched  standards of a very high level  but  attainable

level, and we have adopted this as our standard.  I may as  well

answer the rest of the questions on this issue.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For trade effluent, we use the standards of countries such

as  Australia,  New  Zealand, Japan, the  USA  and  Europe.   In

ensuring  that  these  standards are achievable,  we  have  also

looked at the ability to comply with these standards, what  sort

of  investment is needed, and our assessment has been that these

standards   are   reasonable  and  the   investments   are   not

overwhelming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low has asked whether the burning of wood is covered

under  the Bill.  Yes, the burning of wood is covered in  clause

14  of the Bill.  He has gone on to ask about the transportation

and   storage  of  toxic  and  polluting  substances   and   who

determines.   What system do we use?  The procedure  is  a  very

well-established one.  When a company applies for permission  to

handle,  store, or sell hazardous substances, we will first  ask

them  for  their proposal, which should include storage  system,

handling   system,  pollution  control  system  if  an  accident

happens,  and based on their proposal, we will then review.   If

their proposal is a very rational one, we would be very happy to

accept  their  proposal.  It is not our  purpose  to  run  their

business  for them.  Our interest is to ensure that the  systems

are  in  place and the systems are reasonable and that they  are

well   structured  technically  and  capable  of   coping   with

accidents.   So  we leave it to them.  But if we find  that  the

proposal  is far below the minimum standards, then the  Director

would   have   to   impose  certain  requirements,   and   these

requirements would not be something which is taken out from  the

air  because  much  of  the  business is  already  available  in

Singapore  and  therefore we can use the current  practices  and

equipment as a standard for the new company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked about cleaning up. If there is a discharge of

pollutants, then who bears the cost of the clean up? I think  it

is  quite  clear.  He who pollutes must pay.  The  company  that

discharges  the  pollutants must pay for the  clean  up.   Quite

often,  time  is of essence and the Ministry may  then  have  to

arrange for the clean-up straightaway, in which case the cost of

the clean up is then charged to the company.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low asked about smell pollution and he said that the

Bill  does  not seem to address odours.  Odours are catered  for

under  the Environmental Public Health Act and it has been quite

adequate.  He gave the example of Beecham, a factory in the Boon

Lay  area,  that used to emit very strong smell.   Arising  from

feedback from the residents and people passing by, officers from

ENV went to the factory involved and worked with the factory  to

address the sources of that smell and how to control it.   I  am

glad  to  say that if he drives past that area today, I  do  not

think he will have that problem anymore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about people who trade in hazardous

substances  and who are collecting such waste and  whether  such

persons must have adequate treatment facilities before a licence

is  issued.   For companies or persons who wish to go  into  the

business of collecting hazardous waste, we will require them  to

have the necessary treatment facilities.  He brought up the case

of  a  company who collected waste wood and had a  big  pile  of

waste  wood  which was subsequently burnt.  Sir, he  was  not  a

hazardous  waste  collector. He was a waste  wood  recycler  and

therefore  the  circumstances were quite different.   He  had  a

recycling  facility except I do not think he  ran  his  facility

very  well and because of that, he had some problems and a  fire

broke  out.   The Government put out the fire and  the  cost  of

putting out the fire and the clean up was indeed charged to  the

company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also talked about the use of CFC 11 and CFC 113.

CFC  11  has  been prohibited in Singapore and is  therefore  no

longer  used  today in the production of styrofoam.   I  believe

they use another gas which is approved.  As to the import of CFC

113, it has been banned since January 1996.  However, under  the

Montreal Protocol, remnant stocks are allowed to be used up.  So

what  you  see  in Singapore that is being used are  really  the

remnant stocks which would be used up in the near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked how the qualified persons and registered inspectors

are chosen.  My Ministry conducts training courses on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>

how   to   vet  plans  and  do  site  inspections,   and   those

professionals,  architects and engineers who have  gone  through

that  training  course  would  then  qualify  to  be  registered

inspector.   And we are looking into how to increase the  number

of  training  programmes  so that we can  enlarge  the  pool  of

registered inspectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan is worried that with this Bill, the

Ministry  will nitpick and enforce in a very tough manner.   Let

me  first explain that this Bill is not a totally new Bill.   It

is  a  compilation  of parts from different  existing  Acts  and

compiled  into  one  Bill that handles the  entire  spectrum  of

pollution.    Many   of  the  clauses  are  therefore   existing

provisions  and  already operational.  Some of  them  have  been

operational  since 1971, so they are well-tried and well-proven.

The  few clauses which are new are actually provisions which are

already   operational   also   but   they   are   carried    out

administratively.  What we have done is to now formalise this by

converting  those administrative requirements into law.   I  can

assure  Mr Tay that the enactment of this Bill will not  in  any

way change the administration of pollution control in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he went on quite a fair bit about bak kua and asked

why  has ENV proceeded to ban the outdoor barbecuing of bak kua,

especially during the Chinese New Year season.  Sir, this  issue

is   one  which  we  have  been  discussing  with  the  bak  kua

manufacturers for some time already.  In fact, I think as  early

as about 1 1/2 years ago, they were pre-alerted, and about a year

ago,  after  the  last Chinese New Year, we  proceeded  to  hold

fairly  detailed  discussions with  the  bak  kua  operators  to

explain to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbecuing of bak kua on street pavements has been in place

for a long time, as Mr Tay has mentioned.  And every Chinese New

Year,   you  see  them  sprouting  around  all  over  Singapore,

Chinatown  and elsewhere.  These street and pavement stalls  are

not  licensed  and  they  are not housed  in  licensed  premises

either.   They  spring  up, operate for a  few  weeks  and  they

disappear and we are not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>

even  sure where they obtain their raw meat and meat patty from.

And  this  is  the problem.  It is not the smoke pollution.   In

fact,  in announcing this move, ENV had made sure that both  the

Chinese  press and the English press and the other media carried

the  explanation  quite  clearly that it  was  a  public  health

concern,  not  smoke.  If it is smoke, that  is  really  not  an

issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of hygiene at these makeshift stalls can lead to

serious outbreaks of food borne diseases, not unlike those  that

had  been experienced recently in some other countries.  I  will

give  you  some examples.  The recent outbreak of Avian  flu  in

Hongkong  resulted  in  six deaths and the  E-coli  outbreak  in

Japan,  well-known for very clean food conditions, it broke  out

very quickly, killed seven people before it stopped.  These  are

very recent examples of how such food borne diseases can quickly

appear  from  nowhere and then pose a tremendous danger  to  the

population.   As far as bak kua is concerned, there  are  proper

places  for the food to be produced and bought and, in fact,  if

you walk down Chinatown, one would see many bak kua stalls.  The

key thing is that because the shops and stalls are licensed, the

public  can  be  assured of the proper food standards.   We  are

dealing with a genuine public health concern and I think  it  is

best that we stick to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also talked about the need not to break traditions. Sir,

I  agree  with him.  We would also like to keep as many  of  our

traditions  as  possible, but we think that we have  to  realise

that  over time, some of the traditional practices may  have  to

change,  for good reasons, and we should not change them  unless

there  are  good  reasons.   Firecrackers  were  a  very  strong

traditional  practice.   I  remember growing  up  where,  during

Chinese   New   Year's   eve,  we  were  playing   around   with

firecrackers, half the night not being able to sleep but I still

enjoyed it.  But we still had to intervene because there  was  a

public  health concern.  In the case of bak kua, I do not  think

having  that  stall  there is a tradition.  Eating  bak  kua,  I

believe,  for  some people is very important, and  we  have  not

stopped this.  You can still buy bak kua freely in Chinatown and

in many of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>

supermarkets.  I can assure Members that it is not our intention

to stop the production and sale of bak kua.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay talked about standards and I have already

replied  to him.  Next, he went on to talk about best  practices

and methods of production.  I want to assure him that we do work

closely  with EDB and with the other Ministries and agencies  to

ensure  that  whatever  we do, we are able  to  adopt  the  best

practices available, but it must be a best practice that is also

economical.  We do not believe in going for the ideal  approach,

because  I  think that would totally make us uncompetitive.    I

agree with him that we must be investment friendly while at  the

same time safeguarding our environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also talked about the breadth of legislation and that we

do  not  go far enough in tackling pollution from abroad.   This

topic  has  cropped up periodically and I think we  have  to  be

realistic.  There is really no meaning to having a provision  in

our legislation which we cannot enforce.  And if it is pollution

from a neigbouring country, it is very difficult for us to go to

that neighbouring country and enforce our law if they themselves

are unable to enforce their own laws.  So, I think we have to be

realistic and tackle this problem from another angle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he said that we should not impose controls after the

fact,  ie,  having the self-monitoring devices is good  but  the

pollution is already there.  It is after the fact, and  that  we

should do it before the fact.  We actually do that.  Whenever  a

project  proposal  is  received  by  the  EDB  and  the  various

Government departments that has a pollution element in it,  that

project is referred to us and we will work with the company very

early  in  the  project planning stage to make  sure  that  they

understand  what are our requirements and that they  build  that

capability to achieve our requirements into the process, because

that is the most cost effective way.  So our requirements become

an  integral part of their routine production process, which  is

why  despite our very high requirements, I think no company  has

come back to tell us that our standards are not achievable.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked that we assure him that the inter-Ministry coordination work continues. Sir, that has been an

ongoing   process.    There   is   very   close   inter-Ministry

coordination and we will continue with that, both  in  terms  of

pollution  control  and  land use.   Whenever  the  Master  Plan

Committee reviews the Master Plan, ENV is involved, as are  many

other Government agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about clauses 26 and 36 and that these are akin

to  the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and that we should

get  public involvement in them.  At this point, I think  it  is

useful to explain the whole process.  We have to start from  the

Master  Plan  stage.   In drawing up the Master  Plan,  the  URA

already got all the inputs from both the Government agencies  as

well  as  members of the public, because the URA would  normally

proceed  to hold public dialogues when they release their  draft

development  guide  plans and the Master  Plan.   So  the  macro

planning is the key point where all inputs are taken in, as well

as from members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time when a specific project proposal is received,

we  are not really looking at the macro issues any more.  We are

really  looking  at the micro issues, what sort  of  pollutants,

what  sort of process, what is the level of pollution, what  are

our  standards.   These are highly technical issues.   We  have,

over  the years, built up a tremendous pool of expertise in  the

Government departments and where the expertise is still lacking,

because  maybe it is a new pollutant, for example, then what  we

do  is  that  we  will  take in technical  experts  from  either

Singapore or from abroad to advise us.  So by the time ENV  gets

involved  in  these  issues, these are highly  technical  issues

rather  than a systemic broad-based type of issue,  and  we  are

very focused in dealing with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about clause 37, on self-monitoring equipment,

and  that we should help companies to upgrade by providing  some

incentives.   The  incentives are there.  Mr  Heng  Chiang  Meng

mentioned that too.  Let me explain very briefly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ISO 14001, for example, we already have a scheme which

is  administered  by the Productivity and Standards  Board  that

offers  financial  grants  of up to  70%  of  the  cost  of  the

consultancy, subject to a maximum of $40,000.  And an additional

grant  of  50%  of  the  one-time cost for obtaining  ISO  14001

certification.  My Ministry itself administers a  scheme  called

the  Accelerated  Depreciation  Allowance  Scheme  to  encourage

companies  to use not just energy efficient equipment  but  also

more  efficient pollution control equipment.  So this scheme  is

already in place.  There are various schemes which are available

and those in the industry are quite familiar with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about clause 15 and whether it applies to

industrial  and non-industrial land and whether it also  applies

to  fertilisers.  I believe the clause does apply to other  than

industrial land.  On the issue of fertilisers, definitely,  yes,

we  do  control the use of fertilisers.  We make sure  that  our

water  catchment  areas and the land around the  reservoirs  use

fertilisers  which  are approved by both ENV  and  PUB,  because

ultimately  PUB  is the agency responsible for safeguarding  the

quality of our water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned that the figure of $5,000 is not adequate. I

have  looked  at the clause that he mentioned.  The $5,000  fine

refers to people who failed to inform ENV about the incidence of

pollution.   It  is not for the act of polluting,  but  for  not

informing  us.  Yes, I am correct.  It says, "shall  immediately

inform" and if he does not immediately inform, there is  a  fine

of $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pollution to inland waters, the maximum fine, as I

mentioned  in  my  Second Reading speech, is actually  $100,000.

This  is  a  large  sum because we need to safeguard  our  water

supplies..

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I missed out an important point made by Mr

Heng  Chiang Meng, ie, to refer the Bill to a Select  Committee.

I   understand  Mr  Heng's  concerns  because  the  passing   of

environmental   control  Bills  would  be  momentous   in   most

countries,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>

except  that  in  Singapore  we  are  actually  ahead  of   most

countries.   We  started on environmental  controls  many,  many

years  ago  and  therefore this Bill is not  a  brand  new  Bill

containing  brand new provisions.  Many of the  provisions  here

are  provisions  which have been in existence for  25-30  years.

Therefore, there is no need for us to send this Bill to a Select

Committee.  However, from time to time, we do get feedback  from

either  the  industry or the public or from  interested  parties

with  suggestions and proposals.  And where those  feedback  are

valid,  we  normally do note them and we would not  hesitate  to

include  them  in  future  amendments  to  the  Bill  when   the

opportunity arises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered most of the points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, the Minister in his reply, when I

asked for different permissible noise measurements for different

situations, said that they are already doing that.  I would like

to  ask him why his Ministry allows the (bang) drop hammer  type

of  piling to be used for sites next to occupied houses as  well

as  for sites next to isolated areas.  Sir, I made that noise to

show that in this Chamber, such a noise is very loud.  But if  I

make  the same noise in the middle of the road outside, I assure

you that nobody will notice it at all, because the general noise

level is much louder than probably the noise I made just now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not understand why, for example, 75 dba is

allowed  for construction sites next to occupied houses as  well

as  construction sites in isolated areas.  Using the drop hammer

method  of piling, the same noise level is created.  To somebody

who  is  living next door, the noise level would be  high.   The

effect  would be different for a site further away.   I  see  no

reason  why the noise level for the site next to occupied houses

cannot  be made much lower so that they cannot use this  method.

There  are less noisy methods of piling.  This is why I  do  not

think that presently the Environment Ministry enforces different

measurements   for  different  permissible  noise   levels   for

different situations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I raised the question of clauses 18 and

20  in  combination.  Clause 20 recognises  a  gap  in  the  law

regarding  control  of land pollution and these  have  not  been

addressed in the present Bill except to say that there  will  be

regulations.   Clause  18,  I  suggested,  was  quite   sweeping

potentially.   I  would ask the Minister if  he  would  like  to

clarify these points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Mr Heng has hit the right point. I

agree  with him that whilst we have standards in terms of  noise

levels  -  these  are  technical  standards  -  there  are  some

shortcomings which we will need to address.  The noise standards

refer  to  average sound levels over a certain number of  hours,

together with certain 5-minute peaks.  The sound we heard  is  a

very instantaneous noise and therefore when you average out over

five  minutes, and worse over several hours, that sound  escapes

the  standard.  I have pointed it out to my officials  and  they

are looking into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must apologise that I was too busy reading the Bill when

Mr  Tay  was  making his speech and I must have missed  the  two

points  that he raised.  First, on clause 20 which is the clause

governing the remediation of contaminated land.  This is  a  new

clause.  Sir, could he repeat his point on clause 20?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> This is a new area of legislation where we

are  only saying that we will have regulations to be made.  Read

in  combination with clause 18 it suggests that the Director can

order a clean up.  My question to the Minister is whether,  read

in  combination, this might mean actually the power to clean  up

post facto, ie, where no standards existed before, or relatively

low  standards  existed,  we  impose  new  standards  or  higher

standards,  we  can  retrospectively ask the landowners  or  the

occupiers of the land to clean up to the higher standard and  to

meet the cost.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the intention is to apply clause 20

to  industrial land which is being rezoned for other  uses.   So

when  the  landowner is seeking to rezone, the application  must

also  involve the Ministry of the Environment and we would  then

be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>

able  to  inspect  and require the landowner  to  carry  out  an

assessment  of  the state of the land.  If the assessment  shows

that  certain parts of the land have been contaminated,  we  can

require that either the owner or the occupier would have to make

good that land before approval for converting that land to other

use is allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether clause 18 is meant to create a Superfund.

Sir,  it  is  not  the  intention  for clause  18  to  become  a

Superfund.  The clause does not provide for the setting up of  a

fund  to  deal with contaminated sites.  Clause 18 empowers  the

Ministry  of  the  Environment to require  any  person  who  has

discharged  or caused or permitted to be discharged  or  spilled

any toxic substance or any other polluting matters onto any land

or into any drain or sea for such persons to remove and clean up

such substances within a specified time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the Member some background. From time to time,

the  Ministry of the Environment encounters contaminated  sites,

drains, etc., where we really cannot pinpoint exactly who is the

polluter.   To  do  that, we need to be  on  hand  to  spot  him

discharging the pollutant.  We now have that presumption  clause

that  unless you can prove otherwise, because this is your site,

you  shall  be  responsible for the clean up.   So  this  clause

allows  us  to  do  that.  We do not just presume  but  we  also

require them to clean up the site.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I just ask one further clarification?

Does  it  mean  that the Ministry does not intend to  use  these

powers retrospectively to meet new standards?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we will apply the standards of the

day.   For  example,  if  in two years' time,  a  factory  owner

applies  to  convert  his  site into a  recreational  site,  the

standards of the day must then apply.  It cannot be the standard

when he first bought the site.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Water Pollution Control and Drainage Act (WPCDA)

has  provisions  for effectual drainage of inland  areas,  water

pollution  control  and  the  proper collection,  treatment  and

disposal  of  sewage.   Provisions  for  the  control  of  water

pollution  have been incorporated in the Environmental Pollution

Control Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sewerage and Drainage Bill seeks to, firstly, incorporate

updated  and  strengthened provisions on sewerage  and  drainage

matters   from  the  WPCDA;  and  secondly,  to  introduce   new

provisions for better management and maintenance of sewerage and

land drainage systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will repeal the Water Pollution Control and

Drainage Act (Chapter 348).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is one of the few countries that

provides their entire population with modern sanitation.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>

have  an  elaborate system of sewers transporting wastewater  to

several  treatment  works.  The works treat  the  wastewater  to

internationally-accepted standards before the final effluent  is

discharged  into  the sea.  We are therefore able  to  keep  our

water resources clean and free of contamination.  The result  is

that  Singaporeans  now enjoy a high standard  of  environmental

public health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, my Ministry is responsible for

constructing and maintaining an elaborate network of drains that

collect  and convey rainwater quickly to the sea and reservoirs.

As a result, we have eradicated floods from Singapore except for

a  few small low-lying areas.  These areas may still flood  when

very heavy rains coincide with high tides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sewerage and most drainage infrastructure are buried

underground  or  kept well-blended into the surroundings.   They

are  often not noticed but instead taken for granted.  But  they

play  an  important part in keeping Singapore clean and free  of

infectious diseases.  The existing Act provides my Ministry with

the  necessary  powers to put the elaborate  infrastructures  in

place, maintain, operate and improve them when necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sewerage and Drainage Bill (S&DB) will consist mainly of

provisions   from  its  predecessor.   It  will   regulate   the

construction,  maintenance and improvement of  sewerage  systems

and  land  drainage systems, the discharge of sewage  and  trade

effluent  and other related matters.  New powers are  introduced

to  prevent  damage  to or interference with  our  sewerage  and

drainage  systems and to provide for requirements now  specified

under some other Act, for example, the Building Control Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the major new provisions that are

being introduced in the Bill.

<br><br><i>Sewerage (Part III)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III of the Bill relates to ENV's powers to construct,

maintain, improve and control sewerage systems.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 empowers ENV to lay pipes in, under or over any

premises,  street  or building.  ENV can require  the  owner  or

supplier  of  any  gas, electricity, water or  telecommunication

services to divert or remove their wire, cable, duct, structure,

etc,  in  the way of any public sewerage system.  ENV  can  also

require  the  owners or occupiers of premises to remove  similar

obstructions.   The  cost  and  expenses  of  such  removal  and

diversion  will  be borne by the Government.   The  clause  will

facilitate the construction of deep tunnel sewers and allow  ENV

to  serve notices on owners and suppliers of utilities which are

now private companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 12 and 15 require any person who intends to

construct  or alter any sewerage system or sanitary  facilities,

or  erect building or structure over, across or adjacent to  any

sewer,  to obtain a clearance certificate or approval  from  the

Ministry.  If he fails to do so, the Ministry may require him to

demolish the sewerage system or building, or reinstate the sewer

as the case may be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 empowers ENV to enter upon any premises to

inspect  any  sewerage system and open the ground if  necessary.

Full  compensation will be made for any damage done due to  such

inspection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 19, it will be an offence for any person to

discharge  any sewage, waste matter or effluent into any  public

sewer  improperly  or  without  the  written  approval  of   the

Ministry.   In particular, this will deter the illegal discharge

of  waste  matter  into the sewers, eg, from  tankers  of  waste

collectors,  by  simply  opening  a  manhole  or  an  inspection

chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 disallows the disposal of any matter or substance that

is  likely  to damage the sewer, including sand, earth,  cement,

brick, wood, and others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 21, it will be an offence for any person to damage

any public sewer or do any act to render any public sewer to  be

dangerous or injurious to health or cause a nuisance.   This  is

to  ensure that due diligence is exercised when working close to

sewers, eg, in construction works.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clauses enable ENV to safeguard the integrity of the

sewerage  system  and  ensure that it  is  maintained  well  and

functioning properly.

<br><br><i>Drainage (Part IV)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill relates to ENV's powers to construct,

maintain and improve drainage systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 24 and 25 require any person who intends to

construct,  alter  or carry out works that affect  any  drainage

system  to obtain a clearance certificate or approval  from  the

Ministry.  If he fails to do so, the Ministry may require him to

demolish  or  make  good  the drainage system  to  its  original

condition  or  carry  out such work as may be  necessary.   This

permits  ENV  to  ensure that drains are properly  designed  and

constructed and obstructions to smooth flows are removed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 31, it will be an offence to cause any damage

to  any  drainage  system.  Again, this  will  ensure  that  due

diligence  is  taken  when working close to drains,  eg,  during

construction works.

<br><br><i>Registration, Codes of Practice and Certificate or Approval for Works (Part VI)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, ENV checks plans and approves construction

proposals using powers under the Building Control Act.  Part  VI

of  the  S&D  Bill  regulates works affecting the  sewerage  and

drainage   systems.   Clause  33  empowers  ENV   to   establish

specifications  for both sewerage and drainage works  and  issue

codes  of  practice for professionals engaged in the design  and

construction of such works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 states that a clearance certificate or approval

is  required  for  any  sewerage or drainage  work.   Clause  35

specifies  that  any work that requires a clearance  certificate

shall  not  be  carried out, except under the supervision  of  a

qualified person.  Clause 36 spells out the responsibilities  of

the  qualified person for the proper construction and inspection

of the work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clauses are similar to provisions in the Building

Control Act, under which these requirements are currently  being

carried out.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Enforcement (Part VII)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 39, 40 and 41 give authorised officers powers of

investigation  and  arrest.  Clauses 45 and 46  give  authorised

officers power of entry.  These again are similar to the  powers

in  the EPC Bill and facilitate ENV in investigating into  cases

of infringements against the provisions of the Bill.

<br><br><i>Miscellaneous Provisions (Part IX)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 71 provides for offences under the Bill to be

compounded for a sum not exceeding $5,000.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will enable my Ministry to provide efficient

and effective sewerage and drainage systems, and safeguard their

integrity once constructed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Water Pollution Control and Drainage Act (Chapter 348)

will be repealed with the enactment of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a young boy, my

mother  used  to encourage me to be diligent in  my  studies  by

threatening  me with a fate worse than death; that, otherwise  I

will  grow  up to be a nightsoil carrier.  In those days,  there

were still many, many homes with the manual bucket system served

by  nightsoil  carriers, and being one probably meant  that  you

were at the lowest rung of the social and job ladder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily for me, her tactics worked. On the other hand,

luckily for Singapore, she was not entirely right in her opinion

of  the  low social status of a career in wastewater management.

Otherwise,  we  would  not  be  at  where  we  are  today;  with

Singaporeans  having modern sanitary facilities in  their  homes

and   workplaces,  a  system  of  well-designed   and   well-run

wastewater  treatment facilities and even  now  planning  beyond

this to a future of deep tunnel sewerage systems.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1950s, only buildings in parts of the city and

eastern  Singapore enjoyed water borne removal of  human  wastes

through  sewers.   The  greater part of the  country  was  still

served  by  the  manual bucket system.  The transformation  from

that  scenario to where we are today is no small feat.  It could

only be possible with the entry and retention of top brains  and

good people in the industry and the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that, we have to thank the people in the Ministry of the

Environment.  They have done a good job and we should appreciate

what they have done for us.  For those who do not, I suggest you

visit  the toilets in the rural areas of some countries  in  the

region.   You  will then have a good idea of  what  going  to  a

toilet for most Singaporeans was like in the fifties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have, of course, changed for the better. We are now more

demanding  in  matters  of health, especially  those  of  public

health.   Rightly so, Sir, and that is why this Bill  should  be

supported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to ensure that Singaporeans are entitled to

modern  sanitary  facilities  with  the  appropriate  wastewater

treatment facilities in such a manner that the moment  we  flush

our  toilets, all things are taken care of.  Except, of  course,

when  the  toilet bowl is choked; but then, that is a  different

story.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is exciting, both in the boldness and the scale of the

concept,  and the proposal, is what the Ministry intends  to  do

with  the  Deep Tunnel Sewerage Scheme.  The benefits from  this

scheme are many.  With this scheme, in which the collection  and

treatment of wastewater will be deep under ground, air pollution

and  health  risks will be minimised.  Land currently  used  for

wastewater  treatment plants, including the buffer zones,  could

be  released  for other types of development.   I  am  sure  the

Minister for National Development will be happy with that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the freeing of such land for residential and other clean

uses, we can expect that residents living near such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>

treatment  plants will be overjoyed.  Not only would  they  lose

the  privilege of having their noses assaulted by the foul smell

-  my  apologies to Professor Low - emanating from the treatment

plants;  but  they can also look forward to an increase  in  the

value of their properties.  The Government, too, will benefit by

having more land for other uses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think that the Ministry should also use the

opportunity  of  the  DTSS  (Deep  Tunnel  Sewerage  Scheme)  to

separate   domestic   wastewater  from  industrial   wastewater.

Because  domestic wastewater is free of heavy  metal  and  other

toxins,  it  is  cheaper to treat domestic wastewater  for  more

extensive recycling than what we are doing now.  If we  consider

the  amount  of water that is used in flushing, the recovery  of

water from this source is not something to be sniffed at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister had explained, clause 5(2)(b) which empowers the

Director  to  tunnel  or  bore under  any  premises,  street  or

building, taken together with clause 5(5), will pave the way for

the   scheme.   I  envisage  that  when  the  scheme   commences

construction,  there will be inconveniences  created  for  some.

Sir,  for the sake of a better system for all, I would urge  all

those affected to bear with such inconveniences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, I think the DTSS is a win-win solution to the

management of waste water treatment for the Government  as  well

as for the people.  However, I understand that the total cost of

the scheme may be in the region of about $6-$7 billion.  I would

like to hear the Government issuing a categorical statement like

what  it  did for the construction of the MRT - that such  costs

will be considered as infrastructural costs and eventual charges

to  consumers will be based on recovery of operating costs,  not

total costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also glad to see the inclusion of clause 5(7)

under which compensation is paid to those adversely affected  by

the construction and the maintenance of public sewerage systems.

Sir,  it is better than asking aggrieved parties to seek redress

under civil law.  However, I do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>

see  the need to resort immediately to the courts in case  of  a

dispute, as provided under clause 49.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must remember that the Government is a huge machinery

and  going  to  court  may  be  a matter  of  routine  for  many

Ministries.   On  the  other hand, those  affected  may  be  the

average Singaporean with a property which happens to lie in  the

path  of  the construction and/or maintenance of public sewerage

systems.  Sir, if he disputes the compensation amount, to expect

him  to resort immediately to the courts may be too much to  ask

for.   He  may not have the financial means to do so.  Moreover,

resorting  to the courts is still quite foreign to  the  average

Singaporean,  especially  taking  on  the  Government  that   he

respects.   Sir,  this is something desirable that  the  average

Singaporean  will  not want to take on the  Government  that  he

respects and we should not encourage Singaporeans to go  to  the

courts at the slightest excuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think a better way would be to provide for a panel

of  arbitrators.  Those unhappy with the compensation amount can

then  appeal to this panel for a review.  Only when the  dispute

cannot be resolved at this level, should the conflicting parties

resort  to  the  courts.  We are moving  towards  a  more  civil

society with greater mediation between conflicting parties.   My

suggestion  would  be  in line with such  goals.   I  think  the

Minister should consider this option.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also provides for drainage, both to prevent

flooding  as  well as to collect as much water  as  possible  to

augment  whatever sources of water we currently have.   On  this

issue, I have a point to make.  It concerns the covering or  the

absence of covering of the drains in our housing estates.   Some

time ago, the policy was to cover all drains in order to protect

the  integrity of our water sources, of which the surface runoff

water   into   the   drainage  system  was  one   such   source.

Subsequently, to reduce the incidence of mosquito breeding,  the

covers were removed which is the current policy.  My question is

this:   Does  this mean that the protection of the integrity  of

water from this source is no longer important?  Is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>

current  policy  the  best solution to  handle  two  conflicting

demands?   Is  there no better solution?  Perhaps  the  Minister

would like to enlighten us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if possible, I would like the former policy of

covering  the  drains  be  reinstated.  Besides  protecting  the

integrity  of  protecting our water resources, it has  also  the

added  advantage  of  protecting the residents  in  our  housing

estates.   Since  the  removal  of  such  covers,  accidents  of

residents,  especially the older folks, falling into the  drains

have  increased.  Sir, this is especially important in the light

of our aging population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also concerned with clauses 37 and 38. These are

new  clauses relating to the registration and work of  plumbers.

Does it mean that, with the enactment of these clauses, one  can

no  longer  be a "do-it-yourself" person with regard  to  simple

plumbing  repair  jobs  in the house.  For  example,  would  the

changing of washers in taps at home or even faucet heads at home

by  the  home  owner become offences under this  law?   Must  he

always  employ a registered person to do such jobs?  Sir,  could

the Minister please clarify on this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to raise one issue regarding the

installation  and use of food waste disposals which  at  present

are  not  permitted in Singapore.  Food waste disposals  may  be

quite  familiar to those who have lived abroad.  It is  a  small

electro-mechanical appliance that is installed under the kitchen

sink  and  works  by pounding food waste into a  pulp  and  then

flushing  it  harmlessly down the drain line into  the  sewerage

system.   The food waste is thus pulverized into tiny  particles

and   is  often  described  by  manufacturers  as  having   been

liquefied.   In countries, like the USA, Australia and  the  UK,

such disposals have been in use in households

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>

for  many  years  and homemakers find them  to  be  a  fast  and

convenient method of getting rid of messy food wastes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the main advantage of using such an

appliance  is  that  food waste can be disposed  of  neatly  and

quickly,  reducing or eliminating the problem of  foul  smelling

garbage  which attracts flies, stray animals, rodents and  other

pests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From waste management point of view, it reduces the amount of

solid  waste  that  has  to  be  collected  and  transported  to

landfills or incineration.  For example, data from the  Plumbing

Foundation,  City of New York, shows that about 45%  of  all  US

households use disposals and more than 100 cities and  towns  in

the USA actually require the installation and use to help reduce

the  production of solid waste.  This should be our aim also  as

an   environmentally  conscious  and  ecologically   responsible

society.   Furthermore, it can lighten the workload  of  general

cleaning  workers  in  the housing estates  and  bring  about  a

significant  improvement  in  their  working  conditions.    Our

Ministry  of  National Development told me that members  of  the

public had in fact raised their concerns that this aspect  seems

to have been neglected even while Singapore strives to become  a

more compassionate and caring society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the significant benefits that may be derived

from the use of food waste disposals, I wonder why their use has

been  disallowed  in Singapore and under this Bill  may  not  be

permitted by virtue of clause 20.  In other countries  the  main

concern has been whether the use of such devices could adversely

affect  the public sewerage systems, especially the older  parts

of  them  which  may not be able to handle the  increased  waste

load.   However, our Ministry of the Environment is planning  to

spend  billions of dollars on various programmes,  such  as  the

Deep  Tunnel Sewerage System to upgrade our sewerage  collection

and treatment infrastructure which, I believe, should result  in

the  capability to handle any additional flow of pulverized food

waste from the use of disposals.  I would therefore like to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>

ask whether the Minister could consider allowing the use of food

waste disposals in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, first, let me thank both Members

for their support and comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first address the points raised by Mr Heng Chiang

Meng.  He commented about the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System.  Sir,

this  is  going  to  be a very important part  of  our  sewerage

infrastructure in the coming years and we would like  to  ensure

that  the  Deep  Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) is  optimised  in

terms of its usage and capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has asked whether or not the Ministry should be using

the  opportunity  of the DTSS to separate domestic  waste  water

from industrial waste water because domestic waste water is free

of  heavy  metal and other toxins.  The intention of  Mr  Heng's

suggestion is that technology is developing in some parts of the

world  now where waste water can now be treated to such a  level

that it can be recycled for use in our water system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also been looking into this. In terms of whether

there  is a need for us to separate industrial waste water  from

domestic  waste water, our conclusion is that there is  no  need

to.   What  we  are  doing now is that we  are  controlling  the

pollution  at  source.  We require companies that are  producing

waste   water  to  ensure  that  if  the  waste  water  contains

contaminants which will damage the system they should  pre-treat

the waste water before discharging into our sewerage system.  In

any  case,  the  DTSS would have two treatment  plants,  one  in

Changi  area and the other in Tuas area.  The Changi DTSS system

would  serve  mainly domestic premises and therefore  the  water

from  that treatment plant would be water which can be  recycled

if the technology proves feasible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PUB and my Ministry will be jointly building a 10,000 cubic

metre  per  day  water reclamation pilot plant to  try  out  the

concept  that  Mr Heng has just mentioned.  The  plant  will  be

commissioned and operational in mid-2000 and after which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>

we  will carry out a two-year study to look into the product  of

that  plant and see whether the output can also be used as  part

of our supply of raw water into our reservoirs and other potable

systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked whether the Government intends to treat the

DTSS  like  the MRT, ie, as part of the national infrastructure.

Sir,  the  current sewerage system consists of the  waste  water

conveyance  system  and  the waste water  treatment  facilities.

What we are doing now is that the operating cost of the sewerage

system  and  the  cost of building the treatment facilities  are

recovered but the cost of building the conveyance system is  not

recovered, ie, the sewers themselves are considered to  be  part

of  the  national  infrastructure and not recovered.   With  the

building  of  the DTSS, the same procedure will be adopted,  ie,

the  deep  tunnel will be considered to be part of the  national

infrastructure  and therefore we will not seek  to  recover  the

cost from consumers.  We will only seek to recover the operating

cost and the waste treatment facility costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng has brought up clause 5(7) which provides for the

Government to resort to the courts in the case of a dispute, and

he  has  asked that perhaps we should examine other  avenues  of

solving  the  problems before going to the  courts.   Sir,  this

clause is not new.  It is an existing clause.  I can assure  the

Member that in all the years that it has been operational in the

existing  Act,  we have not had to resort to  the  courts.   Our

approach is to resolve the issue of how much cost we have to pay

directly  with the parties involved and, if necessary,  we  will

seek  mediation.  We would only resort to the courts as  a  last

resort.   So  I can assure Mr Heng that his point is well  taken

and we will keep that in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of covering of drains in the housing estates, Mr

Heng  is  suggesting that we should go back to  the  old  system

where  the drains are covered.  Sir, basically, the covering  of

drains  involves two objectives.  One objective is  how  do  you

ensure   that  the  immediate  problem  of  breeding  of   Aedes

mosquitoes and dengue fever can be addressed properly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>

The  other objective is how do we make sure that litter does not

get  into our water systems.  The problem is that while  we  can

cope with the litter problem by covering up the drains, most  of

the  Town Councils have found that covered drains are a  problem

in  terms  of cleaning.  This is because most drains in  housing

estates have got very shallow gradients and water does not  flow

fast  enough  for  the  debris to be swept  away.   Is  there  a

solution to this?  I would ask my officials to look into  it  to

see  whether some middle ground can be found whereby the  bigger

part of the drain can be covered up and leaving some other parts

open  to  facilitate  cleaning.  At the  end  of  the  day,  the

responsibility will really have to fall on the town councils  to

ensure  that  those  parts that are covered up  can  be  cleaned

properly.   We  are  prepared to be flexible but  the  onus  for

maintaining the place mosquito-free falls on the town  councils.

We  leave that flexibility to the town councils and we hope that

they will use that flexibility wisely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng next talked about clauses 37 and 38. These are new

clauses  relating  to  the registration and  work  of  plumbers.

While these two clauses are new, the registration and definition

of  work  of plumbers are not new.  These currently exist  under

regulations.   What  we  have done is that  we  have  moved  the

regulations into the main body of the Bill.  Does it  mean  that

do-it-yourself jobs would no longer be possible?   Sir,  nothing

will  change  because, as I said, these are existing regulations

and  we  would still follow the current practice.  The intention

is  not  to  prevent simple repair jobs.  What we are  concerned

about is work involving the main system, whether it is the  main

sanitation system or the main plumbing system, because  work  to

those  main  systems  has an impact on the  overall  system  and

therefore  we  want  to be sure that only qualified  people  are

allowed  to make any alterations or repairs which can  be  quite

major.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min talked about food waste disposals or food

waste  grinders  and  asked why we are  so  far  behind  in  not

allowing them to be used.  I think it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>

important to understand how this system works and why we  cannot

allow  them  to  be used in Singapore.  The food waste  grinders

dispose  the  food waste through the sewerage  system  by  first

grinding the solid food into tiny bits, as Mr Ong has mentioned,

or  to  put  it  more  appropriately, it  liquefies  them.   The

question is how do we liquefy solid food?  You liquefy  them  by

not  just grinding the food but using a lot of water to  liquefy

and to sweep the food particles away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, water in Singapore is a very precious resource.

We  should  not  be using a lot of water to just grind  up  food

particles  and then disposing of them.  Secondly,  our  sewerage

system  is  really not designed with the necessary  gradient  to

take  the large amount of grit which the grinders would produce.

To  do that, we have to also modify the existing sewerage system

because  otherwise,  without the necessary  gradient,  the  food

particles  would  coagulate and choke up the  system.   Thirdly,

because  of  the additional amount of water and  grit  that  the

system  has  to  handle, our sewerage system would  have  to  be

expanded at a tremendous cost.  The figure mentioned by Mr  Heng

for  the DTSS is between $6 - $7 billion.  To modify the  system

to take the food waste, we just increase it by another 30%, that

is, over  $2 billion.  The current system works very well and it

is better that we work with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the experience of this system in other countries? I

have  asked that same question when I went to ENV two years ago.

When  I  travel, I see that system is available  in  many  other

countries.   Why  do we not have it here?  My staff  sought  the

views and comments of some of the municipal authorities in other

countries on their experience.  Sydney and Israel, for  example,

have  informed us that, on hindsight, it was not wise  to  allow

its  use.   Why?  High water consumption.  When populations  are

small, it is not a problem.  When populations increase and water

resources  get  scarce,  this becomes an unnecessary  demand  on

their water resources, and secondly, the high organic loading of

the food waste.  They regret it, but the system is in place, and

they cannot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>

do  anything about it.  I thank Mr Ong for his inputs  but  this

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, the Government announced a $10.5

billion  package to reduce business costs.  One of the  measures

was  a  10%  point reduction in the employer's CPF  contribution

rate.   In order to assist owners of private properties who  are

servicing  housing loans or HDB lessees paying  market  interest

for  their  mortgage loans, a bridging loan was also  announced.

This  bridging loan is a Government loan to affected  homeowners

to  make up for the shortfall in CPF contribution due to the 10%

point reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of bridging loan released monthly will

be the shortfall in the monthly loan instalment or the amount of

reduction in the CPF Ordinary Account contribution, whichever is

lesser.   The interest charged on the bridging loan is the  same

as the HDB concessionary mortgage rate which in turn is computed

at the prevailing CPF interest rate plus 0.1%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF (Amendment) Bill before the House today seeks to

amend  the Central Provident Fund Act to expand the Government's

bridging  loan  to  the  borrowers' CPF  Ordinary  Account.   In

effect, the bridging loan money is subjected to the same  charge

as  CPF  savings released for property purchases under  the  CPF

rules.  It also gives the Government, through the CPF Board, the

right to recover the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>

bridging loan amount from the borrower's CPF accounts.  This  is

the  least  cost  approach  to providing  such  a  loan  to  the

homeowners who would otherwise have to draw up another  mortgage

agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to allow CPF members affected by the

CPF  cut to use their CPF Special Account savings to service the

monthly  payment of the upgrading cost incurred  under  the  HDB

Main Upgrading Programme

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go through the key clauses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill introduces section 14(a) to provide

for the Government to extend loans to CPF members under approved

loan  schemes.  The new section allows the CPF Board  to  direct

monies  for  the  bridging  loan from the  Government  into  the

Ordinary  Account of a CPF member requiring such  loans.   These

monies  are deemed to be CPF contributions and may be  used  for

the  purpose  prescribed by regulations which include  financing

the  purchase of residential and commercial property.  This  new

section 14(a) also provides for the member's CPF contribution to

be used to repay the bridging loan and interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By deeming the money lent as CPF contributions, properties which

have  been purchased through the use of the bridging loan  will,

through the existing provision of the CPF Act, be subject  to  a

statutory charge to secure the refund of those monies to the CPF

accounts  of  the borrowers.  This would allow  the  CPF  Board,

acting on behalf of the Government, to recover the bridging loan

and  interest directly from the borrowers' CPF accounts if  they

fail to repay or breach the terms and conditions of the loan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under the CPF Act, a member may withdraw his or

her  CPF savings in a lump sum upon attaining the age of 55, and

after  setting  aside the prevailing CPF Minimum  Sum  or  if  a

member becomes physically or mentally incapacitated, or is found

to be of unsound mind before reaching the age of 55.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, arising from the introduction of a bridging loan

scheme, it is necessary to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>

ensure  that any loan taken should first be paid before the  CPF

member can withdraw his or her savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 introduces a new section 15(a) to require a CPF

member  who  has not fully repaid his bridging  loan  to  do  so

before  he  will be allowed to withdraw his CPF savings  on  the

ground  that  he has become physically or mentally incapacitated

or  is  found  to  be of unsound mind.  However,  a  member  who

reaches  the  age of 55 will continue to be allowed to  withdraw

his  CPF savings after setting aside the Minimum Sum even if  he

has not fully repaid his bridging loan.  This is because the CPF

Minimum  Sum  currently set at $55,000 is more  than  enough  to

cover  the  maximum bridging loan anticipated,  which  is  about

$13,000,  based on a loan of $360 per month for  a  duration  of

three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a CPF member who has been declared a bankrupt

cannot  withdraw his CPF savings unless the CPF Board authorises

his  withdrawal with the approval of the Minister.   Although  a

bankrupt CPF member cannot qualify for a bridging loan, there is

a  possibility that a CPF member may become a bankrupt after  he

has  taken  on  a bridging loan.  To deal with such  situations,

clause  6  of the Bill amends section 27 to require  a  bankrupt

member  to repay his bridging loan plus interest before  he  can

withdraw his CPF savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, about 1,500 CPF members are servicing their HDB

flat upgrading cost with their CPF Ordinary Account savings.  As

announced  by  DPM  Lee, in order to help CPF  members  who  are

affected by the CPF cut, we would allow those who have  used  up

their  CPF  Ordinary Account savings to draw  on  their  Special

Account  savings to meet the shortfall in their monthly  housing

loan  repayment, subject to the amount of the  cut  in  the  CPF

contribution.  In line with this decision, I think  it  is  only

rational  to  allow those who are using their  Ordinary  Account

savings  to  service the upgrading cost to also tap  savings  in

their  Special Account.  This is provided for by clause 7  which

amends

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>

the  CPF  Act  to  allow CPF members to use  their  CPF  Special

Account  savings for monthly payment of their share of upgrading

cost under the HDB Main Upgrading Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this amount of the Special Account savings which

can  be  used  will  be capped at the amount  of  the  shortfall

arising  from  the CPF cut to the Ordinary Account contribution.

I  would  like  to stress at this juncture that this  is  not  a

permanent feature, in other words, allowing the Special  Account

savings  to  be used either for servicing housing loans  or  for

paying  their share of the upgrading cost.  This is a  temporary

arrangement  because once the economy recovers and we  start  to

restore the CPF contribution rate, the existing rule where  only

CPF Ordinary Account savings can be used for upgrading works  or

servicing housing loan will apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, the CPF Act provides for the General

Manager  of the Board and Board members to sign legal  documents

which  require the CPF Board's seal.  Such legal documents could

be  deeds of arrangement and deeds of postponement which set out

the  distribution of sales proceeds of the property between  the

CPF  Board  and the mortgagee financier under the  CPF  Property

Scheme.  This arrangement had resulted at times in inconvenience

when  the General Manager and Board members were not present  in

Singapore.  Clause 2 of the Bill therefore amends the CPF Act to

enable any Deputy General Manager of the CPF Board to sign legal

documents  which  require the Board's seal in  addition  to  the

General Manager and Board members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the amendments proposed in the Bill

will  ensure  that  the  bridging loan  money  extended  by  the

Government  to  CPF  members is protected.  The  amendment  will

allow  members who are using their CPF Ordinary Account  savings

for  the  upgrading  cost  of their HDB  flats  under  the  Main

Upgrading Programme to use their Special Account savings to meet

the shortfall in their monthly instalment payment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the amendment will also enable the Board to be more

efficient in its administration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang.]

<div align="center"><b>CARRIAGE BY AIR (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>5.02 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Carriage By Air Act (Chapter

32A  of  the  1989  Revised  Edition)  to  give  effect  to  the

provisions of the Montreal Protocol No. 4 which amend the Warsaw

Convention  (relating  to  international  carriage  by  air)  as

amended by the Hague Protocol (which is referred to in the  Bill

as the "Warsaw (Hague) Convention").

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Montreal Protocol No. 4, which deals with the

international carriage by air of cargo and baggage,  amends  the

Warsaw  (Hague) Convention to allow electronic air  waybills  to

replace  the  traditional paper air waybills, thus removing  the

need  for  air waybills to physically accompany shipments.  This

provides  greater  convenience to shippers, freight  forwarders,

consignees  and  airlines.  It also reduces cost  and  increases

efficiency of the shipment of air cargoes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protocol also amends the Warsaw (Hague) Convention to

introduce  strict  liability  for  the  carriage  of  cargo  and

expresses the limit of the carrier's liability in terms  of  the

IMF's  Special  Drawing  Rights (SDR)  instead  of  US  dollars,

without changing the limits of the carrier's liability.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's trade environment, manufacturers increasingly

seek  just-in-time delivery and related strategies  as  ways  of

enhancing  efficiency and reducing business costs.   To  exploit

these  innovations, it is more efficient to use  electronic  air

waybills via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in place  of  the

traditional paper air waybills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electronic approach is not only less expensive, but

also faster and less of a hassle to customers.  By making better

use  of EDI as allowed under the Protocol, carriers and shippers

can maximise the productivity of their resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues are addressed by the ratification of the

amendments to the Warsaw Convention by the Montreal Protocol No. 4.

Singapore acceded to the Protocol on 31st October 1997  and

the  Protocol  came into force for Singapore on  12th  September

1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the key provisions of the Carriage

By  Air  (Amendment)  Bill.  The Warsaw (Hague)  Convention,  as

amended  by Montreal Protocol No. 4, is referred to in the  Bill

as the Warsaw (Hague) (Montreal) Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 relates to the short title and commencement. The

clause  deems  the  Bill  to have come into  operation  on  12th

September  1998  and provides that the Bill  should  not  affect

rights  and liabilities arising out of an occurrence which  took

place before that date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends the long title to incorporate the reference

to the Montreal Protocol No. 4.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 reorganises the definitions in section 2 by

replacing the existing definitions of "Convention" and  "amended

Convention" with the new definitions of "Warsaw Convention"  and

"Warsaw  (Hague) Convention" respectively and further inserts  2

new definitions of "Montreal Protocol No. 4" and "Warsaw (Hague)

(Montreal) Convention".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 3 to provide that the provisions of

the Warsaw (Hague) (Montreal) Convention shall have the force of

law  in Singapore; and if there is any inconsistency between the

text of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>

Warsaw  (Hague) (Montreal) Convention as set out  in  the  Third

Schedule  and the Montreal Protocol No. 4, the authentic  French

text shall prevail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 4 to empower the Minister to

certify  who  are  the Parties to the Warsaw (Hague)  (Montreal)

Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 to 14 deal with consequential and drafting

amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 inserts a new Third Schedule containing the text

in English of the Warsaw (Hague) (Montreal) Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the amendments of the Carriage By Air

Act  to  give  effect  to the amendments made  by  the  Montreal

Protocol  No.  4 to the Warsaw (Hague) Convention would  benefit

our air cargo industry by facilitating the transition to a fully

electronic  trading environment for air cargo in Singapore.  The

result   is   significant  gains  in  efficiency   and   greater

convenience  to  shippers,  freight forwarders,  consignees  and

airlines.   The  efficient use of EDI would enhance  our  Changi

Airport's  status as a major air hub in the region  and  further

increases its international competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>5.10 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Prevention of Pollution of the

Sea Act, 1990 to give

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>

effect   to   the  International  Convention  on  Oil  Pollution

Preparedness, Response and Co-operation (OPRC Convention)  which

has  been  adopted  by  the International Maritime  Organization

(IMO)  in  1990  and  to  enable  Singapore  to  implement   any

international agreement relating to the prevention, reduction or

control  of pollution of the sea and pollution from ships.   The

Bill also increases the penalties for various offences under the

Act and provides for the fines imposed for any offence under the

Act to be paid into the funds of the MPA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Exxon Valdez" disaster in 1989 clearly demonstrated

that  oil  spills can overwhelm a country's response capability,

regardless  of  resources at hand. Following this incident,  the

IMO  adopted the OPRC Convention in 1990 in recognition  of  the

serious  threat posed to the marine environment by oil pollution

incidents  involving ships,  seaports as well  as  oil  handling

facilities.  Singapore is a major oil refining centre as well as

the   world's   top  bunkering  port.   We  therefore   have   a

responsibility  to  be  prepared  at  all  times  to  deal  with

pollution incidents that may arise.   This Bill gives effect  to

the necessary precautionary measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention is designed to facilitate international co-operation and mutual assistance in preparing for and responding

to  a  major oil pollution incident and to encourage  States  to

develop  and  maintain an adequate capability to deal  with  oil

pollution emergencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires governments to establish a national system for

responding  promptly and effectively to oil pollution incidents.

As  a  basic  minimum, this includes the creation of a  national

contingency  plan.   In  addition,  seaports  and  oil  handling

facilities  have  to  maintain  Oil  Pollution  Emergency  Plans

(OPEPs) if there exist risks of oil pollution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MPA has revised its Marine Emergency Action Procedure

(MEAP) to incorporate the provisions of the OPRC Convention.  In

the  process, they have consulted various Government departments

and   corporations   including  Jurong  Port,   CAAS   and   PSA

Corporation, which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>

have  responsibilities in the MEAP, as well as  private terminal

operators  which provide oil handling facilities.   This  is  to

ensure  that  all  parties concerned are  ready  to  accept  the

responsibilities  required  of  them  under  the  revised  MEAP.

Terminal  operators have now developed the OPEPs in anticipation

of Singapore's accession to the OPRC Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a party to this Convention, Singapore will have

obligation to give effect to the provisions of the Convention in

its  laws.  The Bill contains the essential provisions  to  give

effect  to the Convention. In addition, to obviate the  need  to

amend  the  Act  in  future  when Cabinet  approves  Singapore's

accession  to  any  new  international agreement  or  convention

relating to the prevention, reduction or control of pollution of

the  sea  and  pollution from ships, the Bill also provides  for

regulations  to  be  made to give effect to  such  international

agreements  or conventions.  In case Members are concerned  that

Parliament's role as the main source of law making and its power

to  oversee regulations are eroded, let me stress that this  Act

asks  Parliament  for  approval  for  MPA  to  make  regulations

relating  specifically to prevention, control  or  reduction  of

pollution  of the sea or pollution from ships.  The  regulations

enacted  will  not  exceed the ambit of the Act.   International

agreements relating to the prevention, reduction and control  of

pollution,  such  as  the  International  Convention   for   the

Prevention  of  Pollution  from Ships  (MARPOL)  and  OPRC,  the

Convention  which we are addressing in this Bill, are voluminous

and  they contain a large amount of technical and administrative

details.   Moreover,  they are amended  frequently.   For  these

reasons, it makes more sense that they be implemented by way  of

regulations.  In any case, the regulations will be gazetted  and

all  Members  will  have access to them so that they  can  raise

issues of concern in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that the existing section 34 already provides for

regulations  to  be made to give effect to any other  treaty  or

international  agreement which provides for the modification  of

MARPOL.  Section

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>

34(c)  will  extend this to other international  conventions  or

agreements  specifically related to areas of pollution  such  as

OPRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 34 of the Bill introduces other measures necessary

to  deal  with  pollution of the sea or  pollution  from  ships.

Besides oil terminals and refineries, cargo terminals, shipyards

and  other facilities in Singapore will now be required to store

detergents,   dispersants  and  equipment  to  deal   with   oil

pollution. This is to enhance Singapore's oil combat capability.

It  will  not  add  additional  burden  on  cargo  terminals  or

shipyards  as  such  resources are  currently  stored  at  their

premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reflect the gravity of damage caused by oil pollution,

clauses  4, 5, 6 and new paragraph (e) of section 34(3) seek  to

provide for increase in fines for non-compliance.  The fines for

indiscriminate  discharge of oil into the sea are  increased  to

reflect  the  severity as well as the increased cost  of  damage

caused  by  oil pollution and to deter any such discharge.   The

Bill  also provides that all fines imposed for any offence under

the  Act  or  any  regulations  made  thereunder  and  all  sums

collected under section 33 of the Act shall be paid to the  MPA.

Payment  of fines to MPA will enable it to recover part  of  the

clean  up  cost for oil spills from unknown sources and expenses

related to investigation into pollution incidents.  The MPA  has

consulted the Ministry of Finance and it has no objection to the

fines being paid to the MPA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, recognising that an independent press is

essential  to  the  freedoms  of  the  people,  calls  upon  the

Government  to announce its readiness to grant a  licence  to  a

newspaper  company  to  publish a  newspaper  independently  and

outside  of Singapore Press Holdings with the assurance that  no

government  control  or  pressure  will  be  extended  over  the

publication of news.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion that I have tabled this evening is in line

with  the motions that I have tabled in the earlier sittings  of

Parliament  urging for a greater freedom of expression  in  this

country as is provided for in the Constitution.  It goes without

saying  that  freedom of the press is an integral, perhaps  even

the  sine qua non of the freedom of expression.  It is the press

which will provide the people the freedom of expression that the

Constitution guarantees in the widest manner possible.   As  was

said  in a collection of essays on the American press, the right

of  the people to speak out through a free press is the hallmark

of  a  democratic society, and we in Singapore  claim  to  be  a

democratic society.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.23 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is to be maintained, Mr Deputy Speaker, then it is

essential  that we give our people, every citizen in  Singapore,

the right to speak out.  As I said, this is only possible in the

widest manner through a press which is fearless, independent, to

speak out on behalf of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The press is one of the institutions of democracy. Some

people might say that  it is the most important institution of a

democratic  society.  It is, along with the other  institutions,

the guardian of the liberty of the people.  It must take it upon

itself  the  responsibility  to  eke  out  any  injustices,  any

wrongdoings committed against the people or even one  member  of

the  society,  and  to speak out against it.   This  freedom  of

expression and the role

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>

for the press have not been won easily in the countries where it

now  obtains.   It has been won by the press in those  countries

recognising their responsibilities and their role, fighting  for

the freedom of expression through the press.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his book which he calls "An anatomy of the Press"

entitled "Dangerous Estate", Francis Williams, who was an editor

himself at one time, writes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The development of the press is part of the history of

national  development.  Much more than political  constitutions,

statistics  of economic progress or demonstrations  of  national

unity, the state of a country's newspapers discloses which  rung

of  the  ladder of civilisation has been reached.  This  is  not

only because newspapers reflect, as they must, public taste, but

because  the  structure  and  status  of  the  press  show  more

revealingly than almost anything else the real stage of national

development."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a sense, even more profound than arises from its nature

as  a  reporter of events, the press is the mirror  of  its  age

because the degree of authority and independence it is permitted

to  exercise, or is able to seize for itself and the  nature  of

its  influence  of public opinion throw light in a  way  nothing

else quite does on the real balance of power within a society."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is important. The newspapers reflect and throw light

on  the  real  balance  of power within a  society.   It  is  by

perusing the newspapers that any comer to a country will be able

to  gauge  or to find out where the balance of power  lies.   Of

course,  again  it goes without saying, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,

that  the balance of power must lie with the people.  If it does

not, then it is not a democracy.  It can be anything else but  a

democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis Williams, again in his book, sees the press "as a

weapon of freedom, a sword in the hands of those fighting old or

new  tyrannies, the one indispensable piece of ordnance  in  the

armoury  of  democracy."  These are strong words but  they  were

necessary when the press was fighting for its freedom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of expression, Mr Deputy Speaker, which as I said,

is so vital and the essence of democracy, cannot flourish unless

there  is  in  the citizens a right to know.  Now, who  supplies

this right to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>

know,  if  not the newspapers?  If the newspapers fail  in  this

duty  to inform the citizens the truth, and honestly, then  they

cease to be a newspaper.  They become an organ of whoever is  in

power  and serve not the people but the government or the  party

in power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said again in this collection of essays that in

the  American press, it is a self-appointed role to  inform  the

public  about  government  activities,  thereby  sparking   open

debate.   In the middle of the last century, Mr Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  when  the  government  of  the  United  Kingdom  then  was

attempting  to  control what the press would publish,  what  the

press would print, the Times in an Editorial in 1852 said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dignity and freedom of the press are trammelled from the

moment  it accepts an ancillary position.  To perform its duties

with entire independence and consequently with the utmost public

advantage,  the  press  can  enter  into  no  close  or  binding

alliances  with the statesmen of the day, nor can  it  surrender

its  permanent  interests to the convenience  of  the  ephemeral

power of any government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were all the values that were held at the time when the

press  in England were fighting to represent the people's views.

And, again, in this "Dangerous Estate", talking about one of the

great editors of the Times (Barnes was the editor), Williams has

this to say

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barnes's influence was rooted in the conviction that a

newspaper  is  "not an organ through which the Government  could

influence the people but an organ through which the people could

influence the Government"."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his concluding chapter, Francis Williams presents what

the present role is, because times have changed.  At one time it

seemed  as though the press was becoming tyrannical in  England,

it  was  trying to control policies.  And so times have  changed

and the press have changed a little.  But he said the basic role

remains the same.  And he concludes that the present role is:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To provide a voice for the people that even the largest

administrative monster will hear above the grinding of  its  own

machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its role in society is not that of a judge but that of a

minefield through which authority, great and small

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>

and  at  every  level  of policy and administration,  must  step

wearily, conscious always that a false step may blow it up."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The basic commitment of journalism remains . the same. . It is

to report honestly [that means, sticking to the truth as near as

possible],   to  comment  fearlessly  and  to   hold   fast   to

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This commitment to] Values call for honesty; honesty to those

attacked  as  well as to those defended.  [This]  requires  that

facts  shall not be distorted.  What is said shall be said  with

both courage and fairness."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members think that this is all western heresy and it is not

something  for  us  to  follow,  may  I  tell  them  that  these

principles  or values have been held fast in a number  of  Asian

societies.   I  do not have to mention them all,  but  the  most

clear example would be India, the greatest and largest democracy

in  the world, as it has been termed very often.  And I see only

in  yesterday's  paper  that when the  Pakistani  government  is

trying  to close down a newspaper, there is a procession against

the  closure led by Miss Bhutto and a number of other  political

parties, and they are all united in defending the freedom of the

press.   And  it is not only just these two, but there  are  the

Philippines, even Thailand and Sri Lanka.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us not just rely on what the other countries are doing.

May  I,  even  if it is tedious, again recall what  the  present

Senior  Minister said about the press when he was  fighting  for

the  freedom  of the press way back in the fifties and  sixties.

Speaking  in  the then Legislative Assembly, Mr Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  the  Senior Minister - I regret that he  is  not  here  to

listen to what he said then - had this to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...we either believe in democracy or we do not. If we do, then

we  must  say  categorically,  without  qualification,  that  no

restraint  from any democratic process, other than  by  ordinary

law  of  the  land,  should  be  allowed.   If  you  believe  in

democracy,  you  must  believe in it  unconditionally.   If  you

believe that men should be free, then they should have the right

of  free association, of free speech, of free publication.  Then

no  law  should permit those democratic processes to be  set  at

naught,  and no excuse, whether security, inconvenience  to  the

traffic,  or  inconvenience to police officers, should  allow  a

government to be deterred from doing what it knows to be  right,

and what it must know to be right."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking in the same year in the Assembly in October, he said - this, Mr Deputy Speaker, has often been quoted, as the "making-

love" speech:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am told [repression] is like making love - it is always

easier  the second time!  The first time there may be  pangs  of

conscience, a sense of guilt.  But once embarked on this course,

with  constant repetition, you get more and more brazen  on  the

attack and in the scope of the attack.   All you have to do  is

to dissolve organisations and societies and banish or detain the

key  political  workers in these societies.   Then  miraculously

everything is tranquil on the surface."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may just interpose, here comes the most operative part of

this speech:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then an intimidated Press and the Government controlled radio

together  can  regularly  sing  your  praises,  and  slowly  and

steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have

already  been done.  Or if these things are referred  to  again,

they  are  conveniently distorted, and distorted with  impunity,

because there will be no opposition to contradict."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these must seem very familiar to us in Singapore today. But

that  was in 1956 the now Senior Minister holding forth  in  the

Legislative Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we were part of Malaysia, what did he have to say?

Speaking in the Malaysian Parliament in December 1964, he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us get down to fundamentals. Is this an open or a closed

society?   Is  it  a society where man can preach  ideas  -  the

novel,   unorthodox,   heresies,   established   churches    and

established  governments where there is a  constant contest  for

men's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is

just,  or  what is in the national interest?  Or is it a  closed

society  where  the  mass  media  -  the  newspapers,  journals,

publications, TV, radio - either by sound or by sight,  or  both

sound  and  sight,  feed men's minds with a  constant  drone  of

sycophantic support for a particular orthodox philosophy?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the principles that the west was

espousing  were  very dear to the heart of the  Senior  Minister

when  he  was  fighting for the same.  May  I  then  remind  the

Members  that this is not just western heresy or western  values

that I am attempting to impose on Singapore.  My commitment  and

my  belief  is  that  we in Singapore, if we  are  to  become  a

democratic society, have to hold fast to the principles that the

Senior Minister was espousing in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>

fifties  and sixties.  If they were found necessary  then,  they

are  all the more necessary today, as we now prepare to go  into

the  21st century, with its challenges facing us, with  all  the

competitions that confront us when we go into the 21st  century.

So,  it is not just western or liberal values but values that  a

number  of Asian societies have accepted and which to  my  mind,

and  I am sure to people who think rightly, are essential for  a

democratic society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now look at the position in Singapore today. We

would  appear to have reached, what the Senior Minister said  in

1956,  an  intimidated  press  of  which  he  was  warning   the

Legislative Assembly and that position, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,

may  I  say,  with  regret, has been reached systematically  and

deliberately by measures taken by his Government after  it  took

power in 1959.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, we have really one newspaper, or one company,

one  stable,  which brings out broadsheets or tabloids  but  all

reporting  faithfully whatever the Government or the PAP  wishes

them to put forward.  They have failed in their duty of being  a

voice  for  the  people and they have become  a  voice  for  the

Government and that has been made possible by the amendment that

was  passed in 1974 which legalised the de facto control of  the

press  which  was  already in place before 1974.   Members  will

recall  that it was before 1974, the years preceding that,  that

the  Eastern  Sun  was closed.  It was accused  of  being  anti-Singapore  because  there was some money received  from  abroad.

Then  there  was the forced closure of the Singapore Herald  for

what  the Government termed "black operations".  No paper  which

was  even  mildly  critical  of the Government  was  allowed  to

operate.   But  this was all done, as I said, de facto,  without

the  legal  control over it.  And so it was in 1974 that  a  new

Bill  was  introduced in Parliament, the Newspaper and  Printing

Presses Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have taken the trouble to read

the debate in the Parliament on the Second Reading of that Bill.

I  am  not going to bore Members by reading what was said.   But

the reason

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>

given for the amendments, and I shall take the House through the

amendments  that  were  made,  was  that  the  control  of   the

newspapers  had to be put into the hands of Singapore  citizens.

One  Member  talked  about not allowing  demons  and  devils  to

control  the  press  in  Singapore and so subvert  Singaporeans.

Another talked about even embassies and diplomatic organisations

in    Singapore   subverting   Singaporeans   by   taking    out

advertisements  or airing their views through the  local  media.

And of course, before the 1972 elections, the Opposition parties

and,  particularly, the Workers' Party was accused  of  being  a

proxy  for  foreign  powers and it was also mentioned  that  the

press might be taken over by proxy by foreign powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the irony of all this is that, in this House, whilst Members

who  spoke  were  all speaking about the necessity  to  put  the

control  over the newspapers in the hands of Singapore citizens,

they  failed  to  see that what the Act did, and  there  was  no

question  about this, was not to put the control into the  hands

of  Singaporeans; it was to put the control of the newspapers in

the  hands  of  the Government, which are two different  things.

The  then  Minister for Culture spoke of putting the control  of

our   newspapers  in  the  hands  of  our  citizens   and   that

Singaporeans  could not afford to have black operations  mounted

against us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if one looks at the provisions in that Act, it is so clear

that  what  that  Act did was to put the dissemination  of  news

completely  and  totally in the control of the  Government.   It

introduced for the first time management shares as distinct from

ordinary  shares,  creating  two  classes  of  shares,   namely,

management  shares  and ordinary shares.  No  management  shares

could be issued or transferred except to citizens of Singapore - one  may not have quarrel with that, but this is where the sting

is  - or corporations who or which have been granted the written

approval  of the Minister.  No company shall refuse to issue  or

accept  transfer  of management shares where  the  Minister  has

granted  an  approval.   And  the holder  of  management  shares

wielded great power.  These were the people who were approved by

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>

Minister.  The holder of management shares, Mr Deputy Speaker, I

am  sure  Members are aware of this but I need to  emphasise  it

again, was given 200 votes for each management share held by him

or  her  in  any  resolution  relating  to  the  appointment  or

dismissal  of  a  director  or any member  of  the  staff  of  a

newspaper  company.  That, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  sealed  the

question as to who was to have the major say or the only say  in

the   appointment  of  the  editor,  the  appointment  of   even

journalists and reporters in any newspaper.  It was the  holders

of  the management shares and their share counted for 200  votes

against the ordinary shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Act did not make any mention about the limit of

shares  that may be held by management shareholders, it  limited

ordinary shareholders to no more than 3% of the ordinary shares.

So  through  these amendments that were made, the  press  passed

into  the  control  of  the Government legally,  de  jure,  when

previously control was effected de facto.  So what is the result

today as a result of the amendments made in 1974 and the actions

taken under that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Singapore Press Holdings controlling the entire

newspaper  industry in Singapore.  It has been, I think,  termed

the largest press company in the world.  Who is on the board  of

this?   The  Chairman is an ex-Cabinet Minister.  The  Executive

Director  was  a  one  time Director of  the  Internal  Security

Department.   The  other  members of the  board  are  tried  and

trusted  men  of  the  Government.  And so the  press  became  a

mouthpiece for the Government.  Whatever freedom it had, and  it

had  very  little before 1974, was taken away and  it  became  a

castrated press.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just read to you what was given to me, and it appeared on

the  Internet at the beginning of this year, I am told, and this

illustrates  the control that is exercised over  publication  of

any  news in the Straits Times.  This man was, he says, a junior

sub-editor  in  the Straits Times, and he speaks of  an  evening

when  he was with his Chief Sub-editor when Mr Leslie Fong,  who

has admitted that he was an ardent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>

admirer  of  the PAP from his school days, came  into  the  room

where they were working, trying to put the paper to bed, getting

everything  ready,  to tell them that he had  had  a  call  from

upstairs.   Everyone  understood  what  "upstairs"  meant.   The

Straits  Times was not to overplay or underplay the visit  of  a

China  delegation that was visiting Singapore or  was  about  to

visit Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, are you prepared

to substantiate what happened?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, I am saying that it appeared on the

Internet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> No, I will not allow that. Anybody can

post anything on the Internet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, perhaps one could ask Mr Leslie Fong

and  the Chief Sub-Editor.  He gives the name, Roger Yew.  These

names  are  mentioned.  This has not been rebutted.   There  has

been no reply from Leslie Fong or anyone else.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Never mind about that. Unless you are

prepared  to  substantiate what happened actually,  I  will  not

allow you to quote that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. But as

I  said,  this  appeared in public.  It was read by Singaporeans

and there has been no rebuttal of it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will you proceed to a new point?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right. May I then move on to the

comments  made about the press today in Singapore and  that,  of

course, was also reported in the Straits Times - I hope you  are

not going to ask me to substantiate it.  These were the comments

made  by  Mr  Marshall  who  was once  the  Chief  Minister  and

Ambassador for the Government in France for many years.  And  he

was  speaking at the Substation one evening.  This was  reported

and  this  is what he had to say, "Today, Singapore's censorship

is worse,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>

broader and more strict than any time under the British imperial

rule."   There  is  this man, Mr Marshall,  who  was  the  Chief

Minister  of  Singapore  and  who  was  an  Ambassador  of   the

Government,  saying  this publicly.  He,  of  course,  had  very

unkind words for the Straits Times, calling them "boot-lickers".

But  he  asked  this question:  "where do we go to  express  our

differences  or views if we are not allowed to hold meetings  or

write  to the press?"  He was commenting on the refusal  of  the

Straits  Times  to publish a letter that he had sent  protesting

against  the death penalty and asking the President  to  commute

all the death sentences to 20 year jail terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Francis Seow, in his latest book, "Media Enthralled",

recalls a statement made by the roving Ambassador for Singapore,

Professor  Tommy  Koh in 1991.  Speaking at a  forum,  Professor

Tommy  Koh  was  reported  to  have  said  that  journalists  in

Singapore  must constantly work under a cloud of  fear  and,  of

course  Members will recall that some months ago, I was  talking

about  the fear that grips Singaporeans asking for steps  to  be

taken  to  rid  them  of  the fear.  That  is  the  position  in

Singapore  today.  The press has ceased to play its  role.   The

press  has  become  nothing but an organ or propaganda  for  the

Government and a mouthpiece for Government's views.  How long is

this  going  to  go  on if Singapore is to become  a  democratic

society?   Is  this  the  press, Mr Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  that

Singapore needs for the 21st century?  Is this how we are  going

to  educate our people?  Is this how we are going to equip  them

for the problems of the country that lie ahead by depriving them

of  the right to know, of being informed honestly and truthfully

what happens in Singapore?  This, I can substantiate to you,  Mr

Deputy  Speaker.   I  can tell you that several  of  my  Party's

statements,  several of my letters that I send  to  the  Straits

Times never see the light of day.  The Government makes much  of

its  right  to reply.  It insists on this in foreign newspapers.

But  this  same right of which the Government makes so  much  is

denied to opposition parties or to the citizens by the press  in

Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not rosy eyed about the press in the West. I am not

unmindful  of the excesses and the lengths that the press  carry

their freedom to.  But may I say that these excesses, especially

on  this recent Clinton affair in the United States, the  extent

to  which  the press reported it, the extent to which the  media

carried  the news, show the strength of democracy in the  United

States.  It shows the resilience of the people.  May I say  that

it is preferable, even with these excesses, to the press that we

have  in Singapore which is completely one-sided, and acts  only

as  a  mouthpiece for the Government, carrying out, - performing

the  task against which Mr Lee Kuan Yew was railing in 1950s and

1960s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this 1974 Bill, there was some mention of the Government

having  thought about a Press Council.  I do not know  why  they

have  not  been able to set up a Press Council all these  years.

But,  of  course, a Press Council will be of no value if  it  is

manned by people who think alike with the PAP or the Government.

The  Council  has to be independent who values the  independence

and freedom of the newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make a plea in this House, to this Government, that it is

time  that  we made a complete break with the way that  we  have

been  controlling  our  newspapers, and give  our  people  their

right,  the  unfettered, untrammelled right,  to  express  their

opinions,  their  viewpoints  through  a  press  which  will  be

fearless and will speak up for the people.  This is not possible

at the moment with the set-up in Singapore as it is now and that

is  why  I ask the Government to say in this House this  evening

that  it will be ready or happy to consider an application by  a

newspaper   company   not   controlled   by   foreigners,    but

Singaporeans, to publish another newspaper outside the Singapore

Press Holdings and to assure whoever is prepared to do this that

there  will be no day-to-day control over them.  That they would

be  at  liberty,  they would have the freedom to  perform  their

duties  and responsibilities as a press to act as the  voice  of

the  people, to uphold the freedom of the people, and to be  the

guardians of the liberty of the people.  This cannot be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>

performed  by the Straits Times, particularly, or by  any  other

paper in the stable of the Singapore Press Holdings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that those who work for these companies, for the

Singapore  Press  Holdings, and who write for  these  newspapers

have been dyed in the wool with the PAP's philosophy of the role

of the newspapers, which is to act simply as the disseminator of

Government's views and Government's viewpoints and  to  try  and

persuade  the people to accept the Government's policies.   That

is not the role of the newspapers.  That is why I cannot see any

one  in the present set-up being able to discharge this new role

for the press in Singapore.  It may be that we may have to bring

from  abroad editors who are committed to the value  of  a  free

press  in a democratic society and who are prepared to speak  up

without fear and with honesty and truth.  We may have to recruit

journalists, reporters who still hold on to these values and who

have  not  surrendered these values to the requirements  of  the

Government or its preferences.  It seems to me that  this  is  a

matter  of pressing urgency if, as I said earlier, we are  going

into the 21st century with our heads held high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I finally end with a prayer by a great Indian poet,

Rabindranath Tagore:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where knowledge is free;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow

domestic walls;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where words come out from the depth of truth;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the

dreary desert sand of dead habit;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever widening

thought and action;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into that heaven of freedom, my father, let my country awake.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that is my prayer for Singapore, that our people may

be  led  into that heaven of freedom where they can  hold  their

heads  high  and where they can make judgments for  the  country

themselves.  And that is not possible, Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>

Deputy  Speaker, when we have a press which is manacled  by  the

Government  and  is not able to perform its functions.   I  hope

very  much that whoever speaks on behalf of the Government  will

this  evening tell us whether the Government is ready  to  break

from  this  habit  of 30 years or 40 years and  to  make  a  new

beginning in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise

to oppose the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, essentially, the motion is flawed for a number of

reasons.   To  begin  with, I would like to stress  that  whilst

there  exist certain regulatory controls on the print  media  in

Singapore,  there is no prohibition for any company  independent

of  the  Singapore Press Holdings to apply for a licence and  to

publish  an alternative newspaper in Singapore if they meet  the

conditions stated in the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act.  We

do  not have to go too far back in our short history to remember

that  there had existed a number of alternative newspapers here,

not  run under the ambit of the Singapore Press Holdings,  right

up   to   the   1980s.   And  through  natural   attrition   and

consolidation  in  the  newspaper  industry,  the  industry  has

evolved to what it is today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the Government does not dictate nor does it

have  any direct influence on the media and the newspapers here.

What  minimalist control the Government has over licensing,  for

instance,  is  necessary  to  safeguard  against  the  potential

rampant distortion of facts that may permeate and undermine  the

fragile social fabric of our society.  Issues like religious and

ethnic harmony have to be dealt with very carefully in order  to

avoid  the  conflicts evident in a close neighbour of ours  like

Indonesia  where the mass proliferation of news  and  the  print

media following the change in the President last year has simply

led  to more confusion than illumination of the truth.  And this

has  contributed in part to much civil disharmony, religious and

racial conflicts today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in Singapore, we cannot afford to take such risks.

Hence,  we  require  newspapers and  other  print  media  to  be

licensed.   This  does not, however, prevent  anyone  else  from

publishing  another newspaper here, provided they are  conscious

of their social responsibilities.  A free press is not an end in

itself,   and   journalists  here  are  fully   aware   of   the

responsibilities that come with this freedom.  In order to  stay

relevant and respected, our local press has thus far acted in  a

most   responsible  manner  in  reporting  the  facts   as   our

journalists are all fully aware of the additional role they play

in nation building, and they are not under Government control or

pressure, as implied by the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are already many alternative means to convey

information  in  this age where technology has enabled,  through

the Internet, for instance, almost instantaneous transmission of

news.  Currently, quite contrary to what Mr Jeyaretnam has said,

Singaporeans  have  the  freedom to access  the  Internet,  have

access  to  cable TV and have access to foreign  newspapers  and

magazines,  to obtain, to compare and to analyse information  in

order  to  make  rational informed choices.   Our  track  record

underlines the openness of our news media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the problem today is not whether we should have another

newspaper.   The  problem  is that Singaporeans  have  too  many

choices  to  choose now, too many choices to access  information

and  news,  given  the limited free time that  they  have  after

minusing  hours  for working, sleeping, resting and  recreation.

Singaporeans  are  increasingly more and more selective  in  the

news that they read.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existence of a vibrant and active media hub in

Singapore  is  evident that the assumptions of  Mr  Jeyaretnam's

motion  cannot be true.  Singapore has successfully  transformed

itself  today into a regional media hub where CNBC,  ESPN,  MTV,

Discovery channel and many other international broadcasters have

set  up  bases  here.   Access to information  will  be  further

enhanced when Singapore One and CableVision are transmitted live

into the majority of homes in Singapore by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>

end  of  this  year.  These organisations are most sensitive  to

Government  controls and they will not thrive in  a  closed  and

controlled society.  If this happens, they will be the first  to

flee from it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has already been pointed out, I think this motion is

nonsensical.  There is no need for such a motion as there is  no

specification by the Government that newspapers are only allowed

to  be  printed by Singapore Press Holdings.  Indeed, under  the

Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, which Mr Jeyaretnam has just

described,  anyone can set up a newspaper company in  Singapore,

provided  they meet the shareholding criteria.  They  must  have

two  classes  of  shares, management and  ordinary  shares,  and

management  shares  have to be in the hands of  Singaporeans  or

organizations  approved  by  the  Government.   Any  shareholder

cannot  hold  more   than  3%  of  the  shares.   An  additional

criterion  is that the directors of this newspaper company  must

all  be  Singaporeans.  If indeed Mr Jeyaretnam can find  enough

Singaporeans to meet these criteria, he can set up a newspaper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been involved in the print media for many years and

I  believe that the print media has consolidated throughout  the

years  due to pure economic fundamentals.  With a population  of

only  three  million people and about 700,000-800,000 households

in  Singapore  and for reasons of economies of scale,  it  makes

more business sense for consolidation of the newspaper industry,

as  there  is  not enough advertising revenue or  readership  in

Singapore to make it viable for an alternative newspaper company

to   survive  financially  on  its  own.   There  is   currently

sufficient  competition  already as  we  can  access  the  major

newspapers and publications from all over the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would suggest to Mr Jeyaretnam that it is

simply  a  matter of financial economics that  has  led  to  the

present  status  quo  and not, as he has implied,  a  result  of

Government controls and pressure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the House to reject the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, for giving me this opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion calls for the Government to give an assurance

about  granting a newspaper licence to any company applying  for

one.   I  believe,  like  Mr Chew, this is  not  necessary.   My

understanding is that there have been no applications in  recent

years for any newspaper licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time an application was made was in April 1988 when the

Straits  Times Press Ltd applied for and was issued a permit  to

publish  the  New  Paper.  The difficulty in sustaining  another

daily   publication  as  a  viable  business  is   perhaps   the

disincentive  against another daily newspaper being  established

and  not  because  the Government is not willing  to  grant  the

licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asian cities do not find it easy to support two English language

daily  papers.   The  No. 2 daily newspaper is  only  marginally

profitable.   Examples are the Nation in Bangkok  and  the  Hong

Kong Standard.   And even the renowned Asian Wall Street Journal

lost money for over 10 years before it made any profit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if a bona fide application to start a newspaper was made and

denied,  then  perhaps Mr Jeyaretnam should ask  for  a  reason.

Otherwise,  we  cannot expect the Government to give  assurances

for  theoretical issues.  There will be no end to the number and

types of assurances which it will be asked to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I do believe in competition - between

companies,   and  certainly  between  newspapers.    Competition

already  exists for the private sector, and is being  introduced

for  state-owned monopolies.  GLCs which had natural  or  quasi-monopolies are also being encouraged to face competition.  In so

far  as  SPH  is a GLC, I believe it is healthy for it  to  face

competition, particularly since it has pretty much cornered  the

newspaper  business  in  Singapore.   As  a  consumer,  I  would

certainly welcome a competitor to start another daily, but  this

is not for us in this House nor the Government to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>

mandate.   I would only hope that if a serious-minded competitor

wishes  to challenge the Straits Times, the Government will  not

stand in the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for business competition. I believe that there is

another   issue  here  which  should  be  addressed,   ie,   the

competition  for  ideas.  Learning to evaluate  competing  ideas

helps  to  nurture  in  our  young the attributes  of  critical,

independent and analytical thinking which will be the basis  for

a  knowledge-based  economy.  If we truly wish  to  be  an  open

society,  capable  of  making sound  judgments  by  assessing  a

situation  from different angles and discerning the  substantive

from  the  fluff,  then we must encourage an  environment  which

enables a competition for ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I would encourage a competitor to the Straits

Times.   I  must quickly add here that judging from the increase

of  letters to the Editor over the past few years, Straits Times

had  indeed published many "alternative" views from Singaporeans

on  a  whole  range  of Government policies.  There  were  angry

protests  and clear rebuttals to public policies; the  Chinatown

theme destination was one recent example.  I applaud the Straits

Times  for printing the comments from the critics and the public

for  undertaking the initiative to write in and make their views

known.   For  me,  such  effort reflects a  growing  independent

thinking  among  Singaporeans who  want  more  say  in  national

policies.   And I urge all newspapers to continue to  give  more

space to Singaporeans to capture their different opinion pieces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I do not support the motion because it is framed

within  unclear terms of reference and postulates a  theoretical

situation  which has not occurred.  But I do wish  that  a  bona

fide  newspaper  company  will  step  forward  to  take  up  the

challenge to compete with SPH.  I hope the Government will grant

it  a  licence  to  operate as a business; then  we  should  let

Singaporeans, as intelligent readers, decide if it  can  survive

and flourish.  If this happens, Singaporeans will be all the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>

better  prepared in the new millennium to benefit  from,  rather

than be overwhelmed by, the intense competition of ideas arising

from the information explosion from the Internet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I give my qualified support to the motion that  we

should  be  ready  to  grant a licence to  a  newspaper  company

outside  the  Singapore Press Holdings and suggest reducing  the

current  laws  for management shares and special holding  rights

under  the  Newspaper  and  Printing Presses  Act.   However,  I

disagree  with some of the proposals made by Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam.

I am personally in favour of certain controls.  I cannot support

the  motion  that  no government control be  extended  over  the

publication  of  news.  We should maintain the present  controls

against   foreign   ownership  and   control   of   local   news

organisations.  Even in the US, while there is no ban on foreign

ownership of newspaper or cable system, a foreign entity may not

control  a  radio  or television outlet.  While  an  unregulated

press  is very much a feature of the media in the US, the  Voice

of  America  is still government-owned or controlled  which,  by

law,  is  not  allowed to broadcast within the  borders  of  the

United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, it would be better to be more protectionistic

and  not allow a completely unregulated press because foreigners

may not understand our unique nation building process, making it

easy for media to tear society apart.  They may not be aware  of

the  state  of our democratic and political culture which  means

that a completely free exchange in public can lead to extremism.

The  vulnerability of our small nation still needs a coordinated

national effort by the Government.  I also accept the view  that

the  Government  can  and should bring  its  influence  on  news

organisation.   The  Government has a mandate  to  set  a  broad

agenda.   It  is right for it to want the media to  support  the

agenda and do what it  can to persuade editors that it is right.

Government  intervention of the press can also be  justified  in

terms  of the influence to ensure that the Straits Times, Lianhe

Zaobao, Tamil

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2127</b></font><br><br>

Murasu,  Berita Harian play a broad-based national role and  not

succumb to ethnic and communal roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I support the proposal raised by the NCMP

to  allow the establishment of another newspaper company outside

the  SPH  and  urge the Government to review the  Newspaper  and

Printing  Presses Act, which currently allows the Government  to

appoint  management  shareholders of Singapore  Press  Holdings.

This has brought about an undesirable consequence that the Board

of Directors and, through them, the editors who are appointed by

the  Government  being generally perceived  as  biased  or  pro-Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: when does Government influence become

Government censorship?  The danger of Government having too much

power  over  the  press  is, instead  of  winning  arguments  by

persuading editors, which settles its case by force,  the  media

must fall in line.  This is not only unfair to the press and  to

the  public,  it  is also wrong because it can  make  Government

lazy.   It  removes an important check in policy discussion  and

debate.   After a while, Government officials may  believe  that

they  are  always  winning all the arguments  because  they  are

always  right  and forget that the real reason  is  because  the

press   is   not  allowed  to  counter  argue  too  strenuously.

Therefore,  press reform may be necessary to check  against  the

possible abuse of power by future governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual justification for media laws is the need to be

careful  with  racial,  religious  and  regional  sensitivities.

Today, most media professionals in Singapore have by now already

internalised  the  sensitivities.   If  controls   were   lifted

tomorrow, I doubt that they will go and start a riot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Chairman of the feedback group on mass media, I

frequently   receive  feedback  that  we  should  have   another

newspaper outside the SPH.  But Singaporeans are still generally

concerned  about  the negative repercussions  of  extremism  and

chauvinism.   In this regard, I support the existing  laws  that

limit what can and cannot be printed or broadcast in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>

Singapore.  This will ensure that a racially chauvinistic  press

will  not emerge.  Furthermore, there are provisions within  the

legal framework to handle undesirable or subversive press.   For

example,  the  Sedition  Act  which  prohibits  publication   or

speeches  that  exhibit  seditious tendencies,  the  Undesirable

Publications  Act which can ban publication contrary  to  public

interest,  and the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act which  can

restrict  the circulation of any publication sold in  Singapore.

These   provide   adequate   safeguards   against   chauvinistic

tendencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, Sir, what the reader wants is an independent

press or, on the other, the Government may want a press that  is

fully accountable to the state. This appears to be fundamentally

irreconcilable.  But my contention is that it is not necessarily

mutual  or  exclusive as it may first appear.  What is generally

misunderstood  is  the  role  journalists  play  in  maintaining

independence in ethical principles in respecting the conduct  of

the press.  This means recognition of the importance of fair and

balanced reporting in which opinions that differ from the writer

or  the  newspaper or the Government officials are  nevertheless

accurately   portrayed.   It  means   to   be   disciplined   in

deliberately  separating one's own opinion  from  the  objective

presentation of facts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam's view, I think journalists

in  Singapore have placed a high level of importance  on  public

service,  impartial  reporting and balanced  opinion.   But  the

Government  must  ask itself, even if the original  reasons  for

media  controls have to do with national security, is  this  the

way  media  controls are actually applied today?  There  is  the

danger that the present situation may in the future lead to  the

press  being  managed to make Government officials'  job  easier

because  decisions can be made with a minimum of fuss or debate.

If this is so, then it is time to review our media regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise a number of issues, hopefully, to

persuade the Government to review the present laws.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The concern that the local market is not big enough for

a  second or third newspaper company to survive.  I think it  is

more  appropriate for a private enterprise to decide and  should

be left to market forces.  Readers as citizens and consumers can

decide  for  themselves the newspaper that is  worthy  of  their

trust and patronage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Competition can bring about not only diversity of views but

generate creativity and efficiency in management and operations.

As  the  bulk  of revenues from newspaper companies  comes  from

advertising, increased competition is more likely to bring about

more benefits to consumers.  We must be aware of the dangers  of

monopolies as they are seldom efficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The belief that ideas must be able to conflict with one

another and given a chance to be heard because participation and

disagreement  in shaping public policy is an important  part  of

our nation building process and, certainly, an important concept

of  publication, otherwise newspapers will not be able to fulfil

adequately their role as mirror of society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) There is also the fear that competition may lead to an

adversarial  press  and  Government  relationship,  as  in  some

foreign  examples,  leading to being a watchdog  of  Government.

The  press  is  constantly  on  the  lookout  for  mistakes   of

Government.   But  we  must view debate quite  differently  from

adversarial arguments, debate as a necessary value in the search

for  a  solution  to common problems.  It presupposes  that  the

debaters are worried by the same questions.  It brings new  life

and ideas and facts and makes possible a  better solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) While the press in Singapore is generally credited for a

reliable  and accurate source of information, it suffers,  quite

unfairly, some credibility problems when it comes to coverage of

local domestic issues.  Readers have learnt to read between  the

lines.   Unfortunately,  bad  news about  opposition  are  often

regarded as politically motivated even when they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>

are not.   Having an alternative or independent newspaper can do

much to remove this credibility gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press reforms can also lead to a more vibrant community-based

newspaper,  something which I believe is  much  needed  here  in

Singapore  as  part of our effort to forge a stronger  community

spirit  amongst  neighbours.  This  is  especially  relevant  in

Singapore as housing redevelopment has uprooted families to  new

neighbourhoods.   A community-based newspaper is  able  to  make

people  aware  of  their surroundings and the changes  that  are

taking  place.   They can do things that national newspapers  do

not.  They can help instill a sense of belonging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these are not sufficient to assure the Government, I suggest

that  we  can  introduce other relevant measures as  applied  in

some  other countries.  In the UK, for example, there is a Press

Complaint  Commission  which is a voluntary  non-statutory  body

established  and funded by the newspaper and magazine  industry,

which   considers,   adjudicates,   conciliates   and   resolves

complaints  of unfair treatment by the press, and  ensures  that

the  press  maintains  the highest professional  standards  with

respect  for  generally recognised freedom, notably  freedom  of

expression,  the  public's right to know and the  right  of  the

press to operate and free from improper pressure.  Newspaper and

magazine conduct is judged against a code of practice.  This has

been  drafted by editors and agreed by the industry and ratified

by  the  Commission.   Its  members  are  editors  of  national,

regional and local newspapers and magazines and also from  other

fields, including Members of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, libel laws and self-appointed press monitors act as

checks  and  balances against journalistic excesses both  inside

and outside the industry.  Some newspapers appoint ombudsman  to

investigate  public  complaints and publish  self-criticism  and

enforce internal standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are those in Singapore who view that the media in US

is dangerously

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>

adversarial, very few mass circulation newspapers, magazines and

broadcast   stations  are  in  fact  affiliated  with  political

organisations.  In fact, purposeful non-affiliation has been the

hallmark  of  American press characterised by both  professional

pride   and   independence  arising  from  self  and   economics

sufficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the state of our society, Sir, we can and should

have  an  independent press, though not necessarily unregulated.

We  can  have an ideological non-partisan newspaper, though  not

one with political affiliation.  We can have a sparkling debate,

as  Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam says, though not an adversarial one.   We

can  have a paper that mirrors the diverse views of our society,

yet  not with the self-appointed watchdog of Government.  If  we

do  not have it now, we should work progressively to have it  in

the  future.  But press reform must be made part and  parcel  of

this process.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  first  of  all,  I must say I am very  impressed  by  your

patience for listening to the very long and repetitive speech of

the NCMP which went on for one full hour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an open society, it is important that Singapore possesses a

news media which is objective, fair, pragmatic, responsible  and

independent  and  which enjoys the freedom of speech.   This  is

because  it  will  facilitate  the mutual  transmission  of  the

correct  signals,  the  exchange of  views  and  arguments,  and

dissemination  of  latest  science  and  technology  among   the

Government,  the  social organisations and  the  people  of  the

various  races,  and  even  with the international  communities.

Personally,  I  admire  the  important  roles  played   by   our

newspapers  such  as the Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao,  Business

Times, Shin Min Daily News, Lianhe Wanbao, The New Paper, Berita

Harian  and Tamil Murasu.   As independent and responsible  news

media  of  Singapore,  they have spared no effort  in  promoting

Singapore's development into an open and progressive society.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition Members complain that they are not getting

enough coverage in our local newspapers.  On the other hand,  my

PAP colleagues often remark that the opposition members seem  to

attract more attention from the local press than they do.   Even

as  the Deputy Chairman of the GPC for MITA, my picture does not

appear in the newspapers as much as the opposition members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe every newspaper has its own standards and guidelines,

and  our  journalists certainly know their job.  We  cannot  say

that  they  do  not  have  freedom of speech  and  we  want  the

Government  to  liberalise the issue of more  permits  for  more

newspapers to be published in Singapore.  I do not think this is

a  sensible  argument and I cannot agree with it.   I  therefore

oppose the motion tabled by the NCMP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, journalism is a sacred job. The

birth and growth of a newspaper is closely related to the degree

of  support  it receives from its faithful readers.   Whether  a

newspaper is successful or not, it is dependent not only on  its

format and design, its sophisticated printing or its interesting

contents,  it is also on whether it is responsible, whether  its

arguments  are  independent and free, and on the professionalism

of  its  journalists.   In addition,  and more  importantly,  it

would   also  depend  on  whether  the  inclination  and  social

consciousness  represented  or reflected  by  the  newspaper  is

accepted by the people or not, and whether the vast majority  of

the  readers  hold  the  view that this newspaper  is  credible,

reliable and readable.  This is something that is decided by the

market  situation.  It is not something that the Government  can

manipulate or influence.  If the market has a need and it  feels

that  more  newspapers  should  be  published,  I  believe   the

publishers will naturally make the necessary application to  the

Government.    So  long  as  they  comply  with  the   necessary

requirement,  their  application will be approved.   This  is  a

business activity and conduct.  I do not think Parliament  needs

to be bothered about it.   Nowadays, with all these gloomy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>

economic  downturns around us, I think it would do us  well  for

Parliament  to  spend  time discussing how  to  tide  over  this

economic crisis. This is the really important issue.  We  should

not waste time talking about such unimportant matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the circulation figures I have obtained, the major

newspapers  in  Singapore  have a large  readership.   In  other

words,  their independence, their reliability and their  freedom

of speech have been supported by the readers.  This is evidenced

by  the  daily circulation figures of the various newspapers  in

1997.   For Straits Times the figure is 376,900; Lianhe  Zaobao,

199,300;  Shin Min Daily News, 111,600; Lianhe Wanbao,  132,200;

and Business Times, only 33,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government wants to control all these newspapers, how can

the  contents  of  all these newspapers be so eventful,  with  a

hundred  flowers blossom, a hundred schools of thought  contend?

Besides, before the Government considers issuing the licence for

a  new  newspaper to be published, we should also  consider  the

future of our journalists.  With an additional newspaper, it may

have some adverse effect on their salaries and remuneration.  If

the  circulation drops, and if the newspaper cannot  grow,  then

their  rice bowl would be in danger.  Now that we are facing  an

economic  crisis,  we have to look after their  rice  bowl.   We

should  not use our own perception of freedom to cause  harm  to

them.   Mr Jeyaretnam's perception of freedom cannot be used  to

feed these people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have been in the publication

industry  for  more than 20 years.  There is one  motto  in  our

publication  industry.  It says that if you want  to  kill  your

friend  or  your enemy, the best method is to encourage  him  to

invest  in  starting  a newspaper.  Because  in  Singapore,  the

market  is small, our population is small, and investment  in  a

newspaper is a very heavy one.  It is not just $1 million or  $2

million - much more than that, and the risk is high!  Every  day

you have to publish.  Yesterday's paper, even if you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>

cannot  sell  it,  you would have to print  today's  paper.  And

today's paper, you do not know whether you can sell or not,  but

tomorrow you will still have to publish.  Whether your newspaper

can  sell or not, you have to edit, you have to write, you  have

to   print  every  day.   Finally,  if  you  cannot  sell   your

newspapers,  you sell them cheaply to the karang guni  man.  The

newspaper business is very, very capital-intensive.  If you want

your  friend  or  your  enemy to die,  the  best  method  is  to

encourage him to start a newspaper!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that Mr Jeyaretnam could understand this motto of

the  publication industry.  Do not encourage people to  start  a

newspaper.  You will be causing much harm to them.  According to

the  motion  by  Mr  Jeyaretnam, the  most  ideal  newspaper  or

publication  in  Singapore  perhaps  is  The  Hammer,  that   is

published by the Workers' Party.  The Hammer is published  under

his  control.   Whatever  he writes, it  can  be  published  and

hopefully  it  will  enjoy  good circulation.   Maybe  they  are

selling more than the Straits Times or the Lianhe Zaobao.  I  do

not  know.   I am not sure.  It is not easy.  I think  he  knows

best whether it is selling well or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, whether the newspaper comes under

the  Singapore Press Holdings or under another syndicate, it  is

not  important.   The most important question  is  whether  this

newspaper  could  report  in a fair, objective  and  independent

manner.  Whether it could receive support from the readers, that

is  the  most important thing! I feel that our local  newspapers

have also attained this.  In view of that, I think we should not

waste our time discussing the NCMP's motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Peh Chin Hua says the

newspaper  in  Singapore  is eventful, with  a  hundred  flowers

blossom, and a hundred schools of thought contend.  But we  must

not  forget that there is actually only one newspaper, that  is,

the  Singapore Press Holdings (SPH).  Our Secretary-General  has

mentioned a while ago that the Chairman of SPH was a former  PAP

Cabinet  Minister  and its Executive Director was  formerly  the

Director of the Internal Security Department.  He said that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>

Singapore newspapers are like a hundred flowers blossom.     But

in  fact,  it is only one single flower blooming.  One  solitary

stalk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh also talked about the readability and readership of a

newspaper being dependent on whether a newspaper is responsible,

independent  or not, and he used  the daily circulation  figures

to  say  that  our  Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao  have  great

support from a very large readership.  But he has forgotten,  in

Singapore, our  readers have no other choices - Straits Times or

Lianhe  Zaobao.  If you want to read the newspapers,  these  are

the  only  newspapers you can get!  So if you are talking  about

circulation figures and say, well, they are supported by a large

following of  readers, and you say they are independent, I think

there is no logic to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we are talking about the present

situation  of  newspapers  in  Singapore  and  claim  that   our

population  now  is too small to support more  newspapers  here,

then  let  us  not  forget that long before our  population  has

attained  the  present state, we had at least two major  Chinese

newspapers,  the  Sin Chew Jit Poh and the  Nanyang  Siang  Pau.

Later on, we had Shin Min  which was originally independent, but

eventually it also became part of the Singapore Press  Holdings.

I  do  not know whether this merger was due to  economic reasons

or  because  of some political pressure causing them  to  merge.

However,   what is very apparent to us is, as what  Mr  Peh  has

said  just now, it is a question of rice bowl.  How much control

there  is  on the newspaper, I would not be able to  say.   Only

those  who are working in the newspaper company will know.   But

very  obviously  under  our Newspaper and Printing  Presses  Act

there  are certain restrictions, and the big bosses of SPH  have

close relationship with the Government.  So, if you work in  the

newspapers,  if  your reporting causes some unhappiness  to  the

Government, will it affect your rice bowl or not?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Government would say, "In the past, although it was

possible  for us to do so, we have never directed the newspapers

as to what they should do."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>

Very often, we say, "Well, if you know how to earn a living; you

should know what to do.  You know who your bosses are, you  know

what  their  preferences are."  But, of course, I am not  saying

that  our reporters and editors are all like that.  But I  think

everyone  has  his conscience.  I believe they  have  their  own

judgement.    But  because  of  this  law  and  this  management

structure,  there is a certain psychological pressure  on  them.

Although the Government may not have to direct them what to  do,

they  have  to form their own judgement.  There is an intangible

pressure on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They themselves know there are certain things they cannot

put  in  the newspapers. This is what they call self-censorship.

The impression given to people is that the newspaper is just the

voice  of the Government.  For different newspapers, whether  it

is  Zaobao or Wanbao, reports on an event, more often  than not,

will  turn out to be carrying the same mood, the same sentiment,

the same view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if there is any company or entrepreneur who wants to start a

newspaper, I think the Government should take an open  mind  and

issue  a  permit to him.  Although now with advanced technology,

there  are different media, for example, the Internet, TV, etc.,

the  newspaper is still the most popular news medium and a  very

important  one.   Whether  it  is  independent,  whether  it  is

reliable, whether its reporting is balanced, would have  a  very

important effect on the development of the society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Peh said that the opposition parties were well

covered  in  the  newspapers.   Let  us  look  at  the  reports,

particularly those covering the General Elections - the election

rallies.  This coverage is very important, because  Singaporeans

must  be well informed before they make their decisions and cast

their  votes.   If  anyone is to sit down  and  do  a  thorough,

objective analysis of the coverage of all these election rallies

in  the  local  newspapers,  it will be very obvious  where  the

balance  was.   At  other times, of course, the newspapers  have

different  emphasis  and different focus.   But  I  believe  the

readers  are very clear.  We have different views and  different

perspectives

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>

of  the  balance of reporting in our Singapore newspapers.   Are

the  Singapore newspapers biased?  Is their reporting  balanced?

I  think  the readers know best.  This question is best answered

by the general  newspaper readers in Singapore.

<br>7.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Information  and  the  Arts (Encik Yatiman  Yusof):   Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I rise on behalf of the Minister to  oppose  the

motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I was in Nevada in the early 80s, being

invited  by the American Press Institute to take up a  newspaper

editing course at the University of Nevada in the west coast  of

US.   The  content  of  lectures that I had  heard  during  that

course, about 18 years ago, ring familiar with the remarks  made

by the NMP today.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> NCMP!

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> NCMP, I am sorry. Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  Singapore is an open society and an international  trading

and  financial centre.  As a financial centre, our markets  must

be  as  up  to  date as other major financial centres,  such  as

London, New York or Tokyo.  Singapore's economy is powered by  a

free  flow of information.  In recent years, we have also become

a  media hub.  Today, no city in Asia has the same ready  access

to  news  wires, magazines, newspapers, television channels  and

the Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently over 40 cable TV channels in Singapore, of

which  more than three-quarters are foreign channels transmitted

"live"  through the Singapore Cable Vision (SCV).  These include

news  channel like CNN, BBC and CNBC.  The BBC has a 24-hour  FM

radio  service  operating  in  Singapore.   International   news

agencies, such as Reuters, Bloomberg, AP, AFP and Nikkei are all

represented in Singapore.  Singapore is also served by  numerous

foreign  newspaper magazines.  The well-known  ones  among  over

5,000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>

foreign  publications like Time, The Economist, The  Asian  Wall

Street Journal have significant circulations here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, including the Opposition, have many channels of

communication.   No  matter how they argue  about  the  coverage

during   the  election,  Opposition  Members  can  hold   public

meetings,  publish  party  newsletters,  write  books  and  host

Internet  websites.   The  fact is that Singaporeans  have  many

avenues for the free exchange of ideas and views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is such a diversity of news and information

services,  we  need a "Singapore" perspective.   The  NMPs,  Mdm

Chiang  and  Mr Zulkifli, may use different languages  but  both

believe  that  there is this need for a "Singapore" perspective.

This   "Singapore"  perspective  is  important   to   hold   us,

Singaporeans,  together.  This is nothing  new.   Every  region,

every  country  in  the  world, would like  to  have  their  own

perspective.  Whether it is in the Middle East during the Middle

East  War, or even during the Falklands War, there is  need  for

the  countries in the region to establish their point  of  view,

their  perspective  and  to convince the  world  that  there  is

another viewpoint.  And for Singapore, such perspective is  even

more crucial because Singapore is a compact city-state populated

by people of different races, languages, religions and cultures.

Racial  and  religious emotions can easily  be  whipped  up  and

passions inflamed by irresponsible rabble rousing.  We also live

in  a complicated region which requires us to manage our foreign

relations in a sensitive way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Singapore has managed the information flow by not

blocking it.  And we believe in it.  We would not block  it  but

by stating our point of view in competition with the world view.

So  our local media understand this position and they share this

position.    Our  newspapers  have  a  "Singapore"  perspective,

seeking to forge consensus and facilitate nation-building.  They

understand that they best serve Singapore by accurate reporting,

clear  analysis  and  intelligent  interpreting  of  events  and

developments through Singapore eyes for Singapore minds.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local press, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, has not adopted an

adversarial  role  just  because  news  organisations  in   some

countries have done so.  Singapore does not subscribe to the  US

model  of the press as a "fourth estate".  We have never and  we

will  never.  I am happy to note that the NMP, Mr Zulkifli  too,

believes in a non-adversarial press.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is in the interest of Singapore to have a press that

reports accurately and objectively.  The press can disagree  and

debate  on  national  policies with  the  Government,  encourage

public  dialogue  and convey divergent viewpoints.   We  do  not

control  the press.  We do not control what the press publishes.

They are free to publish what they want based on their editorial

policy  and  professional judgement, provided  they  uphold  and

protect  our national interests and national cohesiveness.   For

our  society  to hold together, it needs institutions  and  high

points   which  citizens  look  up  to.   The  media   has   the

responsibility  to preserve these high points and  not  diminish

them unnecessarily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public surveys have shown that the local press is well regarded

by  Singaporeans.  Its credibility among Singaporeans is  higher

than the credibility of the established Western newspapers among

their own readers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam, calls upon the Government to announce

its  readiness  to grant a licence to a newspaper  company.   As

pointed  out  by  the  NMP, Mdm Claire Chiang,  it  is  academic

because  it  is a hypothetical question.  The party has  yet  to

submit  a  request.   I  would like to inform  Members  in  this

Chamber that in March last year in this House, during the Budget

debate, the Minister for Information and the Arts stated that if

the  market  can  accommodate another  newspaper,  we  will  not

disallow  it.   Like existing newspapers, a new  newspaper  must

operate within the NPPA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One requirement is that newspapers published in Singapore

must  not  come under foreign control as they must feel  a  deep

sense   of  responsibility  for  Singapore.   They  must   guard

Singapore's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>

interest  when  dealing with sensitive issues such  as  defence,

internal security, race, language and religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspapers which circulate widely here must also give

Government  the  right of reply, a subject which  the  NCMP  had

raised earlier.  We do not stop reports which disagree with  the

Government.   As an international trading and financial  centre,

it  is not in our interest to stop such reports.  But local  and

foreign  newspapers must allow the Government to  correct  their

unfair  or  inaccurate reports.  This is important  because  the

Government  must be able to put across its case to  Singaporeans

to which it is responsible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question is whether the local

newspaper  is  partisan as it does not, as both of  them  claim,

give the Opposition sufficient coverage during the GE.  This  is

a   matter  of  opinion.   Many  of  our  fellow  PAP  MPs  were

complaining that they were not given enough coverage,  far  much

less  than the Opposition during the GE.  On one-to-one, on  per

square  inch covered by the newspapers during the GE, I can  bet

the  Opposition  got  far  more  coverage  than  the  Government

candidate.  Let us measure the pages, see the pictures, and  see

its quantum coverage, including the heading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the NCMP, in his long speech, said that

press  freedom  is the hallmark of a civil society  and  insists

that  a  free  press is an important institution to achieve  the

targeted  freedom of expression.  Let me remind the hon.  Member

that  in any country, America included, there must be some rules

pertaining to expression.  I read a report some time  ago,  when

Rupert  Murdoch wanted to buy a radio and TV network in America,

he  could  not do so because he is not an American.   He  is  an

Australian.   So  I  think it is not fair to impose  demands  on

Singapore  when  in other countries, where the NCMP  had  quoted

widely  on  the so-called right of expression and freedom,  they

are also having their own rules.  And we understand that this is

highly   necessary  for  a  society  to  have  some  regulation,

otherwise  it would not work.  He argued by saying  that  people

have the right to know.  Is he saying that the local

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>

press  which  have shared increased circulation over  the  years

have  been  denying the readers from the information  that  they

were  looking for?  If that is the case, is it not only  logical

for  the  readers to react by not buying the newspaper and  thus

reducing  the  circulation?  If that is  the  case,  how  do  we

reconcile  the  point raised by my colleague, Mr Peh  Chin  Hua,

that  the circulation of all the newspapers, The Straits  Times,

Lianhe Zaobao, Berita Harian had increased?  Lack of choice?   I

think the answer is quite clear.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Lack of choice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, order. Mr Jeyaretnam, at least for

this  debate,  I  believe all MPs have sat down  listening  very

carefully to you.  So would you do the same?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sorry, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.

If  that  is  the  case, in an open market, in  a  free  market,

readers would react and the readers' reaction did not confirm Mr

Jeyaretnam's assertion that they are being deprived  and  denied

of  information.  So where is the logic of his argument?  And he

argued that his principle of freedom of information and press is

not  only  western-oriented, it is  being  practised  in  India,

Thailand  and Sri Lanka.  I just want to ask him this  question:

yes,  I  agree, but at what cost?  Look at Sri Lanka, India  and

Thailand.   They find great difficulties in achieving  consensus

and   moving  the  society  towards  one  direction,   therefore

providing long-term benefit to every individual in society.   Is

that  not  a  more basic right than merely giving the  right  of

expression?  So these are the points which, I believe, must have

been  misread by the NCMP and I hope his presentation would  not

influence our mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he argued too that in order to be democratic, we must

believe  in  what SM had said in 1950s and 1960s.   We  have  to

accept  that time has changed and it requires intelligent-minded

people, rational people who believe in the future

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>

of  the  society,  to  think along the line  where  the  overall

benefit of the community is being secured first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many speakers had used the NPPA as an argument. I think all of

them, except one, used this argument either to hint that because

of  the  NPPA  and  the presence of the management  shares,  the

editors  and journalists are afraid, as what Mr Low Thia  Khiang

said,  that the "rice bowl" factor can cause them to think twice

and  protect their interest.  I was an editor before,  for  many

years.   I must confess to the House that under no circumstances

did  I move away from performing my duty as a responsible editor

of a newspaper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take some time to explain this management

share  and  the  fear,  implication  and  imputation  that   the

management shares had been the key factor in -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) resulting with the Straits Times or SPH group losing

its credibility among its readers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the feeling of fear among the editors, hence, self-censorship among them;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the income from advertisers; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the belief that editors can be changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked for some figures on these, the total list of the SPH

shares.  The management shares that we are talking about - every

newspaper  will have two types of shares:  ordinary  shares  and

management  shares.  For each management share, the holder  will

have 200 votes.  Let us go through the figures.  The SPH has, as

I  was told, about 3.4 million management shares, multiplied  by

200, it is translated into 740 million votes.  Out of these  740

million  votes,  two-thirds  of  the  votes  belong  to  private

companies.   Only  one-third of the votes, of  these  management

shares,  are owned by the Singapore Telecommunications  Limited,

the  DBS, POSB - three major banks plus people that the NCMP had

named, such as Mr Lim Kim San, Mr Michael Fam, Mr Lee Hee  Seng,

Mr  Wee  Cho  Yaw, Mr Tang I-Fang, Mr Tjong Yik Min,  Mr  Cheong

Choong Kong.  These individuals of 10 persons

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>

have total votes of 2,000.  Together with these Government-owned

companies and the 10 people, we have not more than one-third  of

the  share.  With one-third of the share, can we vote to  change

the  director  or the editor of a newspaper?  Simple  arithmetic

will say that this is not possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Government has no control whatsoever over the

appointment  of  the editor or director of the SPH  because  the

remaining  two-thirds of the voting powers are in the  hands  of

private  companies  such  as the Great Eastern  Life  Assurance,

OCBC,  Overseas Assurance Corporation Limited, UOB, OUB,  Fraser

and  Neave.  These are companies with tremendous credential  and

they were successful because of their independent mindedness and

these are the groups that are holding majority share in the SPH.

I  think once and for all, let us go through the figure, compute

and   see  whether  all  these  assumptions,  presumptions   and

imputations are true indeed.  But let me assure you,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, that this is not so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the speech made by the NMP, Mr Zulkifli, I am

encouraged to hear that Mr Zulkifli feels an unfettered press is

not for Singapore and that some checks and guidelines need to be

in  place.   In his speech, he gave six reasons why he supported

the   motion.   He  believes  that  there  should   be,   first,

competition,  and  second, there must be debate  and  newspapers

must  provide these two elements - debate and competition.   His

third  and  fourth points are inter-related.   He  talked  about

having  an independent but non-adversarial newspaper and claimed

that  the  Board  of Directors and the editor  of  the  SPH  are

generally perceived as biased or pro-Government.  And  for  that

reason, amongst others, the SPH has credibility problem with its

readers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained in terms of numbers, management shares which

have  been shrouded in darkness, that is not so.  The Government

does  not appoint editors or the Board of Directors, though  the

Government's  approval  is  required  for  any  person  to  hold

management shares.  The whole point of management shares is so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>

that newspapers, which are important national institutions,  are

run  responsibly in the interest of Singapore.  Today, as I said

earlier, the majority of the management shares are held  in  the

hands  of the private people, by established corporations  which

are   among  those  which  have  significantly  contributed   to

Singapore's success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, Mr Zulklifi also talked about setting up of a Press

Commission  or,  what he said, a Press Council.   In  Singapore,

many  different  professions  have come  together  to  establish

bodies to cater to their respective professional interests,  set

guidelines  to self-regulate their industry and so  forth.   For

example,  the advertising industry has come together to  set  up

ASAS   and   the  broadcasters  have  set  up  the  Broadcasters

Association of Singapore.  If the media fraternity  is  keen  on

setting  up  a body like a Press Council or Press Commission,  I

think it is for them to decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he suggested that by providing freer environment, there

could  be a community-based newspaper being set up at the  local

level,  say,  town council.  I would like to assure  the  Member

that, as the Minister has assured during the Budget Debate,  the

avenue  is  open.   And if it is commercially viable,  why  not?

Somebody  should take the lead.  But we should leave it  to  the

town council or the regional council to decide.  Currently,  the

town  councils  I  understand,  are  having  their  own  monthly

bulletins.  If some of them thought that they could run a  daily

or  weekly publication, it is up to them and I think MITA  would

look at their application seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to comment on views expressed by other

speakers.   Mr Low Thia Khiang said that the SPH newspapers  are

like  flowers  blooming  from  one  stem,  if  I  may  translate

correctly his metaphor.  But he again insinuated that it was not

independent and casts doubts on the merger of the Sin  Chew  Jit

Poh  and Nanyang Siang Pao into Lianhe Zaobao and asked why Shin

Min  decided not to be together.  I think the people who run the

newspapers will have valid commercial consideration  as  to  why

Shin Min must

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>

remain  Shin Min and not being bound together and why  Sin  Chew

Jit  Poh  and Nanyang Siang Pao are kept together.  In Malaysia,

where  they  have a similar paper, they remain so.  It  is  best

that  we do not speculate because I believe that it is purely  a

business consideration.  The question of NPPA, big bosses having

close  relationship with the Government and  the  psychology  of

fear  and  the  rice bowl issues that he played up,  as  I  have

pointed  out  earlier,  have  no  basis  because  I  myself  had

experienced that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the points made by Mdm Claire Chiang, I respect her

position that she believes that there must be competition and an

alternative view prevailing in Singapore.  But she leaves it for

the  market to decide whether this competition and provision  of

alternative  view via the press could be sustained commercially.

But  when we talk about competition of ideas, the press  is  not

the  only media where such competition could take place.  People

are  talking  about having a Hyde Park corner in  Singapore  for

free  speech.  In fact, our Internet is far more effective, more

blunt,  and  a more frank form of Hyde Park and it  spreads  far

beyond  the shores of Singapore.  I think that is the avenue  in

which  everyone  can  move  into  and  use.   The  Minister,  in

answering a question earlier, had said that we do not think that

we  should  apply  high-handedness in imposing  censorship.   So

there is such a thing as an alternative media for us to go into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons I have stated, I urge Members of this

Chamber to reject the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am most grateful

for  the  views  that  have been expressed in  this  House  this

afternoon  and particularly, I welcome the views that have  been

expressed by the two NMPs.  But before I reply to some of  these

points,  may  I make it quite clear that I am not advocating  or

encouraging that control of our newspapers, the press, should be

left  in the hands of foreigners.  I thought that was clear from

what I said.  It should be left in the hands of our people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>

but  not  in  the  hands  of  the Government.   The  fallacy  in

Singapore is the impression that is sought to be created by  the

Government,  that if you are a true Singaporean, if  you  are  a

loyal  Singaporean,  then  you have  got  to  be  loyal  to  the

government of the day.  That is a complete fallacy.  It  is  the

duty  of  a  citizen if he thinks that the Government  is  doing

anything  that  is wrong, it is his bounden duty to  oppose  the

Government, not to shout "Aye, aye, aye" to everything that  the

Government  says.   And in opposing the Government,  he  is  not

disloyal to Singapore.  On the contrary, he is showing where his

loyalty  lies, with the people.  So, let us make it quite  clear

that  I  am not advocating that the control of our papers should

be placed in the hands of foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating that the press should be completely

unregulated and should be free to publish seditious material  or

material  that might jeopardise the harmony that exists  between

the  various  communities or the different religious communities

in  Singapore.  But we have the laws of the land which take care

of  that.  And any newspaper which falls foul of this law can be

taken  to  task  and prosecuted, and then, if necessary,  if  it

continues, have its licence taken away.  The problem,  I  think,

in  Singapore, is the equation of the perspective  of  Singapore

and  the  national  interests and the  goals  for  Singapore  is

equated to what the Government, the party in power, decides what

perspective it should be, what the national interest should  be,

what  the  goals should be.  This is, as I said,  the antithesis

of democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of power should remain with the people and it is the

people  who should decide what the national interests are,  what

the  goals  are.  In this task of the people, the  duty  of  the

people, the press has an important role to play, as their voice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli also mentioned, as I did, about the establishment of

a  council.  We should think very seriously of moving away  from

Government  regulation of the press to the public regulation  of

the press.  As I said, this was voiced in 1974 that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>

Government had been thinking of a press council, but nothing has

come  of  it.  It is time we set up a press council in Singapore

composed, as I said, not of people who see things the  way  that

the  PAP  sees  it or the Government sees it,  but  who  see  it

independently for Singapore as to what is good for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I come to reply to the points raised by the various

speakers.  The first speaker mentioned about Government  control

in  Singapore being very minimal.  The perception, as  has  been

mentioned by the Member for Hougang, among Singaporeans is  that

the  press  speaks  only  for  the  Government  and  it  is  the

Government's voice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this Government control exists not by perhaps

Government issuing orders day by day to the editors and  to  the

journalists  in  the papers in Singapore, but the self-restraint

or  censorship  that is practised by the press themselves.   You

may  recall,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think you  were  in  the

House  then when I was here, when one paper, I think it was  the

Business  Times or was it another paper, carried a  very  strong

editorial on the pronouncement by the late Minister for National

Development,  Mr Teh Cheang Wan, that opposition  constituencies

would be attended to last when it came to breakdowns of lifts or

other emergency services.  The editorial took a very strong line

against it, but what happened?  Within two hours or three hours,

that  issue  was  recalled and another issue was  published.   I

brought  this  up  in the House and I think it  was  the  Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary who spoke on that and asked  whether  I

was  certain of what I was talking.  Then I was fortunate enough

to hand to him and to this House the earlier paper that had come

out  with a strong editorial.  I do not know, and we will  never

know, whether that was because of a Government telephone call or

a  directive or whether it was a decision taken by those who ran

the paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another instance, of course, that will be familiar to

Members,  of  the feature writer who wrote quite a mild  article

about  the  disaffection among the people with the PAP  and  the

Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>

I  mentioned  this in our earlier debate.  Then  what  happened?

She  ceased to write for the Straits Times.  She was  no  longer

writing.   We  are  not  to know whether  it  was  a  Government

decision or whether it was a decision imposed by those who  have

control of the Straits Times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof. Tommy Koh observed in 1991, the press in Singapore has

been  under a cloud of fear, and that is how Government  control

is  maintained.   We  do  not need directives  issued  from  the

Government  to  the  press  every day.   I  think  it  was  Lord

Thompson, who controls the Thompson group of newspapers, who was

asked,  "Do  you control what is published in your  newspapers?"

He  said, "No, I don't.  There is no need for me to exercise any

control  because of the editors and the men who run the  papers.

They know their duties and they will carry them out."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to Madam Chiang for her perhaps qualified support.

But  she  mentioned  that  the motion was  academic  because  no

application had been received.  I think it misses the point.   I

do  not  think any self-respecting person will want to apply  to

run  a newspaper in Singapore after seeing what happened to  the

Singapore Herald, the Eastern Standard, the Eastern Sun and  all

the other papers that have now gone off the scene.

the  credibility of Singapore papers is high among Singaporeans.

I  do  not  know how he comes to that conclusion.   I  have  met

several  people  who  have told me that they  do  not  read  the

Straits  Times, that they do not read the local press  and  they

are  quite  happy to depend on other broadcasts,  the  BBC,  for

example, for news.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Thank you, Mr Jeyaretnam. There was

an  academic  study conducted in 1995 on the perception  of  the

domestic  press in Singapore. This study has shown that overall,

about 70% of the random sample of people approached thought that

the  quality  of  the local newspapers was good  and  only  3.5%

thought that the quality was bad or very bad.  More than 36%  of

those surveyed said that they had a lot of confidence, some  54%

had  some  confidence,  and  less than  10%  had  little  or  no

confidence  in  our  newspapers.  I felt  that  the  independent

survey conducted by an academician is a clear indication of  the

kind of support that the newspapers are getting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Senior Parliamentary Secretary refers to

the  survey.  I do not know whether I have seen this survey, but

the  question is: who was approached for this survey and to whom

were  the questions addressed?  We have to know a lot more about

it.   But may I assure him that he has only got to go and  speak

to the average Singaporean to ask what he thinks of the press in

Singapore  to  find out in what esteem they hold  the  Singapore

press.   I think he will find a great unanimity among the people

in  Singapore  that the press in Singapore speaks only  for  the

Government.  I have had people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>

sending  me  copies  of letters that they have  written  to  the

Straits Times which they said these were never published.   They

send them to me.  I have got quite a number of those letters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, I think we are

dragging  the debate a bit too far.  Can you come  to  some  new

is:  come  to  a new point, otherwise you will be dragging  this

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> As you please, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. If

you  think we should wrap up, I will wrap up.  But I want to try

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right. Do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> If you think we should wrap up, I will sit

down.  The Senior Parliamentary Secretary says Singaporeans have

great  many  opportunities  for  speaking  up  or  disseminating

information.   He  says  opposition  parties  can  hold   public

meetings.  They do not have to rely on the Straits Times.   What

is  the  reality?  There is an opposition leader  who  is  being

prosecuted  because  he  tried to hold  a  public  meeting.   It

ignores the realities in Singapore to say that Singaporeans  are

free  to speak up and to disseminate information.  We are  still

dependent  on a free press to speak up for us, and that  is  not

happening in Singapore.  So long as the press remains under this

iron   grip  of  the  Government,  we  are  not  going  to   get

information.  That is why it is important that we now  take  the

step  to  see that our people get the information that they  are

entitled   to,   information  of  Government   activities,   the

transparency   that   the  Government   keeps   talking   about,

transparency in Government administration.  That is  simply  not

happening  in  Singapore because we do not have  an  independent

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<div align="center"><b>BUILDING OF MORE NURSING HOMES</b></div>

<br>7.51 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to consider the need for more nursing homes  to  be

built  in  Singapore as a matter of urgency and also to evaluate

the  grounds  for  accelerating rather than shelving  plans  for

building more nursing homes during the current economic climate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was perturbed when the Straits Times published the

shelving  of redevelopment plans for the Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital

and  Nursing  Home recently.  The Ministry of  Health  is  still

committed,  in principle, to fund the proposed redevelopment  of

the project.  However, the funds will only be made available for

the  project  in  the next year or two.  This  will  necessarily

cause  the  project  to be shelved for the moment.   The  reason

given  for  this  course  of action was that  the  total  budget

allocation for development projects for the next few  years  has

been cut because of the current economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to beseech the Ministry of Health for a

reappraisal of the situation and seek a positive response for  a

change   in  direction  and  emphasis  towards  this   area   of

healthcare.   Sir,  I  would  like  to  try  and  influence  the

decisions  of  this House and the Minister for Health  with  the

following reasons:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We are facing a shortfall of nursing-home beds now.

There  are  about  4,700 nursing-home beds available  while,  in

fact,  we need about 6,000 beds.  We are short of 1,300 even  as

of  now.   The  need  for more nursing-home beds  will  increase

exponentially  due to our fast-ageing population.  It  has  been

suggested  that  we  will meet an increase in  demand  of  about

22,000  such beds by the year 2030.  There is really a need  for

this  big  task of providing a further 15,000 nursing-home  beds

within  the  next 30 years.  There is a need to expedite  rather

than  to  shelve the building of more nursing homes in spite  of

the  current  economic downturn.  I would urge the  Ministry  of

Health  to seriously give this area more weightage and increased

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The cost of maintaining a patient in an acute hospital

is  about  S$290  per  day, whereas the cost  of  maintaining  a

patient  in a nursing home is about S$25.  It does make economic

sense,  therefore, to make sure that there are  enough  nursing-home  beds  for  patients to be placed out  from  acute-hospital

beds.   Presently, on any given day, there are 120 "overstayers"

in  our acute hospitals.  These patients who are well enough  to

be  discharged from the acute-care hospitals do require  further

care.   However,  they should ideally be sent to nursing  homes.

Not  only do they deprive other acutely ill patients of beds  in

the  acute  hospitals, they are also costing the  country  S$1.6

million per year.  Sir, this is unnecessarily wasteful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Nursing-home beds are for patients who are not fit to

be  discharged  to their own homes.  They still require  special

daily  care and they are dependent on others for daily routines.

If  these patients are forcibly returned to their own homes, the

burden  on  their  family members will be tremendous.   Many  of

these  patients  are  indeed frail  and  elderly.   It  will  be

disastrous if we cannot cater for them in the future.  Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I  foresee problems arising from  an  increasing

number of the aged with a decreasing number of the young looking

after  them.   Problems will also arise because  there  will  be

fewer  care-givers  at  home due to an increase  of  dual-income

families.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) There will always be those who argue that substantial

numbers   of   people  would  prefer  home  care   rather   than

institutional care and that the necessity for even more  nursing

homes begs justification.  The truth is that, although home care

may  be  preferred, it may not be ideal for many.  One  or  more

family members would have to stop work and stay at home to  take

care of these dependent patients.  Healthcare personnel such  as

doctors,  nurses, and physiotherapists would  have  to  go  from

house  to house to check on the patients.  This would mean fewer

patients seen each day and higher opportunity costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The nursing homes in Singapore are usually built and

run  jointly  by the voluntary organisations and the Government.

There  is  a need for constant and conscientious effort  to  woo

more  voluntary organisations to participate and  help  in  this

area of healthcare.  Such organisations do not come on stream as

and  when  we like them to.  Therefore, there are no  guarantees

that we will be getting a constant and continuous stream of them

as  and  when the demand arises.  Sir, I feel that it  would  be

prudent  that  we  do  not  turn  away  any  offers  from  these

organisations  even,  and  especially,  during  these  difficult

times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) It is a prerequisite of the voluntary organisations that

they  take  on  some of the building and running  costs  of  the

nursing homes.  These costs, which usually run into millions  of

dollars, have to be raised through annual fund-raising projects.

Money from well-wishers are an important source of funds and  it

is wise to stagger fund-raising projects so as not to overburden

the  well-wishers  and  thus jeopardise the  smooth  running  of

existing nursing homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) We should capitalise on this economic crisis and take the

opportunities  presented  by cheaper building  and  construction

costs.  This is, in fact, one of the appeal reasons put forth by

the  Kwong  Wai Shiu Hospital and Nursing Home.  A rather  valid

reason indeed and it should support the request for the Ministry

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>

Health to repeal earlier decisions.  Prime Minister Goh, only  a

few  days ago, said that his own feeling was that this year  was

going  to  be  a tough year.  The Government would look  towards

spending  on infrastructure to keep the economy going.  Building

more nursing homes would fit nicely into this strategy and would

alleviate the shortage we face at present.  Therefore, it  would

be  better that we accelerate rather than shelve the building of

more nursing homes now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The shortage of nursing-home beds will be compounded next

year when the Ministry of Health introduces a new funding system

for  our  public  hospitals.  Presently,  public  hospitals  are

funded  on a per-patient-day basis.  In other words, the  longer

the  patient stays in hospital the more the hospital gets.  This

is to change when funding will be based on diagnosis of diseases

and  the  resources required by patients.  The funding mechanism

is  derived  from  a  system of case and disease  classification

termed  Casemix  and  Diagnosis Related Groups  (or  DRGs)   The

introduction   of   Casemix  and  DRGs  is  to   help   hospital

administrators  and doctors to contain healthcare  costs.   This

system  will  certainly pressurise the acute-care hospitals  for

discharge of low-funded or non-funded DRGs cases to the  nursing

homes.  The demand for nursing homes will undoubtedly increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The financial burden upon the "no-choice overstayers" in

our acute hospitals will also be multiplied when the Ministry of

Health introduces the new system next year.  This is because the

use  of  Medisave  will also be based on the  Casemix  and  DRGs

Classification.  The patients will have to pay for the expensive

acute-beds with meagre Medisave deductions.  They will  need  to

fork out much cash for "overstaying" in such acute-care beds due

to a forced circumstance.  They suffer for not having the choice

of transfer to a ten times cheaper alternative - a nursing home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said the aforementioned, I would

like  to  stress  the importance of a couple of  related  issues

which  also  warrant  our attention.   We  need  to  ensure  the

reduction in demand for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>

beds  in our hospitals and nursing homes.  We will also need  to

look  into alternative and additional ways for patients to  have

funds  for out-of-hospital expenses.  Let us consider these  two

issues:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) You will agree with me that we should practise the

"prevention is better than cure" policy, as far as healthcare is

concerned.   Sir, "preventive healthcare" is the key to  success

in  coping  with  future  healthcare  problems.   Revamping  and

investing well in this area will reap us abundant rewards in the

future.   There is still a lot that can be done.  Prevention  of

disease and promotion of healthy lifestyle should be targeted at

everyone.   Due  to time constraint, I would  not  go  into  the

details.   The topic of preventive healthcare alone  will  merit

another adjournment motion by itself!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In the area of healthcare financing, there is still

something  amiss despite Medisave, MediShield and Medifund.   To

repeat  what  I  suggested in this House, we need  a  co-payment

insurance  scheme  to cater for long-term care outside  hospital

settings.   I  would  call  this  "Medicare".   "Medicare"  will

provide  for burdensome and chronic but non-institutional  care.

In   some   instances,  this  may  actually  be  the   preferred

alternative  care  -  "home-care".  This will  reduce  the  load

placed  on hospitals and nursing homes.  Presently, the facility

to use Medisave only for hospital and nursing home admissions is

an  important  consideration causing  many  patients  to  favour

institutional-care  instead of home-care.   This,  again,  is  a

waste of expensive resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us give special attention to these

seemingly  remote  issues, even as we cope  with  this  economic

crisis.   It is far-sighted vision and far-reaching preparation,

the  hallmark  of  the PAP Government, which  will  prevent  and

cushion Singaporeans from catastrophes in the future.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is not shelving the development

of  nursing  homes.   On  the contrary, we  are  expediting  and

building more nursing homes.  Let me explain.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is fully aware of the need to plan for the long-term care facilities for the elderly sick. Not every sick

elderly  person requires institutionalisation.  According  to  a

study  done  by  the Ministry of Health a few  years  back,  our

estimate  is that only about 3% of the total elderly  population

aged  65  years and above need some form of institutional  care.

MOH  has  been  actively  working  with  the  Voluntary  Welfare

Organisations (VWOs) to build nursing homes and help  those  who

are interested in doing so.  Indeed, I agree with the Member, Dr

Lily Neo, that nursing homes by far are a cheaper alternative to

having   patients  staying  unnecessarily  long  in  our   acute

hospitals.   Irrespective  of  the Casemix  formula  of  funding

hospitals, which is actually still at the trial stage, there  is

need  for  us  to provide the cheaper alternative, that  is,  in

terms of nursing homes for the elderly patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many VWOs have problems implementing their projects on

time.  The length of time taken for a project to be approved for

funding  is  dependent  on  the  VWO's  proposal  meeting  MOH's

guideline  on  the  setting up of nursing  homes  and  also  the

obtaining  of  the  necessary approvals from various  Government

departments.  The average time taken for a project  plan  to  be

finalised  is around two years.  But there are often  delays  in

the planning and design phase carried out by the VWOs, and these

are  due  to  several factors.  Firstly, the VWOs  tend  to  far

exceed  the  space norms for approved facilities and they  often

want to include facilities which turn out to be not eligible for

Government  funding.  So, much time has to be spent at  meetings

with the VWOs and their architects to assist them to revise  the

plans until they meet the MOH's requirements.  The other reasons

for  the delays include delay in identifying suitable sites, the

time   required  to  assess  community  reaction,   the   formal

allocation of site and the need to coordinate with various other

agencies  on the plans, such as with the URA, Land Office,  PWD,

LTA,  and so on.  The construction itself takes another  1.5  to

two  years.   So under the present procedures, the minimum  time

required  is 3.5 to four years for a development project  to  be

completed.  We have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>

reviewed the process with a view to expediting the time required

for project approval.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that presently we have a shortfall of nursing home

beds.   However, according to our latest projections, we  should

be  able  to correct this shortfall within the next five  years.

Let  me elaborate.  At the end of 1998, there were around  4,600

available  nursing  home beds.  The shortfall  was  1,600  beds.

This  shortfall is higher than the 1,300 beds quoted by Dr  Neo,

because  she  was referring to 1997 figures.  The background  is

that  between  1996 and 1998, there were only four nursing  home

projects  (two  were  new homes and two were replacement  homes)

which  were  completed.  And this added only  450  beds  to  our

supply  of  beds.   So  there  was  a  slight  increase  in  the

shortfall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are stepping up our assistance to the VWOs. And we are

currently  working with 12 VWOs to build nursing homes  to  meet

this  shortfall.  These projects are already in various advanced

stages  of  development.  Between 1999 and 2001, there  will  be

nine  new  and  replacement projects which  will  be  completed,

adding  another 2,000 beds.  This would give a total  supply  of

around  6,400  beds.   When this is compared  to  the  projected

requirement  of 6,750 beds, the shortfall will be  reduced  very

significantly to only 350 beds in two years.  With more  nursing

home  projects coming on-stream between the year 2002 and  2003,

there  will be another 1,000 beds added to the stock,  and  this

will,  in  fact,  wipe  out the shortfall.   There  will  be  no

shortfall by the year 2003.  The total supply of available  beds

by  the  year  2003 will be 7,400, which is in  contrast  to  an

earlier  estimate we made in 1997, that only 6,600 nursing  beds

would be available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised figure is made possible because last year, we

reviewed  the nursing home building programme and re-prioritised

the  projects  to ensure that those that could  be  moved  ahead

faster  would receive higher priority for funding.  New  nursing

homes that would add more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>

nursing   home  beds  compared  with  replacement  or  upgrading

projects and those that could be put up at a lower cost received

priority   funding.    As  a  result  of  our  re-prioritisation

exercise,  we  were able to increase the number of nursing  home

beds  available by the year 2003 from 6,600 to 7,400.  As I have

said,  by the year 2003, we do not expect any shortfall  and  we

would maintain this balance.  Furthermore, we have begun to work

with  other VWOs on planning for nursing homes to come on-stream

beyond the year 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member mentioned that there would be a requirement of 22,000

nursing  home beds by the year 2030.  But this is more  than  30

years  down  the  road.   With the new  momentum  that  we  have

created,  we are confident that by that time, we would be  amply

prepared to meet the projected demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that besides nursing homes, we are also

stepping  up  the provision of other long-term care  facilities,

such  as community hospital beds and chronic sick beds.  By  the

year  2003, there would be an increase of 800 community hospital

beds and chronic sick beds.  Currently, there is no shortage  of

places at the day rehabilitation centres.  However, there  is  a

need  to  provide home care services.  As the Member so  rightly

pointed out, some patients could be taken care of at home and it

might  be  better for them to be cared for by family members  or

care-givers.   So MOH is encouraging more VWOs to provide  home-care services for the elderly sick.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to provide financial assistance to

VWOs  for  the  development of facilities and services  for  the

elderly sick.  I would like to stress that funds provided by the

Ministry  of Finance have not been reduced, despite the economic

downturn.  Between 1996 and 1998, we have provided $33.4 million

to  nursing home projects.  Between 1999 and the year  2001,  we

will  be providing $131 million.  If you take into consideration

the other long-term care facilities, such as community hospitals

and chronic sick hospitals, then, from now till the year

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>

2003,  MOH expects to spend $235 million to assist the  VWOs  to

build these long-term facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of the Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital, as we explained in the

written  answer to the Member already, is that originally,  they

had  a  very  grand  plan  of building a 1,500-bed  convalescent

hospital cum nursing home.  We went back to them and asked  them

to  reconsider  the  plan.   We  asked  them  whether  this  was

realistic   in  terms  of  the  resources  and  so   on.     The

redevelopment  plan  is now still at the concept  stage  and  is

being revised.  Once the details are firmed up, we will be  able

to  work  out  the funding details.  So we are  asking  them  to

revise  the plan and to be more realistic and more effective  so

as to meet with our requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say that MOH is not only concerned

with   the  availability  of  long-term  care  services.   These

services  must  meet certain standards set by  my  Ministry  for

obvious  reasons, like physical standards and  quality  of  care

provided  for patients.  We have drawn up guidelines on physical

facilities and the staffing ratio already.  Guidelines  on  care

standards  are also being developed.  Once these are  developed,

they  would  apply to all the nursing homes and other  long-term

care facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to ensure that individuals are able to

finance  their own long-term care needs, especially  during  old

age,  and  this  is  apart  from Government  subsidies  and  the

subsidies  provided  by  the  VWOs  through  their  fund-raising

efforts.  We recognise and appreciate the efforts put in by  the

VWOs in raising funds, in providing the services, in running the

homes and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>

community hospitals.  In fact, we are deliberating on how we can

help  them  to reduce their load of fund-raising.  We  are  also

considering how individuals and families could be helped,  apart

from  Medisave and MediShield, to finance their share  of  long-term care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare for the Elderly

has  considered the suggestions which have been put  forward  by

its  members  and by members of the community.  Its  report  and

recommendations will be released soon.  So I would not  disclose

further details on these financing aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I agree with Dr Lily Neo, I agree very much indeed - and this has been the emphasis of my work in the Ministry in the

past  years  -  that everybody, whether young or old,  must  put

emphasis  on leading a healthy lifestyle.  This is the best  way

to  cut  down the burden of his own healthcare costs, the burden

to  his  family, to the community and, eventually, also  to  the

Government,   because   the   Government   heavily    subsidises

healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by saying that we are committed to

ensuring  that  the elderly have access to affordable  long-term

care, but health is also very much in our own hands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.

<div align="center"><b>HOSPITALISATION AND MEDICAL EXPENSES FOR PERSONS ABOVE 55 YEARS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Health,  from 1994 to 1998, (a) how many persons above 55  years

old  without savings in the Central Provident Fund were admitted

to  hospitals;  (b) how many in this age category with  Medisave

accounts were unable to meet their medical expenses; and (c) how

the hospitals handled these cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, our public hospitals saw 80,000 hospital

admissions involving Singaporeans and PRs aged 55 and above. The

hospitals  do  not track whether patients have  savings  in  the

Central  Provident  Fund.  About 38%  of  them  used  their  own

Medisave  savings  to pay at least part of  the  hospital  bill.

Another  50%  of  patients used the Medisave of their  immediate

family  members. Some patients were covered by employer  medical

benefits and therefore need not draw on Medisave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures on Medifund assistance allow us to estimate the

number  of patients who, despite Government subsidies,  Medisave

and  MediShield,  remain unable to meet their medical  expenses.

Medifund is the safety net of last resort for needy and indigent

Singaporeans.  Applications are considered by Hospital  Medifund

Committees, and approval rates have always been higher than 97%.

In Financial Year 1997, Medifund assisted 5,600 cases out of the

61,000 admissions of patients older than 55 into B2 and C  class

wards. They received $5.4 million of financial help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medifund is not the only avenue open to those who need

financial  assistance. Inpatients can also  apply  for  Medisave

overdraft.  Our  public  hospitals are  also  prepared  to  help

patients  with  genuine financial difficulties  by  offering  an

instalment  plan  to  pay  their bills.  Singaporeans  can  rest

assured  that  they  will  not  be denied  essential  healthcare

because of the inability to pay.

<div align="center"><b>PRESENT INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health (a) whether

the  present influenza epidemic is due to Sydney H5N2 as in Hong

Kong and (b) whether his Ministry has vaccines available against

the virus.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The influenza A/Sydney (H3N2) virus has been isolated in

Singapore  since the end of 1997.  It is the predominant  strain

circulating  during  the current season from  November  1998  to

January/February  1999  and  is  associated  with  the   present

influenza  outbreak in Singapore.  This virus strain is  similar

to  the  strain of influenza virus responsible for the influenza

outbreak in Hong Kong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, influenza A (H3N2 and H1N1 sub-types) and

Influenza B viruses are detected throughout the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influenza is an acute viral disease of the respiratory

tract. The disease is self-limiting and patients usually recover

within  a week.  As influenza may occur throughout the  year  in

tropical  countries,  influenza  vaccination  is  generally  not

introduced  in  any  tropical country as  a  routine  basis  for

prevention.  In temperate countries when epidemics occur  during

cold  winter  seasons,  the elderly  and   young  children  with

chronic medical conditions like heart and lung disease, who  are

at high risk of having serious complications are advised to have

influenza vaccination as a preventive measure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has taken the necessary action to

ensure that influenza vaccine is available to those who wish  to

be  vaccinated.  Influenza vaccination is available at Tan  Tock

Seng   Hospital,  Changi  General  Hospital,  and  many  private

clinics.

<div align="center"><b>PROBLEMS CONFRONTING MALAY FAMILIES AND STUDENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether  the Ministry will consider  carrying  out  a

comprehensive   survey   to  determine  the   various   problems

confronting  Malay  families  and  students  and  to   determine

appropriate  programmes to help the community  cope  with  these

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br><i>Malay Students Have Done Well Educationally</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay students have made considerable progress in academic

achievement over the years.  This is evidenced by their  results

in  major  national examinations, the higher Malay participation

in   post-secondary   education,  and   their   performance   in

international studies:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In terms of national examinations - The percentage of

the  Malay  P1  cohort passing Mathematics  at  `O'  level,  has

increased  almost three-fold in the last 18 years, from  10%  in

1980 to 39% in 1997, while the pass rate in Science has risen by

three times in the same period, from 12% to 36%;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In terms of participation rate in post-secondary education

-  The  percentage of Malay students who have gone on  to  post-secondary education - ie, either pre-university, polytechnics or

ITE - has risen from 42% in 1988 to 75% in 1998.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In terms of international comparisons - Our Malay students

fared  better  in  Mathematics at the P3, P4,  Secondary  1  and

Secondary 2 levels, than students in countries such as  the  US,

Canada,   England,  New  Zealand  in  the  Third   International

Mathematics and Science Study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The academic indicators show that our Malay students have

made  significant strides.   These improvements  show  that  the

efforts made by MOE, the Malay/Muslim self-help groups and other

community-based organisations have achieved a measure of success

in  addressing  the educational issues facing  the  Malay/Muslim

community.  Of course, there is always room for improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay/Muslim self-help groups have been very pro-active

in  studying  such  issues. Indeed, on 29th  January  1999,  the

Minister  in  charge  of  Muslim Affairs,  Mr  Abdullah  Tarmugi

announced  an initiative to study how the Malay/Muslim community

should  respond to the challenges of a knowledge-based  economy.

MOE will certainly assist in such studies if we are requested to

do so.

<div align="center"><b>SAFETY LIMITS FOR SOUND LEVELS IN DISCOTHEQUES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for the Environment (a)

for  an  update  on  the specifications and  permissible  safety

limits  for sound levels in discotheques; and (b) whether  there

were  any  public education programmes initiated to  inform  the

young about this type of deafness.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee was formed last year, comprising representatives

from  the  Ministries  of  Manpower, Home  Affairs,  Health  and

Environment, to study the problem of noise-induced  deafness  in

discotheques.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee drew up a set of guidelines, recommending

that  the music level in discos should not exceed 85 dBA over  8

hours  and  140 dBA at any time.  The guidelines were issued  to

the music entertainment industry in July 1998, with the help  of

the Association of Entertainment Organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry, together with Ministry of Manpower, also conducted

a  survey  among young discotheque patrons.  The  survey  showed

that  while almost all of those surveyed knew of the  danger  of

prolonged exposure to loud noise, about 10% chose not to believe

it.   We  are  therefore planning to launch a  public  education

programme to reinforce public awareness of this danger.

<div align="center"><b>DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT MATTERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether the Government will consider introducing legislation  or

other  means  to  ensure that private sector  employers  do  not

discriminate in hiring and other employment matters  on  factors

such  as  race, religion, language, gender or age,  unless  such

factors are strictly relevant to that job.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry does not propose to introduce legislation to

regulate recruitment advertisements and practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my Ministry shares the concern of Mr Tay and members of

the  public over job advertisements which stipulate a particular

race,  religion, gender or age as a criterion for the  selection

of  candidates, we do not believe that legislation is  the  best

solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently my Ministry is able to investigate complaints received

from anyone who considers himself to be discriminated against in

employment  on grounds such as race, religion, age  and  gender.

If  our  investigations reveal that any form  of  discriminatory

practice  does exist, the employer will be cautioned and  warned

of  the  implications of such practices. The employers concerned

will  also  be asked not to adopt any discriminatory  employment

practices  in future.  They usually would accept the  Ministry's

advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of our investigations, we have discovered that job

advertisements  citing  a  preference for  a  particular  ethnic

background were often misrepresented.  Employers explained  that

they  wanted  candidates who were able  to  speak  a  particular

language  and that since candidates of other racial groups  were

unlikely  to  meet the language requirement, they felt  that  it

would  be more expedient to stipulate a particular race in their

job  advertisements.   This  would also  spare  the  efforts  of

applicants  who  did  not  have the necessary  requirements,  in

applying    for   the   job   and   attending   to   interviews.

Notwithstanding this explanation, the Ministry had  pointed  out

to  such  employers  that  citing  racial  preference  or  other

discriminatory factors should be avoided.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to emphasise that this problem resides

in a minority of employers and often in small companies.  We are

of  the  view  that an educational and promotional  approach  is

preferable  to  legislation  in dealing  with  this  issue.  The

problem  with legislation is that it would create rigidities  in

the job market which would be detrimental to economic growth and

job  creation.  For  example, there  would  be  instances  where

business and job requirements would compel an employer  to  look

for  persons  of  a  particular  background  compatible  to  the

requirements. Similarly, where a job requires physical  strength

such as handling heavy machinery in a shipyard, it would be more

appropriate  for the employer to recruit a younger  male  worker

who is able to cope with the job requirement. On the other hand,

in  the  cosmetic business, the employers would want  to  employ

younger  females  instead  of  older  males  to  promote   their

products.   These  are market requirements  and  should  not  be

misconstrued as discrimination.   I would also like to point out

that  experience  in other countries has shown that  legislation

may  not  solve  the problem.  Instead, it often leads  to  high

incidences of litigation and controversies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue of discrimination had not been raised for the past 10

years  when  we enjoyed sustained economic growth and negligible

unemployment.  I have no doubt that in 1996 and 1997, there were

similarly  inappropriately  phrased recruitment  advertisements.

Yet  we only received 9 complaints in 1996 and 16 complaints  in

1997.   Last year, we had 32 complaints.  We believe this  trend

reflects    the   rising   unemployment   rather    than    real

discrimination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the above, my Ministry therefore prefers to

adopt  an  educational  and moral suasion  approach  by  working

together  with employers' organisations to advise  employers  to

promote  non-discriminatory recruitment practices based  on  the

workers' skills and capabilities and not on factors which are of

no  relevance to the job.   In labour scarce Singapore, it is in

the  interests of employers to reach out to all Singaporeans who

can  do  the work and help the company to compete.  This is  the

basis  of  our meritocratic approach which has served  Singapore

well.  By adopting discriminatory practice, an employer is  only

shortchanging himself.  This will become more apparent when  the

economy recovers in a year or two.

<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT AND SUCCESS RATE OF JOB PLACEMENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower (a)

how many people were laid off as at the end of 1998; (b) what is

the  success  rate  of  job placements; and  (c)  whether  older

workers  will  face long-term unemployment of up to  a  year  or

more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest preliminary estimates based on a survey of private

sector  establishments with at least 25 employees revealed  that

around  7,200 workers were retrenched in the fourth  quarter  of

1998,  higher than the 6,000 estimated previously.  This  brings

the retrenchment figure for the whole of 1998 to 28,300 workers,

the  highest ever recorded since the last economic recession  in

1985, which saw 19,529 workers laid off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower provides employment assistance to all

job  seekers who are Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents.

Owing  to  the  economic  downturn, the number  of  job  seekers

registered with the Ministry had quadrupled from 4,777  in  1997

to 19,784 in 1998.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Ministry was able to provide job referrals to

about  78%  of  all  registrants. A total of  4,182  job  offers

resulted  from  these referrals.  However, not all  job  seekers

took  up  the offers.  Eventually, a total of 1,038, or 5.2%  of

all registrants, were successfully placed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether older workers will face unemployment of up to a

year or more is dependent on the performance of the economy.  If

the  economy turns around within a year or two, such a  scenario

is  unlikely.   Of the locals retrenched in the  first  half  of

1998, 65% were re-employed as at September 1998.  Among those re-employed, the average time taken to obtain re-employment was 1.6

months. Older workers may face more difficulty e.g. only 52%  of

those  in  the  age group 50 and above were re-employed,  taking

also on average 1.6 months to secure re-employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To better the older workers' re-employment prospects, my

Ministry  held many discussions with employers to urge  them  to

look  beyond  the  age factor when recruiting workers.  We  have

emphasized  to  them  that the older  workers  can  be  just  as

productive.   We  are also providing skill-upgrading  for  older

workers  who  face  the risk of retrenchment or  who  have  been

retrenched.   For  instance, the newly established  Bukit  Merah

Skill  Development Centre is currently training about 400  older

workers including many who had been retrenched.  Skill upgrading

can help workers to remain employable. Retraining can facilitate

their  redeployment to new jobs in a different sector.  We  will

provide more opportunities for upgrading and retraining so as to

minimise  the  extent of structural unemployment  in  the  years

ahead.

<div align="center"><b>NEEDS OF THE ELDERLY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Community  Development, in line with the Government's policy  of

looking  into the needs of the elderly, (a) whether there  is  a

register or list of elderly persons who live alone and  who  are

not  supported  by  any  relative; (b) what  kind  of  financial

assistance schemes and what total amount were made available for

this  vulnerable group from 1994 to 1998; and (c) what  kind  of

mechanism  is being set up to make it easier for the  illiterate

elderly who are bedridden to apply for Public Assistance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>



<br><br><i>Register of Elderly Persons</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is currently no comprehensive list of elderly persons who

live alone and who are not supported by any relative.  Aggregate

data derived from sources like the 1990 Census of Population and

the  1995  National Survey of Senior Citizens in  Singapore  are

used for planning of services for the elderly at national level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, it is important to note that anyone in the

community  who  comes  across  an  elderly  person  in  need  of

assistance  can  either  call MCD or the  Community  Development

Council  (CDC) Helpline.  Upon receipt of the referral,  an  MCD

officer  will visit the elderly and link him up with a voluntary

welfare  organisation  (VWO) for appropriate  assistance.   This

arrangement  rightly  places  the responsibility  on  the  local

community  to  look after the needs of its members  who  require

assistance and who have no family to help them.



<br><br><i>Financial Assistance Schemes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elderly Singaporeans who have no means of financial support can

apply for assistance under the Public Assistance (PA) Scheme  or

the  Silver  Jubilee Fund (Special Grant) Scheme,  if  they  are

permanent  residents.  As at 31st December 1998,  1,839  elderly

households  were  placed on these 2 schemes.  Between  1994  and

1998, an amount of $20.08 million was disbursed to this group of

elderly.   Besides  these 2 schemes, the  CDCs,  grassroots  and

religious   organisations  and  VWOs  also   provide   financial

assistance to the elderly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Mechanism to assist bedridden and illiterate elderly to apply for PA allowance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedridden and illiterate elderly persons who need financial

assistance  can also be referred to MCD for financial assistance

by  any  party  - whether a neighbour, a relative, a  grassroots

leader  or  a volunteer.  MCD officers will follow  up  on  such

referrals and render assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also implemented two initiatives in

collaboration with HDB, CDCs and VWOs which will facilitate  the

application of PA allowance by non-ambulant elderly  persons  in

need.   The  first,  implemented  since  December  1997,  is  an

outreach  programme  for families living in  1  and  2-room  HDB

flats.    Under  this  programme,  volunteers  call   at   these

households  and  explain  to  them  the  schemes  and   services

available  to them and refer those who need immediate  financial

help to my Ministry for follow-up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative is the MCD-HDB project to improve the

living  conditions of the elderly staying in 1-room  HDB  rental

flats.   Blocks of flats with a higher concentration of  elderly

tenants  are  refurbished with elderly-friendly  features.   MCD

funds and works with VWOs to set up Seniors Activity Centres  at

the  identified  blocks  to  provide support  services  such  as

regular  home  visitation  by volunteers,  home  help  and  meal

delivery  services.  Staff at the centres will refer  those  who

require  PA allowance to MCD.  Since 1993, 31 blocks  of  1-room

HDB rental flats have been identified for the project.

equities or foreign currencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have earlier asked the CPF Board to review the six-month time

lag between interest rates of commercial banks and those paid on

CPF savings to make the CPF interest rate more reflective of the

prevailing  market rates.  As this has implications on  the  HDB

concessionary mortgage rate which is currently pegged at 0.1 per

cent  above  the CPF interest rate, we are still  reviewing  the

matter with related agencies.  An announcement will be made once

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

entered  Singapore  illegally  or  had  overstayed  beyond   the

validity of their social visit passes.  In comparison,  a  total

of  1,884  illegal foreign workers were arrested in  1997.   The

presence of illegal workers creates social problems, affects our

law  and order and undermines economic upgrading.  I would  like

to  inform Members that in view of the current threat of illegal

immigration, we have intensified our enforcement actions and are

working  closely  with  the Police to  ferret  out  the  illegal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal foreign workers and those caught employing them

already  face stiff penalties under the law.  They can be  fined

be   caned.   The  penalties  for  the  employment  of   illegal

immigrants  and overstayers are spelt out under the  Immigration

Act administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs. In view of the

rising number of illegal foreign workers caught, the Ministry of

Home  Affairs  had  raised the penalties for such  employers  in

October  1998  as a further deterrence.  For employers  of  more

than  5 immigration offenders who could not be caned (ie,  women

and  males who are more than 50 years of age), the maximum  fine

was increased from $6,000 to $10,000. This will ensure that such

employers  would be subjected to a heavier fine than  those  who

employ  5  or less immigration offenders ($6,000). For corporate

bodies  convicted of employing immigration offenders,  the  fine

was  increased  from  between $50,000 and  $100,000  to  between

$100,000 and $200,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, in March 1996, the Employment of Foreign Workers Act

(EFWA)  was amended to hold main contractors in the construction

industry liable for illegal foreign workers found at their site.

The  amended  Act also prescribed security measures  contractors

should  take  to  prevent illegal workers  from  entering  their

sites.  This will ensure that contractors make serious effort to

keep out illegal foreign workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also stepped up enforcement and persecution actions. The

number  of  raids  conducted by the Employment Inspectorate  and

jointly with MHA has increased by over 80% between 1997 and 1998

(Number of inspections conducted by EI or EI and MHA in 1997 and

1998 is 572 and 1,014 respectively, i.e. increase of 89%.).   In

1998, my Ministry prosecuted 320 employers for employing illegal

foreign  workers.  While the Employment of Foreign  Workers  Act

provides  for  mandatory imprisonment for a second  offence,  my

Ministry  has  sought deterrent sentences  on  some  first  time

offenders.   This  had resulted in 5 first time offenders  being

sent  to  jail since 1997.  The maximum jail sentence meted  out

was  100 weeks to a proprietor of a  construction company  which

employed more than 100 illegal foreign workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are of the view that the current penalties are adequate to

deter  employers  from employing illegal workers.   However,  my

Ministry  will  monitor the situation closely and if  necessary,

seek  enhancement  of  penalties to  check  illegal  employment.

Employers are reminded not to employ illegal foreign workers  as

the   risks  and  penalties  involved  outweigh  any  short-term

benefits.

<div align="center"><b>RECRUITING METHODS OF EMPLOYERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. <b>Mr Cyrille Tan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower whether his

Ministry is (i) monitoring the situation in which employers  are

being  "choosy" in their recruiting methods and (ii) considering

measures  to  encourage employers to hire  mature  workers  with

relevant skills and experience.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Owing to the economic downturn, the demand for labour in

Singapore  has  dropped  to an unprecedented  low  in  1998.  In

September 1998, some 15,500 vacancies were reported.   This  was

only about a third of the level reported in September 1997.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As jobs become scarce and more candidates are available for

employers to choose from, it is a natural tendency for employers

to   be  more  selective.   However,  I  urge  employers  to  be

reasonable and not to use unfair criteria.  Jobs, which  require

generic  skills  and  capabilities,  should  be  opened  to  all

applicants   regardless  of  their  age  or  social  background.

Employers  should  not  confine  their  recruitment  to  younger

workers only, if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>

the  job  can also be performed by older workers. Older workers,

who  have  much  experience from their previous  jobs  can  also

contribute to a company's growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) With an aging population, to discriminate against older job

seekers  is  a  practice that employers could ill afford.   Even

before  the  regional  crisis  affected  us,  the  Ministry  has

undertaken various activities and programmes such as  the  "Back

to  Work" Programme, to help facilitate the employment of  older

persons.   The  thrust  of our effort is  to  change  employers'

mindset  on  the  employment of older persons and  to  encourage

employers  to  provide  job  opportunities  for  them.  On   the

legislative front, the retirement age has also been raised  from

60  to 62 from January 1999, to help older workers stay on their

jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the current economic situation, job seekers,

regardless of age or educational level, are finding it difficult

to  secure  a job. The situation may continue to be so  for  the

rest  of  1999.  The Ministry is aware that the older  and  less

educated  job  seekers  face  tougher  challenges.     We   have

therefore placed greater emphasis on helping them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been monitoring the recruitment situation for

some time.  We hold discussions with employers to encourage them

to  employ older persons and to identify suitable jobs for them.

We  visit selected companies together with representatives  from

the  Singapore  Productivity and Standards Board, the  Singapore

National  Employers  Federation and the  National  Trades  Union

Congress  to better understand the issues faced by employers  in

the  management  of older persons. We have also  impressed  upon

employers  that certain jobs could be restructured or redesigned

to  make  them  suitable for older workers to handle.   We  will

continue  with  our  efforts  to  help  change  the  mindset  of

employers and to assist the older workers find alternative jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, several schemes are in place to help companies to

regionalise and explore new markets.  For example, the  Business

Development  Scheme  provides  grants  to  cover  the  costs  of

overseas  studies  and visits to explore new  markets;  and  the

Regionalisation Finance Scheme (RFS) provides loans to companies

for the acquisition of fixed assets overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since FY 96, some 250 cases amounting to S$11 million has been

approved  for  various  programmes under the  Trade  Development

Incentive  (TDI)  scheme. To assist companies in  exploring  new

markets,  we  will  further  expand the  TDI  scheme  to  assist

companies  in  setting up overseas marketing offices  and  other

business  development  programmes such as branding,  franchising

and licensing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TDB will also increase its promotional activities in terms of

trade missions and fairs. TDB's plan for 1999 is to increase the

number of missions and fairs to new markets to 28 as compared to

18  in 1998.  Singapore's exports with these markets such as the

Middle  East, Mexico, Central and Eastern Europe and South  Asia

saw   a   year-on-year  increase  of  18%,  19%,  38%  and   28%

respectively.

instead  of  queuing up for new flats.  Some first-timers  could

also  have  bought private residential properties.  It  is  also

likely  that some rushed in and applied for the new  flats  when

they saw the queue growing in 1996 and 1997.  When they are  now

areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flat sizes are reviewed regularly and adjusted to meet

housing demand.  In our small country, it is important that  the

land use is optimised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the 70s and 80s, we now have smaller family units.

Hence,  while  we  try  to  provide larger  flats  to  meet  the

aspirations of flat applicants, the floor area of the flats must

take into consideration the smaller household size of the 90s.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the current 5-room flat of 110 sm and the average

of  4  persons  per household, the living space per  person  for

Singapore  is about 27.5 sm.  Even for the smallest 4-room  flat

of  85 sm, the living space per person is 21 sm.  This is larger

than most apartments in other Asian countries and comparable  to

many  private apartments in Singapore. For example, the  average

living space per person in Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo is about 7

sm, 13 sm and 15 sm respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With continuous improvements in the quality and design of our

HDB  flats,  the  newer flats have better finishes  and  design.

These  flats  are therefore just as functional and are  of  even

better  quality than those built previously.  HDB will  continue

is closely and regularly monitored.  PUB's monitoring so far has

shown that the use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers in the

<div align="center"><b>RISE IN ABUSE AND DISTRIBUTION OF SYNTHETIC DRUGS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  whether  there  has  been  a  rise  in  the  abuse  and

distribution  of synthetic drugs and whether this is  consistent

with the general trend overseas involving increasing numbers  of

younger persons from more affluent backgrounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main synthetic drugs of abuse in Singapore are amphetamine-type stimulants, particularly "Ice" and "Ecstasy". There is no

rise  in the abuse and distribution of these drugs in Singapore.

We  had anticipated the problem and took action to nip it in the

bud.   There  are  also  abusers of other synthetic  drugs  like

hallucinogens and tranquilizers but the problem of  their  abuse

is insignificant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of "Ecstasy" abusers has dropped drastically

from  661  in  1996 to 403 in 1997 and 180 last  year.  However,

"Ice" abusers has increased from 5 abusers arrested in 1996,  to

82 in 1997 and 117 last year. Overall, these abusers represent a

small  proportion  of  the  total addict  population.  In  1996,

"Ecstasy" and "Ice" abusers made up 12% (or 666 out of 5744)  of

the  local  addicts arrested. This fell to 10% (or  485  out  of

4752)  and  7% (or  297 out of 4502) respectively  in  1997  and

1998.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of "Ecstasy" pills seized registered a large

fall  from  about 54,000 in 1997, to about 2,200  in  1998.  The

total  amount of "Ice" seized saw an increase from 90 g in  1997

to  1.71 kg in 1998. These seizures are still small compared  to

the seizures made for other drugs. For instance, in 1998, 139 kg

and 22 kg of heroin and cannabis were seized respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvement in the "Ecstasy" drug situation was a result of

effective  enforcement,  deterrent  12  to  18  month  custodial

sentences  given  by  the  Courts,  intensive  preventive   drug

education, and tighter laws targeting "Ecstasy" traffickers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for "Ice", we had anticipated the potential problem it could

pose and introduced the presumption clause and death penalty for

"Ice"  trafficking last year.  CNB has also been targeting "Ice"

trafficking  syndicates  in  its  enforcement  actions  and  has

intensified its publicity on the dangers of the drug.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence that younger persons from more affluent

backgrounds  are taking synthetic drugs in Singapore.  "Ecstasy"

abusers  are  usually in their late 20s while "Ice" abusers  are

older,  between  35  and  39 years of age.  They  are  typically

Chinese, male and employed in low skilled jobs.

dependants of Singapore citizens are not.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment Pass holders are eligible for medical subsidies

because  they contribute economically to the Singapore  economy.

This is in line with ongoing efforts to ensure that talents feel

welcome  in  Singapore and their stay here is  not  made  unduly

difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All foreign dependants of both Singapore citizens and non-citizens do not qualify for medical subsidies. An exception was

made  some  years  ago  for dependants  of  3-year  Work  Permit

holders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with effect from 1st September 1998, foreign employees

are  issued  with  P, Q and R work passes.  P and  Q  work  pass

holders  are classified as Employment Pass holders, hence  their

dependants  are not eligible for subsidised health  care.   When

existing 3-year Work Permit holders change employers, they  will

have  to re-apply for Q work passes.  Dependants of Q work  pass

holders,  like dependants of all other Employment Pass  holders,

are  also  not eligible for medical subsidies.  If there  is  no

break of employment, their dependants will continue to enjoy the

medical subsidies granted previously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a regional hospital, AH is an important component of the

million  since  1991 to renovate physical facilities,  including

wards,  operating  theatres, intensive care units  and  the  A&E

Department, and to upgrade specialist outpatient services at AH.

These improvements have resulted in better patient care, service

delivery and efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH offers a sufficiently wide range of specialities - general

medicine, general surgery, orthopaedic surgery, anaesthesia  and

A&E  - to cater to the needs of most patients. Since April 1995,

these  services have been augmented by NUS clinicians  providing

specialised  outpatient consultations in a range of medical  and

surgical subspecialities, laboratory medicine and radiology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AH also has a special niche in providing geriatric care for

Singaporeans  in the western part of Singapore.  AH  operates  a

Geriatric Day Hospital and a Geriatric Ward, and runs programmes

on  various  aspects of geriatric care, including rehabilitation

training, managing geriatric-orthopaedic cases and training care-givers in geriatric care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing range of medical services is already quite

comprehensive and is serving patients well.  The Ministry has no

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seletar Expressway (SLE) has increased traffic volume along

better  access to the Yishun New Town.  Also, more  people  have

moved into Yishun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has implemented various traffic management measures to

alleviate  the  heavy  traffic condition especially  during  the

evening  peak  hours.  These include widening  the  junction  of

Lentor  Avenue/Yishun Ave 1, extending the right turning storage

lane,  and  adjusting  the traffic signal timings  at  junctions

along the Yishun Ave 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA is also working with the local grassroots organisation to

encourage  Yishun  residents  to  use  Sembawang  Road   as   an

alternative  route. Sembawang Road is the other  major  arterial

road to Yishun New Town which is relatively uncongested and  has

spare  road  capacity to hold more traffic. It  is  also  easily

accessible via SLE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of S-ONE is tracked by its accessibility, the

number  of  subscribers  and applications,  and  the  volume  of

to 3,470 Gb at the end of 1998.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training the public to use S-ONE is an important part of

its  development  strategy.  During  the  December  1998  school

holidays,  an S-ONE training camp was organised by the  National

Computer  Board.  More than 10,000 people were trained  over  70

sessions  during  this camp.  This brought the total  number  of

people  trained to use S-ONE, as at end-December 1998,  to  more

than 41,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fully realise the potential of S-ONE, its use should

extend  beyond Singapore's shores.  Selected S-ONE  applications

have, since April 1998, been made available in the United States

through   the  Home  broadband  cable  network.   The  relevant

Government  agencies and service providers are working  together

to develop further link-ups with other broadband networks in the

world.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will

reverse  the shelving of redevelopment plans for Kwong Wai  Shiu

Hospital  since there is a shortage of about 1300  beds  in  the

nursing  homes  at  present and also,  a  projected  exponential

increase in bed demand every year due to our ageing population.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been reviewing the redevelopment plans of

Kwong  Wai Shiu Hospital with the hospital management  and  URA.

As  the project is currently only in the concept planning phase,

MOH will work with Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital on the detailed plans

and  design to ensure that it meets our overall requirements for

nursing  homes. MOH will only be able to decide on  the  funding

support when such details are finalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital currently has about 500 beds of

which  only  350  are in use due to its staff constraints.   MOH

will assist the hospital to activate the unused beds as soon  as

possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently working with 12 other voluntary

welfare organisations to build nursing homes.  These are now  at

various advanced stages of development.  We expect the number of

nursing home beds to increase from 4592 at the end of last year,

to  6423 by the end of 2001.  This will significantly reduce the

shortfall in nursing beds. In addition, we are working with VWOs

to  help  the  elderly live in their own homes for  as  long  as

possible.  Institutionalisation should only be a last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cable television take-up rate as of 31st January 1999

is  18.5% or 148,000 households.  The take-up rates are  highest

for  private  condominiums, followed by  HDB  homes  and  landed

property.   The  Member may wish to take  up  with  SCV  if  she

requires a further break-down of the take-up rates, as  this  is

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE STUDIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Education if he

will  consider introducing "Singapore Studies" as a  subject  in

the Universities.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various aspects of Singapore studies are already

incorporated  as elective or compulsory modules in the  academic

curriculum of our universities.  In addition, Singapore  history

will  be offered as a module in NUS's Core Curriculum, which  is

due to be implemented in July this year.



<br><br><i>Compulsory modules</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At NUS and NTU, individual Faculties and Schools require

their respective students to take compulsory modules which cover

a range of topics on Singapore studies.  For example, the recent

history  of  Singapore  is  an area  of  study  covered  in  the

"Foundation Skills Course", a Faculty Enrichment Module taken by

all  first  year students in the NUS Faculty of Arts and  Social

Sciences.   In  NTU,  the  Schools of  Engineering  and  Applied

Science require their students to take a module on "Engineers in

Society" that covers issues pertaining to the history, politics,

social structure and challenges of modern Singapore.



<br><br><i>Elective modules</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues related to Singapore are covered in a wide range of

elective  modules  that  span  diverse  subject  areas  such  as

Sociology, Geography and History.  At NUS and NTU, some of these

elective modules are also offered to students of other Faculties

and Schools within the respective universities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Core Curriculum</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Core Curriculum is a new initiative by NUS which will

be  implemented in the academic year 1999 for about  5%  of  its

undergraduate  intakes (The Core Curriculum is an Honours  track

programme that is scheduled to be implemented in the Faculty  of

Science, the School of Computing, and Faculty of Arts and Social

Sciences,   as  well  as  for  undergraduates  in   the   Talent

Development Programme from other faculties.).  One of  the  five

areas  of  study in the Core Curriculum is "History - Singapore

and  the  Asia  Pacific'.  A core module to be studied  in  this

History component is "Singapore: The Making of a Nation".

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current approach of covering various aspects of

Singapore  studies  through  a wide  range  of  modules  in  our

universities achieves much wider coverage than would a  distinct

subject in "Singapore Studies".  There are no immediate plans to

introduce  such  a  subject in NUS and  NTU.   However,  we  can

certainly  weigh the merits of this to see whether it  would  be

good to offer this in future.

<div align="center"><b>INTERNET FOR EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Education what

is  the current status regarding the use of the Internet for the

teaching and transmission of educational material by educational

institutions.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Masterplan for IT in education, the Ministry will

install  whole-school networking for all schools by  next  year.

This will provide schools with good access to the Internet.   At

present,  about  60  schools already have school-wide  networks.

The  majority  of  the  remaining schools, however,  still  have

limited access points (about 10 points per school and at least 2

points for SingaporeONE).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers and students use the Internet mainly to source for

information,  especially for project work.  The  Ministry  helps

schools  by evaluating websites.   Websites, which are  relevant

to  the  curriculum,  are  listed in  the  Ministry's  Intranet,

together with suggestions on how these websites could be used in

the classroom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Internet is an important resource, pupils are

taught  to  be  discerning  on the factual  correctness  of  the

information downloaded from the web.  In addition, they are also

taught  to  synthesise the data instead of doing a cut-and-paste

job when writing their project report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet provides new possibilities for technology-facilitated collaborative work. Many of our schools have

participated  in collaborative projects with pupils  from  other

countries.  They discuss issues and questions with  one  another

through e-mail. Many of these projects culminate with the pupils

creating and developing their own theme-based websites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet has also been used to disseminate information

to  schools.   Some schools have set up their  websites  on  the

Internet and include educational resources for pupils to use.

<div align="center"><b>CHINESE LANGUAGE AND UNIVERSITY ADMISSION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether  his Ministry has collated any statistics on the  number

of  students  who scored excellent grades in other subjects  but

were  unable  to enter local universities simply on  account  of

their  failure in the Chinese language subject at their  O-level

and A-level examinations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admission into NUS/NTU is based primarily on A-Level

points.  The maximum is 76 points, 20 points each for 3 A  level

subjects  and 8 points each for General Paper and Mother  Tongue

(MT)  taken at the AO level.  Applicants compete on their  total

points.  A student who scores excellent grades in other subjects

but  fail  their  Mother Tongue may have higher points  than  an

average  student who passes Mother Tongue.  However,  a  student

who  does not meet the Mother Tongue requirement (D7 or  better)

will  be  offered provisional admission.  During  his  1st  year

undergraduate  vacation, he must undergo  an  intensive  1-month

mother tongue course and pass the course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thus no students with excellent grades who could

not get into the university because of MT.  Those who failed  MT

and  were not accepted into University because their results for

the other subjects were poor as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For academic year 98/99, a total of 21 students were

provisionally admitted into NUS/NTU on the grounds that they had

failed to obtain at least a D7 in their Chinese Language.   This

is  0.3%  of the 7000 (approx.) JC/CI students who were admitted

into  NUS/NTU.  The percentage of students who are provisionally

admitted because of poor performance in MT is very small.
