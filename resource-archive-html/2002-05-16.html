<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>INCREASE IN GOODS AND SERVICES TAX</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Leakage in collection)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister for Finance with the increase in the GST from 3%  to

5%  in  January 2003 and with the increase likely to lead  to

Singaporeans, particularly those living in the North  of  the

island,  going  to Johor Baru to shop for essentials  whether

the Government will take any measure to curb this trend.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr R. Ravindran</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister  for Finance how will the Government deal  with  the

leakage  of  GST  collections  due  to  a  large  number   of

Singaporeans shopping overseas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I

would answer Question Nos. 1 and 2 together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The Government does not expect a

sharp  rise in people going overseas to shop because  of  the

GST  increase.   The Government is giving a  generous  offset

package  to restore each household's buying power.  There  is

no  need  for  Singaporeans to resort to travelling  overseas

just to shop for daily necessities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When GST was introduced in 1994, inflation was hardly

noticeable.   And the 2% increase in GST this  time  is  less

than the 3% in 1994.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST is chargeable on imports. The GST exemption limit

per  person re-entering Singapore is only $50 if he  is  away

less than 24 hours.  This means that he only saves $1 for the

2%  increase  in  GST.   These small  little  savings  should

generate  little incentive for Singaporeans to shop overseas,

simply to avoid the increase in GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, if against our expectations leakage does

become  a problem, the Government will consider lowering  the

exemption limits.  GST is an important source of revenue.  We

should  not allow it to be undermined by large-scale overseas

shopping.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, could the DPM

consider  imposing a cap on the quantity to  be  brought  in,

say, similar to the three-quarter tank rule for petrol?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it will be

difficult to decide on the appropriate amount of toilet paper

rolls  to  bring  back from Johor Baru - three-quarter  roll.

The problem is not so much the $50 limit as the difficulty of

enforcing the requirement.  Because, sometimes, you may  come

back  with  somewhat  more than $50, and  you  may  not  have

declared  it  and  the Customs does not  check  every  single

vehicle going through.  So we will monitor the situation.   I

understand Mr Ong Ah Heng's problem because the shops and the

shopping  centres  in  the northern  part  of  Singapore,  in

Yishun, also in Woodlands, are affected when the residents go

overseas to shop.  And if this becomes a problem, we will see

what we need to do to tighten up, either reduce the limits or

to tighten up on enforcement.

<div align="center"><b>VEGETABLES IMPORTED FROM MALAYSIA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (a) whether the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



vegetables  imported from Malaysia are safe for  consumption;

(b)  how many cases of vegetables imported from Malaysia have

been detected by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA)

to  contain  pesticide levels which are  below  international

standards since January this year;  and (c) whether there are

other sources of supplies of vegetables.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Agri-food and Veterinary

Authority  (AVA)  inspects and tests all imported  vegetables

for  pesticide residues and other harmful chemicals to ensure

that  they are safe to eat.  Imported vegetables that  failed

these  tests  would be destroyed under the AVA's supervision.

As  such,  vegetables  imported from Malaysia  are  safe  for

consumption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 59,000 tonnes of vegetables was imported from

Malaysia from January to April 2002.  Only about 5 tonnes  of

these  vegetables did not comply with our pesticide standards

and were destroyed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Malaysia, Singapore also imports vegetables from

31 other countries, including China, Indonesia and Australia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng:</b> Sir, the Minister of State said the

sample tests on those vegetables imported from Malaysia  show

that there is still a good chance for Singaporeans to consume

vegetables  from Malaysia as their pesticide  level  complies

with  international standards.  Could the Minister  of  State

consider   importing  more  vegetables  from  other  sources,

instead of Malaysia?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Let me perhaps elaborate on the

system which we have in place to reassure Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All importers are required to apply for an import permit

from  the AVA for each and every shipment of vegetables  into

Singapore.  These permits are only issued to traders who  are

licensed  by the AVA.  Without a valid permit, no consignment

can be imported to Singapore.  These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



vegetables which are imported into Singapore are sampled  for

inspection and testing by the AVA's Veterinary Public  Health

Laboratory.   The samples are collected when  the  vegetables

arrive  at  Singapore's  Pasir  Panjang  Vegetable  Wholesale

Centre.   The AVA tests for pesticides and for other  harmful

chemicals in accordance with the prescribed protocols and the

standards set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission  (this  is

an  international  food  safety  agency)  and  our  own  food

regulations  of  Singapore.  The intensity of these  sampling

tests  would depend upon the past history of these  types  of

vegetables and of the importer who has brought them in.  With

all  these  measures in place, we are sure that by  the  time

these  vegetables  reach  your  plate,  they  are  safe   for

consumption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his point about diversifying our sources, we

already  import  from  32 different countries  and,  although

Malaysia is still our largest source of vegetables, as I said

earlier, other sources include China, Indonesia and Australia

and  these  sources have been increasing over the passage  of

time.  So I want to reassure Singaporeans that the vegetables

are  safe.  In fact, vegetables are good for their health  in

spite  of  what our children may say, and we have  more  than

adequate sources for obtaining vegetables.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I

know  how  the sample tests are conducted?  Do the  suppliers

submit the samples to you, or do you do spot checks and  take

them from the consignments?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> We pick the samples at random

and  we  send them for tests.  We do not allow them to submit

to us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah):</b> I would like to ask the

Minister  what is the percentage being imported  from  China.

As China seems to be a huge market, can we consider importing

more from China?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> At this point in time, we

import 18.36% of vegetables from China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [15th May, 2002],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Leong Horn Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In order to make food

readily  available for workers at the worksite, JTC  provides

canteens  and  invites contractors to  operate  canteens   to

provide food for the workers.  The food provided in factories

in the industrial area used to be cheap and good, much to the

delight of the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for all these canteens, the benefit of low

rental is normally granted for nine years only. Once the nine-year  period is up, the operators will have to re-tender  for

the right to operate, and the tender is inevitably awarded to

the  highest  bidder.  At present, more than 10 canteens  are

affected.   The new rental is  more than double that  of  the

previous one. I understand that in Jurong, the rental  ranges

from  $13,000 to $70,000, whereas in Chai Chee, it is between

$23,000 and $63,000.  With high rental, the operation cost is

naturally high. Consequently, the food prices must go up, and

the  customers  stay  away. Most of  the  operators  find  it

difficult  to  sustain their business  after  six  months  of

operation.  Soon, the canteens close down,  and  the  workers

have  no food to eat.  Something must be done to prevent this

unhappy situation from happening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the bulk of customers of the canteens in the

factories  are  the workers themselves, cheap and  good  food

must  be provided for the workers.  I would suggest that  JTC

learn  from the Nanyang Technological University or the  Ngee

Ann



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



Polytechnic.   They  have  a fixed  rental  system  and  only

experienced operators are invited to operate their  canteens.

The rental is clearly stated in the contract, so are the menu

prices of the food served therein. This is to ensure that the

food  provided  there is good and cheap. With  this  kind  of

operation,  the  stallholders, the workers as  well  as   the

canteen operators will benefit.  This is an ideal system.   I

will  encourage our people to have an entrepreneurial spirit.

The  nine-year   tenancy  period is too short.   I  hope  the

Minister will review the nine-year period.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, many MPs, both during the Budget debate and under

MTI's cuts yesterday, have expressed concerns for SMEs.   The

2%  increase in GST will make an already difficult  situation

for them more difficult.  It is right that their problems are

fully  aired  in this House.  Under the cuts on  SMEs  later,

Senior Minister of State Tharman will cover the many specific

programmes  we  have in place to help our  SMEs  during  this

period  of economic downturn.  Minister of State Raymond  Lim

will address later the issue of entrepreneurship raised by Dr

John  Chen and the progress of energy deregulation raised  by

Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this year will be a better year than last

year.  The improved economic situation will provide relief to

many  SMEs.   The key is the overall health of  our  economy.

Our economy bottomed in the third quarter of last year with a

quarter-on-quarter annualised contraction of 10.5%.   In  the

last quarter of last year, we turned sharply upwards, growing

by  5.6%.   The first quarter of this year saw even  stronger

growth, 7.7%.  This is the arrow tip, the indicator of growth

momentum.  If the trend of economic recovery continues in the

US  and  in the world's semiconductor industry, and  provided

nothing  untoward  happens in the region around  us,  we  are

likely to achieve growth in the upper half of our revised  2-4% projection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the first half of next year, we can be reasonably

hopeful of good, though



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



not  spectacular growth.  Beyond that, it is anyone's  guess.

Economists are divided over the robustness of the present  US

recovery.   The  latest  data show that  consumption  remains

strong  in  the  US,  despite  the  depressed  stock  market.

Corporate  profits  are  still  down.   US  Federal   Reserve

Chairman, Alan Greenspan, said recently that this  is  to  be

expected.   The  sequence is inventory rebuilding,  increased

sales,   then  profits  go  up,  finally,  leading   to   new

investments.    For   a  cautious  man,  he   is   cautiously

optimistic.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can, therefore, expect the overall economic situation

in  Singapore to improve in the coming months.  When I bumped

into  the Chairman of UMC, Robert Tsao, a few weeks  ago,  he

said  that  there  was  a  strong uptick  in  the  wafer  fab

business.   Both  UMC  and TSMC are now  recruiting  workers.

There  will be a lag before growth in orders spreads  to  the

rest  of  the economy.  But many SMEs who supply to MNCs  are

already feeling the change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because employment lags growth by two to three quarters,

the  employment  situation may get a little worse  before  it

gets better towards the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong, Miss Low, Dr Chen, Dr Chong and Mr Wee

expressed  concern  about our international  competitiveness.

In  fact,  Singapore remains highly competitive.   Throughout

the  Asian financial crisis and the last global downturn, our

investment   pipeline   remained  full.    Despite   the   2%

contraction  last year, EDB was able to achieve FDI  of  $9.2

billion  and,  throughout the Asian crisis, we maintained  $8

billion to $9 billion every year.  This year, we are on track

to  reach  $9.2  billion.   The figures  for  Total  Business

Spending has been correspondingly strong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong and Miss Low enquired about the fall in

Singapore's competitiveness rankings.  In the latest IMD  and

EIU  rankings,  we have been overtaken by European  countries

like  Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands.  This was largely

due to the recession last year which followed an

unexpected 10% growth the year before.  However, our  ranking

in  Asia  remains high.  The EIU report now ranks us  as  the

most  attractive  business location in Asia,  ahead  of  Hong

Kong.   BERI continues to put the quality of our labour force

at  the  top  of  the  chart.  Our  political  stability  and

Government  efficiency  set us  apart.   Two  days  ago,  the

Straits Times reported Transparency International pushing  us

up  two notches in the world ranking on absence of corruption

to   9th   place.   This  year,  PERC  rated  us  the   least

bureaucratic country in the world.  I know many MPs may  find

this  difficult  to  believe  but,  really,  when  we  travel

overseas,  we  realise  how much worse the  bureaucracies  in

other countries can be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we are in a relatively good position for the

next  few  years, and our economy will pick up as the  global

economy picks up, we must be prepared for major challenges in

the  medium term.  This is the reason why the work of the ERC

is  so important.  The tax restructuring, which is debated so

intensely in this House, is of crucial importance to our long-term  competitiveness.   No  one  will  want  to  invest   in

Singapore  unless  he  can make good profits,  regardless  of

whether he is a Singaporean or a foreigner.  Lowering  direct

taxes  puts  us  in a much better position.  Lowering  direct

taxes  makes EDB's work much easier and, if EDB  is  able  to

bring in the big investments into Singapore, there will be  a

lot of feeding for the SMEs.  But, if the big investments  do

not  come in, then whatever we do for SMEs will have  limited

effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making fundamental adjustments to stay ahead in a

global  game  that  has  become  more  challenging,  and  our

willingness to do this is noticed by others.  Just the  other

day, the principal adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl for many

years,  Dr  Horst Telschik, was in Singapore  for  an  Asian-German  Forum.  I was invited as a Guest Speaker.   He  said,

"You  have  the  will to change.  We have lost  our  will  to

change."   So, over dinner, I asked, "Why did you say  that?"

He  said,  "You know, in Germany, we have had  so  many  good

years, it is very difficult to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>



make any change now in Germany.  You are different.  You  see

a problem, you analyse it, you make the adjustment."  So, our

GST  increase,  in  order  to lower taxes,  is  something  of

fundamental importance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years ago, when we were toying with the idea of a

GST, I was the MOS to Dr Richard Hu.  He knew I was going  to

Hong Kong and calling on Finance Secretary Piers Jacobs.  So,

he  said, "You ask Piers when Hong Kong is going to introduce

the  GST."   When I asked Piers, he said, "After  Singapore",

with  a  smile.  After we introduced the GST, I went back  to

Hong Kong and I called on him again.  I asked, "When are  you

starting?"   This  time, he shook his  head  and  said,  "No.

Politically,  it is very difficult to do so."  I  know,  even

though he did not say it, that the British Government did not

see  why it should incur the political cost of introducing  a

GST  when  it is a Hong Kong that is returned to China  which

will  benefit from it in the long term.  So, today,  when  we

analyse  Hong Kong's long-term fiscal position,  it  is  much

less  comfortable than ours, precisely because  they  do  not

have a GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Mr Leong, Mr Singh, Mr Wee and Dr Chong

that we track very closely Singapore's relative cost position

in  the  world.   The  entire tax restructuring  exercise  is

precisely  intended to lower cost for companies.  And  we  do

watch  carefully the level of Government fees and  levies  to

ensure  that we stay competitive.  This is how we  have  been

able   to  attract  more  than  our  fair  share  of  foreign

investments.   But we cannot be complacent, because  relative

positions change all the time.  There are many inter-ministry

committees, and most include members from the private sector.

This is to answer Mr Wee Siew Kim's point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have briefed Members of this House before, we are

very much seized by the challenge of China.  Mr Leong, Mr Gan

and  Mr  Wee spoke of the need for a comprehensive  response,

and  this is precisely what we have been doing.  IE Singapore

works  with  Singapore business associations  and  individual

companies and businessmen to pool information,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>



create  networks and facilitate the creation of  consortiums.

Network  China,  launched by Deputy Prime  Minister  Lee  and

Chinese  leader Li Ruihuan earlier this year, was established

for this purpose.  We also work with our Chinese counterparts

in a variety of ways.  For example, we have business councils

which help Singapore companies operate in Shandong, Hubei and

Sichuan.   Our political relations with China are  excellent.

Mr  Gan  Kim Yong suggested that our GLCs team up with  other

Singapore  companies in China.  In fact, this  is  often  the

case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is a huge opportunity and its domestic market will

continue  to grow for many years to come.  Since 1997,  China

became  the  Number One investment destination  for  overseas

Singapore FDI, overtaking, for the first time, Malaysia.  But

China  is  not  an  easy place to do business,  and  not  all

investments  there  have done well.   There  is,  really,  no

substitute  for  deep knowledge.  At the end  of  last  year,

Chinese Vice Minister Long Yongtu came to Singapore to give a

speech  and,  at the end of it, one question from  the  floor

asked  for  his advice on doing business in China. He  smiled

and  said,  "Do not take at face value what you are  told  by

provincial governors, party secretaries and city mayors.  You

should check for yourself and make sure you have a good local

partner."  Conditions vary from province to province and from

county to county, and we must know the ground in which we are

hoping to plant for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build up a pool of younger Singaporeans who know

China  and other Asian countries well, MTI launched the Asian

Business Fellowship last October.  Some study for their  MBAs

in  universities like Tsinghua; others are being attached  to

Singaporean, Chinese and international companies operating in

China for maybe one to two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next five years, we do not expect China to be a

major competitive challenge to Singapore, because our economy

is  at  a much higher level.  But, beyond that, we will  face

the pressure.  Every year,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>



China  produces some 400,000 engineers.  It already has  more

mobile handphones than the US.  China is overtaking Japan  as

the  world's  second biggest market for PCs.   Still  only  a

third  of the US, but growing very rapidly.  Within 10 years,

probably  less, China will have more Internet users than  the

whole   of   the  United  States.   Recently,  the  Economist

predicted, when it was analysing the Chinese space programme,

that  the  next man to land on the moon would be from  China.

So,  all  our  moves are in anticipation of a very  different

Asia and a very different China in the next 10 to 20 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But China is already a big challenge and a big headache

for  countries  like Malaysia.  Recently, I  led  a  business

delegation  to Malaysia, and some MPs accompanied  me.   Both

Minister  Rafidah  and  I agreed that  at  the  coming  ASEAN

Economic Ministers Meeting in July, we will concentrate on  a

common  strategy  to  extract the maximum  benefit  from  the

proposed  China-ASEAN FTA.  Before I went  to  Penang,  Chief

Minister Koh Tsu Koon called me up to apologise that he could

not  be  there  personally  to  welcome  me  because  he  was

accompanying  Prime Minister Mahathir on his  overseas  trip.

Then  he said, "Can you please talk about China and our being

hollowed out by China?"  When I was in Penang, I met a  group

of Singaporean businessmen over tea and they told me that the

problem  there  is quite serious.  In the last  three  years,

Penang  received  very little manufacturing  investments  and

many factories have been relocated to China.  Before that,  I

was in Perak.  The Chief Minister hosted me to dinner and  he

said,  "This morning, I just told Malay businessmen in Perak,

better  learn Chinese."  So, I asked, "Isn't that politically

sensitive?"  He said, "No, not at all.  We have got  to  face

up to the challenge of China."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, when I was in JB for a conference on bilateral

relations, Chief Minister Abdul Ghani told me that he noticed

many   furniture  factories  in  Johore  closing  down,   and

Taiwanese businessmen were all rushing to relocate in China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our neighbours are hollowed out, we in Singapore will

lose out too, because we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



need  complementary  industries based  on  cheaper  land  and

cheaper  labour to sustain the higher value-added  activities

that we have here in Singapore.  It is, therefore, completely

in  our  interest to help the region integrate and  become  a

good  alternative manufacturing base to China  for  American,

Japanese and European investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, assure Mr Leong, Miss Low and Mr Wee that

all our FTAs are negotiated with ASEAN in mind.  And, because

we  are more open and without an agricultural sector, we  can

take  the lead, it being much easier for us to negotiate FTAs

with  countries like Japan, the US, Europe and others.  Under

the US-Singapore FTA, for example, both sides have agreed  to

an  Integrated Sourcing Initiative which will benefit, in the

first phase, Bintan and Batam for a category of ICT products.

US  Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and I visited  those

islands  with  our Indonesian counterpart, Ibu Rini  Soewandi

just  last month.  Ibu Rini has just written to me to express

her  deep appreciation for our efforts.  And, as Dr John Chen

suggested, our SMEs which manufacture ICT components in Batam

or  Bintan,  or  sourced from there,  can  benefit  from  the

Initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the final stages of our FTA negotiations with

the  US.  This morning's Straits Times reported that  the  US

Senate  has  just  passed an amendment which  makes  it  more

difficult  for  the  Bush Administration  to  get  the  Trade

Promotion  Authority (TPA) which it is seeking in the  coming

days.   TPA  will  facilitate  the  passage  of  our  FTA  in

Congress, but it is not absolutely essential.  The big  issue

in  the Senate, this time round, is anti-dumping, which  does

not really involve us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, we completed our FTA with Japan, and

both  Houses  of the Japanese Diet have recently  passed  the

required legislation, and the FTA will come into effect later

this  year.   We have also concluded negotiations with  EFTA,

the   European   Free  Trade  Area  consisting   of   Norway,

Switzerland,  Iceland  and Liechtenstein.   Our  negotiations

with Mexico, Canada and Australia are on-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



going,  and  we  are, presently, lobbying support  among  the

member  countries of the EU for the launch of an EU-Singapore

FTA  which  is  positively regarded by EU Trade  Commissioner

Pascal Lamy.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these FTAs give businesses here better access to

various   markets  and  strengthen  Singapore  as  a  premier

manufacturing and services hub in Asia. They also help us  to

help  our  neighbours.   I  know that  there  has  been  some

misunderstanding about how FTAs work, but I am glad that  our

neighbours  are  now much clearer how they can  benefit  from

them.  You  would have read in the newspapers about  Thailand

and the Philippines also being interested in having bilateral

FTAs with Japan and the US.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN's greatest advantage is that, unlike China, we do

not pose a strategic challenge to the big powers. We threaten

nobody  and  therefore,  we can be  friends  with  everybody.

China, too, wants ASEAN as a friend.  When Vice President  Hu

Jintao  was in Singapore recently, he said that China felt  a

deep  responsibility for ASEAN.  China's offer of an FTA with

ASEAN, which will make us the world's biggest FTA of close to

two  billion  people in 10 years, is of very great  political

significance.   ASEAN's best response is  to  accept  China's

offer  but,  at the same time, make sure that we  have  close

economic  links  with  the  US,  Japan,  Europe,  India   and

Australia.   Then, we minimise our dependence,  we  diversify

our markets and we maximise our own space.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong, Dr Chen, Dr Chong, Mr Wee and others have

expressed  their concern about competition from Malaysia  and

this  seems to be a recurring theme during the last few days.

Many  Singaporeans naturally worry about the loss  of  Maersk

and  Evergreen  to Tanjong Pelapas.  Malaysian  leaders  have

also announced quite openly their intention to take away from

us  logistics,  petrochemical and other  businesses.   Johore

Chief  Minister, Abdul Ghani was reported to have  said  that

Johore's cooperative relationship with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  has  ended  and the new  relationship  is  one  of

competition.    I  think  he  must  have  been   misreported.

Malaysia  is our second most important investment destination

and  half of our investments go to Johore.  More than 60%  of

foreign  tourists  who visit Malaysia go  through  Singapore,

very  many  of  them Singaporeans.  If the dominant  economic

relationship   between   Johore  is   not   cooperative   but

competitive,  the consequences for both sides would  be  very

severe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in some areas, we will compete like in the

port business.  We were not pleased that Maersk and Evergreen

had been lost but no one believes that PSA is taking all this

lying  down.   We did not become one of the world's  greatest

ports  by  being unresponsive to changing market  conditions.

Ditto   for   Changi   Airport.    In   the   logistics   and

transportation business, we intend to keep the position  that

we  have had since Sir Stamford Raffles established Singapore

as  a  trading post for the East India Company, and  we  have

deep  strengths.  The key is the efficiency and  fairness  of

our  public  administration  -  no  corruption  or  cronyism,

complete  rationality in the systems we operate,  competitive

pricing  and keeping our doors open to the best operators  in

the  world.  For  petrochemicals, yes, other hydrocarbon-rich

countries  have cheaper feedstocks but we are very  efficient

and  we  intend to stay that way.  If we have not  been  more

efficient,  we  could never have kept the  refinery  business

when our neighbours built their own refineries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most economic sectors, our relationship with

Malaysia  is a complementary one, with electronics  the  most

obvious  example.  In fact, to be very frank, our worry  here

is  that  Malaysia is not producing enough technical manpower

for  the  industry. Take wafer fab as an example. In Shanghai

at  Jia Ding, they are building a wafer fab park that will be

drawing  in billions of dollars of investment. We  are  still

some years ahead of China.  We are going into 12" wafer fabs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



while  China  is still trying to get equipment for  8"  wafer

fabs.   They will compete against Malaysia's two 8"  fabs  in

Sarawak and Kedah.  If Malaysia does not keep up with  China,

they will be affected and we will be disadvantaged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Rafidah understands the importance of the

bilateral  economic  relationship. She wants  more  Singapore

businessmen to invest in Malaysia.  She told me that  she  is

coming  down  in  early August as a guest of SCI  to  promote

Malaysia  to  Singapore investors.   When  I  told  her  that

despite  occasional bilateral problems, we were like  Siamese

twins, she agreed heartily and referred to Eng and Chang.   I

thought it was Chang and Eng.  I suppose Malaysia must be Eng

and  we  must  be  Chang.  She told members  of  my  business

delegation  in  KL  recently to ignore reports  of  bilateral

problems  and  that the economic relationship will  continue.

The fact is, we need each other.  Bilateral trade between  us

makes  up  half of total intra-ASEAN trade.  Without Malaysia

and  Singapore, there is very little left in  AFTA.   We  are

major  investors  in each other's economy.  Thus,  the  major

challenge  for Singapore is not Malaysia, but China  and  our

response  to  China requires us to strengthen  our  links  in

ASEAN, especially our links to Malaysia and Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong and Mr Wee asked about our relations with

Indonesia.  With devolution of power to the provinces and  to

the  regencies, the local authorities near Singapore are very

keen  to work directly with us.  We are prepared to work with

them to help them build up their administrative capabilities.

But  we are very mindful that everything we do must have  the

blessings of Jakarta.  The Indonesian economy will take  some

years to recover from the disruptions of the last four years.

We  can  play a modest role in helping Indonesia to  recover.

Once  there  is political stability, Indonesia  can  be  very

competitive  because of the favourable exchange  rate.   Many

MNCs  have  told us that if the environment for manufacturing

in   Indonesia  improves,  Indonesia  and  Singapore,  as   a

combination, can be more than a match for China on many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



manufacturing activities.  Unfortunately, it is not so simple

but  Minister Rini and I have been working very hard  in  the

last few months to break new ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee asked how we can benefit from our position in

between India and China.  Indeed, India is an important  part

of  our  strategy to place Singapore as a hub  for  a  region

marked out by a seven-hour flying radius around us.  We  have

good  political  and  economic links with  India.   Recently,

Prime  Minister  Vajpayee proposed to Prime  Minister  Goh  a

Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement between the  two

countries. The Joint Study Group has already been formed  and

expects  to  complete its recommendations at the end  of  one

year.  Like China, India is a huge country and conditions can

vary  quite  a  lot  from state to state.   In  sectors  like

logistics,  IT  and telcommunciations, there are  interesting

opportunities.  Since PM Narasimha Rao's policy of opening up

India more than 10 years ago, Singapore has positioned itself

as  India's  long-term strategic partner, as a Hong  Kong  to

India.   With  India's  bilateral trade  with  China  growing

rapidly, there are many opportunities for our businessmen  to

work with both sides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh worries about the competitiveness of

manufacturing  in  Singapore.  I am glad to  report  to  this

House that we have not done badly at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, after September 11, when the picture

looked rather bleak, AMD and UMC announced their intention to

build  jointly  a 12" wafer fab in Singapore based  on  0.065

micron  technology.   Such  technology  does  not  yet  exist

anywhere  in  the  world today.  But the  two  companies  are

confident  that,  with  the commitment  we  give  to  R&D  in

Singapore, that technology will be available by the time  the

plant is open for operation in 2005.  This is a multi-billion

dollar investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of intellectual property, a point made by

Mr  Wee  Siew  Kim,  is very important for such  investments.

This  is  one  major advantage we enjoy over  countries  like

China.  Two months ago, I opened



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



two new facilities built by the pharmaceutical giant Wyeth in

Tuas,  costing $550 million.  As I took leave,  the  Chairman

pulled  me  aside and said, "Your protection of  intellectual

property  is crucial to our decision to build those  plants."

And  this  is  why we are doing a lot to build up  an  entire

regime  for  the  protection  of  intellectual  property   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good example is the Toshiba-Matsushita Joint

Venture to build Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal Displays

(TFT-LCD) for television and other electronic products.  This

is  state-of-the-art technology.  The panels will be used  in

all kinds of electronic products and will replace the cathode

ray tube in television sets and computer displays.  The plant

in  Pasir Ris, which should be one of the largest LCD  plants

in the world, will start operation in the second half of this

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Philips decided to set up its global

development  centre  also  for  LCD  TV  in  Singapore.   Its

facility  here  will cover a full range of  activities,  from

product  creation  to  testing and  marketing.   The  CEO  of

Philips in Singapore, Johan van Splunter said, "Singapore was

chosen  for its conducive environment and ready talent  pool.

The   pro-business   infrastructure  and  strong   government

partnerships  further  facilitate  the  growth  of   Philips'

businesses  here."  Many of us would have  read  the  Straits

Times  and  Business Times reporting that we  are  losing  12

senior executives to Hong Kong, but that is small compared to

what  we  have  here.   Philips  has  a  staff  of  3,000  in

Singapore,  including 800 engineers at the Philips Innovation

Campus and has every intention to build on what it has  here.

There are other examples in manufacturing which I do not have

time to go into today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the biomedical sciences, we are making good progress.

Last  year,  the  pharmaceutical sector was  a  bright  spot,

growing at over 10% despite the recession.  We have announced

two   one-billion  dollar  funds,  one  to  promote   private

biomedical  R&D in Singapore, the other to invest in  cluster

development.   Yesterday, Mr Leong  Horn  Kee  asked  why  Mr

Philip Yeo was reluctant to provide more details.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



The  reason  is  obvious.  There is no need to  provide  such

information to our potential competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the Biopolis is proceeding on schedule. Last

year, both Eli Lilly and Novartis have announced plans to set

up  important  research facilities in Singapore.   You  would

have  read  in  the newspapers that the Genome  Institute  of

Singapore was opened recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr Alan Colman, the scientist who cloned Dolly the

sheep, decided to relocate to Singapore to work for ESI which

is  a  company  producing stem cells, it caused  considerable

discomfort  in  England because we are all  in  the  game  of

attracting  talent.   This  is an interesting  company,  ESI,

which  has  been formed to exploit the commercial benefit  of

the  stem  cell  lines  which  Dr  Arif  Bongso  of  NUS  has

developed.  You will remember that last year, President  Bush

approved  for federal funding, work on 60 existing stem  cell

lines  in  the  world.  We have six of them which  Dr  Bongso

developed  in collaboration with scientists in Australia  and

Israel.   Dr  Bongso himself, a Sri Lankan, was recruited  by

the  late Prof. S Ratnam many years ago.  All these have  put

us  in  the scientific literature and on the world biomedical

map.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, a team of 10 scientists specialising in

cancer  research from Kyoto University, headed  by  Professor

Yoshiaki Ito, has relocated to IMCB because of our commitment

to  the  development  of biomedical sciences  and  our  ready

acceptance  of foreign talent in our midst.  They  know  they

are welcome here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cite these few examples to make the point that our

willingness to make adjustments in order to stay ahead of the

competition, that is in itself a major competitive advantage.

Our  reputation precedes us.  Companies know that  when  they

have  problems  in Singapore, we will help them  solve  those

problems.  Remaking Singapore is not easy, especially when we

are not doing badly.  But it must be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



done.  And others are watching us, watching what we do.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon, during the Budget Debate and Mr Leong

Horn Kee yesterday, asked why we have to rename NSTB, TDB and

PSB  to  A*STAR,  IE  Singapore and SPRING.   The  reason  is

because  we have reorganized these statutory boards  and  set

them new missions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSTB has transferred $2 billion out of its 5-year $7

billion  budget  to  EDB,  the  portion  which  is  used   to

incentivise  private  R&D  activities,  which  we  call  RISC

funding.   NSTB  has  reorganised  the  Research  Institutes,

consolidating 13 existing ones to nine, and establishing four

new ones.  There will be further consolidation in the future.

Our   objective   is   to  build  strong  multi-disciplinary,

applications-oriented research entities  for  industry.   Our

emphasis  is not on research for research sake, but  research

to help build up long term economic capabilities here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Penang, they do not have what we have.

And  so  they  recognised they are in a  difficult  position.

Much  more  emphasis  is  now placed on  the  development  of

Singaporean  scientific manpower for which $500  million  has

been  set aside.  The key to success will be the quality  and

quantity  of  top  talent that we are able to  root  here  in

Singapore.   If we can do it we will thrive.  If  we  cannot,

then  we  will  move  down the league table,  that  is  that.

Because of the redefinition of NSTB's function, we decided to

add  "Research"  into its name and rename  it  an  Agency  to

signal its greater closeness to industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old TDB was principally concerned with trade

development.  With the growth of our external wing,  we  need

to  support  not  only our traders but also increasingly  our

overseas investors.  Mrs Lim Hwee Hua correctly spoke of  the

need to distinguish between GNP and GDP.  This is because our

overseas  portfolio,  both direct and indirect,  will  become

more and more important in the future.  Because we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



have  a  high  savings  rate and receive  substantial  inward

investments, we have become a major capital exporter to other

countries.   We have become a significant investor  in  every

ASEAN  country  and  beyond,  in  China,  Hong  Kong,  India,

Australia  and  other  countries.   Where  we  can  help  our

investors  overseas,  we should.  Our concern  is  no  longer

trade alone, although trade remains very important and has  a

sub-group working on it under the ERC.  For this reason,  TDB

has  been reorganised to help Singapore companies regionalise

and   globalise,  and  hence  the  change  of  the  name   to

International   Enterprise  Singapore.   IE  Singapore   will

support  the Singapore Business Federation if it  decides  on

the  kind  of  industry associations which Mr Inderjit  Singh

proposed yesterday.  I apologise to Mrs Lim Hwee Hua for  not

providing  the GNP data she asked for in the  past.   I  will

chase  the  Statistics Department, but it  is  not  a  simple

matter, collecting this new information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB has handed over its international functions to IE

Singapore.   It  will  no longer organise overseas  missions.

But  it will remain the principal economic agency to help our

100,000  SMEs,  only  a  few  of which  can  think  of  going

overseas.    For   many   years,  PSB  has   been   promoting

productivity  and standardisation with considerable  success.

However,  this is no longer enough in a fast-changing  world.

Innovation has become very important for the improvement of a

country's  Total Factor Productivity.  Productivity  improves

what  is  inside  the box.  Standardisation  turns  boxes  of

different  shapes  and  sizes into  standardised  containers.

Innovation  encourages us to look outside the box.   This  is

therefore a major addition to PSB's mission.  The name SPRING

includes  Innovation after Standardisation and  Productivity,

all  of which are meant to enhance Singapore's total economic

performance, which in the end translates into higher  profits

and  wages.   I  was  delighted to hear  Mr  Zainul  Abidin's

compliments about the name SPRING yesterday.  The  new  names

have been chosen precisely to signal change and to express  a

certain  freshness.  But I fully understand why  some  people

may not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



take  to  them.  We could have continued using the old  names

and  carried  on.   But  putting new wine  into  old  bottles

devalues the new wine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One place we must remake is Sentosa. This was raised by

Mr  Leong  Horn  Kee  yesterday.  It has  been  a  symbol  of

Singapore's success for many years and well-known  throughout

the  world.   But in recent years we were not  able  to  make

fresh  breakthroughs.   Facilities like  Fantasy  Island  and

Asian  Village, have failed.  The land has since  been  taken

back  by  Sentosa.  When Mr Alan Choe retired, I  invited  Mr

Philip  Ng to take over as the new Chairman.  He was a little

reluctant  at  first  because  his  company,  Far  East,  was

thinking  of  making  bids for land in Sentosa  Cove.   So  I

assured  him that we could ring-fence the Cove from  him  and

his company can continue to tender for the land when it is up

for  tender.  Then after that, the CEO, a civil servant,  was

retiring.   Mr  Philip Ng looked around for a Singaporean  to

take  over,  because so many MPs have raised questions  about

Sentosa, he wanted to show sensitivity.  So I had lunch  with

him  and  I  told him, "Philip, my job is to  defend  you  in

Parliament.  You choose the best man for the job.  Please  do

a  global  search."   So he has selected Darrel  Metzger,  an

American who had worked before in Tokyo's Disneyland, in Hong

Kong's Ocean Park and in Hawaii's Atlantis Adventure.  In the

coming  months,  Sentosa will be making major  announcements,

including  a major reduction in entrance fees to the  island.

Now,  I  do  not wish to steal Mr Philip Ng's  or  Mr  Darell

Metzger's  thunder.   Also we should give  the  Chairman  and

Members of the Board maximum flexibility to do their work and

not  make  them  feel  that every project  is  somehow  under

parliamentary oversight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked whether and when we are going to

introduce a Competition Law.  This is not a simple  piece  of

legislation   because  such  a  law,  instead  of   promoting

competition,  may  raise cost and act  to  the  detriment  of

consumers.  This note of caution was raised very thoughtfully

by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua yesterday when she asked: are we sure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



more  competition is better in every case?  We  have  studied

carefully  the experiences of other countries and  circulated

various  draft  legislation for comment in  the  private  and

public sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have more or less settled on a few key ideas. In

general,  the  law  will prohibit anti-competitive  behaviour

such  as  price fixing and abuse of dominance.  Dominance  by

itself  will not be disallowed.  But abuse of dominance  will

be actionable.  A Competition Commission will be set up as  a

horizontal  agency  covering  all  industry  sectors.    Some

activities may have to be carved out in the public  interest.

Where  there  is conflict between the Competition  Commission

and domain regulators, like IDA, a defined process would have

to  be  followed.  We will bear in mind Mrs  Lim  Hwee  Hua's

point   that  we  must  not  make  mergers  and  acquisitions

unnecessarily  difficult.  Our aim is  to  have  such  a  law

within  two  to  three  years,  but  because  of  its  sweep,

extensive consultations with industry will have to be carried

out.   As  a  matter  of  principle, we will  allow  parallel

imports  to prevent price discrimination against Singaporeans

by  big  suppliers, which was a point raised by  Mr  Tan  Soo

Khoon  yesterday in connection with "white pumps" and  by  Mr

Ong Kian Min in connection with distribution channels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, at the Committee of Supply, I announced the

formation of a CASE-MTI Task Force to look into the enactment

of  a Consumer Protection Law.  The Task Force has since  put

up  its report and I am pleased to inform Mr Yeo, Dr Teo  and

Prof.  Chin  Tet  Yung  that we will table  a  Bill  for  the

enactment of such a law this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Task Force proposed a simple piece of legislation

which  will  help  consumers seek  civil  remedies.   As  the

amounts  are small, most of these cases can go to  the  Small

Claims  Tribunal.   Where  there are reasonable  grounds  for

complaint,  CASE will assist them.  The law will provide  for

civil  but not criminal remedies because there already  exist

laws for criminal cases like the Consumer Protection Act, the

Penal   Code,   the  Miscellaneous  Offences  Act   and   the

Commodities Futures Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, his predecessor

Dr  Teo Ho Pin, and their colleagues in CASE for helping  MTI

come to such a position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin proposed the establishment of a statutory

board  specifically to protect consumers.  We might  do  that

one day, but for the time being, I think let us regulate with

a  light  touch rather than with a heavy hand.  Whatever  the

laws  in place, buyers should always beware.  If a deal looks

too good to be true, it probably is not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Mr Yeo that MTI will continue to support

CASE in its efforts to educate and protect consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Tan Soo Khoon, having read Business Times'

report  of  a recent representation to MTI by the  major  oil

companies, asked whether the Government was going ahead  with

"white  pumps".  Let me confirm that we have every  intention

to.   We  have earlier identified some sites to try  out  the

concept, but they were dropped due to security considerations

after  September 11, except for a new site in Punggol.   This

is  a  site  in  HDB's  reserve list of  sale  sites  for  an

integrated development of residential, commercial and  petrol

pumping facilities.  The oil majors have raised valid  points

about  the importance of a level playing field so that petrol

stations  will not compete at a disadvantage.  We will  study

them  and  take them into account.  For the Punggol site,  we

will open it to public tender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the mini-marts operated by petrol stations, which

Mr  Tan  Soo Khoon is opposed to, they are a convenience  for

all  of us and I think they should not be disallowed.  In any

case,  since  we  are allowing supermarkets to  go  into  the

petrol pump business, we should not prevent petrol pumps from

going into the mini-mart business.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Sir, many Members have expressed

concerns  about  the problems and challenges  that  our  SMEs

face.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government places great importance on

developing   a   vibrant  SME  sector.   It  recognizes   the

difficulties  faced  by  small firms  in  getting  access  to

financing,  or in investing in technologies and  capabilities

before they have acquired economies of scale.  I will address

Members'  queries  on how Government is assisting  the  SMEs.

But first let me elaborate on the issue of business costs  as

was  raised by several Members, including Mr Inderjit  Singh,

Mr Ong Kian Min, Miss Penny Low, Mr Arthur Fong, Dr John Chen

and  Mrs  Lim  Hwee  Hua.   As the  Minister  has  said,  the

Government takes very seriously the issue of cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three main components in business cost: land,

wages,  and  what  Mr Inderjit Singh referred  to  as  hidden

costs,  or charges and levies imposed by Government, such  as

utility  fees.   Land costs are of concern to  the  Ministry,

particularly  industrial land.  We  agree  with  Mr  Inderjit

Singh that land has to be priced to ensure that manufacturing

remains  viable  in Singapore.  Land is zoned for  industrial

use  in Singapore for this reason.  The State has provided  a

substantial amount of industrial land which will  secure  the

long term requirements of our manufacturing sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land is scarce in Singapore and we cannot match land

prices  in  much  larger countries or those with  much  lower

standards  of  living.  Our approach in  industrial  land  is

therefore not to match the lowest prices internationally, but

to  make the most competitive use of the little land we have.

Hence,  we ask industrialists to make more intensive  use  of

their  land  and cluster together to share common facilities.

JTC  now  builds factories, which used to be  on  the  ground

level, on multiple storeys with vehicular access.  These  are

popular   with   companies.    Our  petrochemical   companies

occupying  huge tracts of reclaimed land are also competitive

because of the advantage of large scale integration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, current land prices in Singapore are competitive.

JTC's  posted  industrial land rentals in urban and  suburban

areas have declined by about 40% since the peak in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



1996, while those in outlying areas have fallen by about 19%.

Singapore's  prime CBD office occupation costs are  now  much

lower than in Hong Kong, Taipei, and even Beijing.  They also

remain  lower,  of course, than Tokyo, London and  New  York.

Not   every   business  will  find  Singapore's  land   costs

competitive with other locations for the particular  activity

they  are  engaged in.  But at current prices, we  are  fully

able  to  attract  a range of industries that  add  value  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the current economic conditions, the Government

has reduced rentals so as to help companies, especially SMEs,

cushion  the downturn in their revenues and cash  flow.   The

JTC rental rebates are due to expire in June.  The Government

has decided to extend the rebates to the end of the year.   A

total of 9,000 companies, including 5,000 SMEs, will continue

to benefit from JTC rental rebates, which are currently about

20% on average and, in some cases, up to 30%.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides giving direct rebates, JTC has liberalised

several  of  its  policies  to  give  its  customers  greater

flexibility in managing their costs.  I will cite several  of

these  measures because the specifics are important.  Members

may not be aware of them, and they do add up to a significant

improvement in business costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, JTC now allows firms to sublet up to 50% of their

space.   For  lessees,  as distinct from  tenants,  they  are

allowed to sublet as much space as they want after the  first

five  years.  This liberal subletting policy allows the firms

to  better  manage operating costs.  It also makes it  easier

for  small  firms to obtain space by subletting from  someone

else, instead of paying for an entire factory unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, companies affected by the downturn are now allowed

to defer their committed investments for a year or more on  a

case-by-case  basis by the JTC, so that they  can  use  their

available  funds to meet immediate operational  requirements.

In addition, industrialists whose leases are expiring but who

are unable to decide on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



their  investment  plans  due to business  uncertainties  are

allowed  to  defer the renewal decision for two  years  while

remaining in their sites as tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC also has a scheme to help small companies that are

starting  out new businesses or new product lines to overcome

cash  flow difficulties during the initial years.   It  gives

them  rental discounts of 70% in the first year, reducing  to

30%  in  the  third year.  This is the New Business  Creation

Incentive  Scheme.  JTC is, in addition, designing  no-frills

facilities  to help SMEs who need fairly standard  functional

spaces to minimise their costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a further relaxation of JTC rules, exiting tenants

no  longer  have to restore their premises to their  original

use  if  the incoming tenants are prepared to take  over  the

premises  in their current state.  This saves cost  for  both

the exiting and incoming tenants.  JTC has also increased the

supply  of land with shorter tenures of 20 years or less,  in

response to requests from SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the application process for JTC space has

itself  been vastly simplified.  Application forms have  been

shortened from 11 pages to 3.  SMEs no longer find themselves

having  to  engage  consultants to produce in-depth  business

plans as part of their applications.  All this reduces cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that owners of factories

should  be  allowed to sell back their factories to  JTC  and

then lease the premises from JTC.  JTC is not keen to take on

this  role.   Buying  back  and  leasing  is  essentially   a

financial  arrangement that the private  sector  is  able  to

provide  and,  indeed, has begun to provide in  a  number  of

cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other major component of costs is wages. To

stay  competitive,  wages cannot run ahead  of  productivity.

However,  the  objective of economic policy is not  to  force

wages  down  but to raise productivity, so that  workers  can

enjoy  higher standards of living.  We may have to cut  wages

during a bad economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



downturn to save jobs, as the Government has done by reducing

employer's CPF contribution rates across the board.  But  the

longer-term  solution for competitiveness lies  in  upgrading

skills  and  capabilities  in Singapore  so  as  to  increase

productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that other cost

components,   in  particular  Government  fees  and   utility

charges, should be kept as low as possible, so as not to load

up  business  costs, except where there are  specific  policy

objectives,  such  as  energy  and  water  conservation.   Mr

Raymond  Lim  will  be  elaborating  on  keeping  such  costs

competitive, including the business of electricity tariffs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a wide array of assistance schemes to help

SMEs.   Mr  Inderjit  Singh feels that  there  are  too  many

schemes  administered  by too many Government  agencies,  and

suggested  that we should form a one-stop agency  overall  in

charge  of  nurturing and growing local  companies.   As  the

Minister has just mentioned, SPRING Singapore is the  primary

agency  serving domestic SMEs.  It also provides SMEs with  a

one-stop  service to advise them on which assistance schemes,

anywhere  in Government, are best suited to their needs,  and

refers  them  to  other  agencies  where  necessary.   SPRING

Singapore  has advised several thousand SMEs in this  process

of seeking out the best assistance in Government, given their

needs.   We still find cases where SMEs are sent from  pillar

to  post  when  they  seek  Government  assistance,  but  the

instances  are  now  few.   The multi-agency  approach,  with

SPRING  Singapore  serving  as a central  point  of  contact,

allows for solutions to be customised to a very diverse range

of  companies   -   some domestic, some going  international,

some  very  small, some past the mezzanine stage,  some  with

financing needs and others with various specific capabilities

that need jacking up, and across a whole range of industries.

However,   MTI   agrees  that  we  need  to  streamline   and

rationalise our incentive and assistance schemes, and intends

to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also felt that we are imposing MNC-type rules

and criteria when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



assessing  applications  by SMEs  for  grants  and  incentive

schemes.   Sir, the schemes operated by EDB and IE  Singapore

to  help  companies  grow do not give special  preference  to

small  companies.  However, Members may be surprised to  know

that where EDB schemes are concerned, 50% of the total number

of  projects  assisted last year were for local  enterprises,

and  10%  were  for  local SMEs.  Under IE Singapore's  grant

scheme to help companies develop overseas markets, 73% of the

projects  assisted  were for SMEs.  Further,  all  of  SPRING

Singapore's assistance schemes are focused on SMEs.  There is

no lack of support for SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also suggested that we categorise SMEs into

those with and without growth potential.  This is indeed what

EDB  and IE Singapore have been seeking to do, so as to focus

resources  and  assistance on companies with the  acumen  and

willingness  to upgrade, and which have had some  measure  of

success.   However,  the  definition of  what  constitutes  a

growth   company  will have to remain soft,  to  ensure  that

promising  companies are not denied support on the  basis  of

inflexible  criteria.  If every company had to smell  like  a

rose,  look like a rose and feel like a rose before it  stood

the  chance of being accepted as a rose, we would end up with

a very small rose garden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim has asked that Government be more pro-active in identifying global and regional champions.

However,  Mr  Inderjit  Singh  felt  that  Government  should

outsource the selection of promising local enterprises (PLEs)

to  the  private  sector, as Government officials  cannot  be

relied  upon  to choose winners correctly.  The  Government's

approach is to recognise winners that have been chosen by the

market.   We  welcome feedback and nominations  of  PLEs  and

potential regional champions from the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, access to financing. Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Ong

Kian  Min,  Mr  Arthur  Fong, Dr John Chen  and  others  have

pointed  out  the  difficulties that SMEs have  in  obtaining

financing.   Their  concern  is  valid.   In  fact,  in  most

countries, start-ups and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



SMEs  at  an  early stage find it difficult  to  obtain  bank

loans.   In  the  US, for instance, few start-ups  and  early

stage ventures obtain their financing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have pointed out, the tradition among

Singapore-based  banks  has been to  lend  on  the  basis  of

balance  sheets  rather than cash flows.   This  has  led  to

particular   difficulties   during  the  economic   downturn,

because  of falling asset values.  The Ministry is encouraged

by  the interest of some banks to develop cash flow financing

facilities.  The banks will have to build up the expertise to

make  cash  flow projections and monitor companies' positions

on  an  ongoing basis.  But the SMEs themselves will have  to

open  up their books to the banks, much more than is the case

for  traditional  financing, and develop  better  methods  of

financial  management.  SPRING Singapore  has  implemented  a

Financial Advisor grant scheme to help SMEs in doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen and Mr Arthur Fong were concerned that

present Government financing schemes for SMEs were also asset

based  and  do not provide working capital or business  cycle

financing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has been paying special attention to

working  capital  financing, including cash  flow  financing.

Under  the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS), Government

has  made working capital loans to over 400 firms last  year,

compared to 35 a year earlier.  SPRING Singapore's new  Micro

Loans Programme, which provides loans of up to $50,000,  very

small  amounts but to very small companies, without requiring

evidence of orders in hand, has been very popular.  More than

<br><br>500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micro loans have been granted since November last  year,

when the scheme was first started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has also increased its share of the

loan  risk under LEFS, from 50% to 80%, in the two off-Budget

packages  last year to encourage the participating  financial

institutions  not  to cut back on lending  under  the  scheme

during  the economic downturn.  Similarly, Government funding

for certain schemes under the Local Enterprise Technical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



Assistance Scheme (LETAS) was raised from 50% to 70%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LEFS and LETAS enhancements are due to expire at the

end of next month.  Government has decided to extend them  to

the  end of the year to help tide SMEs over while the economy

is recovering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING Singapore is also exploring a Loan Insurance

Scheme for SMEs, whereby participating financial institutions

buy insurance on the market to cover part of the risk of loan

default.   SPRING  Singapore will help defray  the  insurance

premium  costs.  It hopes to introduce the scheme later  this

year, which should widen the financing options open to SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also suggested that the LEFS

scheme   be  expanded  to  allow  for  hybrid  financing   by

participating financial institutions, for example, where  VCs

and  investors  provide convertible loans  or  subscribe  for

preferred shares.  We agree with Mr Singh that this is  worth

looking into.  However, we will need to adjust the terms  for

LEFS,  including the question of whether it  would  still  be

appropriate for Government to share 80% of the risk when  the

investors are using equity-type instruments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen asked for the Government to take more

direct  stakes  in SMEs and start-ups.  This is  indeed  what

EDB's  Start-Up Enterprises Development Scheme (SEEDS)  seeks

to do.  SEEDS was set up in October last year.  So far, about

40  applications have been approved, amounting to  an  equity

injection  of  $10  million  from  SEEDS,  with  a   matching

injection of $10 million from the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, capability development. Sir, the Government has

sought  where  it  can to improve SMEs' access  to  financial

markets.   That  is  the first prong.  The  second  prong  of

Government assistance to SMEs is to help them build up  their

capabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cost environment will never match that of countries

with a lower standard of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



living  than us.  But SMEs can grow and succeed by developing

the  capacity  to innovate.  Many other high  cost  countries

have  a vibrant SME sector.  Denmark is one example.  It  has

thriving  SMEs, and their level of productivity averages  86%

of   that   of   large  enterprises.   In  Singapore,   SMEs'

productivity  is  about  60% of  the  national  average.   In

Germany,  most of the companies in the precision  engineering

industry,  where  Germany is widely acknowledged  to  be  the

world  leader,  are  SMEs.   In the  state  of  Bavaria,  for

instance,   SMEs  account  for  over  half   of   the   total

manufacturing   sector's  employment   and   about   40%   of

manufacturing turnover.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua said that we should not neglect

Old  Economy  firms.  We agree with her.   Innovation  is  as

important in the Old Economy as in the New Economy,  and  the

labels   themselves  are  wearing  thin  as   knowledge-based

enterprises spring up in what used to be thought  of  as  Old

Economy industries.  We have had several home grown successes

in  some of these industries.  The food industry is   a  good

example.  Apart from well-known examples like Tee Yih Jia and

others  who  have  made  it  big internationally,  there  are

several  other  local companies with great promise.   Let  me

mention two companies which I visited earlier this year,  and

whose  founders I met.  They are examples of companies  which

have,  even  in  the  downturn,  continued  to  innovate  and

experiment  with  new products, processes and  concepts,  and

have succeeded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first example is Tac's Pte Ltd. Tac's turns

industrial  waste  in  the form of raw soybean  residue  into

nutritional  bakery food products which are high  in  dietary

fibre.   The  residue  is called OKARA.   It  is  a  Japanese

concept.   The  idea came from founder Bill  Lee's  encounter

with  a Japanese scientist who introduced him to the concept.

From  a small family business running a traditional cafeteria

at  the  Singapore General Hospital, Tac's now  has  a  7,000

square  feet  factory  with its own R&D department,  creating

original  soybean  based  bakery  products,  including  OKARA

burgers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second example is BreadTalk, a boutique in what must

be one of the oldest food industries.  They have been able to

differentiate  themselves  from other  bakeries  by  creating

original pastries that appeal to Asian tastes, such as  their

signature pork floss bun.  George Quek, BreadTalk's  founder,

started  his entrepreneurial career in Taiwan, where  from  a

very  humble start, he built up a successful food stall.   He

returned in the early 90s and started his first food court at

Junction 8, where he introduced the concept of profit sharing

with  his  stall operators, and brought in foreign fare  like

Thai  and Japanese food in addition to the regular food court

staples.   From  his experience in running a multi-fare  food

court, George struck on the idea of putting traditional Asian

favourites like "bak hu" and "tom yam" into bread  and  buns.

He  started  BreadTalk, which has now grown to 13 outlets  in

Singapore  and is now planning his expansion into  China  and

the rest of the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, neither Bill Lee nor George Quek started off in

high-tech  or  knowledge-based  businesses.   But  they  have

succeeded  by  experimenting and investing in  new  concepts,

taking   calculated  risks  and  executing  their  strategies

carefully.   Both  firms  received  grants  and  loans   from

Government  to  help  them in their  innovations.   Both  are

located  at JTC's Kampong Ampat Foodlink, which is a facility

designed   to   allow   for   cost   synergies   among   food

manufacturers.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the LETAS scheme, which I mentioned earlier, helps

SMEs  improve their business capabilities in a range of areas

-   product,   business   and   market   development,   brand

development,   as   well   as   technical   and    operations

improvements.  Even in the economic downturn, the  number  of

grants  approved under LETAS increased by 11% last year.   In

addition,  SPRING Singapore's Jumpstart E-commerce  Programme

has  helped one in three SMEs make e-commerce part  of  their

business  operations,  by getting them  to  adopt  affordable

ready-made shared solutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed expressed concern that

improving  the  productivity of companies may  lead  to  less

employment.  Sir, if our enterprises are more productive  and

efficient, they will be more competitive.  Most, even if  not

all, will hire more workers as their business volume goes up.

A  productive economy and vibrant enterprise scene will  also

attract  new  investments  and  new  businesses,  leading  to

greater employment overall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Miss Penny Low asked that Government help SMEs who

cannot  upgrade  and  cannot  compete  effectively  to   exit

gracefully.  As a general principle, entry and exit  have  to

be left to the market.  However, the SME retail sector in HDB

estates  faces a special, structural problem.   There  is  an

excess  supply  of  shops  in some  estates  and  not  enough

business.  Some rationalisation is unavoidable and will  help

those  shopkeepers whose business remains viable.  As Members

know,  the  Government  has piloted  a  Voluntary  Retirement

Scheme  in  seven  selected estates.   Last  year,  about  95

shopkeepers, or 35% of those affected, decided to take up the

offer  of ex-gratia payment and exit from the business.   The

ERC  Subcommittee  on Domestic Enterprises is  considering  a

proposal to allow merchants or neighbourhood associations  to

initiate  the  Voluntary Retirement Scheme  (VRS)  for  their

neighbourhoods, rather than leaving the selection to HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be mistaken to assume that the entire SME

sector  is  mired  in  problems.  I have  highlighted  a  few

examples  of  enterprising SMEs that  have  thrived  in  this

difficult business environment.  SMEs, as a whole,  are  also

expressing more confidence now that the economic downturn  is

bottoming out.  SPRING Singapore's survey of SMEs in December

last  year  showed  that 82% of SMEs  felt  that  they  could

survive at least seven months or longer, up sharply from  46%

of  SMEs in July.  In March this year, another survey  showed

that  the  proportion of SMEs reporting worsening  cash  flow

dropped to 56% from 86% in December.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will do what it can to improve and refine

the assistance it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



renders  to SMEs.  But Government can only act as a catalyst,

and  not  a  continuing  source  of  support.   We  can  give

promising firms a leg up, not a crutch.  The best way for the

Government  to  help SMEs grow is to provide a pro-enterprise

environment  that  facilitates the growth of  enterprises  by

keeping  taxes low, removing barriers to entry and exit,  and

maintaining  a level playing field for all competitors.   The

SMEs  are  responsible for their own survival and  growth  in

this   competition.   If  they  continuously  upgrade   their

capabilities,  develop  their human capital,  and  invest  in

innovations,  they  can  get ahead  of  the  competition  and

withstand the vicissitudes of the economic environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon asked that Government upgrade and

revitalise  Jurong Industrial Estate.  Jurong  is  a  vibrant

industrial  district.  It has seen several new  state-of-the-art  specialised parks, such as Tuas Biomedical Park,  Jurong

Island  Petrochemical  Hub and the  Chemical  Logistics  Hub.

However,  although there have been new housing  developments,

shopping centres and leisure facilities in the Jurong region,

Jurong  was planned as a predominantly industrial-use estate.

This  has given rise to the perception of a lack of  buzz  in

Jurong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC and URA are therefore looking at how Jurong can be

reinvigorated,  including introducing  more  mixed  uses  and

creating a work-live-learn-play environment in the long term.

The  transport infrastructure in Jurong will also be improved

- last October, the Ministry of Transport announced plans for

a  new  light  rapid transit line in the Jurong  region.   In

addition, JTC is undertaking en bloc development of selective

sites  to rejuvenate the estate.  And the experience of those

en  bloc exercises so far has been very successful.  We  will

get more feedback from Mrs Yu-Foo and other MPs in Jurong  as

our plans progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min has highlighted that industrialists in

Tuas   find  it  difficult  to  attract  employees,  due   to

inadequate public transportation infrastructure there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>



We  have  had similar feedback from industrialists.  As  Tuas

Industrial  Estate is new, public transportation  is  not  as

extensive or as frequent as desired because of the high costs

involved  in  providing a service to cater  for  the  peakish

ridership over a widely dispersed area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC is currently working with the Ministry of Transport

and  the  public transport operator (SBS Transit) to  improve

public  transport  service levels. As an immediate  solution,

SBS Transit will be refining some of the existing services to

provide   a  direct  connection  to  Tuas  and  shorten   the

travelling time from Boon Lay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Ong Kian Min had commented that

tenants in JTC's amenity centres should be allowed extensions

in  their leases beyond the current nine years.  Mr Ang  also

suggested  fixed rental rates to help keep costs  down.   JTC

amenities  are leased out on 3-year terms, with an option  to

extend  the lease for a further 3-year term, up to a  maximum

of nine years.  The amenities are put for re-tender after the

nine years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-tendering is part and parcel of market competition.

It  provides  opportunities for new entrants, and establishes

fair  market  value.  Existing operators should  be  able  to

recover  their  investments over a nine-year  period  as  the

upfront investment in canteens is not high.  Re-tendering  to

establish  fair  market value is better than  JTC  having  to

decide  on an appropriate fixed rental.  JTC recognises  that

its  earlier tender mechanism may have contributed to  overly

high  bidding  by new entrants.  It has improved  its  tender

mechanism  to ensure that the process is fair and transparent

to  all  parties.   It  has introduced premature  termination

clauses to discourage bidders from submitting unrealistically

high bids just to try out.  Other recent improvements include

an  open  e-bidding system, somewhat similar to the open  COE

bidding system, where bids are transparent for all to see.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to

touch on the issue of promoting entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the new tax measures are welcome, the basic issue

for entrepreneurs is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



cost first and foremost, and whether they get taxed at 24% or

20%  rate is just a small issue.  I can personally vouch  for

this, given my many experiences of starting up companies  and

working with start-ups.  Entrepreneurs aim to create so  much

of  wealth that the tax rate is a small issue because of  the

great  wealth they are going to create.  It becomes an  issue

after they have become rich.  Their real worry in their early

days  is  whether they survive or not, and for sure the  cost

factor is the biggest issue for them.  They will be extremely

grateful  and  will  remain very loyal  to  Singapore  if  we

address their survival concerns, and this involves costs  and

access to funds.  The immediate impact of the tax issue is to

attract the already rich and the already successful.  I think

we  should also try to focus on entrepreneurs who are  trying

and who are basically "PhDs" - poor, hungry and driven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the financial cost of creating new

companies,  one  big factor is the cost of failure.   And  by

cost of failure, I do not just mean the social cost (that one

is  one  of  intolerance to failure, which we have a  problem

here  in Singapore), but also the high price one has  to  pay

because  of  the  high cost of living in  Singapore.   Having

failed in a business may mean one never being able to  own  a

house  or  a car for a long time. Such fears deter many  from

taking risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can spend a lot of time talking about

entrepreneurship as I have spent a lot of time on it, I would

like  just  to go to some specific issues which I  feel  need

addressing.  I am very encouraged, listening to the  Minister

and  the  Senior Minister of State, that there are  many  new

initiatives, and I think these will really help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of EDB's SEED financial scheme, I think

that  has  helped a lot.  Can I suggest that we  include  the

amounts  that an entrepreneur may have already spent  on  his

own,  including  in  kind  or in  cash,  and  also  what  the

entrepreneur  may  be  spending from his  own  pocket  moving

forward, when they consider matching the grant, and not  just

matching  what the new investors are going to put  in?   This

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



greatly help them.  Matching something that he is going to

put in over time can mean that he may draw down on the SEED

funds over a period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is one of streamlining rules and

regulations  to  cut  down on red tape, especially  licensing

requirements.   We  talked about the 12  licences  needed  to

operate  a  pub.   In this respect, we have a  pro-enterprise

panel  that  the Government has set up.  This has  been  very

effective  in trying to resolve issues that businesses  face.

This  is  headed  by  Mr Lim Siong Guan, who  has  tremendous

influence  over  many  Ministries.   I  hope  that  the  pro-enterprise panel will be a permanent feature so that  we  can

continue to address the issue of red tape and bureaucracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also make it easier to register as well as to

shut  down companies.  The nature of entrepreneurship is that

entrepreneurs  have limited resources and have  to  face  the

risk  of  failure.   While there have  been  improvements  in

setting up companies, we should make it even easier to  start

up  companies.   Shutting down companies can be  a  nightmare

too,  and it is a very onerous task and takes a long time  to

happen and costs a lot of money. We need to change the  rules

to  allow  easier shutting down of companies, in addition  to

easier  setting up of companies.  The cost of  maintaining  a

company  is  also  an issue, where there are many  regulatory

requirements  from the Registry of Companies  and  Businesses

and also from IRAS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that, in addition to the many financing

schemes and funds that were given to VCs, we set up a special

entrepreneurship fund that can be farmed out to  a  group  of

Singaporean  businessmen or entrepreneurs  who  already  have

experience.   They could manage this fund on  behalf  of  the

Government.   I think this will complement the VCs  that  are

already here in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the issue of HDB shophouses, the Senior

Minister  of  State mentioned this.  Can I suggest  that  the

vacant HDB shophouses that come about be converted to offices

for technology



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



type  of  start-ups that are basically light  industries  and

those  which are non-polluting?  This, in addition to helping

to  lower cost, will help make the neighbourhood more vibrant

and  also increase availability of space, thus allowing  cost

of commercial spaces to come down further.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir,

entrepreneurship, we all know, is today's buzzword.  In fact,

Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, speaking on entrepreneurship in

Singapore  earlier  this year at the Ho Rih  Hwa  Lecture  on

Entrepreneurial Culture, gave his prognosis.  I  suppose  the

debate  will continue whether we can nurture entrepreneurship

or  whether it is born with such people.  MTI should look  at

entrepreneurship from a wider perspective as to  how  we  can

inculcate  a spirit of enterprise in our people.   This  seed

for  the spirit of enterprise can be sowed only if people are

willing to take risks, meaning less kiasuism, and willing  to

go  out  and  be more adventurous.  For example, we,  at  the

North-East  CDC, have been looking at this issue and  try  to

see how we can help to bring about this spirit of enterprise.

We   are  encouraging,  for  example,  students  to  go  into

business.   Hai  Sing Catholic School, for example,  will  be

marketing  second-hand pots and pans as well as flowers  from

the  school  garden through their own Entrepreneurship  Club.

So  we are also encouraging more schools to look into setting

up entrepreneurship clubs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the Innovation and Creative Fund to develop

the spirit of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship among the

residents  of  North-East CDC.  We are working with  ITE  and

Shell  to also look at how we can bring about this objective.

We  also have a Dare-To-Dream Fund where we want to encourage

people  to go out of their way to look at new ideas and  even

venture into something where they take risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to ask is whether, in fact,

MTI  and  its agencies, for example, the A*STAR,  could  also

look   into   areas   where  we  can  work  with   grassroots

organisations, even CDCs, and see how we can bring about this

spirit of enterprise amongst our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,

promoting entrepreneurship has been a hot topic in  the  last

few  years.  The Government supports entrepreneurship through

many  programmes and funding.  I am very happy  to  hear  the

Minister's response to the many concerns that were addressed.

I have three, of which the Minister has addressed.  I will go

to the last concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society needs an attitude and cultural change to promote

entrepreneurship.  We must go beyond the mere  acceptance  of

business  failures.  We must welcome them,  like  we  welcome

Khoo Swee Chiow when he failed to cross the North Pole - with

wide open and accepting arms.  It is a fact that nine out  of

10  businesses  will  fail.   But a  true  entrepreneur  will

persevere  and press on.   They would have learnt  a  lot  of

valuable  experience  by their first failure.   The  Ministry

would like to look into how society can actually support them

to  restart again.  After gaining these valuable lessons,  it

will  be  most shameful if they cannot restart their business

due to prejudice, lack of funding or support.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must educate our society to adopt this change.

Getting  good  and  high paying jobs  in  private  or  public

services  should  be seen as second or third  career  choice.

The  first career choice should be to venture out on our  own

as  an  entrepreneur.  This we need to educate the  shift  in

mindset, especially on the parents.  The Ministry would  also

like  to consider working with the Education Ministry to send

some of the tertiary students, who are studying business,  to

go  into  the  smaller  businesses and SMEs  for  internship,

understudy and learn from these entrepreneurs.  This will cut

short the learning process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to conclude by asking the Minister

if  he believes in promoting entrepreneurship as a core value

of  our new society.  If so, how would the Ministry intend to

promote it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua mentioned

yesterday that unglamorous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>



old   economy  industries  might  feel  left   out   of   the

Government's attention, an issue that the Senior Minister  of

State  has  answered.   I have a similar  concern  about  new

economy  sectors in that when Government policies, investment

promotion efforts and resources are directed towards  certain

new  growth areas, such as R&D, life sciences, chemicals  and

infocomm, could we inadvertently let other promising  sectors

slip  by  as they are not on our radar screen?  For  example,

where were we when the first wave of Internet companies  took

off  in the US?  Innovators and entrepreneurs who are in  the

ignored sectors feel discouraged because what they do is  not

fashionable.  I do not think our Government agencies actually

brush them away.  But they do feel that insufficient interest

and encouragement are given to their endeavours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we must remain focused, I would like to ask how

our  new growth areas are determined and arrived at.  And how

can  we  be  sure that these darlings of today  will  achieve

their  potential in the years ahead?  What if we  are  wrong?

Can we have some ways to catch all and nurture creativity and

tap  bright innovative ideas in as many sectors as  possible?

Will  we  be  able  to catch the next big wave  as  early  as

possible?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should develop more creative talents. To start the

creativity revolution among Singaporeans, we should set aside

more  money and put in place an ongoing programme  to  create

just for the sake of creating, and not to be driven initially

by  business  and  commercial considerations.   The  business

people  can  come  in later to see how to  make  use  of  the

innovations  and inventions that have been created  and  make

commercial applications out of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after we have come up with an innovative idea, the

next  step is to explore the full commercial benefits of  the

innovation.   We  have  quite  a  number  of  internationally

renowned   research  institutes.   Let   us   say   our   R&D

laboratories  come  out  with a new invention  and  they  are

looking  to  sell  this  invention to someone  who  sees  the

potential and who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>



can realise the full commercial value of the product.  If  an

innovator  approaches a Singapore company, even  a  GLC,  how

much  can  a  local company, with its limited  market  reach,

offer  for  it compared to an American or international  MNC,

who  has the marketing clout and international brand to  push

the  sales?   If  it  comes  to a  bidding  war  to  buy  the

invention, of course, the MNC, with its access to hundreds of

millions,  if not billions of consumers worldwide,  would  be

prepared  to  pay  a  higher price and it  would  be  in  the

commercial interest of the local innovators to get  the  best

deal  for  themselves.  Where does that leave our  innovation

effort?   Is  it to do research and come out with good  ideas

only  to  be  taken  over  by large  foreign  companies?   To

complement  and  support our efforts in innovation,  we  must

also  build  up  or acquire strong marketing  companies  with

strong  brand presence in the international marketplace.   We

should pay more attention to this aspect.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Sir, I thank Members for their useful

comments on encouraging entrepreneurship in Singapore.  These

are  very  relevant as a vibrant enterprise system will  help

drive  our future economic growth.  Let me touch on  some  of

the issues that they have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Dr John Chen suggested that we should

encourage bright business ideas from anywhere in the world to

take  root here.  We agree.  This was why in 1999,  DPM  Tony

Tan launched and led the Technopreneurship 21 programme.  Its

aim  was to foster the growth of start-ups, especially  those

which  build on high technology, innovation and the  creation

of intellectual property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min made a good point when he said that we

should  not confine ourselves just to this area.  Recognising

that  start-ups  are not just in high technology  areas,  T21

will  be  broadened  into Enterprise  21,  to  develop  in  a

holistic  manner  an  enterprise ecosystem  that  would  make

Singapore  a compelling base for all enterprises -  local  or

foreign.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Members - that access to capital,

availability of capital is a key factor to develop enterprise

in  Singapore.   What  we  need is a deep  and  sophisticated

capital market that caters to a spectrum of risk appetite for

enterprises at all stages of their growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the last few days, many Members

have cautioned against too much direct Government involvement

in business.  Along the same line, our approach to enterprise

financing  should  be to let the market allocate  capital  to

companies  with the best ideas, business plans and  execution

skills.  Government should step in to help catalyse this only

when there is a market gap, a market failure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen had highlighted that there may be just such

a  gap  for  companies at the early start-up stage.   As  SMS

Tharman  said, recognising this, EDB has launched the Startup

Enterprise  Development Scheme (SEEDS) last year.   Mr  Singh

suggested  that  SEEDS  also matches the  investment  of  the

entrepreneur.  However, the Government, as Members have said,

may not be the best judge of private sector initiatives.   So

it  is  essential  that it remains driven by  private  sector

evaluation with the Government matching the investment of the

third party investor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many businessmen have told me that our financial

institutions tend to give loans only if these are  backed  by

tangible assets.  Other forms of credit assessment,  such  as

those  based on cash flow projections, have yet to take  off.

Some  have suggested why do we not have something similar  to

what the US have, which is the Small Business Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the approach which SPRING Singapore has taken is

that  instead  of  concentrating SME financing  in  a  single

institution, such as a Small Business Association, it spreads

it  to  more  than  20  participating financial  institutions

(PFIs)  under LEFS.  These PFIs are a good mix of both  local

and  foreign financial institutions with some focusing on SME

lending,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



such  as  Heller  Financial, Sing Investment and  Hong  Leong

Finance.   SMEs can thus choose from a range of PFIs  in  the

pool.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further ensure that access to financing for small

businesses  is  not  hampered by lack of industry  knowledge,

SPRING Singapore would welcome private sector initiative - be

it  from the Singapore Business Federation, TiE, or any other

chamber  or  industry association, who  is  willing  to  come

forward  and  provide more of such financing.  If  they  meet

with MAS' regulations, SPRING can then accord them PFI status

to allow them to offer loans to their SME partners or members

with  the  Government bearing a portion of the risk which  is

currently 80:20.  This will give SMEs a wider choice of  loan

providers with varying thresholds of risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min made an important observation on

innovation.   He said that good business ideas need  at  some

stage  to  be commercialised and how do we capture this.   As

Tharman   mentioned  earlier  there  are  various  assistance

schemes  to  help  not  just  technology  but  non-technology

companies to actually expand their businesses.  He  gave  the

example of BreadTalk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, A*STAR created "Exploit Technologies" to

centrally   manage  the  intellectual  property  created   by

research  institutes and to facilitate the efficient transfer

of technology to industry.  Through this mechanism, we foster

healthy   collaboration  between  Research   Institutes   and

businesses.   To  illustrate,  the  Singapore  Institute   of

Manufacturing Technology collaborated with a local SME, Prime

Electrical  Products,  to develop a  lifestyle  water  heater

which  is  now  selling  regionally.   Another  example,  the

Institute  for  Communications  Research  has  licensed   two

patents  to  a company called iDetect Technology to  help  it

develop  the  Microwave-Guard.  This is  a  credit-card  size

device  that measures radiation leakage from microwave  ovens

and warns the user if the leakage exceeds safety levels.  The

company has plans to sell the product into Australia, Europe,

Japan and the US.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support these efforts, it is critical, as Minister

George Yeo said, that we protect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



intellectual  property.  It takes years of  painstaking  hard

work   to  come  up  with  an  invention  and  to  apply   it

commercially.   Futuristic as Star Wars is,  even  Yoda,  the

sage  in the series, could not foresee that an illegal  clone

of  Episode  II  of Star Wars could be circulating  over  the

Internet  a  week  before  its grand  premiere.   So  at  the

Ministry,  we  say,  may the force be with  the  creators  of

intellectual property.  To bring that about, my  Ministry  is

working  with  the Ministry of Law to review our intellectual

property   protection   laws   comprehensively   to   further

strengthen our regime and encourage innovation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have spoken on rules. Rules provide

business    certainty   and   a   transparent,   corrupt-free

environment.  But we must be careful not to stifle creativity

and  innovation  with unnecessary rules.  Mr  Inderjit  Singh

suggested   that   the   Government  streamline   rules   and

regulations and to incorporate sunset clauses so  that  rules

have  expiry  dates.  The Entrepreneurship and  International

Sub-committee  of  the  ERC, which Mr  Inderjit  Singh  is  a

member,  has  proposed  that there be  a  mandatory  periodic

review  of  rules  by  a  high-powered  Rules  Review   Panel

comprising   senior   civil  servants  and   private   sector

representatives.   The matter is under consideration  by  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members, however, would be pleased to know that we

already  have a headstart in rules.  As Mr Singh said,  since

September  2000,  the  Head of the  civil  service  has  been

chairing  a  Pro-Enterprise  Panel.   Mr  Singh  has  been  a

dedicated  member  of the Panel, bringing fresh  perspectives

and  ideas  for the review.  Since its set-up, the Panel  has

received 344 suggestions, of which 145 have been accepted and

59  pending review.  The Panel will continue to be  proactive

in cutting red tape.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the OASIS project under MTI and MOF, which

stands for Online Application System for Integrated Services.

By  putting  licence  applications for  starting  a  business

online, we aim to reduce the number of such licences  by  10%

and average processing time from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



three weeks to 10 days by the middle of next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested also that we allow HDB

shophouses  to be used for technology start-ups.   We  agree.

Since 1999, HDB has revised its rules to allow shopkeepers to

use  their  shophouses for non-retail purposes, including  as

offices,  showrooms and food shops.  HDB went a step  further

to  liberalise the use of the living quarters above the shops

in March 2001.  Now, shopkeepers can use or sublet the living

quarters above shophouses for all commercial purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh has also suggested that we make it easier to

register as well as to shut down companies and streamline the

procedures  for  maintaining  a  company.   The  Ministry  of

Finance   set  up  the  Company  Legislation  and  Regulatory

Framework  Committee (CLRFC) in December 1999 to undertake  a

comprehensive  review  of  our  company  law  and  regulatory

framework.   The Committee recognised the need to  streamline

and  simplify  incorporation and compliance requirements  for

small   companies.    It   has  just   released   its   draft

recommendations on 9th May 2002 for public comment.   I  urge

Mr Singh and interested parties to give their feedback to the

Committee  on  its  recommendations.   The  draft  report  is

available at the MOF website at www.mof.gov.sg.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond rules and regulations, we should study ways to

liberalise  our markets to enlarge the private sector  space.

At  the same time, it will ensure that our business costs are

market-driven and competitive, which is a point  made  by  Mr

Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked for an update on energy

deregulation.  Much of this has been done.  We have separated

the   competitive  parts  of  the  business,  namely,   power

generation  and retail, from the natural monopoly,  which  is

the  operation of the power grid.  This was effected when the

new  Electricity Act was passed in this House in  March  last

year.  Since then, we have seven new players in retailing and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



two  new  firms in generation.  The market rules  to  further

improve the energy market are going into its final tests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the retail sector, we will liberalise that in

stages.  Since July 2001, we extended contestability from 100

large  customers  to  200.  This means  that  for  these  200

consumers,  they  can  choose which  retailer  they  want  to

purchase their energy from.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Energy Market Authority survey of some of these

consumers revealed that 86% of them enjoyed lower electricity

costs  after  the  restructuring exercise.  For  example,  in

September   last  year,  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority   of

Singapore  (CAAS)  managed to cut electricity  cost  by  30%.

CAAS  will  pass these savings on to its tenants and  private

developers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the middle of next year, we plan to extend

contestability to another 10,500 large consumers.   The  rest

of   the  consumers,  totalling  about  a  million  household

accounts, will be opened in phases, starting towards the  end

of 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong suggested yesterday that the Government

should  defray  part of the costs of companies going  abroad.

IE  Singapore  has  certain schemes that  help  companies  in

skills  upgrading  and  marketing  for  internationalisation.

These  schemes  are  rightly  to help  in  capacity-building,

rather  than  pure cost subsidies.  In the larger  scheme  of

things,  however, the basic enabling business structure  must

be the general fiscal regime that has been enunciated in this

Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members have spoken about building an

entrepreneurial culture.  I do not know whether entrepreneurs

are  made  or  born.   But  I do know  that  many  attributes

associated  with  entrepreneurs: the  "dare  to  experiment",

"dare to fail" spirit, can possibly be cultivated from young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I agree with Mr Zainul Abidin, Mr Inderjit Singh and

Mr  Steve  Chia's  call for education in entrepreneurship  in

schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



and  at  the community level.  MOE has cut curriculum content

by up to 30% in some subjects, to allow the schools and their

students  more  time  to  question, explore  and  experiment.

Several  of  our schools already have specific programmes  to

nurture in our pupils an enterprising spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperative societies, which are recognised CCAs, have

been  formed  in  some schools.  Some of our junior  colleges

have  started Young Enterprise Clubs to develop  and  nurture

future entrepreneurs.  Schools on their own have collaborated

with CDCs and business corporations to solicit grants to fund

their various business projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan

launched  Bizworld,  a not-for-profit programme  that  brings

real-world business experiences to children between Primary 5

and  Secondary  2.   It  is a business  simulation  programme

created  by  Tim Draper, the Managing Director and Co-Founder

of  Draper  Fisher, to help students in the  US  learn  about

entrepreneurship.  Its success has prompted DFJ to  replicate

the  programme in Singapore.  With the help of EDB,  Bizworld

was  successfully  introduced to Anglo-Chinese  (Independent)

School.  Another 39 schools have signed up their teachers  to

be trained to teach this programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do more to widen the access for the young and

adults to entrepreneurship education.  What I think, however,

is  hard to teach is the passion that Mr Inderjit Singh spoke

about.  I think passionate entrepreneurs will not be deterred

by  the  cost of failure.  The worst downside to  failure  is

generally  the same in any country - bankruptcy.  Whether  in

Singapore  or  any other country, a bankrupt is  unlikely  to

afford  a  car or house.  To make it easier for entrepreneurs

to  start  afresh,  this House has passed amendments  to  the

Bankruptcy Act in 1999 to address some of these issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How our society views risk-taking and failures, as both

Dr  John Chen and Mr Inderjit Singh said, will affect to some

degree the quality of entrepreneurship but, ultimately, it is

passion and conviction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>



of entrepreneurs that will make the difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, may I make some remarks on remaking

Singapore?   Much has been made of the Remaking of  Singapore

Committees.  Let me give my perspectives on this.  There  are

no  quick fixes here.  I sense that some feel that we  should

wrap  up quickly, have less discussions and debate, and  come

out  with  the magic formula, so that we can get on with  it.

Aladdin's  lamps  are  as  rare in Singapore  as  in  Arabia.

Remaking  Singapore  is  a  process.   The  Economic   Review

Committee  and  the  Government  are  setting  the  strategic

architecture to achieve our vision of an entrepreneurship and

knowledge-driven    economy   with    globally    competitive

manufacturing and service sectors.  Debate and discussion are

critical, so that our strategic intent is understood  by  all

Singaporeans, without which we will fail.  To intercept  this

future,   I   believe  requires  a  process   of   successive

approximations of what needs to be done, rather  than  a  new

detailed blueprint that is cast in stone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the famous Spanish poet, Antonio Machado said:

"Pilgrims,  ask not where the road is.  The road is  made  by

walking."

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Leong, would you like to withdraw your

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, since we have a bit of time,

may  I  ask the Minister a few questions?  First, in relation

to  Sentosa,  perhaps we should also not forget the  offshore

islands.   Many Singaporeans in fact go all the way to  Batam

or even Bintan for resorts.  So, please do not forget that we

can  also  develop  our offshore islands  as  another  resort

destination for Singaporeans, besides Sentosa.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to address my second remark to Mr

Raymond  Lim.   I have heard of this new committee  reviewing

the  formation  of companies.  I would like to  give  him  an

immediate  feedback:  one  of the rules  that  I  find  quite

cumbersome  is  that,  for  the  registration  of   Singapore

companies,  domestic addresses, ie, HDB addresses or  private

home addresses,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



cannot be used as the registered address of a company.   That

actually  deters  many  people from  forming  companies.   To

enable them to start companies, maybe that can be reviewed.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, the islands to the south

of  Sentosa, which were reclaimed for high-class housing, are

now  under  Sentosa  Development  Corporation  and  will   be

developed in an integrated way with the rest of Sentosa.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Leong, would you like to withdraw your

amendment now?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Yes. Sir, I would like to thank the

Minister, Senior Minister of State and Minister of State  for

their elaborate and very persuasive replies.  I beg leave  to

withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code VA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to hear from the Minister of State that

we  should attract entrepreneurship wherever these  may  come

from  and develop these ideas if the ideas are good  for  us.

The  slew  of  industry  incentives  and  assistance  schemes

provided by the Government has been very helpful to companies

to  improve their operations.  I would like to ask, if it  is

true, that these incentives and schemes are not available  to

bodies  or  persons, such as trade, industry and professional

associations, and, if so, can these be extended to them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to declare my interest as Chairman of

Singapore  Quality Institute.  These bodies provide  services

to  their members and, often, also the general public.   Some

are  also  engaged in business.  They are also  a  source  of

entrepreneurship.   If they have access  to  these  incentive

schemes, they too can use them to improve their operations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, we agree with Dr Tan

Boon  Wan  that  certain  industry  associations  should   be

eligible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



for  support under the Local Enterprise Technical  Assistance

Scheme  (LETAS).   Currently,  SPRING  Singapore  is  already

supporting  industry associations that cater  principally  to

SMEs.   Project supported could be aimed either at  upgrading

the  associations' own operations, so as to better serve  the

needs  of  the SME members or at upgrading the industry  they

represent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, do you wish to withdraw your

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $569,087,400 for Head V ordered to stand part

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head N, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Dr

Ong Chit Chung.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head N of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has happened since the last Budget debate. It

was  a  trying year; it was a watershed year.  We watched  in

horror  and  shock  as  the World Trade  Centre  Twin  Towers

collapsed  into  a heap of rubble right before  our  eyes  on

television.   Thousands perished.  September 11  changed  our

lives.   The world is not the same anymore.  Terrorism  looms

large.  Terrorism can strike anywhere, anytime at anyone.  We

have to be prepared.  We have to be alert.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nations have to sink their differences and unite in

countering   terrorism  and  preserve  lives.    Individuals,

corporations  and nations have, one and all,  to  redo  their

sums,   reassess   their  positions  and  re-engineer   their

strategies and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



tactics.   Being  the prime victim as well as the  superpower

and  leader  of the free world, the United States  takes  the

lead  in combating and countering terrorism.  Nations  around

the   world  have  come  together  to  share  resources   and

intelligence   in   implementing   counter-measures   against

terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism is global, so must be the fight against

terrorism.  Likewise, Singapore has come out strongly against

terrorism.  We have worked with the United States  and  other

nations to counter terrorism.  It is the right thing  to  do.

We  have to stand up and be counted.  It is also, Sir, in our

interest,  as  a small nation, to do so.  We are  vulnerable.

We  need to work with other nations.  If not, when we are  in

trouble  and we ask for help, they will ask, "Where were  you

when you were needed most?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within Southeast Asia, September 11 has opened up

potential  fault lines of race and religion across the  whole

region.   Religious fundamentalism and terrorism could  be  a

volatile  mix  threatening the peace  and  stability  of  the

region as well as the economic well-being of our people.  The

case  of JI clearly confirmed the international dimension  of

terrorism.    Singapore,  KL,  Manila   and   Jakarta   need,

therefore,  to  liaise  closely on  preventive  measures  and

counter-terrorism.  The Minister may wish to comment  on  the

state of cooperation amongst the ASEAN partners on this issue

and how we can further strengthen our security network in the

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the strategic landscape has indeed changed.

September 11 has altered the triangular relationship  amongst

the  US, China and Japan, and changed and altered the balance

of  power  in  this  region.  China's relationship  with  the

United  States has turned for the better after September  11.

Both are now combating the common enemy in terrorism.  China,

as  we  know,  has  its  own  Muslim  separatist  problem  in

Xinjiang.    Therefore,  in  this  climate,  the  spy   plane

incident,  the Taiwan issue and human rights are now  put  on

the  backburner and are not so contentious.  And China  glows

in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



limelight  of  WTO, the APEC Summit and the coming  Olympics.

It was, indeed, a good turn of events for China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After September 11, Malaysia also has a new beginning in

its relationship with the US.  All past frictions are happily

forgotten, and Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir has found

a  new  role  as the moderate voice of Islamic nations.   And

this  is much welcomed and appreciated by Washington, as some

of us have seen last night on CNN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan, still struggling to recover from the long

recession, is taking a new look at defence, seeking  to  pass

new  legislation for its defence forces and to play a  larger

role,  and  the Japanese Prime Minister even made a  personal

visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, despite international outcry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US, for the first time, has committed a significant

number   of   what  is  called  "ground  trainers"   in   the

Philippines.   This is the first time in years that  American

ground troops are back in the region.

Sir, what do we make of all these?  How do we manoeuvre as  a

small  country?  How do we navigate in the new uncharted  and

treacherous  waters?  How do we create space and advance  our

national  interests when circumstances are clearly less  than

favourable?

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I continue with my next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, over the years, ASEAN had

earned  its  spurs and won recognition as a  grouping  to  be

reckoned  with.   ASEAN  gave  individual  ASEAN  nations   a

collective  voice  and  a  higher standing  in  international

forums and meetings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nations and agencies do factor in ASEAN in their

assessment  of  geopolitics, as well as  investments  in  the

region.  With President Surharto then at the helm of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



Indonesia,  and  playing a positive leadership  role  in  the

region, ASEAN surged ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But times have changed. The Asian financial crisis and

recession  hover over the region. Surharto is  no  longer  in

charge and Indonesia is beset with internal problems.  In the

meantime, ASEAN has grown to ten.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: is ASEAN becoming too large and too

disparate,  with nations as diverse as Myanmar, Cambodia  and

Laos, with varying degrees of economic development, and  wide

varieties of political cultures and systems?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myanmar, for example, attracts a great deal of attention

from  the international community and media over human rights

issue.   Myanmar recently released Ms Aung San Suu  Kyi  from

house  arrest.  This is a right step and a good  development.

Would  the  Minister  please give us his  assessment  of  the

latest  development in Myanmar and whether it would  lead  to

liberalisation  and opening of the country for  democracy  as

well as for foreign investment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall question is this: is ASEAN becoming

unwieldy?   It  will be even more unwieldy  if  somehow  East

Timor is admitted to ASEAN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the East Asian nations of China,

Taiwan,  Korea  and  Japan  are pulling  ahead  of  ASEAN  in

economic   development  and,  in  particular,  in  attracting

foreign investments.  ASEAN therefore faces the risk of being

marginalised  in  the  intense  competition  for  investment,

talent and entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot do without ASEAN. It is there. But

ASEAN seems to have lost steam, lost its vigour - we can just

carry  on  with a limping ASEAN - but for what purpose?   But

can  we  find  a  new sense of purpose, a new  direction  for

ASEAN, a new lease of life for ASEAN?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what role Singapore can play in

re-engineering ASEAN, and making ASEAN relevant in the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



scenario  and  the  new  strategic  landscape.   How  can  we

strengthen ASEAN and create linkages with others outside  the

region, eg, the FTA with Japan and the USA?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are in the region, and would do our utmost to

support ASEAN but, at the same time, we must not be boxed in,

and should explore linkages globally.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, ASEAN faces

grave   challenges  today.   It  is  seen  by  outsiders   as

fractured,  weak  and leaderless.  Some  of  its  states  are

constantly  quarrelling with each other and let us  not  name

names.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an urgent need to revive the spirit of ASEAN,

the spirit that once made it strong as a regional voice.   In

its  early  years, ASEAN states considered internal communist

insurgencies  to be the most immediate threat. This  was  the

threat  that bound the states together and made ASEAN  united

and  a  strong voice to be reckoned with.  Today,  the  ASEAN

states  face another internal threat, and that is, terrorism.

Terrorism   provides  ASEAN  with  the  new  opportunity   to

demonstrate  its  relevance  to  regional  and  international

security.  It should be seized.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN's greatest potential as an international actor

lies  in  its  abilities  to  coordinate  responses  to   the

challenge  of  terrorism.   I am  glad  to  note  that  ASEAN

Ministers  will  meet  soon  to discuss  signing  a  pact  on

terrorism, although it is a little late, but better late than

never.  The pact should not involve only grand pronouncements

of  cooperation, as it is so often associated with ASEAN, but

should  also  come accompanied with some clear  and  decisive

action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Indonesia has played a key role as a stabilising

force in ASEAN in the grouping's first 30 years and was  seen

as  playing  a leadership role in its grouping's development.

But   today,  Indonesia's  preoccupation  with  its  domestic

politics  and economy has unfortunately diluted its  role  in

ASEAN.  Indonesia's revival is necessary to revitalise ASEAN.

Singapore needs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



to engage Indonesia more during this period.  What happens in

Indonesia is beyond Singapore's control but ASEAN can  launch

initiatives  designed to help Indonesia  to  become  involved

more  effectively in regional affairs and to assist  them  in

their economic recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One laudable move on Singapore's part was the proposed

Free  Trade  Agreement  with the  US.   It  will  extend  the

benefits of the FTA to Batam and Bintan and ASEAN, in sectors

such as information technology.  With that, ASEAN will become

a  more  attractive  place  for investment  by  American  and

Singaporean companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are signs that Malaysia does not see the

benefit  of  such  FTAs.  Malaysia's Prime Minister  Mahathir

Mohamad  was  reported  as  saying earlier  this  month  that

Singapore  would  not  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  its

membership  in ASEAN if it continued to sign bilateral  trade

pacts with nations outside the region.  Sir, this is the time

to  be  strengthening the investment climate in ASEAN.   Such

comments would not be helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN has played a useful role in engaging major powers,

such as through the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN+3 and the

ASEAN+10 processes.  But it lacks strong effective leadership

and  solidarity as a grouping to take full advantage of that.

I  am not sure how long it can determine the agenda for these

multi-lateral  forums  involving  these  big  powers  if   it

continues to appear weak and disunited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how Singapore proposes

to  play its part in strengthening ASEAN in the face of these

challenges.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I agree largely with

the  sentiments  of my colleague before me on the  challenges

that ASEAN faces today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, ASEAN has seen many challenges that could have

an   impact  on  its  status  and  standing  as  a   regional

organisation.  You will recall at the height of the Cold War,

ASEAN was seen as a regional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



bloc  that  was  capable of dealing with the  advancement  of

communism  in Southeast Asia.  It had assumed a profile  that

quickly  earned  the respect of members of the  international

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in recent years, the economic crisis and

the  resultant  political unrest and instability  within  the

region  have quite substantially affected the image of ASEAN.

These  events,  coupled with the inability of ASEAN  to  pull

itself  together quickly on major trade and economic  issues,

have  raised  concerns about the continuing effectiveness  of

ASEAN's existence.  Indeed, these negative perceptions  have,

to  a  large extent, been compounded by the emergence of such

other  issues  such as the rampant burning  of  forest  which

contributes  to  the haze, the emergence of terrorists  cells

and  the  inability  of some countries  to  deal  with  these

problems without requiring assistance from outsiders and  the

internal  political  instability that still  exists  in  many

countries  within  ASEAN.  To be sure, the  strength  of  the

spirit  of  ASEAN which seeks to arrive at decisions  through

consensus is presently also its weakness, now that ASEAN  has

become a 10-member organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with this negative perception, the economic

challenges  facing  ASEAN in the coming  years  do  not  look

positive  either.  We have just heard the eloquent exposition

of  Minister George Yeo on the challenges coming  from  North

Asia,  especially from China and Korea, and these  challenges

are  real.   For many ASEAN economies, the hollowing  out  of

manufacturing and service industries to cheaper cost  centres

in  China  is a serious problem and threatens to  derail  the

process  of  economic recovery within ASEAN.  The  fact  that

China  has  joined  the  WTO does not  give  Southeast  Asian

countries  much  comfort  and  in  fact  would  increase  the

competitive  pressure for us.  Unless the growth  engines  of

ASEAN economies, such as the US, Japan and the EU continue to

power  its  way  to recovery, it does not look  as  if  ASEAN

economies  are  likely to emerge from the doldrums  and  this

will continue to be a drag factor for us here in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know from a recent publication that ASEAN, with

its teeming population of 500 million people, is not punching

at its strategic weight in relation to other regions and also

regional organisations.  For example, APEC accounts  for  56%

of  the world's GDP; the EU is almost 30% of the world's GDP;

NAFTA  is  33% and the South Asian Organisation for  Regional

Cooperation  alone is 19%.  In the case of  ASEAN,  it  is  a

dismal  1.5% of the world's GDP and if it gives us any cheer,

we  are only about marginally better than the Organisation of

African Unity, which contributes 1.4% of the world's GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these statistics are stark by comparison and

obviously,  there is much that we have to do if  we  want  to

bring  ASEAN, and together with it, the people, to  a  higher

standard and quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Singapore's position towards ASEAN is that

it  plays  a significant role as a regional organisation.  We

have  sought  to  impress  on our ASEAN  colleagues  to  pull

together  and  to  deal with the perception  that  ASEAN  now

suffers  from. Unless we begin to deal with this  perception,

Sir,  our  dialogue partners and international investors  may

perceive  ASEAN as ineffective and may, in the  longer  term,

marginalise  us. We have to move towards greater integration,

especially with our newer members and to work more closely on

the  projects that we have started in order to help all ASEAN

members to engage in the economy. It is important if we  want

to  raise  the  status, the credibility and the  standing  of

ASEAN  as  a regional organisation. In that light,  Sir,  the

friendly  dialogues that we have among members of  the  ASEAN

states must continue to prevail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

whether we are making active progress on the projects that we

started  out  with and active progress in further integrating

the various economies within ASEAN.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the GPC Chairman

and  Members  have drawn a very good picture of ASEAN  and  I

would not like to go through the details



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



of  the  state of ASEAN except to ask the Minister to address

three issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, what are the initiatives that ASEAN and Singapore

in  particular have taken to strengthen ASEAN as a strong and

vibrant regional organisation, especially in the aftermath of

the 1997 crisis and the September 11 incident?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, what are the new initiatives ASEAN has taken to

further  engage the super powers and the regional  powers  in

dialogue  and confidence-building through the ASEAN  Regional

Forum?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three, whether ASEAN is exploring other Free Trade

Agreements similar to the one being negotiated between  ASEAN

and China.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, Singapore is a

founding  member of ASEAN.  In joining hands with  the  other

founding  nations to form ASEAN, Singapore  must  have  hoped

that this economic grouping of Southeast Asian countries will

help  provide  the  critical mass  to  attract  and  generate

investment  and  trade both into and within the  region,  and

with  more investment in trade that life will get better  for

all people living within this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a small open economy that is so reliant on free

trade and investment flows, Singapore knows that our fortunes

will  always be, to a given extent, influenced by, for better

or  for worse, the standing and actions of ASEAN.  Hence, our

participation in ASEAN is not something that is philosophical

or  abstract.   It has direct bearing on our  well-being  and

prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in more recent years, and especially after the

dream  of the Pacific Rim Century evaporated after the  Asian

financial crisis, the different members of ASEAN have had  to

deal  with their own combination of social, economic as  well

as  political  challenges.  The strength and cohesiveness  of

ASEAN now seem greatly weakened.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, with the opening up of China, we know

that a growing proportion of investment inflows into Asia  is

heading to the North East instead of to the South East.  Sir,

these  trends  are not insignificant.  If they  persist,  the

region  may  lose  its relevance to international  investors.

When  that  happens,  the  risk  of  countries  resorting  to

enlarging  their  share  of a shrinking  economic  pie  would

increase,   thereby   compounding   regional   problems   and

difficulties.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore will be a beneficiary of a strong ASEAN, I

would  like  to ask the Minister, what specific  steps  could

Singapore  take  to  help strengthen  ASEAN  as  an  economic

alliance  so  that  it  will  not  lose  its  relevance   and

attractiveness.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> ASEAN-10 is now

a  thousand pound gorilla.  It was half the size when it  was

first  born.  With its 30 years of growth, somewhat unevenly,

have  come new problems.  Its vision now appears to be a  bit

diffused.   Its organs are not exactly working well together.

Its  left paw sometimes does not like what its right  paw  is

doing.   And  it  is  currently fed  mainly  by  the  various

governments.   In  other  words, its  environment  is  mainly

government-based.   It does not engage very  much  the  other

sectors  of  ASEAN,  meaning the business sector,  and,  most

importantly, the people sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that the main problem with ASEAN now is that we

are facing a problem of internal unity, of internal cohesion,

in ASEAN, which did not exist when it was originally started.

Then  the  vision  was  clear - it was  to  provide  for  the

security  of the region, and perhaps the programmes were  not

as  extensive as they are now.  So to this end, I  think,  at

this time, we must ask, whether as a founding member of ASEAN

how should we see ASEAN, given the problems that it is facing

now,  and in that respect, I have three issues which  I  hope

the Minister will pay some attention to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, has the growth of ASEAN to ten provided

more problems for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



organisation and resulted in it being much weaker rather than

stronger as a regional force?  Can we really expect ASEAN  to

attain its original unity, to retain its original force as an

international organisation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, would Singapore be better off in terms of geo-political strategy in charting its own course, eg,

negotiating our bilateral FTAs rather than waiting for  ASEAN

initiative  to take place, which as we have seen do  take  an

inordinate  amount  of  time  for  such  agreements   to   be

initiated,  although I am very pleased to hear, I  must  say,

that  there is every possibility that there will be an ASEAN-China FTA by the end of the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if we are committed to ASEAN, how can we

improve internal strength, the internal unity of ASEAN?  Now,

I   understand  that  among  the  officials  and  among   the

governments, there is actually a very great sense  of  common

purpose.   However, this does not translate to very  much  in

terms of the other sectors, particularly the business and the

people sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at ASEAN, actually one of the greatest

strengths  in  ASEAN  is the diversity  of  its  people,  the

diversity of cultures.  And I think it is very important that

if  we  have any long term interest in ASEAN we should expand

the  scope  of our engagement with ASEAN nations and  I  hope

that  the  various Ministries, with the Ministry  of  Foreign

Affairs  taking the primary role, encourage the expansion  of

programmes,  especially in relation to  cultural  activities,

because  I  think  that is one of the greatest  strengths  of

ASEAN.  It has been ignored, but it is a strength and  if  we

can    pull   the   500   million   people   together,   then

notwithstanding what my colleague, Mr Sin Boon Ann, has  said

about us not having a great GDP significance in the world, we

nevertheless can still remain a powerful regional force.  500

million people cannot always be wrong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, judging by what other Members

have  said,  ASEAN appears to have lost much of  its  lustre.

Some 35 years after its founding, several



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



member  countries  are beset with political  and/or  economic

problems.   And quite a few are still dealing with the  fall-out  from  the  Asian financial crisis of 1997, reluctant  as

they  are even to deal with obvious root causes such as inept

political   leadership,   corruption   and   poor   corporate

governance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the admission of the CLMV countries, Cambodia,

Laos,  Myanmar  and Vietnam, in recent years  threw  up  even

greater  disparities  in  the level of  social  and  economic

developments  in  the  membership.   And  with   that,   vast

differences  in  the  approaches  to  different  issues  that

confront  the  grouping  became  even  more  obvious.    Sir,

approach to trade is one such example.  On the one end of the

scale  you have Singapore, advocate of free markets and  free

trade,  and,  on the other end, you have the CLMV  countries,

still   far   from  comfortable  with  trade  liberalisation.

Somewhere in between, you get Malaysia, committed to an ASEAN

Free  Trade  Area  but still asking for  protection  for  its

motorcar industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with such disparity, I think it is difficult to

even  pretend  that we can find strength in  diversity.   The

danger  is  that  ASEAN risks being marginalised  by  others.

ASEAN countries offer a combined market of about half that of

China's  1.2  billion  people and yet we  get  so  much  less

attention  from others.  Large chunks of foreign  investments

are bypassing the region, heading towards China and the North

East.   This is discomforting.  Sir, I have experienced  this

uneasy  feeling myself when I visited the European Parliament

last  year.   The EU is very occupied with its own  problems,

such  as enlarged membership.  And it has its priorities  and

must  be  selective  in its dealings with other  regions  and

decide  who  or what comes first on its radar  screen.   Sir,

although  polite  noises are made that they  remain  occupied

with  an interest in South East Asia, there is no doubt  that

China  was  the focus of their dealings with Asia.   And  any

interest  in ASEAN was probably dominated by a pre-occupation

with what was happening in Myanmar.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no less than the EU's Commissioner for External

Relations,  Chris Patten, underscored this  when  he  visited

Singapore  recently.  He said that Europe remained interested

in  the  region.  Again it was a polite noise because in  the

same breath he said that EU-China ties were better and closer

than they had ever been before.  And he also pointed out that

the  level  of  European investments in this region  has  not

recovered  in  the  aftermath of the financial  crisis,  even

after five years.  And he reminded us that the attractiveness

of  South  East  Asia to Europeans and other investors  would

diminish with the rise of opportunities in China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he also made the point about ASEAN's disparity and

pointing  to  the  different levels of wealth  in  the  ASEAN

countries, he said that, "setting a clear and coherent policy

for  dealing  with that variety, is in itself  a  bit  of  an

intellectual  Himalaya".  Sir, these are ominous  words  from

someone  who was the last British Governor of Hong  Kong  and

who  knows Asia well.  Or you can read between the  lines  to

take  that to mean that ASEAN had better get its act together

or it is going to miss out altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how can ASEAN move forward? Sir, getting FTAs with

other countries is an approach that we have taken and I think

it  is  a good way.  The way Singapore has done in trying  to

get  FTA  terms  with other countries has  put  paid  to  the

argument  that we only think of our own interest  because  in

the  negotiations with the US we have roped in products  from

Batam.   But my concern here is that this too appears  to  be

stalling, now that the US President has failed to secure fast

track authority from Congress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point that was raised was also the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement. I think my colleague made a

mistake.   I do not think it is going to be signed  within  a

year.   From what I read, it is going to take some  10  years

for  such  an  FTA  to be in place and I think  10  years  is

certainly  a  long  time.  A lot of water would  have  passed

under the bridge.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point I want to make is that ASEAN

appears  to  lack  leadership.  Significant  changes  in  the

political   leadership   of  several   member   states   have

contributed to this vacuum.  Indonesia and Thailand  are  too

busy  trying  to  clean  up their own  backyards.   Sometimes

people ask me why Singapore cannot play a leading role.   But

I  think, Sir, we have always said that we are small, we  are

pretty modest about this, and without naming names, I am sure

there  would  be  at least one or two others  who  would  not

accept  us as the leader of ASEAN.  So we are modest  and  we

say  no.   We say that we rather get things going by  pushing

from  behind.   Sir, I think that PM therefore got  it  right

when  he  said that Singapore can play the role  of  a  path-finder.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan, start winding up your speech,

please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Yes, Sir, just one minute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a path-finder is one who negotiates a route and

keeps  everyone on track.  I believe that unless  someone  is

willing  to clear the way, I am afraid that ASEAN  will  just

hobble along like a lame old man and will have missed  a  lot

of opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point I want to make is the question of

terrorism which has been raised.  It is now a problem.  Where

the question that used to be asked was, "Is this a good place

to  invest?", the question now being asked more often is, "Is

this a safe place?"  Sir, Prime Minister Mahathir himself has

admitted  as much that he has a problem dealing with  Islamic

militants and the terrorist organisation Al Qaeda is known to

have  links with Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia and other groups

such  as Laskar Jihad in Indonesia and the Abu-Sayaff in  the

Philippines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is: now that Indonesia, Malaysia and

the  Philippines have last week signed an anti-terrorism pact

and  Thailand is reported to have been invited  to  join  the

pact,  I  would like to know why Singapore has been left  out

and  whether we intend to sign on as a demonstration  of  our

commitment against the war on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



terrorism.  And apart from just signing, what concrete  steps

can  ASEAN  take  together so that terrorism  just  does  not

remain a point of discussion?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Could I just provide a quick

clarification, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> I think the previous speaker stated that

I have made a mistake by saying that the Free Trade Agreement

is  only  due in 10 years.  I want to clarify that  the  Free

Trade  Agreement will be signed by the end of this  year  and

the  hope  is  that a Free Trade Area will be created  in  10

years' time.  That was the statement in the press.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Members who have spoken. Let

me  respond  to, first, Dr Ong Chit Chung, on  the  strategic

overview, and then the various comments on ASEAN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I agree, almost completely, with what Dr Ong Chit

Chung has said in his overview of the strategic situation.  I

think  he  has  put  it  as comprehensively  as  any  Foreign

Minister could.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I had noted that South East Asia was going

through  very uncertain times and the situation not only  has

not   changed  materially,  but  the  terrorist  attacks   of

September   11   have  really  added  considerably   to   the

complexities.   He  is  right  when  he  describes  it  as  a

watershed  year.  In my view, the September  11  events  have

affected  the  geo-political  and  strategic  environment  in

several ways.  I would mention at least three ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the attacks and the United States' response to

them have underscored the United States' pre-eminence, and in

a  sense,  has  provided a focus for it.  The  anti-terrorism

campaign will now clearly be the main focus of United States'

priority for the foreseeable future.  Washington, as  we  all

know,  is quietly determining who its friends and allies  are

in this new situation.  The results of its determination will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



be  a  critical  influence  on East  Asia's  development  and

prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about our relations with the

United States and also about an assessment of our position on

counter-terrorism.  I think Members will know  that  we  have

taken  a  very  strong  stand on terrorism,  like  all  other

countries in East Asia.  Singapore has stood with the  United

States  in its global fight against terrorism.  Why?  Because

it  is the right and correct thing to do.  As the arrests  of

the  Jemaah  Islamiyah and the uncovering of the  network  in

Singapore have shown, we are clearly not immune.  And it is a

fight  that all states in the world have to take a  stand  to

combat this new menace.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way in which the global situation has changed

is  that the events of September 11 have, in fact, stabilised

United  States-China relations, a point  which  Dr  Ong  also

referred to, and that is a very important factor in the  East

Asian  strategic  equation.  The terrorist  attacks  and  the

fight against terrorism have affected big power relationships

significantly.  As Dr Ong mentioned, the United States  needs

China's   support  for  its  global  anti-terrorism  efforts.

Although  China  may  not agree fully with  every  aspect  of

United States' policies, it also wants stable relations  with

the  United States.   When United States-China relations  are

stable,  it  has  a calming effect on the region  across  the

board.  But when United States-China relations are disturbed,

as  the  collision of the planes incident last April  showed,

the entire region is considerably unsettled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can expect the geo-political positioning to

continue  in  many  different  forms.   There  may   be   the

occasional   differences,  but  it  is  inevitable   in   the

relationship between big powers.  For now, the US-China-Japan

strategic triangular relationship which underpins East  Asian

growth and prosperity can be described as stable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fortunate, in Singapore, to have very good

relations  with  China and Japan as well as with  the  United

States.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



Singapore and other countries in the region will benefit from

the strategic stability of US-China-Japan relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked specifically about our relationship with

the  United  States.   I would describe the  relationship  as

excellent.  It is multi-faceted.  It is a relationship  which

is  a  strong one that pre-dates the events of September  11.

Prime Minister Goh made a very successful visit to Washington

last  June and, more recently, Senior Minister did  so.   The

Prime  Minister  and Senior Minister met President  Bush  and

other  United  States  leaders, and they  had  very  fruitful

exchange of views on both regional and bilateral matters.   I

think many other Ministers have also had visits to the United

States, or are planning to do so.  This close relationship is

in  our  interest and, as several colleagues have  mentioned,

both on this Ministry and other cuts, the negotiations on FTA

with  the  United  States  will benefit,  not  just  our  two

countries,  but also the entire region.  When completed,  the

FTA will strengthen the bilateral relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third way in which September 11 has affected the

strategic  landscape is that, as I had mentioned  last  year,

the political and economic changes that have catalysed across

the  region  by the crises of 1997 and 1998 are  still  being

played out, and many countries are adjusting to those events.

Matters are compounded  by the events of September 11.  A key

factor  will be how countries deal with political  Islam  and

religious  extremism, again a point which Dr  Ong  mentioned.

There  are  more than 230 million Muslims in Southeast  Asia.

Southeast  Asian Islam has traditionally been  syncretic  and

tolerant.   Mainstream Muslims in Southeast  Asia  have  been

moderate in their beliefs.  We all know that most Muslims  in

our  region  want nothing to do with terrorism or  extremism.

But  it  is a fact that in Southeast Asia, Islam is  changing

under  pressure.  Why?  Pressure of external influences.   As

Dr Ong said, there are extremists with political agendas, and

some  of  the most dangerous terrorist organisations  try  to

invoke Islam as their motivating ideology. Muslim anger in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



some  quarters against the United States is another  fact  of

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, America's pre-eminence means that there is no

real  alternative for any Southeast Asian government than  to

try  to  forge  good relations with the United  States.  Good

relations  with  the  United States are not  possible  unless

governments  cooperate in the anti-terrorism  campaign.   But

many  Southeast Asian governments will also have to find ways

to  assuage the anxieties of their Muslim ground which may be

uneasy or unhappy with the United States' policies, while  at

the  same  time  taking  firm action to neutralise  extremist

Islamic elements in their societies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How governments are going to deal with this matter is a

real  political conundrum.  How they are going to  deal  with

this will have a profound influence on Southeast Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked how is Singapore going to

position  itself on many of these fast-changing developments.

As  a  small  state, we do not have that many  options.   But

Singapore,  as  we  all know, cannot exist without  effective

links  to all parts of the world.  At the same time, we  must

realise  that Singapore's future is inextricably linked  with

Southeast Asia.  That is why I have always stressed  in  this

House that we will have to have a multi-track approach to our

engagement  with  the  rest  of the  world.   We  are  firmly

committed  and  must remain committed to  ASEAN  and  to  the

region.   And,  as I will show, when answering  questions  on

ASEAN,  we have, in fact, played our part in trying to assist

ASEAN  to deal with some of the enormous challenges  that  it

faces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have to engage with regions beyond

Southeast Asia, with the major powers, with Europe, with  the

United  States, and with North East Asia.  In doing  so,  not

only  do we advance our own interests but, I believe, it also

helps  focus  these  external players on  the  importance  of

Southeast Asia.  Of course, specific policies will have to be

adapted to changing circumstances.  I may add



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



that  the  total effect of  September 11 events is that  they

have     really    underscored   the   unpredictability    of

international developments, and have underscored the need for

a small country like Singapore to be agile and nimble, and to

adjust  both its economic, strategic and other facets of  its

policies to rapidly changing external environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those general remarks, let me turn to the specific

comments  my colleagues have made about ASEAN.  I  discern  a

common  theme  or  concern in many  of  the  points  made  by

Members, which is a concern as to where ASEAN is heading.  Is

it  in decline?  Does ASEAN have a future?  Can it have a new

lease  of life?  What has Singapore done?  What can Singapore

do in this re-engineering or remaking of ASEAN?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we answer these questions? I would start, first,

by  recalling  what I said last year, and that  is  ASEAN  is

going  through  a very difficult period, largely  because  of

both internal and external challenges.  When I outlined those

challenges  last year, I was being frank and realistic.   But

much  of  what  I have said still continues,  but  made  more

complex  by  the events of September 11 and by the uncovering

of terrorist networks in several places in Southeast Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commentators continue to write articles about ASEAN

which give a dismal picture and rather pessimistic prognosis.

It  will  be  misleading of me to paint an  overly  rosy  and

upbeat  picture of ASEAN.  But at the same time, let  us  not

have  these  commentaries on ASEAN cause  us  to  prematurely

write the orbituary of ASEAN, because I think one must take a

realistic  position.   If you ask me what  is  the  realistic

position,   it  is  that  while  ASEAN  faces  many   serious

challenges,  I think there are some grounds for optimism.   I

would  not  lose all hope and I think ASEAN can overcome  its

challenges,  provided, firstly, it gets its acts together  on

the internal challenges; secondly, provided it stays on track

on  some  of  the initiatives which have been launched;  and,

thirdly, if it continues to be outward looking and not inward

looking.  I will elaborate on this shortly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that there are internal and external challenges.

Some  of  the  Members  have alluded to  them.   On  internal

challenges, it covers points Mr Tan Soo Khoon and others have

mentioned.   Many countries in ASEAN underwent or  are  still

undergoing internal political transitional challenges.   Some

are   undergoing  economic  challenges.   And   until   these

countries  are able to effectively overcome these challenges,

it  is very difficult for them to pay attention to the bigger

picture  of  regional solidarity and big picture  imperatives

for ASEAN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, every country in ASEAN must get its own act

together -  economic, political.  Then the group, as a group,

has   to  overcome  some  of  the  challenges  mentioned   by

colleagues, namely, that of integration, how not to allow the

recent  expansion from 7 to 10  to become an unwieldy gorilla

or  elephant,  and  not to let decision making  processes  be

severely circumscribed.  These are internal challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the political side, reference was made to Myanmar. I

was asked for an assessment.  I think it is too early to make

a  full assessment.  Singapore has welcomed the recent events

in  Myanmar concerning the release of Aung San Suu  Kyi  from

house  arrest  as  a  positive step in the  overall  national

reconciliation process.  How it will proceed, I think we will

have  to  wait  and  see.  I think much will  depend  on  the

discussions  between the SPDC and Aung San Suu  Kyi  herself.

We  do  not  know what exactly transpired in the confidential

talks, but there have been signs that a certain comfort level

has been reached.  Indeed, it is a positive step because,  as

Mr  Tan  Soo  Khoon  and others have said, the  situation  in

Myanmar  previously has, in a sense, been a factor which  has

been  responsible for some slowdown in our relationship  with

dialogue  partners, particularly with the EU.   So  it  is  a

positive  step  and  let us hope that it will  lead  to  more

positive developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members talked about the expansion of ASEAN to

10.   We  cannot  turn  the  clock  back.   There  were  good

strategic reasons why ASEAN took the decision to embrace  the

new members,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



and  expanding the organisation from 7 to 10.   As  with  all

organisations, when membership increases, it must  inevitably

bring  problems for consensus making, decision making and  so

on.   But the challenge in that regard is how to address  the

problem  of  a  two-tier ASEAN.  This is a real problem,  and

ASEAN  has  to  address it, and Singapore, in  a  sense,  has

contributed  to  efforts towards integration  of  ASEAN.   An

example  is  Prime Minister Goh's proposal for the Initiative

for  ASEAN  Integration,  which was  endorsed  by  the  ASEAN

Summit.  To give concrete support to this, Singapore had,  in

fact,  pledged  and given contributions to  the  Indo-Chinese

countries, including setting up of training centres there.

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East Timor - it has not made a formal application for

membership.  I think the sense in ASEAN, as I discern it,  is

to concentrate on consolidation of the existing ASEAN 10.   I

believe  we will proceed cautiously and take matters step  by

step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure Prof. Chin Tet Yung is being completely

fair  to  ASEAN when he said that ASEAN is focused purely  at

the  government  level.  Yes, much of ASEAN's  activities  is

driven by Foreign Affairs Ministries, Economic Ministers  and

a  whole host of other Ministries.  But he will be aware that

there  is  also  a  track two process in ASEAN.   The  former

Speaker,  Mr Tan Soo Khoon, has been a very important  driver

of  ASEAN  parliamentary meetings, for example, although  you

may  describe  that as non-governmental.  But Prof.  Chin  is

right  that for ASEAN, we have to work not only at  the  pure

government instrument but at all other levels.  And there  is

a   host   of  organisations  -  professional  organisations,

business  organisations, which are ASEAN oriented,  including

ASEAN  business councils, and so on.   So, I agree with  him,

but these activities are being conducted.  His point that  we

should   also   have   people-to-people  linkages,   cultural

organisations, is something that I would agree with,  and  we

should pursue that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards external challenges of ASEAN, Members have

alluded  to it.  Principally, it is coping with the challenge

of  China and North Asia.  Minister George Yeo, my colleague,

I believe, has spoken about these challenges.  These are real

challenges.   And ASEAN, if it does not get its internal  and

external acts together, may see a hollowing out as more  FDIs

will gravitate towards North Asia and China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked about terrorism by several Members. Apart

from  what transpired at the ASEAN Summit last year,  and  it

was  an  important development, before the uncovering of  the

terrorist  networks in our region, the ASEAN leaders  took  a

stand  when they adopted the Declaration on Terrorism,  which

was  not  just repeating the mantra, or motherhood statements

about  combating  terrorism, they asked for  law  enforcement

agencies  in ASEAN to cooperate, particularly front-line  law

enforcement  agencies.   In  a sense,  the  meeting  of  Home

Affairs  or Interior Ministers, which is going to take  place

soon  in Kuala Lumpur, I think, within the next two weeks  or

so,  is  a very good follow-up of that.  Ms Irene Ng referred

to  that meeting.  Exactly what is going to emerge from  that

meeting remains to be seen, but I am sure there is an earnest

desire  on the part of the law enforcement agencies  and  the

Ministers who were charged with security to map out areas  in

which  they  can cooperate.  This is absolutely essential  in

view of the events which have arisen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon asked about this Trilateral Agreement.

Let me just explain that the evolution or the genesis of this

Agreement  was originally started when Philippines,  Malaysia

and  Indonesia drafted the agreement, and the text that I saw

had   a   specific   geographically   demarcated   area   for

cooperation,  by  reference  to  coordinates.   Because,   as

Foreign  Minister Syed Hamid told the press  recently,  there

was  urgency felt among those three countries for cooperating

in  the seas, Sulu Sea and seas off Celebes, and other areas,

which  were  immediately adjacent to the country,  to  tackle

specific  problems.  That was my understanding  of  how  this

Agreement came about.  The latest Agreement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



has  been signed by the three countries.  It is not the  case

of Singapore or other ASEAN countries being deliberately left

out because the Malaysian Foreign Minister explained that  it

was  a  sense of urgency of these three countries which  felt

they  should proceed immediately on the areas of cooperation.

Now,  we  have had to study the Agreement to see what aspects

are contained there, and whether it has relevance for us and,

if so, whether we should sign on, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the important point is this - for combating

terrorism,  it has to be tackled by a variety of  ways,  both

nationally, where countries have to take the necessary steps.

On  bilateral  cooperation, as we  know,  after  the  JI  was

exposed,  we  have  excellent cooperation with  Malaysia  and

other  countries.  Whether it is trilateral  or  multilateral

like  the  UN, many fronts have to converge in tackling  this

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the external side, the key element is for ASEAN to be

outward  looking.   Because, as  I  said,  if  it  is  inward

looking,  I  think the rest of the world will pass  ASEAN  by

now.   To be outward looking, it must continuously find  ways

of  engaging with the external players, the dialogue partners

and major powers, a point which Mr Ravindran also alluded to.

ASEAN  has  to, in a sense, rebuild its strategic  relevance.

If  you look back, countries were interested in ASEAN because

ASEAN  started  the ASEAN Regional Forum, the  only  security

forum  of  its  type  in the region, and  ASEAN  was  in  the

driver's seat.  ASEAN is still in the driver's seat.  But  to

be in the driver's seat and to attract confidence and inspire

a  sense  of  support for ASEAN being in the  driver's  seat,

whether  the  driver's seat for ARF or  ASEAN  Plus-3,  ASEAN

itself must be a credible organisation.  ASEAN has taken some

steps   which  show  that  it  realises  the  importance   of

maintaining its strategic relevance, for example, the  ASEAN-China  FTA.  Minister George Yeo may have spoken - I was  not

in  the  Chamber - about the significance of this.   But  the

significance  of  this is not just in the  economic  benefits

that  may  accrue to ASEAN or China, but it has  a  strategic

relevance, in a sense, that it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



underscore to other countries the importance of ASEAN.  In  a

sense,  this  has  been  borne out  because  soon  after  the

announcement  of ASEAN-China FTA, you would note  that  Japan

took   an  interest  and  has  offered  Japan-ASEAN  enhanced

economic cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a good sign. In this regard, Singapore's role

is   quite  evident  because  the  Japanese  have,  in  fact,

suggested to the ASEAN countries to have a look at the Japan-Singapore  FTA as a model and to examine what provisions  may

be  applicable,  as  they discussed the ASEAN-Japan  economic

partnership.  When we have this bilateral FTA, a  point  made

by  Ms Irene Ng, it has spin-off effects for the rest of  the

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sign that ASEAN realised its importance of being

outward  looking is that it has now decided to have a  summit

meeting  with India, which is a proposal that Prime  Minister

Goh  had floated some one or two years ago, and this has  now

borne  fruits.   It is important to bring India  into  closer

interaction with ASEAN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are steps - Members may think that they are too

tentative  and not enough - to show that ASEAN,  despite  all

its problems, is aware of the importance of staying on track,

the  importance of continuing to be relevant to the  external

players.  I should add that in July, there will be a  further

engagement with the external players when the ASEAN  Regional

Forum  meets.   And I think when they meet in  Brunei,  there

will  be  another opportunity for ASEAN to show that  working

with the dialogue partners, it can take several steps towards

discussion in a concrete manner of the matters like combating

terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked what can Singapore do, what

can  Singapore assist in showing leadership of ASEAN.  Mr Tan

Soo Khoon referred to the pathfinder role.  Whatever term you

describe - whether it is pathfinder or leading from behind  - Singapore's  commitment to ASEAN is there.  It  is  important

for us.  It is in our interest that ASEAN succeeds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have referred to some of the roles we have played. It

was  Prime Minister Goh who proposed that ASEAN invite  India

for  a  summit.   This has now borne fruits.  Prime  Minister

Goh,   in   Singapore,  proposed  an  Initiative  for   ASEAN

Integration.   And  we  have, in  fact,  set  an  example  by

providing some $50 million over a 5-year period, and training

centres  have actually been set up in Indo-Chinese countries.

We  have  also  come out with ideas as to how  ASEAN  can  be

marketed  abroad, and the idea of roadshows - ASEAN Roadshows

- in fact was proposed by Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the political and security side, it was

Singapore  which  suggested that ASEAN also  has  closed-door

retreats.   Why?   Because  there is  a  tendency  in  ASEAN,

because  of the ASEAN way of doing things, to tread  gingerly

on  sensitive and delicate topics.  So what we have  decided,

and  also  it  was  Singapore's proposal,  was  in  order  to

overcome  this, let us have retreats where only  the  Foreign

Ministers,  unaccompanied  by  officials,  meet.   This   has

enabled, over a few years, ASEAN Foreign Ministers to discuss

matters in a very frank and candid way.  I would say, on some

occasions,  topics which in previous years  would  have  been

considered sensitive and too delicate to be brought up  among

the  Ministers, Singapore has also suggested the proposal for

e-ASEAN, which has been taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, how ASEAN will move, whether it moves

successfully   or   whether  it  will   be   a   marginalised

organisation, depends on these twin challenges -  whether  we

can  overcome  the  internal challenges and  whether  we  can

overcome  the  external challenges of being outward  looking,

and  continue to be regarded by major powers and the dialogue

partners as a body with whom they find it useful and relevant

to stay engaged with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head N (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, following Singapore-Malaysia

relations is like going on a roller-coaster ride.   It  zooms

up  and  down,  up and down, full of excitement and  thrills.

Never  a  dull moment, I must say.  But, Sir, it is not  good

for  the  heart, not good for the heart of economic interests

and not good for the heartlanders of both countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should all forget the past historical baggage of

merger and separation and focus on the present business of  a

borderless  new economy.  In this regard, Singapore  believes

firmly  in the "prosper thy neighbour" policy.  But recently,

the  Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, was  reported  to

have  said  that "there are many ways to skin a cat,  and  to

skin  Singapore, there are also many ways".  This is  a  most

unfriendly  comment from the Prime Minister of a neighbouring

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remind the Malaysians that Singapore is no pussy

cat.   We are no pushover.  They should jolly well know  that

it  is not easy to skin a lion.  And those who dare try  will

be badly mauled.  So better do not try.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this we can promise. The lions of Singapore will

stand  up  and roar and defend Singapore, our homeland.   Are

all  these Singapore bashings a preparation or prelude to the

coming  Malaysian election?  I wonder.  But we  welcome  fair

competition, whether from Port Tanjung



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



Pelepas, or KL International Airport, as long as it  is  done

on  a commercial basis.  In this regard, there is no need for

Singaporeans  to  moan  and groan.  No  need  to  generate  a

climate  of  gloom and doom.  Such competition  helps  us  to

sharpen  our  competitiveness and enhance  our  productivity.

This  is  part and parcel of life.  We need not be  angry  or

resent   such   competition  but  welcome  such   competition

positively.    It  makes  us  better.   It  makes   us   more

competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, earlier on in this House, BG George Yeo

pointed  out that our economic competitors are not only  from

the region, but from further afield, from China, for example.

And  its cost-efficient manufacturing capacities in China  is

one  important  area for us to look at.   So  we  must  thank

Malaysia for giving us, indeed, a practice run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, water has been a bone of contention between

Singapore  and Malaysia.  Singapore is indeed  deemed  to  be

dependent on Malaysia for water and could be held to  ransom.

On  the day of Separation, Tungku Abdul Rahman said that, "If

Singapore's  foreign  policy  is  prejudicial  to  Malaysia's

interests, we could always bring pressure to bear on them  by

threatening  to  turn  off the water  in  Johor."   And  this

Malaysian position has not changed over the years.   Now  and

then, Malaysians have threatened to use water as a trump card

against Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysts and commentators have pointed out that this

could  lead to tension and open conflict.  Even Mr Chiam  See

Tong, speaking in this House on 5th June 1997, declared  that

"cutting off the water supply is a very serious issue.  It is

like  declaring  war  on Singapore."  Lt General  Zaini  Mohd

Said,  a  retired Malaysian General, wrote that water  was  a

security issue that could lead to war.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation has changed. The first to pick this

up  amongst  analysts is Mr Joey Long, a young researcher  at

the  NTU Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies.  Mr Long

wrote  a  ground-breaking article on the water issue  between

Singapore and Malaysia in the December



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



2001  issue of "Contemporary Southeast Asia", a journal.   Mr

Long  concludes that with the desalination and  NEWater  from

recycling  plants, Singapore has the means to  achieve  water

self-sufficiency  and  is  no  longer  held  to   ransom   by

Malaysia's  use of water as a leverage.  In other words,  the

water  issue  has  been  desecuritised.  There  is  no   need

therefore   for   rhetoric  and   threats.    No   need   for

confrontation  and conflict.  There is no more the  Damocles'

sword  hanging  over  our  heads.  Mr  Long  is  indeed  most

perceptive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we remember that in this House on 5th April 2002,

the  Prime  Minister confirmed that Singapore  had  called  a

tender  for  a  desalination plant and has been  operating  a

plant to produce NEWater using membrane technology with  more

NEWater  plants to be built in the future.  And the  cost  is

indeed  not  prohibitive.  The Prime Minister concluded  that

"it may be better for bilateral relations if we start to move

a  little away from our reliance on Malaysia for water."  May

I  ask  the Minister what is the reaction of Malaysia to  our

new  found self-sufficiency in water?  I also wish to ask the

Minister  to update us on the negotiations of the package  of

issues  and  whether  the  talks  have  resumed  and  whether

Malaysia has sent a comprehensive note on their claims on the

issue of land reclamation and the basis of such claims.   The

Minister  may also care to draw some lessons on this  roller-coaster   up-and-down  relationship  between  Singapore   and

Malaysia  and  put it in the context of history and  politics

for us.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, relations with

Malaysia  will  always  have its  ups  and  downs.   However,

recently,  there  are more downs than ups.   The  reasons,  I

think,   are,   one,  historical;  two,  increasing   intense

competition as a result of Malaysia's strong economic  growth

and  progress.   I  have no problems with  increased  intense

competition because, to me, it is good for both countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has to sit up and accept such challenges to

our  port  and  airport services with more vigour  than  ever

before, and to compete with Malaysia for new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



businesses  and  talent  with our recent  tax  restructuring.

This  healthy competition will bring about better changes  to

both  economies.   In  fact, intense  competitive  activities

attract  international players to come and take advantage  of

the  good deals that come out of these competitions.   So  we

have  Maersk  Lines  and  we  have  Evergreen  going  to  the

Malaysian  port,  Pelapas.  However,  if  historical  reasons

continue to bear down on relations, then I think it is  going

to be tough to resolve because of the strong emotive elements

attached  to  this.   This should, however, be addressed  and

left  to rest once and for all in a pragmatic and non-emotive

manner.   Talks based on perception of issues will  create  a

widening gap between the two countries.  It must be based  on

facts  or it will not withstand the test of law, locally  and

internationally.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best signal came from Malaysian Foreign Minister

Syed  Hamid Albar, when he played moderator and told some  of

the  country's brightest brains to discard historical baggage

when   dealing   with  Singapore.   He  was  addressing   the

Association of Young Malaysian Professionals recently in  KL.

In  his  address,  one of the questions  he  posed  was:  can

emotions make way for pragmatism?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach to issues has always been pragmatic and, at

times,  clinical, and this has probably irked many.  However,

we  were brought up in circumstances that gave us not much of

an  option  but to work hard and survive.  Our EQ  is  poorly

ranked.   But  that does not mean we cannot  learn  from  the

Malaysians  or  from the Thais on this art of making  friends

and  winning people.  We want to be friends with  all.   Some

have  accused that Singapore is an Israel.  But Singapore  is

not the Israel of the East, and we do not want to be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and Malaysia have many similarities than

differences.   We  should avoid highlighting our  differences

and  emphasise  on our similarities.  Both countries'  racial

mix is the same, though in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



different proportions.  Both use Malay, Mandarin and English;

both  have relatives on each side of the Causeway;  and  both

have  investments on either side.  In fact, Singapore is  the

biggest  investor in Malaysia.  In fact, I remember,  when  I

attended  many  of  these  parliamentary  meetings  with   my

Malaysian  counterparts, I find Malaysians  and  Singaporeans

gravitating towards each other during such meetings, and  the

jokes  we share, the songs we sing, and the stand we took  on

many  issues usually strike similar chords.  Many of the  two

countries' agencies work very closely together, such  as  the

police,   the  anti-narcotics  agencies,  tourism  and   even

security  matters, eg, the latest terrorist crackdown.   Yet,

it  is  sad  when  I hear of harsh calls to  stop  our  water

supply, for example.  Perhaps, these were said in the heat of

anger and not meant seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we can, for once, set aside all our

historical  baggage, as proposed by their  Foreign  Minister,

and negotiate all our outstanding issues purely on the merits

of  the case, with a little give and take on both sides, then

I  hope we can start a new chapter in our relations.  It will

be good for both countries, it will be good for our children.

And  for  both  countries because the region will  be  viewed

differently than today, with investors more assured of  their

choice to put their money in these two countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia is a beautiful country, notwithstanding

what my colleague said that we do not visit Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, could you pose your question

quickly, because we are rather short of time now?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> I am saying that we should not just

take  these differences and these ups and downs that we  have

with  Malaysia  by  not going to visit Malaysia.   We  should

visit Malaysia, have more exchanges with each other, and then

we will have better trust between the two countries.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, the negotiations on our

bilateral package with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia  show  no sign of real progress.  On  the  contrary,

they  seem to have regressed.  In September 2000, when Senior

Minister Lee Kuan Yew visited KL, there was hope of  a  deal.

An  in-principle agreement was reached in skeletal form, with

differences narrowed significantly between the two countries.

This was despite the fact that Malaysia introduced new issues

to the package, such as the building of an underground tunnel

and a bridge, and the demolition of the Causeway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore had made concessions to reach the skeletal

agreement,  such  as offering 12 parcels  of  land  in  Bukit

Timah.   Many Singaporeans had then queried whether Singapore

had  given too much.  Then, instead of seizing the moment  to

narrow differences further, Malaysia suddenly upped the price

of  water being negotiated many times, and everything is  now

back  on  the  drawing  board.  Sir, in  most  parts  of  the

civilised  world, this would be considered a breach  of  good

faith.  Since then, heat was generated in the Malaysian media

over  issues such as land reclamation, Pulau Pisang and Pedra

Branca.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this does not help to improve the climate for

negotiations.  My concern is that Malaysia might use  any  of

these new issues to pressure us during our negotiations  over

the  bilateral package.  Indeed, can the Minister  assure  us

that no more new issues will be added to the already unwieldy

package?  And, since everything is so fluid now, it  is  also

worth asking if it is wise for us to be even negotiating  the

issues at all as a package.  It has so many issues tangled up

together.  It is so unwieldy, and it seems to be so dependent

on the temperament of Malaysian leaders that I feel it cannot

hold  together  as  a stable agreement,  even  after  it  was

signed.  After all, the Points of Agreement on railway  land,

signed  in  1990  between Senior Minister Lee  and  the  then

Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin, was supposed to be

binding.  Yet it had to be varied now to accommodate requests

from Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, before any deal can be reached, confidence must

be built on both sides,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



based  on  mutual  respect and reciprocity.   But,  from  the

barrage of one-sided criticisms from across the Causeway,  my

guess  is that it will take a long time - or, at least,  some

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Mahathir was reported as saying that the 1963

water  agreement with us was unfair to Malaysia  because  "it

states  that  there can be no changes unless  both  countries

agree."   This  statement worries me,  because  it  seems  to

indicate  that  he prefers an agreement which can  be  broken

unilaterally, then only it is fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that our package deal with

Malaysia, if it is at last made, be sealed so tightly that it

would  not  unravel just because someone wants to pick  fault

with  any one of the issues down the road, like a cat playing

with a ball of thread.  The future generations should not  be

bequeathed with such extra historical baggage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a younger MP, my hope is that, when the

agreement  is done, the younger generations of both countries

are  able to view the agreement as a positive symbol  of  our

interlocking  destinies.  Then, we can move on and  build  on

this legacy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I agree with my colleague before

me in his choice of the metaphor to describe our relationship

with the Malaysians, ie, it is like a roller-coaster, it  has

its ups and it has its downs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last year, in this House, it was reported that our

bilateral  ties  with  the Malaysians were  improving.   This

arises from Senior Minister Lee's visit to Malaysia, when  we

thought  we  had  an  agreement in principle  to  settle  all

outstanding  issues  with  a  certain  measure  of   urgency.

Unfortunately, after more than a year, it does not seem as if

we are anywhere closer to resolving these outstanding issues.

Not only that, we have new issues emerging, such as the issue

on  our land reclamation works at the Singapore straits which

is  now  a  bone  of  contention between the  two  countries.

Honestly,  Sir,  I cannot see how the conduct  of  legitimate

activities  within our territorial waters can be seen  as  an

interference with the rights



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Malaysians.   My  understanding  is  that  the  land

reclamation  is  well within the bounds of international  law

and is within our legitimate right so to undertake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems that in recent months, it is not uncommon

for the Malaysian media to allow itself to be used as a forum

to  conduct international relations.  The exploitation of the

media  has caught the attention of a Straits Times cartoonist

in  a  recent  publication, where there was a  cartoon  which

depicted the removal of the Merlion from one side of the road

to  the other with a caption which said: "Let's better  check

with  the Malaysian media before we move the Merlion  to  see

whether  they  approve of it."   We can  all  laugh  at  this

little joke.  Unfortunately, it is a sad reflection of how we

have allowed our foreign relations with the Malaysians to  be

played  out.   And,  as I was preparing  to  come  into  this

Chamber,  my  GPC Chairman, Dr Ong, remarked that  I  have  a

sombre-looking tie and asked whether this reflected the  tone

of  our relations with Malaysia.  Well, I thought perhaps  it

might.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have lost much ground in our ties with the

Malaysians,  and this is evident by the Freudian  slip  which

the Malaysian Prime Minister made recently when he alluded to

the  fact that there are many ways to skin the Singapore cat.

The   Malaysians   have  called  for   sensitivity   in   our

relationship  with  them.  If, as in the case  of  our  ties,

sensitivity   is  to  be  applied,  I  wonder  whether   this

sensitivity should also be mutually applied.  Where, if I may

ask,  is  the  sensitivity when the Malaysian Prime  Minister

alludes  to  the fact that there are many ways  to  skin  us?

Such words, unfortunately, and sadly, are not words that will

help  strengthen  our bilateral ties.  On  the  contrary,  it

weakens  and undermines the goodwill that we have put  in  so

much effort to build up in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let it be known that Singaporeans expect the

conduct  of our bilateral ties with the Malaysians to  be  on

equal footing and between two sovereign states enjoying equal

status and standing in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



the  international community.  If the Malaysians  think  that

ours is an "abang-adek" relationship, then I am sorry to  say

they  are sadly mistaken.  Again, I should have guessed  that

perhaps the Malaysian general election is coming, and this is

the  usual  time of the year or the season to  take  out  the

bogeyman from the cupboard to win popular support.   If  such

was the intention of the leaders, then one wonders how it  is

possible  for  the outside world to have much admiration  for

their system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, appreciate it if the Minister can

give  us  an update on the existing relationship between  the

two countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, my parliamentary colleague, Dr Tan

Cheng Bock, is a very nice man, and he means very nice things

for  everybody.  Sir, I, like him, was very optimistic, being

a   young  generation  of  Singaporeans,  that  with  a   new

generation on both sides of the Causeway, we will have a good

relationship in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unfortunately, as a person who visits Malaysia

regularly, the contrary is happening in Malaysia.  I remember

Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew made a call a few years ago that

we   do  not  pass  this  historical  baggage  to  the   next

generation.   But,  if  one goes and  talks  to  the  younger

generation  in  Malaysia,  on  the  contrary,  the  Malaysian

leaders  keep  on  passing historical  baggage  and  keep  on

raising  issues which predate historical matters.   I  wonder

whether they sincerely want the new generation to start their

relationship  on  a  new  basis or  do  they  want  all  this

historical baggage to be at the back of their mind when  they

deal with Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would add that let us be cautious but, at the

same  time,  try  to  keep an even keel  with  our  Malaysian

friends.   The cat was let out of the bag recently  when  the

Malaysian  Prime  Minister told UMNO to get ready  for  early

elections next year.  It explains the issues that were raised

by  the  Malaysians  in the last few  months.   I  think  the

standard operating procedure for the next few months will see

the usual barrage of issues across the Causeway,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



from  Pulau Pisang to reclamation, to water, so much so  that

somebody  even  remarked that they may  raise  goreng  pisang

also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the latest salvo, which was fired just last week,

was  that  our  Malay  brothers  are  being  left  behind  in

Singapore,  as compared to those up north.  I sincerely  hope

that  our  High  Commission in Malaysia  can  put  all  these

bilateral  issues  on its website with detailed  answers,  so

that whenever these issues are raised by the Malaysian media,

Malaysian  leaders  or  even ordinary  Malaysians,  our  High

Commission  can  just send them a simple note  telling  them,

"Please refer to this particular page on our website on  this

issue which has been raised many times in the past."  And,  I

think, by reminding them and telling them to keep on going to

the  website with those particular pages, we show  them  that

they  are,  basically, playing the same old broken gramophone

record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what really perturbed me was the recent comment by

the  Malaysian Prime Minister where he stated that just  like

there  are  many ways to skin a cat, there are many  ways  to

skin  Singapore.   That  it was not a Freudian  slip,  but  a

careful   statement,  bothers  me  a  lot  and   many   other

Singaporeans, some of whom wrote to the press about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am heartened to see that there are many lions in

this  House, just like there are many other lions  out  there

who  will  stand  and show that there are many  varieties  of

cats.  Do not always think that this is a kucing kurap.  This

is  Singapura and, if you try to skin the wrong cat, you  may

end up getting into a lot of trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while it is directed to the domestic audience, the

implications  of  the  statement  are  very  grave.   Do  the

Malaysians have a grand plan to fix Singapore, which directly

fixes  every Singaporean?  Is the grand plan to fix Singapore

supported  by all Malaysians?  If so, in what ways  are  they

planning to fix us?  I am sure that if a Singapore leader had

made a similar statement about Malaysia, they would have made

a ruckus about the statement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



and  even  gone to protest before our High Commission.   Many

Singaporeans are polite ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ravindran, I will give you another 30

seconds to skin the cat!

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Sorry, Freudian slip!

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Sir, the point I

want  to say is that we want to have good relationships  with

the Malaysians and we want to be friendly with them but, yet,

we must be firm and tell them that, please deal with us as  a

sovereign  nation and as a good friend, and do not treat  us,

as my colleague said, as in an "abang-adek" relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what are the other

steps  that perhaps the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and  the

Minister  in particular, can suggest to see how we  can  move

our  relationship forward and to have a better  relationship,

both between the leaders and the people in the two countries.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, Singapore is

Malaysia's  second largest investor. Singapore's  investments

in Malaysia are only superseded by those of America.  America

is  Malaysia's  largest  investor.  Malaysia  is  Singapore's

largest  trading partner.  Singapore is physically  connected

to Malaysia by a Causeway.  Singapore depends on Malaysia for

its water supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This water supply seems to be a troublesome issue. As

reported by Dr Ong, an article published that if Singapore is

self-sufficient in water, I suppose that much of the  quarrel

between  Singapore  and Malaysia will be taken  away,  but  I

believe  even  if there were no water issue, because  of  our

proximity  with  each  other, there shall  be  some  form  of

quarrel from time to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good relationship between Malaysia and Singapore is

of paramount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



importance.  What is worrying is that these angry  words  can

escalate.  This kind of situation has been going on  for  the

last  10  years.  It is not a recent event.   I  believe  the

quarrels  between Singapore and Malaysia are there  for  more

than  10 years in fact.  Malaysia has complained of Singapore

being  "unneighbourliness'' and arrogant.  Some  Singaporeans

have  called  their fellow countrymen to boycott shopping  at

Johor  Bahru  and to stop travelling to Malaysia.   It  would

appear  that,  with  the  passage of time,  the  relationship

between Singapore and Malaysia has not improved.  In fact, it

has worsened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of war have escalated and become quite intense

recently.   Last  month,  the  Malaysians  paper  the  Minggu

Malaysia reported, "Following the uproar over the reclamation

of  land off Pulau Tekong, noises are being made about  going

to  war  with Singapore.  This time, it is a small  group  of

Malaysians who are beating the drums of war."  Then  I  quote

again, "These people who do not have a complete understanding

of  the  problems  at hand want the Government  to  stop  the

supply  of  water and take confrontational action."   It  was

further  reported in that newspaper that,  "It  was  an  open

secret  that  if  Malaysia cut off the water  supply  to  the

Republic,  Singapore would use its airforce to attack  Johor,

try  and  wrest  control of the water  treatment  plants  and

occupy  that state."  These are very dangerous words -  going

to war between the two countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What must we do? I would suggest that if Singapore is

able  to  take  the  initiative  to  form  a  committee  with

representatives  from  both countries and  all  questions  of

relations between Singapore and Malaysia be brought  to  this

Committee  and  not dealt with by the press.  In  any  event,

Sir,  such words or talk between Singapore and Malaysia going

to war must be stopped.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainul Abidin. We are running behind

time now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, last week, there was a

group from Malacca,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



accompanied  by  the  members of the Malaysian  Institute  of

Historical  and Patriotism Studies, who came to visit  Malay-Muslim organisations and members of the community.  I  had  a

dialogue with them too.  They came out saying that, in  fact,

from  what they observed, they were very clear in their  mind

that  Singapore Malays are very much an integral part of  the

society,  that  they have not been left  out  and  have  been

looked after, and there is no marginalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week earlier, Datuk Megat Najmuddim Khas, the

President of the Corporate Governance Institute also said  on

CNA  `Between  the Lines' to the effect that we  should  just

forget  about  the  rhetorics  and  the  private  sectors  in

Malaysia  and  Singapore should move on to improve  relations

between the two countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should encourage more people-to-people

relations  to grow.  We should encourage more of the  Melaka-type  of  groups of people to come and similarly,  we  should

reciprocate by sending our grassroots organisations groups to

visit Malaysia to promote better understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that the last time our Senior Minister

visited  Malaysia, he chose to travel by road just to impress

on  the  Malaysians that he is willing to come to  understand

the  Malaysians closer and better.  I think maybe it is about

time that Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, also

made  a  visit here and stayed close to the ground to have  a

better understanding of Singapore.  I say this because of two

remarks  which  Dr  Mahathir made:  one,  is  of  course  the

infamous  skinning of the cat, and the other is  his  remarks

about Singapore Malays.  I do not want to belabour the point,

Sir,  but I think I remember that sometime back, one  Straits

Times  journalist once described Dr Mahathir as a "top  dog".

That  could  have evoked him to refer to us as a cat.   Never

had  we  in fact seen ourselves as a top cat.  So  I  do  not

think  there  is a need for them to skin us.  I  must  remind

them  that neither are we stray cats.  We are a very integral

part  of  the  region  and we value good relations  with  our

neighbours.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a cat of our own called Kuchinta, meaning

we  love  you.   This  is  just  to  remind  Malaysians  that

Singaporeans  love  Singapore and we  will  defend  Singapore

whenever there are unfriendly and uncalled for remarks  made.

Dr Mahathir should realise that Singapore Malays do not agree

with his description of their position in Singapore.  Yes, we

are  a minority. Yes, we still have problems to overcome  but

we  are  not  marginalised.  Neither do  we  despair  in  our

efforts  to  uplift.   We  are  happy  that  our  efforts  at

upliftment  not  only get the support of the  Government  but

also   support  from  the  private  sector.   By  all  means,

Malaysian  leaders can motivate the Malaysian Malays  but  do

not  look  down on Singapore Malays.  They hurt the Singapore

Malays'  feelings by those unfair remarks.  Let us move  away

from  the  `dogs and cats' relationship to one that  is  more

productive and more friendly.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, compared with previous years, I

cannot  recall the Committee of Supply where so many  Members

have  moved cuts on Malaysia. I think, this is, in fact,  the

largest number.  Perhaps it is understandable in view of what

Dr  Ong  Chit Chung had said about the ups and downs  in  our

bilateral  relationship and the way in  which  Singapore  has

been criticised in the Malaysian media on several issues over

the past few months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh recently, on 5th May 2002, spoke

about  the  negative  reports in the Malaysian  media.   They

started with the water issue in January. We were portrayed as

having  profiteered  from  the  purchase  of  water   at   an

"unreasonably"  low  price all these years  as  a  result  of

"unfair" Agreements, as mentioned by Ms Irene Ng.    Then  in

February,  their media turned to the tudung issue, with  some

alleging  that  our policy was part of an overall  scheme  to

marginalise   the   Malay-Muslim  community   following   the

September 11 events and the arrest of the JI in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in late February, the focus moved on to Singapore's

land  reclamation works.  In March, remarks which  have  been

made in jest by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan almost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



threatened  to become a self-contained bilateral  issue.   In

April,  criticism  turned  to  the  lighthouse  that  we  are

entitled  to  operate on Pulau Pisang, with wild  allegations

that  armed  Singapore  personnel  were  going  there.   More

recently, Members would have read reports that Singapore  was

buying fewer tomatoes from Cameron Highlands, and accusations

that  Singapore was turning away Malaysian vegetables because

they  did  not satisfy certain health standards that  we  had

somehow kept secret all these years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In levelling these accusations against us, Singapore was

asked to "compromise" and exhibit neighbourly behaviour.  The

comments  suggest that Singapore should accede to  Malaysia's

expressed concerns, regardless of whether they were  formally

raised  or  substantiated  to be facts.   Anything  short  of

accepting and abiding by the Malaysian concerns was deemed to

be  insensitivity  on our part towards  our  neighbours.   In

essence,  we  were  being  asked to accept  a  zero-sum  fait

accompli.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we respond to all these unsubstantiated

claims  and allegations?  Sir, I suggest that the best course

of  action  for  us  is not to be unduly perturbed  by  these

strident diatribes but proceed with our daily affairs  as  we

have many pressing issues in our national agenda.  Of course,

we  want  to  have good relations with Malaysia but,  as  the

Prime  Minister  said  recently, we  cannot  be  chasing  and

answering  each and every wild allegation that is made.   But

if  a serious point has been made, backed by proper facts, we

should be ready to look at it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would not want this afternoon to reply point-by-point to every one of the Malaysian allegations that

Members raised. Instead, I will briefly update Members on the

status  of  our package negotiations and some Members  talked

about reclamation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the package, on 3rd May, when I replied to Mr Leong

Horn  Kee  here  who requested for an update on  our  package

negotiations,  Members would recall that I said  that  I  had

proposed a set of dates to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



my counterpart, the Foreign Minister, Syed Hamid Albar for  a

meeting  between  both  sides  following  the  correspondence

between  the  Prime  Ministers.  He had  offered  alternative

dates  and  now officials on both sides are working  out  the

dates  convenient to both of us.  I believe  that  they  will

soon  settle  the date for the first meeting.   Dr  Ong  Chit

Chung  asked  what has been the reaction to  what  the  Prime

Minister  spoke about self-sufficiency in water.   But  as  I

said  before,  Members would have read  the  statements  that

different leaders in Malaysia have said.  There has  been  no

official government reaction and I do not think it was really

called for.  When Prime Minister spoke on this, Members would

have  read  that Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah  Badawi  said

that if we wanted to look at other sources of water supply it

is  up  to  us  and  he said that it is not going  to  affect

negatively or jeopardise bilateral ties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reclamation, Members would recall that I spoke on

this  on  3rd May also in response to Mr Leong Horn  Kee.   I

informed  the  House that Malaysia had sent a  Note  on  30th

April on our reclamation works around Tekong and Ubin.   That

was the third Note after two previous Notes which had focused

on reclamation works in the Tuas area where they alleged that

we  had  violated their territorial sovereignty.  This  third

Malaysian  Note  only contains general allegations  that  our

Tekong  reclamation  works  have  had  an  impact  on   their

territorial  waters, but there were no specific  facts,  none

whatever, details to substantiate their allegations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had replied and rebutted their two previous Notes. I

would  like  to inform Members that we have replied  to  this

third Note on 15th May 2002.  The Malaysian High Commissioner

was  called in to receive a copy of our official reply  where

we  stated that their allegations that our reclamation  works

had   caused  a  "transboundary  environmental  impact"  upon

Malaysian  territorial waters and the claim that it  narrowed

"the waterway" in Kuala Johor were unsubstantiated and lacked

particulars.  We therefore reminded the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



High  Commissioner to ask his government to send  us  a  Note

itemising their concerns in detail for us to study carefully.

So  in reply to Dr Ong Chit Chung, the answer is no.  We  are

still awaiting that comprehensive Note.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said thus far about the package and

reclamation  works  is factual.  But it  is  true  that  both

matters have become bell-wethers, in a sense, for the  course

of  our bilateral relations.  It would be natural for many in

this  House,  and  many Singaporeans, to  conclude  that  our

relations with Malaysia are at a low point based on  the  way

these  and  other issues have hogged the headlines in  recent

months.    There   is   no  denying  that  Singapore-Malaysia

relations  have encountered choppy waters, but  I  would  say

that  like  the tide which ebbs and flows, the current  rough

patch  is  to  be  considered  as  normal  in  state-to-state

relations   between  immediate  neighbours.   Both   of   us,

Singapore  and  Malaysia,  share a  complex  and  interlinked

relationship and keeping it on an even keel is never an  easy

task.  Therefore, I agree with colleagues who have said  that

both  sides should view Singapore-Malaysia relations, not  in

an  emotional  sense, bogged down by historical baggage,  but

from a pragmatic and longer-term perspective, rather than try

to seek short-term gains through one-upmanship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also noted what Ms Irene Ng has said just now.

Yes,  negotiating with the Malaysians is not easy.  But  does

it  mean  we should not negotiate with them?  I do not  think

that  this is what she meant.  Our experience has been  that,

notwithstanding all the difficulties, it is still possible to

reach  agreements with the Malaysians, but this  is  provided

there is the political will and goodwill to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with her that if new issues are thrown into

the  package that is currently on the table, it will make the

negotiations  even  more  complicated  and  the  chances   of

reaching  agreement even more slim.  But that is not  to  say

that in our bilateral relations new issues will not crop



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



up.  Events have shown that they do crop up, and we will have

to deal with them as and when they emerge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this matter of "skinning the cat", many Members have

alluded  to  Dr Mahathir's "skinning the cat" remarks.   They

have quoted from the Beritan Harian (Malaysia) report of  3rd

May, where he was quoted as saying "We can skin a cat in many

ways.  To  skin Singapore, there is not just one method."   I

was  curious and looked up the various newspaper articles and

magazines and it would seem that Dr Mahathir seems to have  a

fondness for skinning cats.  He has used this phrase "we  can

skin  a  cat  in many ways" on several other occasions.   For

example,  in an interview with Asia Incorporated on 4th  May,

in  answer to a question: "If you have to describe Malaysia's

approach to globalisation in one sentence, how would  you  do

it?",  and he replied, "Firstly, listen to everyone.   Number

two,  always accept that there are many ways to skin  a  cat,

many  ways  to  do things in order to achieve results."   and

similarly, at the PEBC conference in Kuala Lumpur, when asked

to explain Malaysia's approach in dealing with the 1997 Asian

Financial Crisis, he said:  "People know that there are  many

ways  to  skin a cat.  We have chosen the unorthodox way  and

the cat has been neatly skinned."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge Members that we should take such

remarks  in  our stride.  This is not the first time  and  it

will  not be the last time that we are called names.  We have

been  called  all  kinds of names:  a `little  red  dot',  `a

pimple that won't burst', and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have also often been accused of being thick-skinned. So trying to skin us can be quite a daunting task.

Despite all the name-calling that we have endured over  these

years, Singapore continues with our business, we continue  to

survive  and we continue to prosper.  Cats, after  all,  have

nine  lives, they say.  And no cat is ever going to lie  down

meekly to be skinned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would say to Members of the House that we should

not allow such name-calling to deter us from what we must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



do to defend and promote our national interests.  Instead,  I

think  all  of us should look and take note of the underlying

message  behind the metaphor, the underlying message  of  how

seriously  they  intend to compete with us and  we  therefore

have to gird ourselves to meet this challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore-Malaysia relations are extremely

complicated,  as  must be any relationship  of  close  inter-dependence.  There are different strands in the relationship,

and  not  all  the  strands are neatly  compartmentalised  or

compatible. There will always be ups and downs.  And it is  a

fact  that some Malaysians delight in putting Singapore down.

But  that strand of thinking revealed is not the only one  in

Malaysia.   There  is also an understanding  that  given  the

close  inter-dependence  between our  countries,  what  hurts

Singapore  will also hurt Malaysia.  And the  games  of  one-upmanship should not be allowed to go too far.   In fact,  Dr

Mahathir  himself  said so recently when  commenting  on  our

reclamation  works,  on 14th April in Bernama:  "We  must  be

careful  in handling a problem such as this because we  don't

want  to be at war with Singapore" and he said, "That's  why,

when  handling  national affairs, we  have  to  be  extremely

careful and wise . ."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would repeat, let us not get too worked up over

these   remarks.   It  should  not  deter  us  from   seeking

cooperation  with  Malaysia when  cooperation  is  to  mutual

benefit.  But we must cooperate without illusions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say, let us take the Malaysian criticisms

against  us in our stride.  There is no need to get  excited.

They  constitute a form of psy-war to weaken our  morale  and

soften   our   position  on  matters  under  negotiation   or

discussion.  Let us quietly and politely state the facts  and

stand on them.  Mr Ravindran said, put it on the website.   I

will ask my High Commissioner in KL, I know they are doing  a

good  job in disseminating all the speeches and positions  to

various  quarters in Malaysia.  They have a website.   If  it

can  be  improved, Mr Ravindran said, let us do so.  But  the

important point is that notwithstanding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



the  present cloudy atmospherics, we are committed to forging

a  long-term  relationship  with  Malaysia  based  on  mutual

respect  and sovereign equality.  We are neighbours  who  can

and  should cooperate and realise the full potential  in  our

bilateral relationship and find win-win solutions.  As PM Goh

himself  said,  both  countries should  in  fact  be  working

closely in order to consolidate and lead ASEAN.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung asked me:</b> Would I reflect on what are

the  lessons that we can learn from this?  I think there  are

several useful lessons, if I may enumerate them.  I think the

points  are alluded to by Mr Chiam See Tong about  the  media

and Mr Sin Boon Ann, too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we should not negotiate or try to raise

bilateral  issues  in the mass media.   If  the  goal  is  to

resolve  the  problem,  then conducting  bilateral  relations

through  the media actually complicates finding a  resolution

to  the issue.  Playing up bilateral issues through the media

restricts  the  manoeuvrability of both sides.   It  is  much

easier to find a solution which would benefit both parties if

such  issues  are quietly handled.  In fact, in an  interview

with  Straits  Times which my counterpart,  Foreign  Minister

Syed  Hamid  Albar,  gave in 1999,  he  said:  "But  what  is

considered  as  sensitive and can be  misunderstood  and  can

create  tension  should be kept outside the  public  domain."

And he noted that quiet diplomacy would enable the points  of

contention to be resolved speedily by both sides.  That is  a

point  I  wholeheartedly  agree.  Unfortunately,  the  recent

public  comments  made  by  some politicians  and  the  media

barrage  there show that they have not heeded  his  words  of

wisdom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second lesson is that while disagreements are bound to

occur  from time to time, it is very important to  keep  open

our  channels of communication.  And I think this point  made

by  Mr  Zainul  Abidin is relevant, by still maintaining  the

different  visits and so on.  So, I am glad that despite  the

intense  barrage and roller-coaster rides that  Dr  Ong  Chit

Chung mentioned,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



there   has   been  a  steady  exchange  of  visits   between

Singaporean  and  Malaysian leaders since the  start  of  the

year.   Singapore  has  hosted visits by  Malaysian  leaders.

Ministers  have come here and our Ministers have gone  there.

Barisan  Nasional  Youth delegation came to  Singapore.   Our

Deputy  Prime  Minister visited Kuala Lumpur.  Our  President

led the NUS team for the Games, and other Ministers like RAdm

Teo  Chee Hean and BG George Yeo have made visits.   Mr  Wong

Kan  Seng  also led the MHA team up there and he  met  Deputy

Prime  Minister  Abdullah  Badawi.   These  exchanges  should

continue.    Perhaps  they  are  even  more  important   when

relations go through a rough patch.  It gives the opportunity

for  both  sides to share views and discuss key issues.   The

agreement  by  the  youth wings of the PAP  and  the  Barisan

Nasional  to  formalise their relationship by establishing  a

secretariat is also a move in the right direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, and this touches on the point that Mr Sin Boon

Ann  made  about  reciprocity, I think there  should  not  be

double  standards  applied  to  the  cardinal  principles  of

relationships, such as the principle of non-intervention,  or

non-interference with the internal affairs  of  one  another.

More so, when the issue involved is sensitive, and which  can

have a possible impact on racial and religious harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tudung issue is a case in point. The point that Mr

Zainul  Abidin  mentioned is also relevant.   Some  Malaysian

politicians  continue to hold the position that they  have  a

right  to  comment  on Singapore issues  involving  race  and

religion.  These comments do not help in any way in advancing

our  bilateral  relations.  On the contrary, they  will  only

complicate and confuse matters further.  For example, on  the

tudung issue, it is not about the religious rights of Muslims

in Singapore, and I fail to understand how Singapore's school

uniform  policy  is  anything  but  a  domestic  issue  which

Singaporeans have to decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, and this touches on the point which Miss Irene

Ng talked about agreement.  I think the relationship between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



Singapore and Malaysia must be based on international law and

the  observance  of  agreements.   It  cannot  be  based   on

subjective   criteria,   or   based   on   emotionalism    or

sentimentality.  Otherwise, there would be no basis to  judge

whether one's action was right or one's action was wrong.  As

a small country, Singapore adheres closely to this principle.

That  was  why we have stressed several times the  legal  and

binding nature of the Water Agreements or the POA.  And  that

is  why we also repeatedly stated that our reclamation  works

are  being carried out within Singapore's territorial waters,

and  in accordance with international law.  Recently, Sir,  a

New  Straits Times editorial of 15th April, referring  to  my

Ministry's   Addendum,   said  that  Singapore   was   "over-legalistic"  and  added,  and I  quote,  "what  follows  from

Singapore's overweening legalism is a fixation with  'facts',

[fixation  with facts], the sort that would stand  up  in  an

adversarial  court of law, and a foreclosing of the  flexible

positions that would conduce to a friendly tete-a-tete."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, "fixation with facts"? "Legalistic"? Sticking to

facts  and  to  the  law surely is the  only  basis  for  any

relationship which is not based on the arbitrary wishes of  a

single  party.   How  else can it be?   How  else  can  sound

international relations be possible if we do not have  regard

to  principles  of international law and agreements  lawfully

entered  into  by governments?  Also, how can we  have  sound

basis for bilateral relations if we were to ignore facts  and

instead  rely on unsubstantiated allegations, distortions  or

rumours?  Yes, we can have friendly tete-a-tetes.  And indeed

we are having them, as I mentioned all these to-ings and fro-ings.   But,  Sir, this cannot be at the expense of  ignoring

facts   or   at  the  expense  of  abandoning  solemn   legal

commitments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to conclude, let me stress again that it is not the

intention of Singapore or interest to have strained relations

with  Malaysia.  We seek a cooperative relationship based  on

mutual benefit and mutual respect.  Not one based on emotions

or  historical  baggage, as some Members have  rightly  said.

Inevitably,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



there  will  be ups and downs in these relations.  Therefore,

we  believe  that  both  sides should  address  the  problems

pragmatically,   on   equal  terms,  taking   a   longer-term

perspective  without resorting to unsubstantiated allegations

or  threats.  On this basis, Singapore and Malaysia can enjoy

a calm and balanced bilateral relationship.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that we

have  about  5  items  and 4 replies to be  completed  in  20

minutes' time.  Mr Heng Chee How.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, it is not my intention to

belabour  the  point  about Singapore-Malaysia  relationship.

But  I just like to bring up one subject matter, and that  is

on Pedra Branca.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's claim to Pedra Branca, which is the

land  on  which  the Horsburgh Lighthouse  stands,  has  been

challenged by Malaysia some years ago.  I recall that, in the

end,   both  sides  agreed  to  refer  the  dispute  to   the

International  Court  for arbitration.  In  our  relationship

with  Malaysia,  we  have often lamented that  there  is  not

enough  progress  because details cannot be  pinned  down  or

agreed  to by both sides.  But in the case of this particular

dispute over Pedra Branca, this agreement to refer the matter

to  third  party arbitration seems to have placed us  further

along this road towards the determination of outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I read reports that some politicians in

Malaysia  have  said  that they are pushing  for  the  matter

before  the International Court to be expedited.  Sir,  I  am

certain  that Singapore's claim to Pedra Branca has full  and

firm  basis and we are surely just as keen to see a  decision

on this matter.  I would just like to ask the Minister for an

update  on the status of the matter and what steps are  being

taken to have this arbitrated upon as soon as possible.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, it has been some time since this

subject was last brought up.  Let me refresh our memories by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



saying  that  Pedra Branca is part of Singapore's  territory.

The  Singapore Government and its predecessors have  occupied

and  exercised  full sovereignty over Pedra  Branca  and  the

waters around it for more than 150 years since the 1840s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ownership and sovereignty over Pedra Branca has

never been challenged by another country.  Even Malaysia  had

continuously   and   consistently   recognised    Singapore's

sovereignty  over Pedra Branca for more than 130 years  until

it contested Singapore's ownership of the island in 1979.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I have noted that some Malaysian politicians have

said  that  the  case on Pedra Branca is already  before  the

International Court of Justice, that they want to expedite or

accelerate the hearing of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual or current position is that both Malaysia and

Singapore  have agreed in 1998 on referring the case  to  the

International  Court of Justice.  But the case  has  not  yet

been  submitted  to  the Court, because there  is  a  certain

procedure that Malaysia and Singapore must follow in order to

do so.  The procedure was spelled out in 1998, when Singapore

and  Malaysian senior officials reached agreement on the text

of a draft Special Agreement to refer Malaysia's claim to the

ICJ.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that Agreement is subject to procedural requirements

such  as a formal ratification of the Special Agreement,  and

only when that is done we can submit the case to the ICJ.  On

our  part,  we  are prepared to proceed to the ICJ  when  the

Malaysians are ready.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Indonesia is Singapore's

biggest neighbour, and an important member of ASEAN.  We wish

Indonesia well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jakarta's relationship with Singapore has vacillated

from the affectionate Suharto, to frosty in Habibie, then the

awkward  in  Wahid and now to cordial in Megawati,  over  the

past few years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must say that, despite the stronger government-to-government ties that have accompanied Mrs Megawati's

ascension to power, much needs to be done to broaden the  web

of  relationship between the two countries.  However,  things

are  quite unsettled in Indonesia.  Separatist movements  are

still  active  and  there  is fear of  the  Balkanisation  of

Indonesia.   There  are  signs  of  factionalisation  of  the

leadership, with the Vice-President doing his own  thing  and

pulling in different directions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern that the leadership is not taking

a  strong  stand  on religious fundamentalism and  terrorism.

The sluggish handling of regional concerns over the terrorist

links  in  Indonesia  has undermined the credibility  of  the

Megawati  government.  Islamic groups have  gained  influence

and  have  asserted pressure on the government and  increased

their political demands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has offered to facilitate direct

investigations  by  Indonesia to  confirm  that  links  exist

between  Indonesian suspects still at large in Indonesia  and

members of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the outcome of such Indonesian

investigations?   I  wish to ask the Minister  also  for  his

comment  on the political and economic situation in Indonesia

and the state of our relations with Indonesia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, Indonesia has been an anchor partner

of  ASEAN  and  a  key trading partner of Singapore.   It  is

undergoing  tremendous political, economic and social  change

since 1998.  Its economy is in the path of recovery and there

is greater optimism of its economic prospect this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our relations with Indonesia are excellent, and we must

continue  to  build on the good work done  by  our  political

leaders,  bureaucrats,  the SAF  and  businessmen.   We  have

extended  many  forms  of  support  and  assistance  to   the

Indonesian government and other NGOs.  These efforts are well

appreciated  both  in Jakarta and at the  provincial  levels.

Our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



recent  suggestion to provide an export corridor for  exports

from  Batam and Bintan to the US, under the proposed FTA,  is

an  excellent effort to help Indonesia increase its  economic

growth and create more employment for Indonesians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister as to what are his

Ministry's   plans   to   further  promote   this   excellent

relationship between the two countries, particularly in three

areas:  (i) in promoting greater trade and investment between

the   two   countries;  (ii)  whether  we  can  see   greater

cooperation in the area of counter-terrorism; and (iii)  what

measures  can  be  put in place to increase contacts  between

Members of Parliament, bureaucrats, businessmen and people.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> As both Dr Ong and Mr Ravindran said,

we   attach   great  importance  to  our  relationship   with

Indonesia, and our relations are excellent.  Indonesia is one

of   Singapore's  closest  neighbours  and  a  major  trading

partner.   Actually  we have a deep and abiding  interest  in

Indonesia's  stability  as a unitary state,  its  growth  and

prosperity.  Indonesia is also strategically important to the

region.   Events  in Indonesia, such as political  strife  or

Islamic militancy therefore can have severe repercussions  on

Singapore as well as other ASEAN countries.  Therefore,  this

underscores  the importance of Indonesia, the  importance  of

our  bilateral relations, and the impact of Indonesia in  the

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Ravindran and Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about

cooperation  on terrorism.  Let me say that at  the  official

level,  our  agencies are cooperating closely with Indonesian

authorities  and  providing  them  with  the  information  to

conduct their own investigations after we had assured them of

giving them access to the people we had arrested.  But I hope

Members will understand when I talk about cooperation in such

areas on counter-terrorism and intelligence cooperation,  the

details have to be kept confidential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked what we can do to nurture this

relationship.   It is a relationship that has been  based  on

very strong fundamentals, especially the close



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



personal  and institutional ties we have built over  some  30

years  with  Presidents, Ministers, officials,  and  recently

with  President  Megawati.   We have  also  established  good

relations  between her and our leaders.   As  you  know,  she

visited  Singapore soon after she was inaugurated as head  of

state.  We had good discussions with her and her delegation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Ministers have visited Indonesia and vice versa, and

have had good discussions with their counterparts.  They meet

bilaterally.   They  also meet at the  sidelines  of  various

meetings.  There are also good contacts between officials.  I

agree with Mr Ravindran that these are matters which we  must

constantly  nurture because there are new actors,  there  are

new  personalities, and it is not static.  You have  to  keep

working  at  it.  I can assure Members that my  Ministry,  as

well   as  other  Ministries,  is  very  cognisant  of  this,

particularly  with  Indonesia when  they  have  so  many  new

personalities  at  the centre as well as in  other  parts  of

Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On economic cooperation, I believe Minister George Yeo

did touch on this when the Ministry of Trade and Industry was

discussed.  We do want Indonesia to recover economically,  to

play  a  leading role in enhancing stability in  the  region.

Therefore,  we  remain  ready to help  Indonesia  within  our

limited capabilities as a small country.  That is why we have

said that we can play a catalytic role and find creative ways

of  assisting Indonesia's economic recovery.  A good  example

is  what Mr Ravindran mentioned, such as the extension of the

US-Singapore FTA to cover Indonesian IT products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is in these ways that Singapore, although we are

small,  can  demonstrate  that we have  a  deep  and  abiding

interest if we want to work with Indonesia, and that we  will

try to be helpful when we talk to other countries to generate

in  them  an  interest also in Indonesia, and in  Indonesia's

future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong. "Guillotine" time is 5.05 pm.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore was privileged to be

elected a non-permanent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



member  of the United Nations Security Council.  We  are  now

three-quarter way through our term of office in the  Security

Council,  and  Singapore is again President of  the  Security

Council this month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what valuable lessons have we

learned  in terms of the scope and operations of the Security

Council, and whether such an experience is useful to a  small

nation like Singapore.  For example, how do we give input and

ideas in dealing with complex and difficult issues?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, continuing

along  this  line,  I would like to ask the Minister  whether

there seems to be a low level of perception of the importance

of  this  multi-lateral diplomacy that we are doing, and  the

international  organisations as fora that  we  embark  on  to

protect  our  own interest and to further our interest  as  a

small  nation state, in pursuit of this international  public

route  of an open economy, of international commons  such  as

freedom  of the sea, anti-piracy, anti-terrorism.   I  wonder

this  low  level of perception is due to a lack of our  media

coverage  of our action.  What kind of initiatives  does  the

Minister think we could do to improve on these?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Second Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Sir, our experience as an elected member of the

United  Nations  Security Council has  been  educational  and

instructive.   We  now have a better sense  of  the  internal

workings  and procedures of the Council.  We have  tried,  as

part  of  our work on the Council, to try to make the Council

more transparent and accountable to the larger UN membership.

It  remains  clear that the influence of P5 countries  weighs

heavily  in  the consideration of the issues in the  Council.

It  is  not only due to their power to veto resolutions,  but

their  global  reach  and  access to information  around  the

world,  particularly in conflict areas.  On difficult  issues

of  the  Council, where there are differences of opinion  and

positions  among  the P5 countries, the elected  members  can

play a bridging role to help bring about a compromise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another lesson is the importance of Council's unity for

it  to be effective.  For example, on the difficult issue  of

the   Middle  East,  the  Council  was  able  to  adopt  four

resolutions  in  two months - March and  April  this  year  - unanimously.  However, recently, the lack of consensus in the

Council resulted in its inability to respond to situation  on

the  ground.  Our approach at the Council has been guided  by

our  consistent support for principles of international  law,

observance  of  the  UN  Charter  and  compliance  with   the

resolutions of the Security Council.  Because we have  always

taken a consistent and principled approach, our friends  have

been able to understand and appreciate our position, even  if

it  means that we are unable to fully support them.  We  have

always  endeavoured to conduct ourselves in  a  credible  and

responsible manner in the Council.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In responding to Mr Chay, I agree with him that more can

be   done   to   publicise  what  we  do   in   international

organisations.   We will see what more can  be  done.   As  a

small  country, Singapore has been selective in applying  for

membership in international organisations.  Besides being  an

elected  member  of  the UN Security  Council,  we  are  also

elected  members of the UN Commission on International  Trade

Law  and  the Governing Council of the International Maritime

Organisation.   Being a small country,  it  is  also  in  our

interest  to work with other small states.  In 1992,  in  New

York,  Singapore  established an informal grouping  of  small

states  known as Forum of Small States.  It now comprises  85

countries  and  meets  a few times a year  under  Singapore's

chairmanship to discuss issues of concern to small states.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various Singaporeans have contributed to the work of the

UN.   For example, Ambassador Tommy Koh comes to mind for his

outstanding work concerning the Law of the Sea.  We prefer to

go  about our work without fanfare.  It is our style to  work

through quiet diplomacy and focus on results.  However, we do

publicise our major contributions, especially in the UN.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



The  Ministry of Defence also keeps the media informed on our

participation in UN Peacekeeping Operations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee, I suggest you just ask your

questions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, sorry about just now. Singapore

has  a  long  history  of providing technical  assistance  to

countries in the region.  These exchanges allow us  not  only

to  help  build  up  capacity in surrounding  countries,  but

foster great goodwill and enable long-term friendships to  be

built  up that can help smooth over relations between  states

during  troubled  times.   I wonder  if  the  Minister  could

encourage more of these exchanges and training programmes  to

be  carried out, not only by Government agencies, but through

NGOs  and  institutions,  like  the  Singapore  International

Foundation, so that we can move for more understanding  among

our neighbours.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, you have two minutes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Sir, short answer to Dr Warren Lee is, yes,

we  will try to do more.  We are already doing that.  We have

collaboration   not   just   with   governments   but    with

institutions, such as the World Bank, ADB and the IMF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be useful here to draw Members'

attention  to what Dr Lee has alluded to, which is  the  long

history of Singapore's technical assistance.  We have,  since

its   inception  10  years  ago,  trained  more  than  20,000

participants from 147 developing countries.  Last year alone,

we  trained 4,187 participants from 113 countries.  We should

do  more  to publicise and profile what we have done because,

if  properly  managed,  this will  help  enhance  a  positive

international  image  of Singapore and help  us  win  friends

abroad  and,  just as important, make Singaporeans  proud  of

their country.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Ministers

for their full and comprehensive replies.  I must say that we

want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



send  a  message  out  from  here across  the  Causeway  that

Singaporeans are friendly, but we are resolute and determined

to   protect   and  defend  Singapore's  national   interest.

Moreover, I want to say that we do not wish to play a cat and

mouse  game with the Malaysian leaders.  On that note, I  beg

leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I take items (a) and (d) together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid not.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, when we scan the security

landscape   around  us  today,  the  triangular  relationship

between  US,  China and Japan continues  to  be  a  focus  of

attention within the Asia-Pacific.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central issue here is how rising Japanese and

Chinese national self-assertion mesh with each other as  well

as  with  the  United States, the sole surviving  superpower.

While Chinese relations with US continue to be conditioned by

the  Taiwan  issue, there is concern in the region  over  the

increasingly  evident desire of Tokyo to become  a  so-called

"normal"   state,  able  to  fully  exercise  the  political,

diplomatic and military power commensurate with its  economic

clout.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the Sea of Japan, the continued stand-off on the

Korean    Peninsula   is   another   potential    flashpoint,

particularly given President Bush's recent identification  of

North  Korea  as one of the so-called "Axis of Evil"  states.

Closer  to home, in the South China Sea, the Spratly  Islands

continue to be a contentious issue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



between  China  and several other regional states,  including

the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that brings us to the recent arms spending spree of

Southeast  Asian  countries,  for  example,  Malaysia.   Some

countries  claim  that their arms spending is  to  modernise,

catch  up and complete projects that were put on hold  during

the  Asian financial crisis.  However, given the historically

competitive  nature  of  the relationships  within  Southeast

Asia,  like between Thailand and Burma, Cambodia and Vietnam,

Malaysia and Singapore, an apparent arms race is on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, it is now becoming clear that following

the  ouster  of the Taliban and the destruction  of  Al-Qaeda

infrastructure   in  Afghanistan,  Al-Qaeda  operatives   are

seeking to set up new bases of operations in Southeast  Asia.

In  fact,  an  American military chief  recently  voiced  his

concern  over such developments in Manila, and this  explains

why  the  Americans are expanding their military presence  on

the ground, the Philippines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to what I think is the most dramatic

change  in the strategic environment after September 11:  the

frontline is no longer just something out there; it is  right

here  within  our  shores.  The frontline  lies  not  in  our

military   hardware  or  in  our  technical  software.    The

frontline lies within our collective hardware.  Do  we  feel,

first and foremost, as Singaporeans committed heart and  soul

to  the idea of Singapore, or are we being pulled apart  from

one another by a hundred different ideas?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the potential for a mass exodus of people from a

crisis-stricken  Indonesia is another area of  concern.   Are

there contingency plans in place if Indonesians were to  fall

again  into  a  period  of  protracted  economic  crisis   or

protracted  sectarian violence, thereby  resulting  in  large

uncontrolled population movements?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after September 11, the nature of threats has

changed.  Not only have we to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



train  and mobilise against conventional attacks, we have  to

give   full  attention  to  lower-intensity  operations   and

terrorist  attacks.   Such low-intensity  operations  require

highly trained personnel and specialised equipment.  The  SAF

will  have  to  be  multi-tasked and there has  to  be  close

coordination  between SAF, Police, Civil  Defence  and  other

related agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the issue of privacy at sea, and the need

for  us, together with other nations, to ensure that the  sea

lanes  of communications are safe.  I therefore wish  to  ask

the  Minister whether the SAF has upgraded its capability and

recast its strategy for the tasks ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, as a small country, we have never

taken  our defence for granted.  Since independence, we  have

relied on the twin policy of deterrence and diplomacy as  the

foundation of our defence policy.  One cannot deny  that,  if

not  for  a strong and capable SAF, Singapore's standing  and

profile in the region would have been very different, and  it

is  because of our strong and capable SAF that we are able to

conduct  our  diplomatic relations with much  confidence  and

assurance.  We have not only relied on deterrence as a  means

of  securing peace and stability for Singapore, but  we  have

also  invested  heavily in maintaining strong ties  with  our

neighbours  and friendly big powers.  These investments  have

paid  off substantially for Singapore as we now are  able  to

overcome the limitations of space by training overseas in the

friendly countries.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.10 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 11 has sharpened the way in which we look at

security  threats in this country.  We are coming to  realise

that  apart  from dealing with conventional threats,  we  now

have to deal with terrorism that, in itself, is a more subtle

and  insidious  form  of  challenge.   Terrorism  is  a  non-conventional  threat, ie, low in intensity  in  nature.   The

assault not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



can  come  in  the  form of flying jetliners  into  high-rise

buildings,  but can also take the form, as we  all  know,  of

biochemical and cyberspace attacks.  In this regard, security

requirements  call  not  only for  SAF  to  deal  with  these

challenges alone but on a comprehensive basis involving other

agencies  like  the  Police Force and SCDF  to  counter  such

threats.   Indeed,  the recent arrest of  "Jemaah  Islamiyah"

terrorists  and the neutralisation of these cells only  serve

to  remind us that such threats are real and are not confined

to distant lands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Tony Tan said recently that the demand for security

agencies  and  the terrorists are not equally  balanced.   We

require  our  security  agencies to succeed  in  looking  and

neutralising  these terrorist groups all the time.   However,

all  it takes is for these groups to succeed only once for  a

high profile statement of their intent to create chaos and to

instill  fear  and anxiety in our population.  Against  these

challenges,  I would like to ask whether the SAF  is  in  the

process  of broadening its spectrum of capability to  respond

to  such low intensity threats and challenges, and whether or

not  we  will  be  working closely with  the  other  security

agencies,  such  as  the Malaysians, the  Filipinos  and  the

Indonesians  have  done  recently to share  intelligence  and

information in order that we can more effectively  deal  with

such threats.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, Foreign Minister

Jayakumar,  GPC  Chairman Ong Chit Chung  and  my  colleagues

before  me  have  provided a good overview of  the  strategic

situation  in the region.  I just like to add one point  very

briefly  that,  although  the  situation  has  changed  since

September  11  and the US relations with China have  improved

and  the  regional picture is stable, there are still several

uncertainties that we have to bear in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as pointed out by Dr Ong, is the uncertainty over

whether  Indonesia can contain its separatist  pressures  and

the  agitation  of its increasing number of  Islamic  groups.

Second  is  the  uncertainty over the  future  intentions  of

China,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



whether it will assert itself more vigorously in this  region

in  the  future.   The third area of uncertainty  is  whether

there  will  be  US  military  action  against  Iraq  or  new

pressures on North Korea as part of its "Axis of Evil".  This

will  have  implications on the regional situation  here.   I

hope  the Defence Minister can give his sense of how regional

security will shape up given these uncertainties and MINDEF's

response to this new situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I join my GPC colleagues in asking

the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence in sharing

with   us  what  are  the  changing  security  and  strategic

situation  in the Asia-Pacific, in particular, the  state  of

the  tripolar relationship between China, Japan and  the  US.

What  are the existing relationship between Taiwan and China,

especially in regard to the Straits of China?  Also, what has

the  September 11 incident given rise to in the Asia-Pacific,

particularly given the increasing engagement of the Americans

in   many   of  the  Southeast  Asian  countries  to  counter

terrorism?   More  importantly, what  are  the  external  and

internal  challenges  facing  many  of  the  Southeast  Asian

countries,  and  how Singapore can respond to  this  external

environment,   particularly   the   security   and   military

environment that is fast changing in Southeast Asia?

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> The dispute over bilateral

issues  between Malaysia and Singapore has led  to  the  word

"war"  being bandied about recently from across the Causeway.

Such  talk of war should not be taken lightly, even if it  is

just  talk.  It could heighten tension and suspicion  between

the  two countries.  It could also give foreign investors the

wrong  signal  about  the stability of this  region,  already

troubled by terrorist threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in February, when the Malaysians were unhappy

over  our water supply agreement and the unhappiness  was  at

its  peak,  the retired General Zaini Mohamed Said  wrote  in

Mingguan Malaysia that the dispute over water supply was  the

"most serious" among potential regional threats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



to  Malaysia,  as  it could lead to war with  Singapore.   He

advised  that  the issue be handled carefully by  leaders  on

both  sides.  He also reminded Malaysians that the  Singapore

military  was  stronger  and more sophisticated.   Later,  in

another  column,  he  warned about a  "small  nation  with  a

powerful army" and said that Malaysia must prepare itself  to

give  any attacker "a bloody nose".  This phrase was repeated

by  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad last month when he  spoke

about  Malaysia's recent arms purchases.  He  said,  "We  are

buying  weapons  only for our defence.   Those  who  want  to

attack us, we promise we will give them a bloody nose."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia recently sealed its largest defence deal in a

decade  for  Russian and European missiles worth about  S$674

million.   It  signed several multi-million dollar  contracts

for  weapons, including a rocket-launching system, submarines

and tanks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans were not rattled by the war rhetoric or by

these  arms purchases by Malaysia because they were confident

of the capabilities of the Singapore Armed Forces.  Outsiders

have  also acknowledged that it is the leading military force

in  Southeast Asia and is a significant deterrent force.   We

should  continue upgrading our SAF and to give  the  men  and

women  of  our Armed Forces the support and recognition  that

they  deserve.  The people who make up our Armed Forces  make

an  enormous contribution to Singapore's place on  the  world

stage.  The budget allocated to the Defence Ministry is money

well spent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own view is that Malaysia and Singapore are unlikely

to  go to war, as long as strong and rational leaders prevail

from  both  sides.  However, a geopolitical setting  that  is

fluid  and  uncertain  in  itself  also  poses  a  threat  to

stability.   This is because countries will then  want  their

armed  forces  to be primed in such a way that prepares  them

for  worst-case scenarios.  While this psychological  priming

is almost inevitable, it is important



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



that  Singapore continues to widen and deepen  its  bilateral

and  multilateral  defence relations  to  promote  peace  and

stability  in  the  Asia-Pacific region.  Confidence-building

exercises are also important for managing the undercurrent of

tension and suspicion between regional states.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister  for Defence what is the state of defence  relations

with  Malaysia, and for an update of Singapore's  efforts  to

promote  regional  peace and stability  in  the  Asia-Pacific

region.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, September 11 has changed the

strategic landscape in Southeast Asia.  Terrorism is  global,

terrorism  is  elusive.   Southeast  Asian  nations  are  now

challenged  and  targeted  by  amorphous  terrorist   groups.

Unlike the open campaign previously against communist Vietnam

at  the height of the Cold War, it is difficult to ferret out

and combat elusive terrorists.  They seem to be everywhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister whether the SAF is ready and

has  contingency  plans for dealing with  outright  terrorist

attacks, hijacks, attacks on our computer information system,

chemical warfare and biological warfare.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Madam, post-September 11, the threat

of  global  terrorism  has been keenly  felt  throughout  the

world.  The JI arrests in Singapore showed very clearly  that

Singapore is very vulnerable to such threats and we  came  so

close  to  being a real victim of attack.  We know  that  the

Government has set up various coordinating structures between

relevant Ministries and has also enhanced protection for  key

installations.  I am sure that necessary policies  and  steps

are also being put in place to anticipate and neutralise,  or

otherwise deal with, such threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, what I am more concerned about is the preparation

of  our  population in the light of this changed setting.   I

firmly believe that, more and more, the effectiveness of  our

total defence strategy will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



lie in how well we strengthen the non-military defence areas,

even as we continue to strengthen our military defences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. The greatest harm that terrorism can

inflict on the people is not the immediate deaths and  damage

that  those terrorist acts exact.  It is the loss of  morale,

the  lingering uncertainty and fear associated with  tackling

an  enemy  that  is  in the shadows.  For  this  reason,  the

psychological resilience of the people is key to  a  nation's

response  to terrorism, and psychological resilience  is  not

something  that can be left to the armed forces  or  security

forces  alone.  It must involve different ways of  informing,

sensitising  and preparing the people for certain  scenarios,

without  frightening  them  and causing  undue  anxiety  that

backfires on public morale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that after the Prime Minister told us that some

of the escaped JI terrorists had wanted to hijack an aircraft

and  crash it into Changi Airport, a television station  went

to   interview  some  people  at  the  airport,   and   those

interviewed were Singaporeans who work at the airport or were

going  to  travel through the airport.  The general  response

was that they did not think that such a thing would happen to

Singapore,  because Singapore is such a safe place.   Another

person said that perhaps people would be more careful for the

first few weeks but, after that, it would be forgotten.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am not advocating paranoia. But this shows

that  much  more  needs to be done on a  sustained  basis  to

prepare our population to understand the new setting that  we

are in and to know what we can do as individuals, communities

and nation, to strengthen our resilience towards this threat.

I  would  like to ask the Minister if his Ministry  would  be

taking additional steps in this area.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Madam, this year, the defence budget is,

once  again,  way below the cap set at 6% of  the  GDP.   The

actual  amount is $7.69 billion.  In 2001, the actual defence

expenditure  was  $7.09 billion and, in 2000,  it  was  $6.56

billion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some may comment that we are overspending on

defence  and  see there is money spent without hard  tangible

benefits,  I beg to disagree with them.  Defence expenditures

play  a  key  role  in having a Keynesian multiplier  effect.

There are also externalities experience from the state-of-art

technologies developed and adopted in the defence  sector  by

organisations like the Defence Science and Technology Agency.

These  can have civilian applications and they can help boost

growth.   In  addition,  the  expenditure  also  creates  and

provides  jobs,  training and education to a  large  pool  of

people.   It  creates  jobs  in  the  marine,  aerospace  and

engineering  industries.  Finally and, most  importantly,  it

indirectly  supports the growth of the economy by creating  a

secure environment for trade and investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we are situated in a unique geopolitical

situation.   The  strategic  and  political  environment  can

change  rapidly and catch everyone off guard.   In  addition,

the  challenge  of international and domestic  terrorism  has

brought  a  new sense of realism that a threat can come  from

both  within and outside.  In the light of these developments

and   the  recent  resumption  of  arms  acquisition  by  our

neighbours, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister  for  Defence whether we are spending adequately  on

defence.   I  would  also like to ask him whether,  at  these

levels   of   expenditure,  we  are  able  to  maintain   our

qualitative and quantitative advantage against our  potential

aggressors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Madam, as a former member of

ACCORD, I benefitted tremendously in understanding SAF from a

close  range.  Last Saturday, I visited the Combat  Engineers

at Seletar, and I left the base even more reassured about our

SAF  and  our  defence capabilities.  Whether in  technology,

human   resource   development,  training   and   operational

considerations, I could see SAF's seriousness, efficiency and

determination in the security and defence of our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see some of our 18-20-year-old NSmen managing our

gigantic Bionics



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



Launched  Bridge evoked a powerful emotion in  me  about  the

inner strength of our SAF.  It convinced me that the increase

in  defence budget to ensure that Singapore is well  prepared

for the uncertainties of the future is well deserved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One challenge, however, is for the SAF to continue to

win  the  hearts of its soldiers and Singaporeans in  general

for  what  it  is  doing.   I  am glad  that  the  Government

continues to include NSmen in its offer of rebates for income

tax  and Singapore Shares and, now, the ERS.  Perhaps, it  is

also  time to review the modest allowances for our NSmen,  to

help instill a greater sense of belonging and service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I would like to urge the Ministry to review

its total defence programmes to ensure a better understanding

and rapport with the people.  It would be worthwhile also  to

see  how ACCORD could do more to bond the public and the SAF.

I  gather that Mindef is doing a lot of work in reaching  out

to  the people through the Discovery Centre and the Air Force

Museum,  and  I also look forward to the Ministry  having  an

Army  Museum.  That will help us to bond the people with  the

SAF further.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Madam, in recent years, the Singapore

Armed  Forces  have  participated in  a  number  of  overseas

operations  that  are not necessarily of a  training  nature.

Members will recall that we had a team in the early 1990s  to

help  with  the  peacekeeping efforts in  Namibia  and,  more

recently,   in  East  Timor,  where  we  not  only   provided

peacekeeping troops there but also logistics support that the

international troops require.  Such participation, one  would

suppose,  is necessary and even welcomed, as Singapore  takes

its  place  in  the  international community  and  plays  its

responsible part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, not all of our participation, unfortunately, is

peacekeeping in nature.  There were times when the SAF had to

undertake  missions that could well put our  soldiers'  lives

and  military assets at risk.  This took place when  we  flew

our soldiers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



into  Cambodia  in  1994  to  rescue  Singaporeans  who  were

stranded there in the aftermath of a coup.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While one would not have any objection in principle to

the   participation  of  our  armed  forces  in  humanitarian

missions,   one   would  wonder  whether  some  parliamentary

oversight  in  this  regard is necessary, especially  if  our

armed forces are committed to undertaking dangerous missions.

I can accept that there could well be missions where secrecy,

in  the  interest  of the state, ought to be  preserved  and,

accordingly,  are  not open to any form of public  debate  or

discussion.  On the other hand, there could well be  missions

that  are  not  time-sensitive and that  could  well  involve

commitment of our resources on an extended basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a situation, therefore, the question is whether

or  not Parliament should be the appropriate forum to discuss

the  merits  of our country's participation.  Should  we  now

define  more  clearly the situations in which the  Government

can  act  without the consultation of Parliament,  and  those

that  require  consultation  with  Parliament?   I  hope  the

Minister can enlighten this House on the matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, National Servicemen are

thankful indeed to the Government for increasing the  NS  tax

relief  by  50%, from $2,000 to $3,000 for active NSmen,  and

from $1,000 to $1,500 for inactive NSmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef has wisely chosen a national service armed forces

over  that  of a standing regular force.  All male  Singapore

citizens  know  that  they have to do NS,  and  there  is  an

element  of sacrifice involved.  If we do not bear  arms  and

defend our own country, no one else would, and Singapore will

perish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But NS allowances have been frozen for a number of years

and  have  not  been adjusted for cost of  living  or  rising

standards of living.  Many parents do fork out extras to  see

their  son through National Service.  I did the same when  my

two sons went through NS.  Do not mistake us.  Parents do not

grumble about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



such  things,  but it is high time that Mindef  reviewed  and

readjusted the NS allowances.  I am sure the morale of  NSmen

and their parents will go up.  Any other ways for recognising

the  services  and contributions of NSmen will also  be  much

welcomed.

NSmen  do their best for the country.  We should also do  our

best  for  our  NSmen.  I hope the Deputy Prime Minister  and

Minister  for  Defence will have some  good  news  for  NSmen

today, this being the 35th Anniversary of National Service in

Singapore.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Madam, even in National Service, there

is  time  for rest and recreation.  To help NSmen  use  their

time  wisely, could I suggest that we might consider  helping

NSmen  with  low educational qualifications to upgrade  their

educational  levels by encouraging them to take  examinations

as private candidates? For those who have actually done well,

perhaps opportunities to learn about entrepreneurship, social

skills or public speaking might even be encouraged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a different note, since National Service is such a

great  national  institution, activities that  might  promote

cohesion building, inter-faith and inter-racial understanding

might  also not be out of place during leisure hours.   On  a

different note, some of our young NSmen may also have started

families.   While  this  may not have  been  wise,  they  are

nevertheless in that position.  If they have young  children,

their  spouses  are  unlikely to be able to  seek  employment

outside,  because of the need to look after the  young  ones.

Could  we  perhaps be more generous to this  small  group  of

servicemen on a case-by-case basis?  In the same vein,  there

are those who come from families where, unfortunately, one or

both parents may have been retrenched recently.  The argument

that  our  existing  NS  allowances  are  only  meant  to  be

allowances for the individual NSmen may then not quite be  as

relevant.  Perhaps we could also help this group and be  more

generous to them, especially in cases of genuine hardship.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Madam, National Servicemen play a

critical  role.   In a small nation with a small  population,

these citizen soldiers are responsible for the protection  of

our  national sovereignty.  We live in a complicated part  of

the  world,  and  the  world itself  is  also  becoming  more

complicated.  Besides the stress of economic competition,  we

also  have  to  confront  the increasing  threats  of  global

terrorism, regional instability, piracy on crucial sea lanes,

not  to  mention  some  threats of "skinning".   Our  citizen

soldiers  know that they bear a heavy responsibility  to  the

country,  to themselves and their families.  They  know  that

only  when  the country is safe and secure will  there  be  a

basis for a better life for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises the sacrifice and

contributions  of our National Servicemen in  many  different

ways,  through  the work of bodies such as  ACCORD  and  such

policies as CPF top-ups and tax rebates, as mentioned  by  my

colleague.   The  Government has enhanced  the  standing  and

reward   for   our  National  Servicemen,  both  active   and

operationally ready over the years.  One of the most concrete

ways  for the Government to indicate its recognition  of  the

work and contribution of National Servicemen is to review the

allowances   paid  to  them.  Such  review  has   been   done

periodically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence, I believe, told the

media  very  recently, which I read in the  papers  that  the

Ministry  might  be  reviewing  the  allowance  for  National

Servicemen.   I  would like to ask the Minister  for  Defence

whether  such a review has been completed and,  if  so,  when

will the revised rates of allowances take effect.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Currently, our

young  men  are called up to serve national service  for  two

different  lengths of time.  Majority of our youths  serve  a

two-year  stint  in  national service, whilst  the  commander

grade  serve  another  six  months.   The  NS  system,  as  I

understand, had since then undergone some changes.  In  order

to  encourage our youths to be fit for NS upon enlistment and

thereby  cutting  time  that  otherwise  would  be  spent  on

building their fitness, the fitter of the lot is cut  by  two

months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that Mr Chiam has raised the issue of shortening

the  length of NS before in 1991.  Let me state that I am not

speaking in support of him. Rather, things then and now  have

changed so much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the September 11 incident, I appreciate

the  heightened concern over security.  It might be  untimely

to  bring this up now but I feel the length of NS, especially

that  for  a better-educated youth, might be reviewed  for  a

shorter period.  I have two reasons for my proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the advent of modern technology in warfare has

rendered conventional warfare almost obsolete.  Wars  are  no

longer fought and won based on territorial occupation and the

use of numerical forces.  The recent Afghan War is a case  in

point.  My point here is this.  The development and advent of

information  technology is very significant in  the  way  our

security forces can be and is organised.  Wars are fought and

won   sometimes  even  without  seeing  your  enemies.    The

efficiency and battle-readiness of a defence force  need  not

be compromised with the reduction of troops.  There is lesser

and lesser need for a large standing army.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second and, more importantly, allow me to argue for the

enhancement  of our youths' competitiveness in the  light  of

global competition for talent.  Our young talents suffer from

an   uneven   competition  compared  to  their   counterparts

elsewhere who do not have to serve NS.  Our youths  join  the

workforce  mostly in their mid-twenties.  I  have  seen  many

times  where  our young graduates are much older  than  their

foreign counterparts in university.  Not only that, they  are

also  saddled  with  debts which they have  to  service  upon

graduation.   I wonder what is the opportunity cost  to  them

and  to  the Singapore economy as a whole.  I also wonder  if

perhaps  that  is  the reason why we are so scarce  of  local

entrepreneurs.  I also feel that we owe our NS youths,  after

the  contribution of their prime time of their lives  to  the

country, the duty to enhance their economic value as much  as

possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can allow those fitter NSF men to serve a shorter

stint,  can we not then have an overall review of the  length

of our NS?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Madam Chairman, I thank the Members of

Parliament for their relevant comments on defence  policy  on

the  SAF.  I will deal with some of the points that have been

raised  so  far.   My  colleagues, the  Second  Minister  for

Defence,   the   Minister  of  State  for   Defence,   Senior

Parliamentary Secretary for Defence will then deal with  some

of the other points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has embarked on a process of self-examination.

Since  our independence in 1965, we had a business plan which

enabled us to achieve significant progress and success in our

economy.   But  times  change, and the fundamentally  changed

circumstances now require us to re-examine our business  plan

and  the  way  we  do things.  In short, we  have  to  remake

Singapore.   We have to restructure our economy  and  address

pressing  social issues ranging from social cohesion  to  the

implications of a low birth rate and an aging population.  As

part  of  the process of change, we must expect that some  of

our long-held policies will have to be updated or revised  to

meet the new challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we rethink and debate the economic and social

policies  that  will make Singapore the  best  home  for  our

people,  one thing remains constant, and that is the absolute

importance  of a strong defence for Singapore.  A  prosperous

economy  and a vibrant society must be supported by a  strong

security foundation if it is to continue thriving.    Without

security,  without a strong defence, there  is  no  guarantee

that Singapore will continue to survive, let alone thrive, as

an  independent, sovereign nation.  I am therefore  heartened

to  note  the  resounding support which all the Members  have

expressed  this  afternoon for maintaining a  strong  defence

force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now comment on the point which Dr Ong Chit Chung

has brought up as to whether Singaporeans will pull



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



together  when  there is crisis.  During the  debate  on  the

President's   Address  last  month,  Dr  Vivian  Balakrishnan

stirred  up a minor controversy, both within and outside  the

House,  when he related in Parliament the question which  his

11-year old son asked him:  "If there is a war, why should we

fight  for  Singapore?"  This  is  not  a  trivial  question.

Neither  is  it a question that should not be  asked.   Every

generation  must  confront this question.   Every  generation

must  decide  for themselves why they should be  prepared  to

fight and, possibly, to die for their country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patriotism is an emotionally charged subject. It stirs

up   the   most   fundamental  emotions  and   reactions   of

Singaporeans, and this is rightly so.  One does not  talk  of

war  lightly.  Neither is war a subject simply to be  debated

in   Parliament  or  in  the  correspondence  pages  of   our

newspapers.  Given the terrible consequences of war, going to

war  is  the  most serious and fundamental decision  which  a

country  has to make.  When to go to war, how to go  to  war,

whether  the  circumstances dictate a need for a  country  to

resort  to war, these are fundamental issues which no  leader

and  no  Singaporean can treat lightly with glib  remarks  or

clever rhetoric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patriotism has different meanings for different

individuals.   Patriotism is something that  must  come  deep

from  within each individual.  Patriotism cannot be  mandated

or  forced.   In  deciding why one should  be  patriotic  and

willing to fight for one's country, different people will  be

motivated  by  different  reasons.  For  example,  Dr  Vivian

Balakrishnan's son concluded his conversation with his father

by  telling  Vivian  that  he,  ie,  the  son,  would  defend

Singapore  because this is his home and his  family  and  his

friends are here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the House, a Singaporean who lives in Canada

posted a note to the Straits Times Interactive to say that if

war  were  to  break  out, he would fly  back  to  fight  for

Singapore simply because he wanted "to fight for my home,  my

family  and friends".  Another writer, Mr Teh Peijing,  wrote

to  the Straits Times and this is what he said, "In my  case,

my main motivation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



for  fighting in the event of a war would be my friend Norman

as well as other colleagues of mine.  And I believe that this

is  the case for most Singaporeans serving in the SAF:   that

they  would  fight mainly to be there for their  friends  and

comrades  in  arms with whom they have shared  sweat  on  the

training  grounds of the SAF."  The reasons I have cited  are

good  and  powerful motivations for people to be prepared  to

fight for Singapore should the need arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering this subject, I think that it is also

helpful  to  ponder the reasons why people  are  prepared  to

leave their country of birth to settle in another country  to

make a life for themselves and their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khaw Boon Wan and Ms Irene Ng are two such

individuals.  Both born in Penang, highly educated,  able  to

settle anywhere in the world, both of them decided that their

destinies would lie with Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Khaw Boon Wan and Irene Ng are persons of ability

and  drive.  They could have had successful careers in Penang

or,  if they wanted to leave their home town, they could have

settled  in  the  countries in which they  had  their  higher

education  -  Khaw Boon Wan in Australia,  and  Irene  Ng  in

England, for a higher degree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Australia and England are bigger countries than

Singapore.    Both  of  them  have  larger   economies   than

Singapore's.  Both have more land, certainly in the  case  of

Australia.   For  talented  and determined  individuals,  the

prospects of a successful career could be better in Australia

or England than here, in Singapore.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we ask ourselves: why then should Khaw Boon Wan and

Irene  Ng decide to throw in their lots with Singapore?   The

answer,  in  my view, lies in the values which both  of  them

identified as the core strengths of Singapore:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Meritocracy and Fair Play;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Equal Opportunities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Clean Government; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Racial and Religious Tolerance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Khaw Boon Wan said, and I quote, "these core values

have  been fundamental tenets of our nation for the  last  40

years."   The core values constitute the Singapore Cause  for

which  Khaw  Boon Wan was prepared to leave his  hometown  to

settle  and  build  a future for himself and  his  family  in

Singapore.  Of all the core values, meritocracy is central to

the realisation of a Singapore nation as we know it.  As Khaw

Boon Wan said, "Meritocracy is a powerful idea."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene Ng expressed the same sentiment in her words:

"Meritocracy  is one of our founding principles,  so  is  the

principle  of  equality of treatment and  non-discrimination.

We  must  make  it clear that discrimination based  on  race,

religion, gender, age or national origin is not tolerated  in

Singapore.  We must give each individual and each  group  the

confidence  and  hope that they have equal  opportunities  to

realise  their aspirations, even if unequal outcomes are  the

result.   We cannot guarantee success, but we must  guarantee

equality of opportunity."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she valued these principles, Irene Ng said:

"This  is  why I left Malaysia for Singapore when  I  was  16

because  this country offered me the opportunity to  live  my

life  based  on  these  principles.  I became  a  Singaporean

because I wanted to be a part of a country that upholds these

principles."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chairman, the principles on which our nation is

founded  -  Meritocracy and fair play;  Equal  Opportunities;

Clean  Government; and Racial and religious tolerance  -  are

embodied in this small island of 680 square kilometres, which

all  of  us call home, because Singaporeans believe in  these

principles and are prepared to defend them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building on the principles and core strengths, we have

created  a  prosperous and thriving country that is  able  to

give  a  decent standard of living to all its  citizens.   We

have gained international respect as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



a nation, that may be small by physical standards, but we are

a   nation   that  stands  by  our  principles  and  beliefs.

Singapore  is a nation that has often been cited as  a  model

for other countries to emulate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not small achievements. The Singapore in

which  we  live  today  is a large  achievement.   It  is  an

achievement which all Singaporeans can justifiably  be  proud

of.   And  not  only  be proud of, but also  be  prepared  to

defend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that so many Singaporeans have sacrificed their

time  and  disrupted their careers to serve  our  country  in

National Service; the fact that Singaporeans of all races and

ages  strongly support the building of a strong SAF; the fact

that  Total Defence is not an empty slogan in Singapore,  but

an important concept taken seriously by all Singaporeans; all

these are evidence that Singaporeans value Singapore and  all

that  Singapore stands for.  So, when the question is  asked:

"If there is a war, why should we fight for Singapore?", I am

confident  that,  whether  or not  they  can  articulate  the

reasons,  Singaporeans will rally to defend our country  and,

if  necessary,  make the ultimate sacrifice to  preserve  and

uphold  the  principles and values which  we  hold  dear  for

ourselves and for our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the security situation in our

environment, a topic which has been commented on  by  Dr  Ong

Chit Chung, Ms Irene Ng and Mr Ravindran.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. Members have noted, the need for security

has  in fact taken on even greater importance.  Last year,  I

told  the Committee of Supply that there was more uncertainty

in  the  regional  security environment.  Developments  since

then  have  made the security environment even  more  complex

than  any  of  us could have imagined just a  year  ago.   In

particular, the threat spectrum has greatly expanded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now all too familiar with the threat of a new

type  of  terrorism  which is called catastrophic  terrorism.

This has injected greater uncertainty when the region has yet

to fully recover from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



economic  downturn  and  the socio-economic  dislocations  of

political  leadership transitions.  As Members  have  pointed

out,  unfortunately,  this  new threat  is  not  some  remote

problem somewhere in another part of the world.  We have  all

seen  the  chilling scenes of the surveillance by  the  local

Jemaah  Islamiyah terrorist network.  We have heard of  their

plans to construct 7 truck bombs - 3 tons of ammonium nitrate

each  -  21  tons altogether.  It requires 1 ton of  ammonium

nitrate bomb to demolish the building in Oklahoma City in the

US.  Imagine how horrific the consequences would have been if

these  extremists had managed to pull off their plans to  set

off these bombs in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides catastrophic global terrorism, there are other

non-conventional threats that we have to be vigilant against.

We have to continue to be alert to these security challenges,

certainly at least over the next few years.  The much greater

political  and  social instability in  our  region,  and  the

economic uncertainty, have also raised the potential of  what

is  called Low Intensity Conflict.  In 1998, for example,  we

experienced an upsurge in illegal immigrants trying to  enter

Singapore.  Fortunately, our firm response quickly put a stop

to  this flow.  But many security threats are trans-border in

nature, and international borders are porous.  The impact can

also be far-reaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Singapore is vulnerable, and we must be prepared to

meet  such  security  challenges as they arise,  whether  the

problem be illegal immigrants, piracy, cyber-attacks or other

forms  of  terrorism  from  sources  other  than  the  global

terrorist networks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the House that these newer

threats, while dangerous, and we have to tackle them, are not

in  place  of,  but they are in addition to  our  fundamental

security  concerns that we have faced since our  independence

in  1965, and which lie at the heart of our very existence as

a sovereign, independent nation.  The circumstances of how we

became  independent brought us to the quick realisation  that

our highest priority as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



nation  must  be to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial

integrity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore felt very vulnerable then in the 1960s.

Today, we no longer feel as vulnerable because we now have  a

significant  defence capability.  But we must remain  acutely

aware  that the external environment is not as benign  as  we

may  wish  it to be.  We must remain very conscious  that  we

must  have  the wherewithal - the will and the  muscle  -  to

safeguard  our  security, and to ensure that we  will  always

have  the  space to act according to our own best  interests,

and not succumb to pressure by others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A credible defence capability is absolutely critical for

the  prosperity of Singapore.  We learned the  bitter  lesson

from our experience in World War II.  And we continue to  get

frequent reminders from the example of other countries  which

fall  prey  to hostile forces, because they could not  defend

themselves,  as well as on many occasions, from  the  hostile

rhetoric and speeches of politicians in other countries  that

we  frequently hear.  Sometimes there is even talk of war, as

has been mentioned by some Members today.  We need a credible

defence  force to ensure that talk of war remains talk,  just

mere rhetoric, and no one is tempted to go beyond rhetoric to

take  action  which  directly threatens our  sovereignty  and

territorial integrity and our vital interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chairman, from the debate on the Estimates of the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and from the comments of Members

just now, Singaporeans, all of us, are all too aware that our

relations  with  our neighbours go through frequent  ups  and

downs.   It  is a roller-coaster ride.  We are likely  to  go

through more of such cycles in the years ahead.  This is  not

something  of  our choosing.  It is more profitable,  and  we

would  much  rather focus on cooperation  in  all  sectors  - economic, cultural, education, even security - which  can  be

of  mutual benefit and help to strengthen relations.  And  we

are  always  looking  for such opportunities.   But  we  must

always  make sure that should the mood turn nasty against  us

and demands are made of us on a host of issues as has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



happened,  and will happen from time to time -  we  have  the

confidence  to ride out the storm, not to react hastily,  but

not  to  knuckle  in under any pressure.  And  the  SAF,  the

Singapore Armed Forces, gives us that confidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a few words about our Defence Policy. Members have

sought  assurance  that  our defence policy  is  adequate  to

ensure  Singapore's security in the face of the  spectrum  of

threats that we could potentially have to deal with.  I thank

Members  for  pointing  out the need  to  maintain  and  even

increase  our defence Budget, as some Members have suggested,

so  that we will be able to deal effectively with the  threat

of  terrorism  and  low  intensity conflict  in  addition  to

conventional military threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chairman, we have always given, and will continue

to  give, the highest priority to security and defence.  Over

the  years, we have put in consistent effort, investment  and

sacrifice  to  build  up  the  SAF.   Today,  the  SAF  is  a

technologically-advanced   and  operationally-ready   defence

force.   The  SAF's capabilities were not built up overnight,

neither was it built up by sudden spurts in defence spending.

Each  of our operational capabilities is the result of  long-term   planning,  a  well-considered  acquisitions  strategy,

structured training, and systematic maintenance.  And we have

been  able  to  do  so because of our policy  of  maintaining

defence spending at a steady rate, up to a maximum of  6%  of

GDP  each year.  I commend Mr Ravindran and Mr Zainul  Abidin

Rasheed  for  saying that we should ensure that defence  gets

the support from Government that it needs.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capability development programmes sometimes require

spending  commitments  spread over  many  years  -  from  the

acquisition of new weapons systems and training of operators,

to  sustaining research and development and periodic  upgrade

programmes  for the enhancement of mature systems.   To  keep

such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



a  defence  capability  in good, sharp condition  requires  a

sustained long-term commitment, and I am indeed gratified  by

the  commitment which Members have expressed  today  for  our

defence effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mdm Chairman, even as we continue to enhance

deterrence,   we  are  fully  aware  of  the  importance   of

encouraging  friendship and cooperation with other  countries

and  other  armed  forces - both in the  region  as  well  as

further  afield.  We know that the stability of our  security

environment  can  only  be  preserved  by  countries  working

together  -  a  point  made  by several  Members  today.   So

deterrence and diplomacy form the twin pillars of Singapore's

defence policy.  We have strong bilateral relationships  with

many  countries, from many of which the SAF benefits  greatly

in  the  form  of professional interactions,  and  access  to

training   facilities  and  defence  technology.    We   also

contribute,  as best as we can, to multilateral institutions,

such as the United Nations, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and the

Five  Power  Defence Arrangement, because these  institutions

provide  an  important layer to the security architecture  in

the  region.   One  particular area where the  SAF  has  made

contributions is in UN peacekeeping missions.  Currently,  we

are  involved in the peacekeeping missions in East Timor, the

Kuwait-Iraq border, and the Ethiopia-Eritrea border.  I would

like  to  assure Members that only SAF regulars are  sent  on

such  UN  missions.  National Servicemen are deployed  on  UN

peacekeeping missions only if they themselves volunteer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word on the point brought up by Mr Sin Boon Ann about

Parliament and our defence policies.  There is no doubt  that

Parliament  is  the highest body in the land.   All  policies

implemented by the Ministry of Defence must be in  line  with

the laws passed by this Parliament, and with the Constitution

of  Singapore.  The Ministry of Defence reports to the  Prime

Minister   and  the  Cabinet  who  are  in  turn   themselves

accountable to Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words about the issue of counter-terrorism and

counter-low intensity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



conflict,  a point brought up by Mr Sin Boon Ann and  Dr  Ong

Chit  Chung.  They have asked about our ability to deal  with

the  threat  of  terrorism and low intensity conflict  (LIC).

Let me assure the House that the SAF has the capabilities  to

deal  with what the military terms as OOTW (Operations  Other

Than War).  These capabilities of the SAF have been developed

over the years and they are constantly being upgraded as  the

situation demands.  For the threats of low intensity conflict

and  global  catastrophic terrorism, we are fully aware  that

while  the SAF may have the capabilities, the military  alone

cannot  effectively counter such threats.  The SAF  needs  to

work  with other Government agencies in Singapore.   This  is

not  new, as we have long had inter-agency efforts to  tackle

various  security issues, especially between the SAF and  the

Home  Team.   For  example,  MINDEF,  the  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs,  the  Ministry of Health and  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment have been working together for many years on bio-chemical  defence.  The Navy and the Police Coast Guard  have

also   worked  together  for  many  years  to  stop   illegal

immigrants coming to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realised that the inter-agency efforts need to be

tightened  and  strengthened when the nature of  the  threats

changed and the threats become more real, as a consequence of

the deteriorating political and socio-economic conditions  in

the  region.   Our national security apparatus has  therefore

been  beefed  up  to  deal with possible contingencies.   The

National   Security   Secretariat  and  a   ministerial-level

committee,  chaired by me, as the Minister  for  Defence  and

known  as the Security Policy Review Committee, were  set  up

with  the  objective  of  providing a swift  and  coordinated

response to non-conventional security threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the need for coordination and integration of our

efforts  became even more urgent after the event of September

11  last year.  The threat of terrorism now requires a  level

of  intelligence,  of monitoring, and of  response  which  is

quantitatively  and qualitatively different  and  many  times

more  demanding than what our system - or any system  in  the

world -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



has  so far been geared to handle.  So we have put into place

a  comprehensive crisis response and management structure  to

meet  the new requirements.  This system is constantly  being

refined and enhanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorist threat is not unique to Singapore. Other

countries in our region have uncovered terrorist cells linked

to  the  Al  Qaeda terrorist network.  While Southeast  Asian

countries  deal  in  their  own  ways  with  the  threat   of

terrorism, to their security, all of us recognise the need to

cooperate to combat this common enemy.  One area where  there

has   been   useful  cooperation  is  in  the   exchange   of

intelligence.   At  the  beginning of this  year,  the  Joint

Counter-Terrorism Centre was created to integrate Singapore's

multi-agency intelligence efforts as well as to serve as  the

point  of  contact  for  counter-terrorism  intelligence  cooperation among friendly countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been able to adapt to the new security

environment  -  swiftly and with confidence - in  large  part

because  we  have  Total Defence.  When the Jemaah  Islamiyah

group  was  uncovered in December and the  rest  took  place,

Singaporeans were neither gripped with fear nor paralysed  by

panic.   Our  people could withstand the jolt to  our  social

fabric and take this threat in our stride.  Singaporeans also

had  the  confidence that the security authorities, including

the  SAF, could deal with the contingencies and safeguard our

security.   Singapore remained unshaken  as  we  have  strong

foundations in Total Defence - Psychological Defence,  Social

Defence, Economic Defence, Civil Defence and Military Defence

-  and we must continue to strengthen this, as pointed out by

Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Zainul Abidin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go on to the topic of National Service which has

been  commented  on by Dr Ong Chit Chung, Dr Warren  Lee,  Mr

Zainul  and Mr Heng Chee How.  The Government, as I said,  is

fully  committed to providing for Singapore's  security,  and

Singaporeans,  by  and  large,  support  this  commitment  to

defence.   It  is  a commitment which goes beyond  supporting

spending on defence to serving National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



Service.  Our young men have to commit 2-2 1/2 years of their

lives,  starting from the age of 18 years old, and thereafter

commit a few weeks a year to service in the SAF.  And, should

Singapore actually come under threat, they may have  to  make

the ultimate sacrifice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1967, about 600,000 of Singapore's sons have

pledged  the  Oath of Allegiance to protect  and  defend  our

nation.   We  are now into the second generation of  National

Servicemen  -  young  men following their  fathers  into  the

service of our country.  This year marks 35 years of National

Service.  NS is a national institution.  NS has become a rite

of  passage  for Singapore men.  Shared NS experience  brings

together  Singaporeans  from  different  social,  racial  and

religious backgrounds in the common mission of defending  our

homeland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have noted, the economic progress and

stability we enjoy today are possible only because we have  a

defence  capability and security, and our defence  capability

is  possible only because of the dedication and sacrifice  of

our  National Servicemen.  They form the backbone of a strong

and  capable  SAF.  As citizen soldiers, National  Servicemen

have  to balance the demands of their civilian lives  and  NS

duties.   This  involves commitment and no  small  amount  of

sacrifice.   It has therefore been a matter of  priority  for

MINDEF  to  give  recognition and show appreciation  for  the

contributions   of  our  National  Servicemen.    MINDEF   is

committed  to implementing the recommendations of  the  Third

Committee  to  Recognise  the Contribution  of  Operationally

Ready  NSmen to Total Defence (or RECORD III).  Indeed,  many

of  the  recommendations have already  been  implemented  and

MINDEF is actively working on the implementation of the other

recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond this, MINDEF has been conducting an in-depth

review  of  our  NS system and policies.  This review  covers

many issues, affecting both full-time and operationally-ready

National  Servicemen.  They include examining ways to  refine

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



NS training system, improve NS management and administration,

and  enhancing  the NS experience overall.   The  review  was

supplemented by comprehensive surveys of National  Servicemen

and  studies  of other foreign conscription systems.   A  key

consideration was that any changes, as a consequence  of  the

review,  must  not  undermine the operational  readiness  and

effectiveness of the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One focus of the MINDEF review was on NS allowance.

Before I go into the details of the changes, which I will now

announce, let me reiterate some of the fundamental principles

of  the  NS  allowance.  National Service is a  duty  to  the

country.   National  Service is not a regular  salaried  job.

Full-time   National  Servicemen  are   therefore   paid   an

allowance; they are not paid market wages.  The NS  allowance

is meant for basic personal upkeep, given that most full-time

National  Servicemen stay in camp, where accommodation,  food

and clothing are provided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these principles, the NS allowance will be

restructured   and  streamlined  to  reflect  the   different

responsibilities undertaken by our National Servicemen.   The

revised NS allowance will comprise two main components - rank

allowance   and   combat  allowance.   Those  in   leadership

positions   will   receive  a  higher  rank   allowance,   in

recognition  of the responsibilities they have  to  shoulder.

The  combat allowance will be paid to National Servicemen  in

combat  vocations, to recognise the onerous nature of  combat

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision will result in a significant increase in

the  NS allowance across all ranks.  For example, the monthly

NS  allowance for a Recruit will increase from presently $240

to  $350.   A  Corporal in a combat job will receive  $520  a

month (up from $330), a Third Sergeant will receive $660  per

month  (up  from $420) and a Second Lieutenant  will  receive

$970 per month, instead of $650.  MINDEF will also raise  the

additional allowances given to operationally-ready NSmen  who

hold key or command appointments.  This is in recognition  of

the vital leadership roles which such servicemen play and the

additional responsibilities they are asked to shoulder.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised NS allowances will be implemented as from

1st  July this year, in conjunction with the 35th anniversary

of   National  Service.   More  details  on  the  revised  NS

allowance  will be given by MINDEF in a press  release  which

will be issued after my speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, the NS review is still in progress. We

are  now  looking  into the operationally-ready  NS  training

cycle  and  examining  ways  to  improve  NS  management  and

administrative  efficiency.   I  thank  Members   for   their

suggestions  and I assure them their views and comments  will

be  taken  into account.  I hope to announce the  outcome  of

these reviews later this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words on the length of National Service, a point

touched  on  by Dr Chong Weng Chiew.  The length of  National

Service  is determined by the time required to train our  men

to  a  level of military proficiency where they can not  only

handle their personal equipment but also fight effectively as

an  integral  part  of a large military  formation  -  up  to

battalion, brigade and division level.  The aim is to  ensure

that  the  SAF  is operationally ready and  effective.    The

process  has to be thorough and robust, so that our men  have

the   confidence   to   fight  and   win,   when   necessary.

Technologically sophisticated weapons and equipment  increase

the  potency  and  firepower  of our  soldiers,  sailors  and

airmen.  They can reduce the need for manpower in many cases.

But  it still takes time to master these weapons and to learn

how to employ them effectively, both individually and as part

of  an  integrated larger fighting force.  This is  something

that we cannot compromise on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that MINDEF would not want

Singaporeans to spend more time than necessary to  carry  out

their  National Service duties, because we are acutely  aware

of the commitment and the sacrifices they have to make.  This

is  something  that  we are also carefully  studying  in  our

review.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, let me conclude by saying that few, among

our  older generation, will ever forget the tumultuous  years

in  the  early  years of our history.  It is a  testament  of

Singapore's success that our children have known  only  peace

and  progress.   But we should never forget that this  is  in

large  part  because  we  have put considerable  effort  into

building  up  our defence capabilities.  We have peace  today

because  generations of Singaporeans have put in considerable

sweat and sacrifice to make Singapore safe and secure through

National  Service.   But  once our defence  capabilities  are

eroded,  it  will not be long before we feel vulnerable  once

again and  our security is put at risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we remake Singapore to meet the challenges of the

future,  as  we  must, let us not take defence  for  granted.

Only  when  we have guaranteed our security, can we guarantee

that Singapore will have a future.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, can you take your two cuts

together, please?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Mdm Chairman, compared with other

armed  forces,  SAF is small.  But, with technology,  it  can

pack a powerful punch, maximising intelligence, mobility  and

firepower.   Technology is the SAF's trump card  in  ensuring

success  in  its  strategy of deterrence and,  if  deterrence

fails,  in overwhelming the enemy with superior mobility  and

firepower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid technological advances over the last 30 years

have  led to what is termed a Revolution in Military  Affairs

(RMA).  Revolution in Military Affairs is broadly defined  as

a  military  revolution in which the entire  armed  force  is

transformed and renewed in terms of technology, organisation,

strategy, tactics, training, doctrine and logistics.  The RMA

evolves   around  three  advances.   First,   in   terms   of

intelligence gathering, using sensors in satellites, aircraft

or  unmanned aircraft, which can monitor virtually everything

going  on  in  an  area.  Second, in processing  intelligence

through   advanced   command,  control,  communications   and

computing  systems, known as C4, making  sense  of  the  data

gathered by the sensors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



and  displaying  it  on screen for target selection.   Third,

acting  on  the intelligence, for example, by using precision

missiles to destroy enemy targets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new warfare would be multi-dimensional, ie, air, sea

and   land   operations  would  be  increasingly  integrated.

Information and outer space would also be part of the  modern

war.   Another  important  element  of  RMA  is  "information

warfare",   disabling  enemy  by  wrecking   his   computing,

financial,  telecoms  or  air  traffic  control  system  with

viruses,  or  electromagnetic  pulses.   There  is  indeed  a

serious  concern  that the "information strike"  could  crash

one's computer system in the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most serious problem for those who espouse the RMA

is  that  enemies  could counter or copy the capabilities  so

generated.    Every  breakthrough  in  offensive   technology

eventually  inspires an advance in defence.  My  question  is

whether  SAF  is exploiting technology fully to give  it  the

cutting   edge   and  updating  its  strategy  and   doctrine

accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, SAF has been involved with UN peacekeeping

operations for a number of years.  Recently, we have sent SAF

combat  teams, as DPM has said, for peacekeeping missions  in

East  Timor,  besides  medical and support  group.   In  this

context, I wish to ask the Minister for his assessment of the

performance of our SAF contingents and the lessons  we  learn

from such missions overseas.  What are the reactions or state

of  morale of our troops in such missions? Are there plans to

continue  to  send  SAF  teams to  East  Timor  or  to  other

peacekeeping missions elsewhere?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mdm Chairman, I will deal with Dr Ong's question on

peacekeeping and the Minister of State, Mr Cedric  Foo,  will

deal with the subject of technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 900 SAF personnel have participated in UN

peacekeeping missions around the world over the past dozen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



years.   Today,  there  are about 75  SAF  officers  and  men

serving in three such UN missions - UNIKOM at the Iraq-Kuwait

border,  UNTAET in East Timor, UNMEE in Ethiopia and Eritrea.

SAF  officers  also  regularly  participate  in  multilateral

peacekeeping  seminars  and training  programmes  where  they

learn  from  as  well  as  share  the  SAF's  experience   in

peacekeeping with other armed forces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to East Timor, SAF peacekeepers, as well as

Singapore Police force personnel, were sent to support the UN

efforts to bring peace and stability back to East Timor.   We

have  contributed to the international missions in East Timor

in  both  INTERFET  and UNTAET.  Peace and stability  in  our

region is important for Singapore's security, and we are glad

that we are able to make our contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the SAF has a platoon of peacekeepers in

Fohorem in the western sector of East Timor, near the border.

The  deployment will soon go into its third rotation  of  six

months.   Our platoon is deployed as part of the New  Zealand

composite  battalion, which includes contingents  from  Fiji,

Ireland  and  Nepal.  I visited our men  in  Fohorem.   Their

morale  is  high  and  they are doing their  job  well.   The

deployment  is progressing well and we have had good  reports

from   the  UNTAET  Headquarters  in  Dili  on  the   platoon

professionalism and operational readiness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has gained useful peacekeeping knowledge and

experience from this deployment in East Timor.  Singapore has

committed  to  continue  with our  current  deployment  of  a

platoon of peacekeepers until this November.  The UN Security

Council  is  expected shortly to endorse the details  of  the

composition and size of the peacekeeping force which will  be

established in East Timor after its independence day on  20th

May.  This will be UNTAET's successor mission, the UN Mission

of  Support  in East Timor (UNMISET).  When the  details  are

announced, Singapore will assess the situation and  determine

what  size force we will contribute.  Our objective, as  with

all our commitments to UN peacekeeping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



operations,  would be to participate in a manner  whereby  we

can make a useful contribution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng):</b> Mdm Chairman, I would like to thank the hon. Member,

Dr  Ong Chit Chung, for raising the question about the use of

technology  in the SAF.  I want to assure him and Members  of

the   House  that  the  words  RMA  (Revolution  in  Military

Affairs),   CA   (Comprehensive  Awareness),  C4I   (Command,

Control,  Communications and Computers and Intelligence),  PS

(Precision  Strikes), and so forth, are  words  that  we  use

everyday in MINDEF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has, from its earliest days, recognised the

critical importance of technology in helping us overcome  our

constraints in manpower and other resources.  Technology acts

as  a force multiplier by enhancing the capabilities and  the

firepower of the SAF.  We have seen the devastating power  of

technology  in  the war in Afghanistan.  In  modern  warfare,

indeed,  the  odd favours the side that makes better  use  of

technology;  the side that can integrate platforms and forces

into  a unified, flexible and effective fighting system;  the

side that can see better and further on the battlefield;  the

side  that makes informed decisions more quickly, strike with

greater accuracy and from further afar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A larger number of troops is indeed no longer enough to

win  modern  wars.  A strong capability in defence technology

is  also  critical  for the quality of our training  and  the

effectiveness of our equipment.  As a national service  armed

forces,  it  is vital that if ever our men have  to  go  into

combat,  they go with the confidence that they have  superior

training and superior equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has been making a steady and significant

investment  of  resources over the years to give  the  SAF  a

strategic  technological  edge.  First,  we  have  helped  to

develop  the  local defence industry.  Today,  the  Singapore

Technology   group   undertakes   activities   ranging   from

manufacture to full life cycle support of weapon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



systems  and equipment for the SAF.  This group of  companies

also  upgrade as well as develop advanced weapon systems  for

the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indigenous capability, which we cannot buy, is very

important  to  the  SAF.  We have also built  up  a  pool  of

engineering and scientific talent and develop our  capability

in  defence  R&D.  DSO National Laboratories  is  the  single

largest  R&D organisation in Singapore.  We also do extensive

collaboration    with    local    and    overseas    research

establishments.   Locally, there have  been  many  successful

collaborative  projects  with NUS,  NTU  and  other  research

institutes.   Overseas, our partners include the  US,  France

and  Sweden.  Such collaborative efforts allow us to leverage

on  the capabilities and resources of others, so that the SAF

can  be  at  the  leading  edge in meeting  the  increasingly

sophisticated and complex demands of modern warfare.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spend roughly 4% of our defence budget on R&D. This

does  not  include money spent on the development of  upgrade

programmes   and  indigenous  systems.   Such  a   commitment

underscores the importance we attach in ensuring that the SAF

has  the edge over potential adversaries.  This is a critical

element of our deterrence policy.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, would you like to withdraw your

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, I wish to thank the Deputy

Prime Minister and the Ministers for their full answers  and,

in  particular,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  the  very

generous increase in NS allowances.  I am sure this  will  be

very  much appreciated by all NSmen.  On that note, I am also

assured that our defence and security are in good hands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Warren Lee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Mdm Chairman, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Singapore Armed Forces spend considerable

sums of money to provide realistic training opportunities for

its  combat  troops.   The medical  corps  of  the  SAF  also

performs a crucial function during operations and even during

peacetime,   to  preserve  life  and  reduce  suffering   and

morbidity.  I urge the Ministry of Defence to explore the use

of   sophisticated  training  mannequins  and  computer-aided

programmes   to   improve  training   realism   for   medical

vocationalists in our army, especially at the level  of  both

active and NS battalions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be necessary for sophisticated mannequins to

be  used at all times.  A mix of sophisticated and simplified

training aids may be all that is necessary.  To echo Minister

of  State,  Mr  Cedric Foo, perhaps we could  even  get  some

indigenous capability in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is on NSmen memorial. On the occasion of

the  35th  Anniversary of National Service  in  Singapore,  I

would urge the Minister for Defence to consider some sort  of

national  memorial to celebrate the institution  of  National

Service.   This  memorial  should not  only  commemorate  the

sacrifices of our NSmen and their family members, but  should

also celebrate the role of National Service in Total Defence,

nation  building and in promoting racial harmony.  It  should

perhaps  celebrate the citizen-soldiers' dual role in society

and  also reflect the SAF's role, not in having had to  fight

for  freedom, but as a powerful deterrent and guardian of our

national security.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mdm Chairman, I thank

Dr  Lee  for his comments and his questions.  If I may answer

the  second question first, because MINDEF and the SAF  place

great  importance  on the topic raised by  Dr  Lee,  and  the

topics   of   training  and  the  contribution  of   National

Servicemen are close to our hearts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a word about training. National Servicemen in

the  SAF undergo rigorous and realistic training.  To enhance

proficiency and operational readiness, the SAF conducts  many

local  and  overseas exercises.  Despite  the  high  training

tempo,  the SAF has maintained a good, in fact, an  excellent

training  safety record.  This is due to the strong  emphasis

placed on safety at all levels within the SAF.  The challenge

is  not  to  avoid  training but to pro-actively  manage  our

training activities to minimise risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are detailed safety procedures for every training

activity   in  the  SAF.   These  procedures  are   carefully

disseminated to all soldiers involved.  Before each  training

activity,  ground  commanders  systematically  identify   the

potential risks, using a risk assessment matrix, what we call

the RAM.  These risks are then managed through measures, such

as   safety   briefings,  close  supervision,   precautionary

actions,  and rehearsals and rehearsals prior to  the  actual

exercises.    In   addition,  safety  audits  are   routinely

conducted  to  ensure that the highest safety  standards  are

maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years, there have been very few

accidents  and  deaths involving National Servicemen  in  the

SAF.   However, we recognise that every death, every accident

is  just  one too many.  MINDEF's priorities in dealing  with

training-related accidents and deaths are 3-fold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, is to avoid such fatalities wherever

possible.   We, therefore, emphasise training safety  without

compromising training realism and operational standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, MINDEF investigates every incident thoroughly

to  avoid  similar situations being repeated in future.   For

every  case, an inquiry involving third parties is  involved,

swiftly convened to examine the circumstances leading to  the

accident  and  recommend  any improvements  to  the  training

system.   The findings are reported to the highest  level  in

MINDEF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we help the bereaved family deal with the grief

and come to terms



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



with  the death.  In this respect, MINDEF has a comprehensive

system  in place to provide prompt assistance and support  to

the  family.   Unit  commanders and professional  counsellors

keep  in close contact with the serviceman's family.   MINDEF

also  gives  the family financial assistance and compensation

payment, where applicable.  The serviceman will also  receive

a military funeral, if requested by the bereaved family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee asked MINDEF and the SAF to also recognise the

contribution  of National Servicemen, indeed, the  spirit  of

National  Service.   Every year, on 1st July,  SAF  organises

what we call an SAF Day Parade.  This is a very important and

solemn  occasion.  The occasion is to mark the importance  of

the   contribution  of  National  Service   as   a   national

institution,  and the contribution of National Servicemen  to

national security.  In addition, a minute's silence  is  also

observed, to pay tribute to the National Servicemen who  have

lost their lives in the course of duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with your indulgence, I will repeat the citation

made  before  the 1-minute silence.  The MC of  the  occasion

will say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr President, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen,

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the SAF has not been called to battle, precious

sons  of  Singapore have lost their lives in  the  course  of

service  in  the SAF.  Let us observe a minute's  silence  to

remember our comrades-in-arm."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF believes that these are meaningful and solemn

recognition of National Servicemen who have lost their  lives

during training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on to Dr Warren Lee's cut on the use of

simulators and CAI packages for medical training in the  SAF.

Computer-aided   Instruction  (CAI)  packages   and   medical

training  simulators are currently used by the SAF School  of

Military Medicine and by SAF's Specialist Medical Centres  to

enhance the training of medical personnel.  They are selected

to  provide  the appropriate pedagogic technique relevant  to

the   provision  of  medical  knowledge,  as  well   as   the

development of individual and team-based medical skills.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Military Medicine has implemented the use

of Computer-Based Training (CBT) courseware in the CAI centre

since 1996.  Since then, more than 30 hours of computer-based

training courseware were developed in-house and by commercial

vendors.   Our approach is to source and acquire commercially

available  software packages to provide professional  medical

knowledge  and training, while developing packages  for  SAF-specific  medical operations systems and team-based  training

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF Medical Corps recognises the usefulness of

simulators  for  enhancing  the  realism  and  efficiency  of

medical  skills  training.  The medical  simulators  used  in

training  for  individual  technical  skills  include  simple

anatomical models and intravenous infusion trainers  for  use

by medics, and more complex models for training in in-patient

intubation.   A  variety  of  full-size  and  weighted  human

mannequins,  to simulate the weight of the real patient,  are

also now extensively used to simulate casualties during field

training of medical units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Military Medicine has also procured six

sets of advanced patient simulators, what we call the SMM-MAN

this year.  These have just been procured and they are state-of-the-art  simulators (mannequins).  These  full-size  human

models  are  equipped  with  sophisticated  components   that

simulate  clinical signs and symptoms, and they are  able  to

provide  highly realistic training for a variety  of  medical

conditions.   The  mannequins allow the trainees,  medics  as

well   as   the   doctors,   to  perform   specific   medical

interventions,  and  these  mannequins  provide   real   time

feedback  for the trainees through a change in the  patients'

clinical parameters, and these parameters can be observed  on

a  monitor.   These simulators are presently  being  used  to

provide  a  high degree of realism in our paramedic  level  3

training and advanced trauma life-support courses.  In  time,

we  will  provide  these  courses  to  our  NS  medics.   Our

intention  is to continue extending the employment  of  these

simulators  for the medical team training as we gain  further

experience in their use.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the Chief Medical Officer to host a visit

for  the  GPC  members to take a look at how  the  School  of

Military Medicine incorporates CAI and CBT courseware in  the

training of doctors and medics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I have your permission to take the two cuts

together?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will have to propose the question.

Please proceed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> The recent spate of

terrorist  activities  in  the world  and  the  detention  of

Singaporeans suspected of terrorist activities last  December

underscore the critical importance of having strong  homeland

security measures.  Our home, in such a case, is actually the

frontline  when  we  deal with terrorism.   The  dangers  are

enormous and the damage can be catastrophic, as was the  case

we   have  seen  in  the  September  11  incidents.    I   am

particularly  relieved, and I am sure  that  members  of  the

public will also be very reassured, that the Ministry of Home

Affairs and, in particular, the Internal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>



Security  Department,  had  been able  to  identify  would-be

terrorists,  and to stem the danger before such  an  incident

could arise.  I think this is a particularly reassuring thing

for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the recent December 2001 detentions of

terrorists,  it  is quite clear that ISD has been  doing  its

job.  I believe they were monitoring the potential terrorists

for some time before they were forced to take action, due  to

the  imminent dangers that they were causing.  So I  am  sure

that the Ministry of Home Affairs will be able to assure  the

public  that this level of surveillance, in fact, an enhanced

level of surveillance, will continue.

Of  course,  terrorist  attacks, if they  do  take  place  in

Singapore, would be felt much more strongly in such  a  small

country  and  with  so  many vulnerable  places  packed  with

people.   And, now, since terrorist activities take  so  many

forms,  we  basically  have  to  take  extra  precautions  to

safeguard  the  interest and security of our  people.   I  am

sure,  today, the public would like to know how the  Ministry

of Home Affairs, together with agencies, intend to protect us

from terrorist attacks.

<br>6.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least four areas relating to homeland

security that I would like to touch on.  First, I would  like

to  ask the Minister whether the Ministry, together with  the

other  departments, is prepared for any terrorist  who  might

want to use biological agents to attack us.  Do we, first  of

all,  have  the  expertise  and,  secondly,  have  sufficient

medical  supplies  to respond to such an  attack?   Have  any

studies  been  done  so far, for example,  of  what  sort  of

medical  needs will be required, in a big bomb explosion,  an

anthrax attack or something of that type?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of security measure in homeland security

is,  of  course, the border and port security.  Now, with  an

enormous  number  of people moving in and  out,  particularly

through  the  Causeway  everyday,  how  vigilant  are  we  in

equipping our border police and port



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



security   in  determining  whether  or  not  such  terrorist

suspects are coming in?  Are we confident that we can keep an

eye on such people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is environmental and energy security. We

know that the Government has, of course, done a good job over

the  years  to  safeguard  important installations,  such  as

telecommunications networks and so on.  But, naturally, power

stations,  etc, would also be targets for terrorist  attacks,

and  I am sure that there are plans in place to protect  such

vital  installations.  My question is not so much in relation

to  physical  facilities that I am interested in.   I  wonder

whether   we   have  measures  in  place  to  safeguard,   in

particular, sensitive electronic information, such as in  the

financial  sector and other forms of information  of  digital

communications  of MINDEF and MHA, whether these  are  secure

from  terrorist attacks through the Internet or  through  the

use of computer viruses and so on.  Are we confident that  we

can  be sure that such terrorist attacks would not bring  the

whole digital networks of vital installations down?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second cut relates to the role of the community in

homeland security.  I think there is no question that without

the  participation,  without the  consciousness  of  all  the

members  of  the public in Singapore, we cannot have  a  high

degree  of homeland security, no matter how hard the security

forces  can  try.   The  demands  of  homeland  security  are

increasing,  due to the current development  in  this  world.

The  primary question I want to ask in this respect is:  will

the Minister tell us how the community can play a more active

role in combating terrorism and crime?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention that in the World War II, we

have  heard  of  homeland security groups  in  a  variety  of

countries.   In  England,  they  were  partly  satisfied   by

something  called the "Dad's Army", that is to say  that  for

men  and women who cannot participate at the frontline,  they

would   stay   at   home   to  man  security   installations,

neighbourhood  watch groups and so on.  I think  it  is  high

time that, in Singapore, we had a dedicated volunteer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



force,  maybe a citizen corps, to be trained and  to  provide

immediate  assistance to major disasters caused by  terrorist

attacks.   If the majority of men are already engaged  in  NS

duties,  may  I  respectfully suggest that we  encourage  our

women folk to do their national service in this way and  play

a more active role in the defence of the nation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this type of citizen force can be created, we hope

that  they will play supporting roles, like being trained  as

paramedics,  for  example, to administer  drugs,  to  perform

first  aid  in  times  of  crisis.  Volunteers  may  also  be

enlisted to help play an important role in instilling  public

awareness  and  educating the public  on  the  management  of

emergency situations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, many of them have already joined the

neighbourhood   watch   groups  to   report   on   suspicious

activities, but I think we can do more.  Many of us  live  in

fear  of terrorism.  However, part of the fear is created  by

the  fact that we do not know what sort of dangers or in what

form  terrorism can come.  It is very important that we  have

some  form of public education, so that members of the public

will  not  be  taken unawares and will know how to  react  in

times of emergency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to say this. I believe that

homeland    security   requires   a   highly    sophisticated

intelligence  network, not only through  intelligence  agents

collecting  information or high-tech intelligence  gathering,

which  I  am sure is done by the professional services.   But

more  often than not, it is public giving information on what

they  regard as suspicious activities.  I think that will  be

the  key to helping us combat terrorist activities.  In  this

regard,  I also hope that this sort of citizen force will  be

trained in basic skills and recognising suspicious characters

or recognising something out of the ordinary among neighbours

or  whatever.   I do not mean to encourage a vigilante  force

which would give rise to a lot of complaints about neighbours

and so on.  I do not mean that.  But I do mean that we need a

bit  more education for our citizens to understand that there

may be situations where they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



would  feel  that there are some danger involved  in  certain

activities, and they would be prepared to report this to  the

relevant  authorities.   As  an  example  of  this  type   of

reporting, I must say that I was very impressed with the fact

that  in  the  United States, for example, now  they  have  a

website where one can actually put in information for the use

of  intelligence services, so that the intelligence  services

can then follow up to see whether there are dangers involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will clarify whether such a force

can  be  useful in combating terrorism and also in  enhancing

homeland security.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Madam, first of all, I would like to

start   off  by  paying  tribute  to  the  Internal  Security

Department for its fine work in breaking up the plot  by  the

13 terrorists last December.  I think it would have certainly

been a terrible disaster for Singapore if the terrorists  had

gotten  their way.  The unveiling of the plot has brought  to

the surface a new kind of threat to our country, and that  is

why  I call it an unconventional threat.  Previously, we have

been  prepared for different kinds of disasters.  I  remember

that   we   have  also  run  exercises,  simulated  emergency

situations and our community is generally quite well-prepared

to deal with any incident that may arise.  But terrorism is a

different thing.  It is a different kind of threat to us  and

I  would like to know what steps the Ministry of Home Affairs

has in place to mobilise the community in case a disaster  of

this nature should occur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read that the Ministry has in place a committee called

the  National  Emergency System (NEST).   I  would  like  the

Minister to provide us with more details as to what  NEST  is

doing,  how  it  intends  to educate the  population  of  the

dangers of unconventional threats, and to what extent can the

community  leaders and the community be involved  in  dealing

with a situation that may arise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Chairman, I intended to ask the

Minister whether our Home



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



Team  has the capability and is prepared to address chemical,

biological  and  other  conventional threats.   However,  the

Senior Minister of State, in an answer to a Question for Oral

Answer earlier this week, had already told the House that the

Home  Team has the capability and is prepared to address  any

unconventional threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would just like to ask what measures have

been taken or are being planned to prepare the population  in

the  form of public education or national exercise on how  to

react in the event of a chemical or biological incident.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Madam, I had intended to ask the

question  of  how  the  Home  Team  intends  to  involve  the

community   more   directly  in  exercises   in   connection,

especially  with  the preparation to tackle  the  threats  of

terrorism.  I want to say that the Senior Minister of  State,

in  reply  to an Oral Question raised in an earlier  session,

had  addressed some of those concerns.  I would just like  to

echo  the questions raised by my colleagues earlier  on  this

subject, and I look forward to more details being provided.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yatiman, you have three minutes.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Madam, I would like to join my colleagues in

expressing  our gratitude to the Internal Security Department

in  handling the JI incident in Singapore and the  threat  of

terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent arrests of the JI members in Singapore have

proven  that  Singapore is far from free from the  threat  of

terrorism.   The  threat is global and  the  network  can  be

regional or international, thus making the protection of  our

home  ground  even  more  complicated  and  difficult.    For

Singapore,  unlike other countries with no  hinterland,  with

high concentration of population in an urban area, the threat

of  terrorism  is  real  and can be devastating.   We  cannot

imagine  if a bomb planted in Yishun MRT station did explode,

you can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



calculate  the extent of injuries, fear and devastation,  not

only  to  the community in that area, but to the security  of

Singapore,  as well as our image as a country  that  is  free

from threat of terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, we have to be more vigilant because the

network  of  terrorism is well embedded in this  region.   As

Members  are  aware, Abu Sayyaf is a growing  threat  in  the

southern  Philippines,  Al Mauna, KMM,  JI  Malaysia,  Laskar

Jihad  in  Indonesia, Jemaah Islamiyah - they all  form  into

networks  that can reach Singapore one day.  My question  is:

how  could our security agencies prevent Singapore from being

the   target  of  such  threats,  and  how  could  we  ensure

investors,  tourists and, most important, Singaporeans,  that

such threat will not be a reality here?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 7.00 pm.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mdm Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to report

that the Committee of Supply has made further progress on the

Estimates  of  Expenditure for the financial year  2002/2003,

and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.
