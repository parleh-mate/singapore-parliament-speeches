<div align="center"><b>(Exploitation of job-seekers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Labour and Welfare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



whether  he  is aware that some private employment

exchanges  in Singapore are exploiting  employment

seekers, and what does he propose to do about such

concerns.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am aware of one recent

case  in  which four aggrieved employment  seekers

made  a  report  to the police which  led  to  the

arrest  and  conviction of  a  man  who  had  been

operating a private employment agency. I have good

reason  to  believe  that  although  some  private

employment  agencies are long  established,  there

are  others which exist only to exploit employment

seekers.  I  am  looking into the  possibility  of

introducing  new legislation under  which  private

employment  agencies can be effectively regulated.

However, most of the bogus agencies which  exploit

the  unemployed are mushroom growths,  here  today

and gone tomorrow. The remedy in such cases is not

new  legislation but for the intended  victims  to

make  early  reports to the police so that  prompt

action  can  be  taken  against  them  under   the

existing law.

<div align="center"><b>LEGAL AID AND ADVICE ORDINANCE, 1956</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Implementation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Labour   and  Welfare  whether  he  will  make   a

statement  on the implementation of the Legal  Aid

and Advice Ordinance, 1956.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the implementation of the

Ordinance is dependent on the recruitment  of  the

necessary  staff, particularly of  a  Director  of

Legal  Aid.  Applications  for  various  posts  in

Superscale Grade F of the legal service closed  on

4th March and candidates have been interviewed  by

the Public Service Commission. It is expected that

it will be possible to appoint one of the selected

candidates to the post of Director of Legal Aid by

the end of this month. As soon as this appointment

has  been  made, implementation of  the  Ordinance

will follow step by step.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> How many steps and how long for

this  measure which had the unanimous  support  of

this House and which is a year old?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> As many steps as are necessary

to implement this Ordinance in order to enable the

smooth  running of a law which was passed  a  year

ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Do I understand that the Minister

does not know how many steps are necessary and has

not  provided for the period during which it  will

be   necessary  for  it  to  be  brought  to  full

implementation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am aware of the many steps

required, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS OFF CHRISTMAS ISLAND</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether   the   Singapore  Government   has   been

consulted by, and/or has made representations  to,

the  British  Government  with  reference  to  the

latter Government's intention to carry out nuclear

explosions based on Christmas Island.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> The answer is no, Sir. The

Member for Cairnhill will be aware that there  are

two Christmas Islands and that the tests are to be

based  on  the one in the Pacific which  is  6,600

miles  from  Singapore, and this is  further  from

Singapore  than  the North Pole  is.  Perhaps  the

Member  for  Cairnhill is feeling  a  bit  anxious

because the Christmas Island in question is nearer

to the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The Member for Cairnhill is not

aware,  Sir,  that  distance  has  any  particular

effect in respect of the very grave disturbance to

the  human person by these explosions, and I would

like   to  understand  from  the  Chief  Secretary

whether  he considers the 6,600 miles to  be  such

adequate  protection  that  there  is  to  be   no

representation on behalf of the human  beings  who

comprise this island's population? No answer -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That last remark must be

withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I  understand that no answer is sometimes  a

very  eloquent reply; but if you rule that  it  is

unparliamentary, I withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Did I understand the Member for

Cairnhill to use the word "elephantine"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> "Eloquent reply", Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I beg the hon. Member's pardon.

<div align="center"><b>CHINESE SCHOOL GRADUATES EMPLOYMENT IN PUBLIC</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SERVICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Appointment of Inter-departmental Committee)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  he  will  appoint  an  inter-departmental

Committee   with   a  view  to  making   available

opportunities for employment in the Public Service

of graduates of Chinese Middle Schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is no.

The  Government have already decided to  accept  a

Pass  in  the Government examinations for  Chinese

Senior   Middle  School  third-year  students   as

equivalent to the Cambridge School Certificate for

the  purpose of entering the civil service.  There

is   therefore  no  need  to  appoint  an   Inter-departmental Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, is the Chief Secretary

informing  this House that, in fact, there  is  no

need  to investigate the posts available for  this

particular type of candidate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on 30th March

Government issued a statement listing many of  the

posts  which  are eligible now for Chinese  Middle

School third-year students. Additions to the posts

are being investigated and consultations are still

going on with other departments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> That is not what I mean, Sir. We

know that there has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>



been this White Paper, but what I am suggesting is

that  if  there is an Inter-departmental Committee

with  this particular aim in view - for the purposes

of  investigating what posts are available or  can

be made available - then we can proceed at a greater

pace.  Sir, and with more precision in respect  of

the enrolment of these new applicants.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Cairnhill  ought  to  lead up to  a  supplementary

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The question is this: Would the

Chief   Secretary  not  agree   that   an   Inter-departmental  Committee would be  of  considerable

assistance in this aim?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think it

would  be  essential to have an Inter-departmental

Committee.

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Amendments to grant personal relief)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Financial

Secretary what steps he has taken, or proposes  to

take,  to  amend the Income Tax Ordinance  with  a

view  to  granting personal relief to  an  income-taxpayer   who  supports  his  parents,  brothers,

sisters or relatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Financial Secretary (Acting)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Sir, a proposal of this

nature  requires  consideration on  a  pan-Malayan

basis. This is one of the many questions that  are

constantly  engaging my attention. I am  sure  the

hon.  Member  will not wish me to  anticipate  any

statement  that I might wish to make at  a  future

date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Why not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Have there been any

consultations with the Malayan Government  so  far

on this question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Financial Secretary (Acting)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> I have nothing further to

add, Sir.

<div align="center"><b>CHINESE SCHOOL GRADUATES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Research into employment opportunities)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Education what research, if any, his Ministry  has

made into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



question of employment opportunities for graduates

of Chinese Middle Schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Ministry of Education has carried out a survey  of

a  good  cross-sectional  view  of  the  Singapore

commercial    and   industrial   communities    to

determine:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Methods of recruitment and standards

required of recruits;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Appraisement and criticisms of the products

of the Singapore education system in relation

to the commercial and industrial needs of the

community; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Suggestions for adjustments or improvement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Can this House expect, Sir, a

White Paper on the results of these researches, or

at least publicity given to them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I can assure this House that

publicity  will be given to it, but  not  a  White

Paper, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DENTISTS' PETITION ON USE OF PATENT MEDICINES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Health  what  decision  he  has  reached  on   the

petition  of Class "B" dentists about the  use  of

patent medicine.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

received no petition from Class "B" dentists about

the  use of patent medicines. There are, in  fact,

no  such  dentists as Class "B". Neither is  there

any   restriction  against  the  use   of   patent

medicines  outside the Poisons  Ordinance.  I  had

however  received  a petition from  the  Singapore

Chinese  Dentists Association asking that Division

II  dentists  be  allowed  to  use  certain  anti-biotics,  sulfonilamides,  penicillin  cones   and

analgesics.  A  reply was sent  to  them  on  10th

September, 1956, stating that Government regretted

that  it  did  not  propose to legislate  for  the

withdrawal of the amended rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member may perhaps have in mind a

petition  addressed to the Chief Minister  with  a

copy to me. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>



should  like  to  make it clear that  the  Poisons

Rules  are  specific in denying  all  Division  II

dentists  the use of certain poisons that  include

anti-biotics, sulfonilamides, penicillin cones and

analgesics.  There is no restriction  against  the

use of patent medicines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Was there a copy of the

petition,  sent by the Singapore Chinese  Dentists

Association addressed to the Chief Minister,  sent

to the Minister for Health?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> A petition from the Singapore Chinese

Dentists Association was sent to me and there  was

another petition sent to the Chief Minister with a

copy addressed to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, has the

Minister  taken  any action on the petition  which

was  referred to as having been addressed  to  the

Chief Minister dated 4th March, 1957?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I think I have given an answer to

that.

<div align="center"><b>NUCLEAR TESTS - EFFECT ON HEALTH AND FOOD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Health whether he will make a statement as regards

the possible effect on the health of the people of

Singapore  and their food supply of  the  proposed

nuclear  tests by the British Government based  on

Christmas Island.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it that what

the hon. Member intends to ask is in reference  to

the  proposed  nuclear tests  based  on  Christmas

island  by the British Government - an island which,

as  has  already been pointed out, is 6,600  miles

away  and farther from Singapore than is the North

Pole. I might add that there are several countries

such  as  Australia,  New  Zealand.  Hawaii,   the

Philippines and even the Californian coast of  the

United  States of America which are far nearer  to

the  centre  of these experimental tests  than  is

Singapore,  and  apparently  no  anxiety  for  the

welfare of their peoples has yet been expressed by

them.  Russia has been exploding atom and hydrogen

bombs  at  distances nearer to Singapore  than  is

Christmas Island in the Pacific,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>



and this question might well be addressed to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the danger of possible effect on the

health  of the people of Singapore and their  food

supply,  I  can do no better than quote the  reply

given  by  the  Prime Minister  in  the  House  of

Commons  who  would naturally have the  advice  of

experts competent in these matters before he  made

the  statement which I now quote from Hansard, 7th

of June, 1956. The Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These [tests] will take place during the first

half  of  1957  in a remote part  of  the  Pacific

Ocean. The explosions will take place far from any

inhabited  islands  and  the  tests  will  be   so

arranged   as  to  avoid  danger  to  persons   or

property. The tests will be high air bursts  which

will   not  involve  heavy  fallout.  All   safety

precautions  will  be taken in the  light  of  our

knowledge and of experience gained from the  tests

of other countries."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st April, 1957, the Prime Minister stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So far as our own tests are concerned, I have

been   asked  to  say  that  there  will   be   no

perceptible radiation outside the test area.  This

is my answer. I am satisfied that from the medical

and  biological point of view that  the  radiation

effects of this explosion will be insignificant."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on 2nd April, 1957, the Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that the nuclear explosion takes place

in  areas remote from populated territories and an

adequate danger area is declared for the period of

the  tests,  any localised deposit of radio-active

matter  so diffused by the normal dispersal action

of  currents  and winds as well as by the  natural

decay of the bulk of radio-activity emanating from

the explosion, any possible danger to human health

is negligible. Radio-active contamination of fish,

marine plants and sea-weed can occur, only in  the

immediate  vicinity of the explosion. The  chances

of any contamination going outside the danger area

or  continuing after the termination of the danger

period   is  negligible  in  the  case  of   tests

conducted  by the United Kingdom. There should  be

no  contamination of fish from the high air bursts

proposed for our forthcoming tests."



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The Minister has just come back

from  Japan, Sir. Is he aware of the deep  anxiety

of  the millions of Japanese people in respect  of

these  nuclear tests? Furthermore,  Sir,  I  asked

what  effect on the food supply of Singapore  will

these tests have? Do we get fish from that area?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I am quite aware of the anxiety of

the  Japanese  in  connection with  these  nuclear

tests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> And they are fools!



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> As regards the food supply, I have

given  the  only  answer that is possible  in  the

circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.  May  I  ask  the Minister  for  Health  what

qualifications the Prime Minister of Great Britain

has to make these weighty statements?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> He is our boss.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> As I said, Mr Speaker, I am

confident that the Prime Minister was sufficiently

briefed  by  men more competent to deal  with  the

subject.

the  confidence  of  the Prime Minister  of  Great

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



whether he will present to the House a White Paper

on  the Milk Plant offer by Australia to Singapore

under the Colombo Plan.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, Sir. I do not consider

the  publication of a White Paper will  serve  any

useful purpose since I have already issued a Press

statement   setting  out  the  reasons   why   the

Government has had to refuse the kind offer of the

Australian Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Is the Minister aware, Sir, that

the  people  are deeply angered by his taking  the

food  out  of the mouths of babies and putting  it

into the mouths of pigs, and why cannot this House

be  entrusted with an examination in detail of the

accounts  which he says render the  acceptance  of

the gift uneconomical?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

aware  that  the people are deeply angered  by  my

taking  the food out of their mouths. I  have  not

received  any  petition signed by  the  people  of

Singapore. If the Member for Cairnhill  can  claim

to  represent some people of Singapore, we on this

side  of the House can claim to represent probably

14 or 15 times more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already stated, Sir, I have in a Press

statement given all the reasons why we have had to

refuse this offer by the Australian Government.  A

White Paper would only serve to bring to light the

haste in which the offer was accepted in the first

instance  without proper reference to experts  and

to  finding  out  the implications  and  financial

involvement that would be brought about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is the Minister aware that the

people  of  Singapore  are greatly  relieved  that

Australian dried milk producers are not  going  to

make  money out of Singapore by selling dried milk

to that milk plant?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware

that  the people of Singapore are greatly relieved

because they are not going to be burdened  with  a

$2  million  recurrent expenditure a  year.  I  am

however not aware of the reasons given by the hon.

Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> is the Minister aware, Sir, or

will he inform the House whether it is true that a

commercial concern retailing milk in Singapore has

been  fighting  the acceptance of this  gift?  And

will  he tell us why, since this gift was accepted

under  the  Colombo Plan and a statement  made  in

respect thereof in this Assembly, he is ashamed to

produce  a  White Paper for the scrutiny  of  this

House?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I am not ashamed to

produce  a  White  Paper. I  do  not  consider  it

necessary to produce a White Paper. When the offer

was  accepted, the hon. Member, who was  then  the

Minister  for Commerce and Industry and the  Chief

Minister,  did  not put up a White Paper  to  this

House at that time. This is a gift. The acceptance

of the gift does not warrant the publication of  a

White Paper, and the refusal also does not, in  my

opinion, warrant the publication of a White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the first part of his question - that a

commercial firm has been fighting for  us  not  to

accept this gift - I am not aware of that fact,  and

I deny that there has been any pressure brought to

bear  on  Government  by any  commercial  firm  or

private enterprise to reject this offer. The offer

has been refused purely on financial grounds. I do

not  consider that it is fair, when we  have  such

heavy  and  urgent  demands on  our  finances,  to

commit public revenue to the extent of a couple of

million  dollars  per year on a  project  which  I

think  will  not have much demand. The milk  which

this  scheme  will  turn out will  not  find  much

demand in Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE POLYTECHNIC (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>10.31 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  the  Singapore   Polytechnic

Ordinance  was  an Ordinance to  provide  for  the

establishment of the Singapore Polytechnic and for

matters  connected therewith. When that  Ordinance

was drafted, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



authorities  in  Singapore  knew  little  of   the

workings of such institutions and naturally sought

experience  from  other  territories   where   the

experience  of  those territories themselves  were

setting  up  establishments of the same  kind  and

therefore  had  little  to offer.  But  conditions

elsewhere  were not the same as those in Singapore

nor  was  it possible to foresee at that time  the

changes which only experience of working under the

terms of the Ordinance would show to be necessary.

The  present Ordinance sufficed only to  establish

the  Board  of  Governors to enable them  and  the

Board  to  plan the buildings and to  recruit  key

members   of   the  staff  but   it   has   become

increasingly   apparent   that   amendments    are

necessary  if  the  Board is to continue  to  work

efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments which this Bill seeks to make are

listed  very clearly and simply in the Explanatory

Note and I think it is unnecessary for me to dwell

in  detail upon them. I would merely mention that

the  work  of  the Board is at present handicapped

because  all  decisions had to be  taken  at  full

meetings  of the Board. It is important especially

that provision should be made for the constitution

of  sub-committees to which certain powers of  the

Board  could be delegated. This provision is  made

in  clause 3 of the Bill which by an amendment  to

section  5  of  the original Ordinance  gives  the

Board  the  power  to make the necessary  by-laws.

Sir,  I  move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.33 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

only  one  point  I wish to make  regarding  this

Bill.  At  first sight, it would appear  to  be  a

matter of detail but if we take similar provisions

in  the Education Bill into account, it is clearly

a  matter  of  Government policy. I refer  to  the

provisions  to  revoke appointments in  paragraphs

(e) and (f) of clause 2. Paragraph (e) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chairman and other members appointed by the

Minister  under  subsection (2)  of  this  section

shall, unless the Minister shall otherwise direct,

hold office for a period of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



four   years   and   shall  be   re-eligible   for

reappointment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the Minister may at any time

revoke such appointment."



<br><br>There  is a similar provision under paragraph  (f)

for  persons or bodies appointing members  to  the

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can see no good reason why appointments

once  made  for a period of four years  should  be

subject  to  revocation  at  any  time.  Once   an

appointment  is  made,  the person  so  appointed,

should feel that he can settle down and do the job

of  work for which he has been appointed. It is  a

system  on  which we work in this  House.  However

much  Members  on  this side may regret  that  the

present  Government can remain in office for  four

years,  the Government is entitled to that  period

and  we  feel  that  the same sense  of  stability

should  be  given to members of the  Board.  I  am

aware that the Explanatory Note 2 (b) states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amendments to section 4 provide, for appointing

bodies   to   have  the  power   to   revoke   the

appointments of members of the Board who have  not

satisfactorily represented their interests."



<br><br>Now,  whether  or not my hon. Friend the  Minister

for   Education   in  the  last  two   years   has

satisfactorily  represented the interests  of  his

electorate  is  a  matter of  opinion  but  he  is

entitled  to sit in this House for better  or  for

worse for a further period of two years. I see  no

reason why the Chairman of the Board should not be

equally immune from summary dismissal. The proviso

implies  that  if the Chairman does  not  toe  the

Minister's  line, he could be sacked and  it  also

implies  that the Minister has poor confidence  in

his  own selection. Furthermore, if there  were  a

general  election and a change of government,  the

Chairman could be dismissed and replaced  by  some

favourite  of the new Minister. The same  argument

applies  to  the appointments made by the  various

bodies  and  conditions would  arise  which  could

seriously  affect  the  smooth  running   of   the

Polytechnic and an educational institution  should

be outside the play of politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are dangerous provisos. If it is felt

that there is an argument against appointments for

four years, then let us reduce them to, say, three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



years  but  do not let us run the risk  of  making

these  appointments open to the  abuse  of  whims,

factions and patronage.



<br><br>10.37 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, to me, this

Singapore  Polytechnic has been  a  long  time  a-borning  and all I want is to see that it gets  on

with  the  job. I must confess I had  not  studied

with  the care indicated by the Member for Tanglin

although   I  did  notice - I  noticed   with   some

surprise - similar provisions in the Education Bill.

I  would  like  to say, Sir, that  the  objections

taken   by  the  Member  for  Tanglin  have   very

considerable  validity  and  I  would   draw   the

attention  of the House to the provisions  of  the

principal  Ordinance  (the  Singapore  Polytechnic

Ordinance,  Chapter 204), section 4 (3)  of  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chairman and other members appointed under

subsection  (2) of this section shall  unless  the

Governor shall otherwise direct hold office for  a

period of four years and shall be eligible for re-appointment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the persons first appointed under

paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of subsection  (2)  of

this section shall hold office for a period of two

years."



<br><br>There is no provision whatsoever in section 4 of a

power  to dismiss. I think the Member for  Tanglin

says  rightly  when he says that  this  is  a  new

policy - a policy of dictatorial power being  sought

by the Ministry of Education which is particularly

blatant  in the Education Bill. I cannot  see  the

necessity  for this excessive executive  authority

and,  before I concede it, despite my anxiety that

the  Polytechnic  should get on with  the  job,  I

would  ask the Minster to satisfy this House  that

this  provision  is, in fact,  essential  for  the

efficient working of the organization.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> In reply, Sir. I am gratified

that  the Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall)  and

the  Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) have pointed out

this   provision  in  the  Ordinance.   When   the

Polytechnic  Board of Governors and other  similar

bodies  held meetings, it was usually  found  that

some of the members did not attend such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>



meetings  and I may draw the attention of  Members

to  other legislation where the same provision  is

also  provided,  that  is,  the  appointments   of

certain members may be revoked at any time; but  I

would assure the House that it is not intended  to

appoint  members  because they have  patronage  or

that  the  members  appointed  to  such  statutory

bodies   should  be  favourites  or   friends   of

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pointed out in my speech earlier that because

of  the  handicap now in the Ordinance  the  Board

found that they could not carry on with their work

efficiently    and   amendments   therefore    are

introduced   to   implement  the   work   to   the

satisfaction of not the Ministry but of the public

whose anxiety is expressed here and elsewhere that

we  should get on with the Polytechnic and that we

should  have the buildings and recruit the  staff;

and  in  order  to  have them we must  have  these

amendments  to the Bill so that the sub-committees

appointed  by  the Polytechnic Board of  Governors

could carry out the executive functions. It is, in

fact, essential.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of information, Sir. Is

the  Minister aware of the provisions of clause  2

(8)  of his Bill which states that a person absent

for  three  consecutive meetings  shall  forthwith

cease  to  a member? Consequently, the  reason  he

gave has no validity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> There are other reasons also.

in writing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, the amendment is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, all I wish to say is

that  subsections (8) and (9) seem to cover  quite

adequately  what is required. I have already  made

the  point  that  I do think it  is  dangerous  to

include these provisos of revocation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



appointments  at  any  time.  There  is   adequate

coverage, as the Member for Cairnhill has  pointed

out, under subsection (8) .



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do not think

that  the point which the Member for Tanglin makes

carries very great weight unless he seeks to apply

it   overall   to  all  existing  legislation   or

statutory boards. I am not familiar with the terms

of   all  the  relevant  Ordinances  but  in   the

Telephone Board Ordinance, you will find a similar

provision  which he should also seek to remove  if

he wishes to press this point.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I wish to

emphasise  what  my hon. Friend the  Minister  for

Communications  said  just now.  In  the  Seamen's

Registry  Board  Bill, which  is  coming  up  very

shortly - today or tomorrow - to this House, clause  3

(6) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chairman and members of the Board shall

hold  office  for  a period of two  years,  unless

earlier  removed  by the Minister,  but  shall  be

eligible for re-appointment."



<br><br>Now,  it  is a common practice in most legislation

that  you  have this discretionary power given  to

the  Minister and there are reasons - reasons  which

are broader than what was stated by my hon. Friend

the  Minister for Education: not only a member may

not  attend meetings and thereby fail to discharge

his duties, but there are other reasons, it may be

found  that  a person who is appointed  is  not  a

suitable person for that body or that there may be

reasons  for  which the Minister  thinks  that  he

should   be  removed:  there  may  be  allegations

against him which the Minister may think are right

that   he   is  favouring  one  side  or   showing

partiality  or something like that. I  think  that

this  discretionary power should be given  to  the

Minister.  I  do  not think any  Minister  in  his

senses  would ever take advantage of such a clause

to  manoeuvre persons who are his friends  or  are

favourable towards him into such bodies and it has

certainly  not been the case with this  Government

in the past.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I  am  astonished  at  the  poverty  of  the

reasons - I would prefer to say "excuses" if  I  may

be  permitted - given to support this effort to give

dictatorial powers to the executive. First, we are

told  that  it is in other Ordinances, although  I

have  pointed  out  that in the  parent  Ordinance

produced  by  colonial officials  passed  in  1954

there  is  no  such dictatorial power  to  dismiss

given. It is suggested that it is in a Bill before

the  House - the Seamen's Registry Board Bill.  That

does not give it validity, Sir. Two wrongs do  not

make a right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education gave a reason which sounded very good - that some members do not attend

meetings - and  consequently the  Minister  should

have  a right to dismiss them because they do  not

do  their  work,  completely  forgetting  that  in

clause 2 (8) of his own Bill, he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any member absenting himself from four

consecutive  meetings of the Board without  having

obtained leave of absence from the Chairman  shall

be considered as having resigned from the Board."



<br><br>Consequently, there is absolutely no  validity  in

that  reason  given  by the  Minister  and  it  is

unfortunate  that the Minister in  charge  of  the

Bill,  who is supposed to know its provisions  and

to  understand what it is sought to do, should  be

so  inadequate in his presentation and put  before

the House a reason that does not exist on the face

of the Bill which he himself moves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Commerce and Industry

says, "The executive powers of the Government  are

never  abused." All power corrupts, Sir,  and  the

more  absolute  the power, the more  absolute  the

corruption.  I  intend tomorrow to  bring  to  the

attention of this House the abuse of the powers of

banishment  for  which  the  executive  has   been

responsible. I intend, God willing,  at  the  next

sitting of this Assembly to draw the attention  of

this  House  to the abuse of the discretion  given

under   the   Preservation  of   Public   Security

Ordinance - abuse  by  the  Ministry  of  the  Chief

Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government being formed of human beings who

are weak will always



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>



abuse latitude unnecessarily given. There has  not

been  given  one single reason why these  provisos

give  an absolute power to the Minister to dismiss

persons  whom  he  himself appoints,  and  why  he

should  have  these powers except as suggested  by

the  Member for Tanglin that if a member does  not

toe  the  line, then out he goes. I for one,  Sir,

entirely  support the amendment of the Member  for

Tanglin   and   strenuously   object   to    these

dictatorial  powers - if  I  may  use  the  word  so

popular in this House, the "undemocratic" powers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I rise to support the amendment proposed  by

my colleague.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that when a person is appointed to an

office,  he  should be there to voice his  opinion

irrespective  of what the man who appoints  should

think about him. The Minister has put forward  the

idea  that  the  appointee is a  human  being  and

therefore  is  subject to human  frailties  but  I

suggest  that the Minister is also as  human.  All

Ministers are human beings and are as human and if

one  human being can commit one error, I  suggest,

Sir,  that all human beings including the Minister

who  makes  the  appointments can also  have  such

human faults.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, to point out that Assemblymen

elected by the people to this Assembly are here to

stay for their term of office and they may not  be

removed even if the voters feel that they are  not

performing their jobs. It is up to the Assemblymen

to  resign and contest a by-election but  that  is

within  their power. Here, Sir, is an  appointment

to  a  less  important job. All the  same,  it  is

important and I think the man appointed should  be

given  facilities to express his  decided  opinion

and  not  the opinion of the people who  appointed

him.  When  I look at this Bill and the  Education

Bill, I come across this power again given to  the

Minister. This power is unnecessary. This power is

undemocratic and this power should be removed  for

the  better  running of all institutions.  Sir,  I

support the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill gave us a burning,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



heartfelt,  emotional speech on  this  intolerable

injustice,  this dictatorial abuse of power  which

he   foresaw  will  inevitably  follow  from  this

proviso  which  has,  of  course,  been  in   many

Ordinances for a very long time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> What Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I mentioned the Telephone Board

Ordinance, Mr Chairman. The hon. Member  will  no

doubt  find the other ones by a simple  search.  I

would  point  out to him that he has  not  so  far

drawn  attention  to any case  in  which  existing

powers  have  been abused. It has not occurred  in

the  past and it is a presumption that it may  not

occur in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just point out also that his earlier

speech and the very competent speech of the Member

for  Tanglin do indicate that abuse of powers will

not  be  easy, because we have these  burning  and

heartfelt emotions which rise up to make clear  to

the public whatever the individual Member feels is

wrong;  and  if this power which is  desirable  in

itself  were to be abused, the remedy  is  simple.

The  Member can, of course, draw attention  to  it

and  seek  to  have the matter dealt with  by  the

Assembly.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think my

Friend  the Hon. Minister for Transport errs  when

he  says  that it is an easy matter  to  draw  the

attention of this House to an abuse of power. Now,

Sir, in my own mind, I am satisfied that there has

been an abuse of power in rejecting the milk plant

which is required for feeding our large adolescent

and  infant  population. But I cannot  compel  the

Minister  to  disclose the facts - the Minister  who

was  Assistant Minister for Commerce at  the  time

that the milk plant was accepted and who now turns

round  and says that it was accepted in haste  and

that  it  was  a  thoroughly  bad  act.  Did   the

Assistant  Minister himself at that  time  suggest

any such thing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is an abuse of power, but how

do you prove it? How do you bring to the attention

of the House private acts of abuse of power on the

part of a Minister in the privacy of his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>



own office if the Minister says, "I will sack you,

Mr  X,  from  the Polytechnic"? He may  sack  him

because he does not like the fact that he wears  a

red  necktie or does not wear any necktie at  all,

or  because  he is a friend of David Marshall.  He

sacks him. How do we question him? He says, "I did

it  within  my  discretion. I am not  prepared  to

answer  the  whys  and  the  wherefores."  He  can

stand - and  quite rightly stand - on the  legalities.

But  why does he need these powers, Sir? It is  in

the  Singapore Telephone Board Bill! Sir, the fact

that  one evil exists does not mean that  we  must

perpetuate it. It seems to me that now it has been

pointed  out to the Government that what they  are

seeking for the Minister for Education are in fact

dictatorial  powers,  they should,  with  dignity,

withdraw and bow to the pressure of this House, in

the  same  way as the Chief Minister has bowed  to

our demand for an investigation into corruption.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill  waxes eloquent over the milk plant  and

says  that the rejection of the offer is an  abuse

of  power  on the part of the Minister.  Sir,  the

remedy  is simple; he can bring a motion  to  this

House  demanding that Government put  up  a  White

Paper;  and  if he succeeds in getting his  motion

through, he shall have a White Paper. This is  the

working  of the democratic system which I am  sure

he does not object to; or would he like to have  a

Communist system here and he could have his  views

imposed  on  the  representatives  of  the  people

(there  would probably be none)? But, Sir, he  did

become  irrelevant in the debate when he  referred

to  the  milk plant and if I have your permission.

Sir, I would like to answer him; he mentioned that

I was the Assistant Minister at that time.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. When the Member for

Cairnhill mentioned the milk plant, I take  it  he

was  mentioning  it in passing. I  cannot  have  a

debate  on  the  milk  plant at  this  stage.  The

Minister,  of  course, can also mention  the  milk

plant in passing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, would it not be

considered  an abuse of power to accept  something

and  commit the public revenue to the  tune  of  a

great amount of money-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Prove it!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> -without going into the pros

and  cons  of  the  matter and  getting  technical

advice? The hon. Member forgets that not only  was

he  the Minister for Commerce at that time - he  was

also  the Chief Minister. And he also forgets that

his  was  a  different sort of  personality,  that

there  was  a  different sort  of  system  in  his

Government compared with what it is now, and  that

he   also   was  accustomed  to  taking  decisions

hastily. In fact, this decision was so taken and I

would not have liked to bring it up if he had  not

insisted that I issue a White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I must confess when I

raised this question that I did not expect to have

such  a  doughty champion on my side  as  my  hon.

Friend the Member for Cairnhill. My own anxiety in

this   matter   does  derive  largely   from   the

Explanatory Note number 2 (b) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amendments to section 4 provide-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for appointing bodies to have the power to

revoke  the  appointments of members  of  the

Board who have not satisfactorily represented

their interests."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means, as I understand it, that, as far as

paragraph (e) is concerned, if the Chairman of the

Board   does  not  satisfactorily  represent   the

interests  of  the  Minister,  he  may  have   his

appointment revoked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I think, Sir, my Friend the Member

for   Tanglin   should  be  conscious   that   the

Explanatory Note in no way limits the  wording  of

the  clause,  that  the wording  is  an  absolute,

unfettered and unchallengeable discretion.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> I

do  not  want, Sir, to prolong the debate on  this

particular  point, but there is a  point  which  I

think  may usefully be made. In dealing  with  the

proposed proviso which is unacceptable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>



to  the Member for Tanglin, I would say this, that

I am sure all Members of this House will recognise

the possibility of a person being appointed to the

Board  who  may, for reasons it is  impossible  to

specify  precisely in the Bill,  turn  out  to  be

thoroughly unsuitable. The words proposed in  this

proviso are to give the Minister powers to get rid

of  him  (putting it bluntly) and I think  Members

must  assume that the Minister will use powers  of

that  kind with a full sense of responsibility.  I

would suggest to the Member for Tanglin that, as I

have  said, since there is a possibility that  the

person  may  turn out to be thoroughly unsuitable,

it may very well be in the public interest that he

should  be  removed from the Board.  At  the  same

time, it is quite impossible to anticipate, and to

specify, in a Bill the precise reasons or the  set

of   circumstances  which  may  arise  which  will

justify such a course. I would ask him to consider

very  carefully that aspect of the problem, and  I

am  sure he will see - I hope he will see - the  force

of the point I am trying to put.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The Attorney-General is too modest,

Sir. He has provided in the Education Bill for the

removal  of school-teachers, in a large  and  very

detailed section - when he goes bankrupt, when he is

imprisoned,  when  he  is  this  and  when  he  is

that - which can be copied bodily into this Bill  if

he   so   desires.   But  if  he  wants   absolute

discretion, Sir, why have any law at all? Why  not

say,  "This Assembly hereby surrenders its rights,

powers   and   privileges  to  the  Minister   for

Education  in respect of all educational matters"?

I  mean  to say that if we like to have  a  little

Mussolini,  Sir,  let us be  clean  about  it  and

create  a Mussolini, but do not let us go  through

these  procedures  and say, "Ah,  but  this  is  a

little  privilege, and it is going to be exercised

with  responsibility."  Surely,  Ministers  always

exercise all their powers with responsibility?  No

doubt the Attorney-General has never heard of  any

executive  abuse of power, but I  say,  Sir,  that

this  House  knows full well that  it  does  exist

currently.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, the terms "Mussolini",

"human  beings"  and "abuse of  power"  are  very

popular  besides  the word "undemocratic".  Human

beings - yes,  we  are all human beings,  but  some

human  beings may be stable one day and  unstable

the  very next minute; some human beings  may  be

sane today and become insane the next moment. And

talking  of  dictatorship. I think  we  have  had

dictatorship  some  18  months  ago.   But   this

proviso, as I pointed out-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I object, Sir, and I ask that that

remark  be  withdrawn from a  person  who  worked

under  the alleged dictatorship without a  bleat.

Either   he   explains  it,  or  apologises   and

withdraws it. Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. All I heard the Hon. the

Minister for Education say was that there  was  a

dictatorship  18  months  ago,  but  he  did  not

enlarge on it and I am not officially aware  that

there has ever been a dictator - it might have been

a  figure of speech and unless the Minister  uses

an   offensive   remark  with  reference   to   a

particular Member of the Assembly, I cannot act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I have not imputed any

improper  motive to any Member  at  all  in  this

Assembly,  and  therefore I do not apologise  for

the statement. I have pointed out, as I have done

in  my  reply  just now, that such a  proviso  is

necessary if we want a Polytechnic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I have heard with great

interest  the  remarks by the Hon. the  Attorney-General.  I do not think that that will apply  in

this  case at all. After all, the person  who  is

going  to  be put in the office will be appointed

by the Minister after very careful selection; and

if after all this careful selection, he turns out

to  be one who is unsuitable, are we then to give

the  power to the Minister to remove him?  Basing

on  these lines of argument, which I made before,

Sir,  suppose we have some Ministers elected into

this Assembly and are later found to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>



unsuitable,  we  cannot  remove  them   in   this

instance;  we  will not be able  to  remove  them

until  the  next elections. This position  should

also  apply  to people who are appointed  to  all

boards;  I think unsuitability at one moment  and

suitability  at another, applies  to  all  people

handling  all affairs. I do not think, Sir,  that

the argument is valid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."

a  matter of important principle, should be given

grave  consideration, and I ask that they do  not

use  the Whip, and permit these deletions  to  go

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, Mr Chairman, provides that the

Chairman  may, at his discretion, grant leave  of

absence  to any member of the Board.  That  is  a

minor  matter in this case, but again,  it  gives

quite unnecessary discretion. The Chairman  is  a

human  being and if he is opposed to a member  of

the  Board, (as he often will be), he will  quite

naturally,  in the course of human  nature,  take

excessive  dislike, or could take dislike,  to  a

member of the Board; and by refusing leave  at  a

time  when  a member acutely needs it,  he  could

force him into the position of not attending four

meetings and thereby being automatically removed.

I   say,   Sir,   this  discretion   is   utterly

unnecessary.  Why  in  his  discretion?  I  would

suggest  that the power be left to the  Board  to

grant  leave  to any member of the Board,  and  I

move, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 43, to leave out the words

"Chairman  may  at  his  discretion"  and  insert

"Board may".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause will then read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Board may grant leave of absence to any

member of the Board."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think the

amendment is very reasonable. In the course of my

public  work in many institutions and bodies,  it

is  always  the  Committees or the  boards  which

decide and not the Chairmen. The Chairman decides

on  procedural points and I think it is better to

leave this discretion to the Board and not to the

Chairman alone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  rise  to  speak on this minor point,  but  the

actual  point I want to make is that I am unhappy

to   witness  in  this  debate  such  unfriendly,

undemocratic  and  even uncomplimentary  remarks.

Many  Members  in this Committee  have  in  their

speeches  mentioned little Mussolinis  and  human

beings-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must say that the hon.

Member  is  completely  irrelevant.  We  are  now

dealing with an amendment to leave out the  words

"Chairman may at his discretion". The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>



attitude  adopted  by Members is  not  really  the

concern of the hon. Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, I thank you

for  your guidance. What I mean to say is that  we

should  not  have  the  habit  of  bringing  in  a

personal grudge or Party feeling into a debate  on

such  an important issue. I must confess that  the

whole  time  I  have been unhappy  about  debating

these  minor things and hearing so many unfriendly

and  unpleasant  things. I  hope  the  Member  for

Cairnhill, with all respect due from the people of

Singapore, who also remember-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must remind the hon.

Member  that we cannot have a lecture on behaviour

in  this  Assembly  when we are  dealing  with  an

amendment on a Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> So, Sir, in order to prove

that  I  want  a  frank and truly sincere  working

committee, I think I will support this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I think the amendment is

reasonable, Sir, and I am prepared to accept it.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> My only comment, Sir, is

that there are other legislative measures in which

similar powers are given to the Minister and  even

to   the  Governor;  and  perhaps  the  honourable

champion  of  democracy would like to run  through

them  in  time to come and bring up his  proposals

before this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, I have a consequential

amendment to move following on this in respect  of

clause 2 (i) , new subsection (8) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,

Sir,  the House will appreciate that, in  view  of

the  acceptance of the previous amendment, the new

subsection (8) is no longer appropriate  since  it

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any member absenting himself from four

consecutive  meetings of the Board without  having

obtained leave of absence from the Chairman.".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should either be "from the Board" or the words

"from  the Chairman" should be deleted,  and  just

say  ", without having obtained leave of absence".

Perhaps  if you will permit me, Sir, I would  like

to move, instead,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, line 4, to leave out the word

"Chairman" and there to insert "Board".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 6 inclusive ordered to stand part

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is a natural consequence of the

Government's  acceptance  of  the  recommendations

made   by   the  All-Party  Committee  on  Chinese

Education  for  the improvement of  the  education

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides within one Ordinance not only

for   the   registration  of  schools,   managers,

teachers  previously included in the  Registration

of  Schools  Ordinance, 1950,  but  also  for  the

constitution  of the Education Finance  Board  and

the  Education Advisory Council to replace the old

Education  Finance  Board and  the  old  Education

Committee  set  up  under  the  present  Education

Ordinance, 1948.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also provides for the constitution of an

Appeals  Board  to  hear appeals  against  certain

decisions  made  by  the  Director  and  for   the

extension  of the provisions of the  Bill  to  all

types  of  schools. At the same time,  opportunity

has  been  taken to introduce a number of changes.

Some,  for  instance, provide for a more realistic

approach  to the problem of registering  teachers,

managers and others, and there are also other  in-corporations in the Bill which seek to  strengthen

it where experience has shown it to be weak. These

changes  are  outlined briefly in the  Explanatory

Note which accompanies the Bill. There are a great

number of these changes. Most of them are of minor

importance and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>



do not propose to dwell on them in detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to speak on the general principles

of  which  the Bill is an expression and  to  deal

with  some of the misunderstandings which  comment

in  the Press on the Bill has shown to exist about

the purpose of the Bill as a whole, and especially

about  the  more important changes. The  All-Party

Committee  of  this  Assembly, hon.  Members  will

recollect,  was appointed in 1955 to enquire  into

the  causes of the disturbances in certain Chinese

schools.  That Committee became aware  at  a  very

early stage of its enquiry that there was a strong

feeling  in  Chinese education  circles  that  the

Registration  of  Schools  Ordinance,  1950,   was

directed   solely  against  the  Chinese  schools,

managers  and  teachers.  Though  there   was   no

justification for this suspicion, it was  possible

to  find  a  cause for this misunderstanding.  For

certain perfectly sound reasons, the provisions of

that   Ordinance  did  not  apply  to   Government

schools,  that  is, to schools completely  run  by

Government, controlled by Government, and  staffed

entirely  by  principals  and  teachers  bound  by

regulations which controlled their activities,  in

fact,  much more closely than the Registration  of

Schools  Ordinance or any regulations  made  under

it.  But  at  the same time, there  were  then  no

Government  Chinese  schools,  and  though   Malay

schools  were Government schools, it  came  to  be

assumed  in  Chinese education  circles  that  the

terms  "English schools" and "Government  schools"

were synonymous, and that all English schools were

exempted from the provisions or that Ordinance. It

was to remove these possible doubts and suspicions

that  the All-Party Committee recommended  that  a

new  Ordinance,  if Government were  to  introduce

one,  should apply to all schools. Now  this  Bill

provides  for  the  change. All schools - Government

schools    or    aided    schools    or    private

schools - whatever  the medium of instruction,  must

conform  to the conditions laid down in  the  Bill

and in any regulation made under it. Similarly all

teachers must be either registered under the  Bill

or given authority or permission to teach.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the Bill is concerned then, it does

not matter in the slightest whether a school is  a

Chinese school, a Malay school, a Tamil school, or

an  English  school, whether  it  teaches  in  the

medium  of  Kuo-yu, Malay, Tamil  or  English,  or

whether the school is bilingual or trilingual; the

provisions of this Bill must apply to all schools,

it  discriminates against no one. It  is  strictly

non-communal and I can assure hon. Members that it

will  be  administered quite impartially. The  law

must  be  strict,  but  the  application  can   be

generous and lenient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may say here that in drawing up this Bill

we have kept continuously in mind the interests of

one  particular section of the community, and that

is  the children. The aim throughout has been,  so

far  as  possible, to see that they are  given  an

education  in  conformity  with  the  Government's

education policy to fit them to become responsible

citizens  of  the  territory  under  the  care  of

teachers   with   good   education,   professional

training  and personal integrity, and in  premises

which   conform  to  the  highest  standards   the

community can reasonably afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that there has been criticism by

managers and teachers of those clauses of the Bill

which refer to them. I have been told -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Ordinance shows no respect to the

enthusiastic members of the public who  have  made

great  contributions to the culture and  education

of this country."



<br><br>Another comment says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It contains unreasonable and stringent

provisions which reduce the teaching profession to

a  slavish service and show no respect whatever to

teachers who are assuming heavy responsibilities...".



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Should

the  Minister  not  indicate to the  Assembly  the

sources from which he is reading?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was not aware that the Minister

was reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I was only quoting.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is strictly not a point of

order. Of course, it is the practice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>



that  a  Member ought first to disclose the source

of any quotation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> These quotations can be found

in  the newspapers and if the Member for Cairnhill

has followed these papers or the Chinese Press, he

will  have been aware of these criticisms. I  have

also    personally   received    memoranda    from

educational bodies in Singapore. These are some of

the  quotations  which I am reading.  Yet  another

quotation says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ordinance completely impairs the teachers'

self-respect and prestige and makes them lose  all

sense of security and confidence in themselves."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are surely ill-considered criticisms by a

body of responsible men. I am very well aware  of,

and  have frequently paid tribute to, the splendid

and  disinterested work which so many  members  of

the   Chinese  community  have  done  for  Chinese

schools and Chinese education. I am equally  aware

of  and  I  now pay tribute to the excellent  work

which  so  many teachers have done for many  years

under  very difficult conditions in these schools;

but  I think hon. Members will agree with me  that

an Education Bill is not the place to express such

appreciation, though I am glad to say, as  I  said

just  now, I will avail myself of this opportunity

to  pay tribute to them, and I do so here. We  all

know  that there have been some - and I am  glad  to

say  that there are only a very few - managers whose

interest in the pupils has been purely selfish and

who have taken advantage of the intense enthusiasm

of so many parents to give their children a better

education than they themselves had, to abuse their

position sometimes. Some of the schools have  been

set  up  in very unhygienic premises. They  packed

more  and  more  children into classrooms  already

grossly overcrowded, and some school children were

taught  by  under-qualified, untrained, overworked

and   under-paid  teachers,  and  for  all   this,

excessive sums in fees have been extorted from the

children. Is it therefore wrong of me to  ask  for

powers to control the activities of managers  such

as  these  unscrupulous ones? Is it not reasonable

for me to expect not opposition but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>



support for measures which are designed to  ensure

that only honest and responsible people should  be

allowed  to  become  or  to  remain  managers   or

teachers?  Let there be no misunderstanding.  Most

teachers and managers are responsible - I  said  so

just   now - but  they  occupy  positions  of   such

responsibility  that  not most  but  all - each  and

every  one of them - must and should pass the  test.

That  is  my  justification for  enforcing  strict

conditions   before   registering   managers   and

teachers.  If anyone thinks that these regulations

and conditions are not necessary, let him think of

the  children who have suffered because conditions

in  the  past were not strict enough or  were  not

enforced nearly strict enough. Undoubtedly some of

the   criticisms  which  come  from  managers  and

teachers arise from their misunderstanding of  the

powers  and functions of the Director.  They  have

assumed  that  the  Director can  act  arbitrarily

according to his particular whims and fancies, and

therefore  they naturally fear for their security.

But  the  Director of Education  is  a  Government

servant  who  is required always  to  act  in  the

public   interests.   He   must   administer   the

Department in accordance with the policy laid down

by  the  Minister, and you may be  sure  that  any

decision  he  takes will be made  only  after  due

consideration  of all the available  evidence  and

after   discussion  with  all  officers   of   the

Department. That does not mean, of course, that he

does  not  make mistakes, so there is a, provision

in  the  Ordinance  for persons aggrieved  by  his

decision   to  appeal  to  the  newly  constituted

Appeals Board or to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one of the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on Chinese Education that such an

Appeals Board should be set up. The Board is to be

a  small one with six members and a Chairman, none

of  whom  will be officials. Educational interests

will be strongly represented with four of the  six

members,  including  two  teachers.  Very  careful

consideration  and  thought  were  given  to   the

question  whether  the proceedings  of  the  Board

should  be open to the public or not. The decision

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>



they  should  not be open to the public  has  been

criticised   as  contrary  to  normal   democratic

principles  and  practice,  which  requires   that

justice should not only be done but be seen to  be

done. In theory, that criticism may be valid,  but

the  decisions which the Board will have  to  take

are   not  concerned  with  rightful  or  wrongful

convictions of offences against the Criminal Code.

It  will  be  for  them to decide,  for  instance,

whether  or not the Director was right in deciding

that a school in some way failed to comply with or

satisfied  the  conditions  which  the  Department

requires  or that the manager or teacher  for  one

reason or another is not a suitable person to have

charge  of the education of children. In my  view,

the  Board will be the better able to arrive at  a

just decision if it can consider the appeals in an

atmosphere  free from the impact of political  and

emotional  propaganda. The members  of  the  Board

will, in fact, have a difficult enough task if the

proceedings are not public. Experience  has  shown

that  the  task becomes impossible if the meetings

are  allowed to be used as occasions for political

or  communal propaganda. The Board will not in any

sense  be  an  official one. It is only  right  to

leave  them  to hear appeals in peace and  at  the

same    time   to   avoid   giving   any   further

embarrassment  to  persons whose  appeals  may  be

unsuccessful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for appeals against

certain decisions of the Director to be heard  not

by  the  Appeals Board but by the Minister.  These

are   appeals  against  decisions  which   involve

considerations of public security. It is the  view

of  the  Government that, while it  is  proper  to

delegate  power  to  the  Director  to  deal  with

questions of purely educational content, it is not

proper  to  delegate that power where  the  public

security  is  concerned. The Minister's  power  is

after all the Government's power. It has been said

that  it is undemocratic that the Minister  should

hear such appeals, but I say that it is democratic

that  the Minister should be responsible for  such

matters and that he himself is responsible to this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other important changes recommended

by  the All-Party Committee was that both the  old

Ordinances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>



-the  Registration  of Schools Ordinance  and  the

Education  Ordinance - should be embodied  into  one

Ordinance. This has now been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill not only provides for the registration

of  schools,  managers and teachers but  also  the

setting up of an Educational Finance Board and  an

Educational  Advisory  Council  (the  latter   was

recommended by the All-Party Committee).  The  new

Educational Finance Board is in most respects very

like  the  old  one, but there  is  one  important

difference.  The new Board will be advisory  only.

It will make recommendations to the Minister about

the  money  needed  for education  and  will  also

advise  him  on the administration of  this  money

when  it  is  provided, but it will not  have  the

authority to decide what money is to be  spent  or

how it is to be spent. That responsibility must be

the  Minister's  who,  in  turn,  as  I  say,   is

responsible to this Assembly. This will involve  a

change in the annual Estimates. The Estimates  now

appearing  under  the  Head  Education   and   the

Appendix    under   the   Head   Education - Finance

Board - will  in  future  be incorporated  into  the

ordinary departmental Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that the Finance Board

should  contain representatives of  all  the  four

main  communities. I do not think it is necessary.

There   is  already  too  much  talk  of  communal

interests.  It will be the responsibility  of  the

Minister, and in the last resort of this Assembly,

to  see that all are given a fair deal; and in any

case  it  is  most  churlish, in  my  opinion,  to

suggest that we cannot find four men of sufficient

standing,   integrity  and  authority,   who   are

sufficiently  free  from  communal  prejudice,  to

recommend a just allocation of the funds available

for education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Council replaces the old Education

Committee.  It  is  a much larger  body  than  the

Education Finance Board and therefore here  it  is

easier  to  arrange for the different  communities

and    educational   interests   to   be    fairly

represented.  Here  it  has also  been  criticised

because  its membership is not wholly  drawn  from

educational circles; but again in my opinion  that

criticism



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>



is  ill-considered.  It is not  only  teachers  or

managers  and  the  like who  are  concerned  with

educational problems. Education touches every  one

of  us. We need on this Advisory Council not  only

educationists but also men of authority  and  wide

experience  who  can  look at education  from  the

outside;  otherwise  there  is  that  danger  that

education  for  education's sake will  become  too

ingrown  and that in our concern about the  means,

we  shall lose sight of the ends. So provision has

been made in the Bill that the Council should have

a  strong  leavening of members with  no  specific

educational  qualifications or interests.  I  hope

the Council will be an extremely valuable means of

keeping in touch with the views of the public  and

the   community  at  large,  whether  on   matters

referred  to  it by the Ministry or matters  which

the Council itself might bring up to the notice of

the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have touched on the most important

features  of  the Bill, and I hope I have  removed

some  of  the  causes  of  the  misunderstandings.

Before I move, Sir, may I emphasise once more what

I have said at the beginning:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that this Bill is strictly non-communal

and  that  it  is  quite untrue  to  say  that  it

discriminates  against  any  particular  group  or

schools or community or teachers; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that the over-riding purpose of this

Bill  is  to protect the interests of the children

without  whom  there  would be  no  necessity  for

providing schools or teachers or managers  or  any

need for this Bill at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>12 noon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as  one  who  is  not affected  by  communal

matters, I would like to say that, having  studied

this  Bill over two evenings, I am satisfied  that

the Minister does in fact speak the truth when  he

says   that  it  is  an  attempt  at  non-communal

unification  of our educational system.  There  is

much that is good in this Bill but a study of  its

provisions indicates that the emphasis is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>



not  so much on unification and on policy, but the

emphasis is on the establishment of a "Dictator of

Education" - and this I intend to prove.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has said that the Bill

purports to incorporate the recommendations of the

All-Party Committee on Education appointed by this

Assembly,  of which the Minister himself  was  the

Chairman;  and now that I am no longer a  dictator

of  the  Government or even a Member of his Party,

let me say, Sir, what I have always said, that the

All-Party Committee-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Mr

Speaker, Sir, is it in order for a Member of  this

Assembly  who has now openly renounced his  Party,

which  is  the governing Party, to remain  on  the

Government Benches?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not strictly a point of

order. As hon. Members do know, there are no seats

reserved  in  this  Assembly except  possibly  the

front  row  of the Government Benches.  When  hon.

Members  take seats on the Government Benches,  it

is  proper  for other Members to assume that  they

are supporters of the Government in the sense that

they are amenable to the Government Whip. But as I

say,  the  choice  is left entirely  to  the  hon.

Member  himself, and if he chooses to take a  seat

on  one  of  the  Government Back Benches,  he  is

perfectly entitled to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I think perhaps the hon. Member is

anxious  to  come  here but he  cannot  accept  my

chastising  presence. Sir, let  me  say  this  for

myself - I have stood, and I stand and will continue

to stand for the aims and principles of the Labour

Front promulgated to the electorate and in so  far

as this Government -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think we should

pursue the subject any further. I have ruled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker. I

was  on  the subject of complimenting the Minister

for  Education  on  what  I  have  considered  and

consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>



to  be a first-class job - that is the Report of the

All-Party  Committee  on Chinese  Education.  That

Report  was followed by a White Paper on education

for  which  the Minister was responsible - under  my

dictatorship - providing for equal respect  for  all

languages  and cultures, and I would like  to  say

again,  though I am not a Member of his Party  and

have  no axe to grind, that it was an enunciation,

a   magnificent  enunciation,  of  a  courage,  of

decency, of foresight. It was a truly good  policy

and  although members of the Chinese community and

organisations indiscriminately "gave us hell" - if I

may  use that expression in this House; if  I  may

not, I withdraw it -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the word "hell" has

in fact been over-ruled in the past.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Although members of the Chinese

community  did attack us, and attacked us  without

cause   and  violently,  yet  I  think  they   now

recognise  that they were very wrong in  attacking

that  White Paper which was a thing of decency.  I

think  they  recognise that that White  Paper  put

forth  principles which they desire themselves  to

see  put  into concrete form in legislation.  They

are  ready, they are anxious for legislation which

embodies  the principles of that White Paper,  and

some  of those principles are in fact embodied  in

this  Bill. But there is so much not in the  White

Paper  but in this Bill that it destroys the value

of  the Bill, Sir, and the theme of this my speech

is  not so much to attack the Bill as to hope that

Government, after considering the views  expressed

in this House, will take time to reconsider before

seeking to force through this measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have known the Minister for Education for

some  time  and  I  trust he will  take  it  as  a

compliment if I say this - that probably he  is  not

fully  aware of what this Education Bill contains,

because to me, Sir, this Bill is drafted, or seems

to   be  drafted,  on  the  assumption  that  this

Assembly consists of blind chickens, that  we  can

neither  read  nor understand legal English.  Sir,

the Straits Times has depicted me as a hen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>



addling  the  Easter egg, but at  least  it  never

depicted me blind. It gave me open eyes, and  open

eyes I have. Of all the Bills or Ordinances I have

ever  seen,  this  Bill,  Sir,  is  unique  in  my

experience, absolutely unique, in the breadth  and

the  extent  of  the dictatorial powers  which  it

gives  to  one  man. If there  were  a  museum  of

colonial  exhibits, I would put this Bill  Exhibit

A,  Sir, Exhibit A. Educational matters, Sir,  are

not  specifically my line. I have never sought  to

interfere, particularly the administration of  the

Ministry,   despite  the  bitter  words   of   the

Minister,  but I thought it my duty the  last  two

evenings  to look at this Bill, and I am going  to

submit to this House that there are defects  of  a

grave   character  which  require   very   earnest

consideration   and   which   require   that   the

Government  should  withdraw  it  for  some   time

despite  the  urgency in order to  reconsider  its

position.  Sir,  I  was, am, and  will  be,  as  a

representative of the people, anxious  to  receive

representations from associations  which  seek  to

make  their points of view heard. I have not  been

approached by anybody until this morning - by one at

9.30,  by another at 9.50. At 9.30 a.m. I received

a  memorandum from the English Teachers of Chinese

Schools' Union, and frankly, on a cursory reading,

there  seems  to be some sense in  many  of  their

objections. I have also received a memorandum from

the  Singapore Chinese Schools Committee  Teachers

Association in the Chinese language. It looks very

imposing, Sir, and very impressive but it  is  not

followed  by any translation and I am  unhappy  at

being  unable  to know how I can be of  assistance

after  reading it. But placed in the  position  of

not   being  able  to  study  the  representations

received,  I can only indicate to this  House  the

defects  which exist in my view after a  study  of

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to take the Educational Advisory

Council  appointed by clause 5. You will see  from

there,   Sir,   that  there  is  an  extraordinary

preponderance of official appointments.  There  is

the Director of Education, the Permanent Secretary

to  the Treasury, the Medical Officer in charge of

schools, the Director



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>



of  Social Welfare, ten persons appointed  by  the

Minister at his discretion - ten.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Clause 8.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Clauses 5 (2) and 8 (2) (f).

Clause  5 (2) provides for four and clause  8  (2)

(f)  provides  for  six. If  it  please  you,  Mr

Speaker,  I  would  like  to  explain  it  to  the

Minister   in  very  simple  language.  Clause   5

appoints  the  Finance Board. Clause  8  says  the

whole  Finance  Board comes into  the  Educational

Advisory  Council. So the four people he  appoints

under  clause  5  of the Finance Board  become  an

additional four to the people he appoints  to  the

Educational  Advisory  Council.  If  that  is  too

difficult, the Attorney-General will correct me if

I am wrong. Let me go back, Sir. I think four plus

six  makes ten. So under clauses 5 (2) and  8  (2)

(f),  the  Minister appoints ten  persons  at  his

discretion.  A  total  of  14  appointed  by   the

Minister - four officials and ten nominated by  him.

As  against  that,  Sir, there are  eight  persons

nominated  by educational bodies, the  educational

bodies  themselves being institutions approved  by

the Minister. Sir, it is a heavy preponderance  of

officials and members appointed by Government, and

it is to be noted that here, as in the Polytechnic

Bill, these persons appointed by the Minister  can

be removed at his pleasure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we leave for a moment the Educational

Advisory  Council and come to the Schools  Appeals

Board.  It  is rather important to look  at  these

things, to notice the preponderance of persons who

are  officially persona grata. The Chairman  under

clause 12 is appointed by the Minister. There  are

two registered teachers appointed by the Minister.

There are two other persons - not teachers, brokers,

merchants,   Income   Tax  employees,   what   you

will - appointed by the Minister. So  you  have  got

five  persons - five - appointed at the discretion  of

the  Minister; and there are two persons nominated

by  educational  bodies who are  approved  by  the

Minister.  But  at  least they  are  nominated  by

outsiders. So you have got - and keep this  in  mind

when  we  come to consider the powers - an official

preponderance of five to two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>



on  the Schools Appeals Board. Now, Sir, what  are

the  powers of the Schools Appeals Board?  Let  us

look at clause 14 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be the duty of the Appeals Board to

hear and decide all appeals from the decisions-"



<br><br>Now  whether "decisions" include orders is  rather

an interesting point. I continue, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"-of the Director other than those expressly

excepted under paragraph (a) of subsection (2)  of

section 48 of this Ordinance:".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us go chasing round, if you do not

mind - I  know it is a bore to follow paragraph  (a)

of  subsection  (2)  of section  48:  nobody  ever

bothered - but let us chase round and find out what

this  "expressly excepted" means. Let us  turn  to

clause 48. Sub-clause (2) (a) of clause 48 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"in cases where the refusal is under paragraphs

(o), (p) and (q) of section 24, paragraph (f)  of

section 25, paragraph (i) of section 33, paragraph

(g) of section 34, or paragraph (g) of section 38...".



<br><br>Of  course, we could not say all that in the first

one.  In  fact, in clause 14 it looks very  simple

except  with  the one exception, but now  we  find

that  there  are  in fact seven exceptions.  Seven

exceptions where the Schools Appeals Board has  no

power  to hear appeals, and where the appeals  are

only to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the period when I was dictator,

according to my friends and former colleagues  who

at  the time enjoyed their posts without demur,  I

learned one thing if I learned nothing at all, and

that  is,  a Minister is not in fact organised  to

hear  appeals, to be able to gather facts  and  to

sit in judgment quietly in order to do justice  on

a difficult matter. He just is not organised. Your

Ministers - pity them! - have (if they work and  most

of  them  work) a great deal to do. Their time  is

cut up into little bits of appointments and little

bits  of other things. They just are not organised

and  can  never be organised into a true Court  of

Appeal   which   can  quietly   and   calmly   and

impartially  examine  appeals  from  decisions  of

their own Ministry. For let us recognise this - that

if you do not co-operate with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>



your  Permanent  Secretary, you  come  in  for  an

awfully difficult time. I remember-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was not aware that I had a

Permanent Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. Indeed I

was suggesting you. I apologise. Sir, let me quote

a story of Churchill who, after a stormy interview

with  his Permanent Secretary to the Treasury when

he  was  in the Treasury, turned round to him  and

said,  "You  might as well treat me as an  equal."

And  that  is too true. A Minister can, a Minister

sometimes even does go against the advice  of  his

officials  in  the Ministry, but let us  recognise

the  fact that it makes life impossible if you are

going  to  question  every  single  act  of   your

permanent officials. You have got to work with the

tools  you have. So a Minister cannot approach  an

appeal from his Dictator of Education impartially.

He  cannot.  This power of appeal  in  respect  of

these  seven  clauses to the  Minister  is  purely

nominal.  Now  what are these seven  classes?  The

Minister spoke of the danger to security.  Let  us

look  at  these seven classes which are  known  as

paragraphs  (o) ,  (p)  and  (q)  of  section   24,

paragraph  (f)  of  section 25, paragraph  (i)  of

section  33,  paragraph (g)  of  section  34,  and

paragraph (g) of section 38-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It might be appropriate to suspend?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The sitting is suspended. I will

take the Chair again at half-past two.

<div align="center"><b>EDUCATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, on the adjournment, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>



were discussing the seven doors of destruction let

in  by  clause  14 of this dictator  of  education

Bill.  These  seven  doors,  Sir,  are  where  the

dictator of education has his big guns to  enforce

his  absolute will on all educationalists  subject

only  to an appeal to his boss the Minister.  Now,

Sir,  I  have pointed out that where there  is  no

Appeals Board at all, an appeal to the Minister is

better than nothing though in truth and in fact it

usually is a pure formality but here there  is  an

Appeals Board. There is an Appeals Board of seven,

five of whom are specifically picked and chosen by

the Minister himself: five to two preponderance of

those  who are persona grata to the Minister.  Why

then,  Sir, can this Appeals Board not be  trusted

with  the  matters coming under the seven  classes

exempted  under the provisions of clauses  14  and

48? Let us look at them, Sir. I will take them  in

order. It says that clause 24 (o), (p) and (q)  is

not  subject to appeal to the Appeals  Board.  Now

clause 24 on page 11 of the Bill reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may refuse to register a school if

it shall appear...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(o) the proposed school is likely to be used

for  a  purpose detrimental to the interests

of the Colony or of the public;".



<br><br>I  do  not know whether "interests of the  Colony"

are  identical with the fact of being a colony  or

the  Colonial Office's interests but let us assume

for  a moment that the words are legitimately used

as  interests  of this territory  and  the  people

therein.  Notice how extremely wide  that  wording

is, Sir:  if it appears to the Director that  the

proposed school is likely to be used for a purpose

detrimental to the interests of the Colony  or  of

the  public.  You  could not possibly  find  wider

words. Look at the next one:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(p) the proposed school is likely to be used

for  the  purpose of instruction detrimental

to  the  interests of the public or  of  the

pupils;".



<br><br>I do not know what difference there is. Then:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(q) the proposed school is likely to he used

as a meeting place of an unlawful society;".



<br><br>Then we go to clause 25, Sir. Clause 25 (f) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may cancel the registration of any

school-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) if it appears to him that discipline in the

school  has not been or cannot be adequately

maintained."



<br><br>Here  again, although the Appeals Board is  surely

an   organization  far  better  suited  than   the

Minister to understand what educational discipline

is,  no, the Appeals Board cannot be trusted  with

an  appeal  from  a  decision  of  so  serious   a

character  as  to  cancel the  registration  of  a

school on the ground that "it appears to him  (the

Director)  that discipline in the school  has  not

been or cannot be adequately maintained."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then let us take clause 33 (i). I am sorry, Sir,

if  I  seem  to be going into details.  I  am  not

seeking  to amend them at this stage.  What  I  am

seeking  is  that this House should  realise  that

this   Bill   is,  in  fact,  a   Bill   for   the

establishment  of a dictator of education  and  to

that  extent it is entirely unacceptable to  those

who  accept, shall we say, the popular phrase, the

democratic principle that, in fact, this  Bill  is

undemocratic. Now, Sir, let us take clause 33  (i)

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may in his discretion refuse to

register any person as a manager of a school if-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) it appears to the Director that it will be

prejudicial to the interests of  the  Colony

or  of  the public or of the pupils  of  the

school  that  such  person  should   be   so

registered."



<br><br>How  wide, how much wider is it possible to  frame

any clause giving absolute powers! Let us go on to

clause 34 (g) which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may cancel the registration of any

manager-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) if after the date of his registration it

appears to the Director that he is a  person

who ought not in the interests of the Colony

or  of  the public or of the pupils  of  the

school to remain a manager."



<br><br>Finally,  clause 38(g) -finally, I  say.  Sir - I  am

merely  talking  of  the seven main  doors.  After

these seven, Sir, there are 27 areas of discretion

but these are the main doors. Clause 38 (g) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may refuse to register a person as

a  teacher  if  it  appears to  him  that  the

applicant-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) is likely to influence his pupils in a

manner  prejudicial to their  welfare  or  to

the public interest;".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I say, Sir, that the exception in clause 14

makes a complete farce of the Appeals Board,  that

in   fact,  those  exceptions  give  the  Director

absolute  power  to  refuse  to  register  schools

(clause  24), to cancel registration of  a  school

(clause 25), to refuse to register the manager  of

a  school (clause 33), to cancel registration of a

manager (clause 34) and to refuse registration  of

a  teacher (clause 38). In truth and in fact, this

exception  means there is no protection whatsoever

for educationalists against the arbitrary exercise

of dictatorial executive powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said before that the Minister in

charge of this Bill does not fully understand  its

provisions but I here and now, Sir, challenge  the

Hon. the  Attorney-General to tell  you  that  my

statement is incorrect, that in truth and in  fact

there  is  absolute  power  in  the  Director   of

Education as the right-hand man of the Minister to

refuse   to   register   a  school - absolute   and

unchallengeable - to cancel registration, to  refuse

to register a manager, to cancel registration of a

manager  and to refuse registration of a  teacher.

Those   are  the  seven  main  doors  of  control - absolute  and  dictatorial - but they are  not  all,

Sir.  Throughout this Bill, there are 27 areas  of

discretion,  in addition to these seven  given  to

the  Director  and  they  are  divided  into  four

classes. One, the phrase "in his discretion". That

phrase  is  used seven times. Two,  "if  it  shall

appear  to him" and that phrase is used 13  times.

Three, "he has powers if in his opinion" and  that

is  used four times. Finally, "he has powers if he

is  satisfied"  and that is used  three  times,  a

total  of 27 areas of discretion. Now let  us  see

what  this means. I do not intend to pull the wool

over anybody's eyes in these matters. I would like

you  to  see  exactly what it means. Let  us  take

class  one "in his discretion" and let us turn  to

one  of the items to which it refers and I ask you

to look at clause 22(2) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An application for the registration of a school [that

is important enough, you think]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>



other  than a Government school shall be  made  to

the  Director by a person intending  to  become  a

manager of the school and the Director may in  his

discretion grant such application subject to  such

conditions,  if any, as he may think  fit  or  may

refuse such application."



<br><br>There  is  no right of appeal whatever  either  in

respect  of  the conditions or in respect  of  the

refusal to register the school because it  is  "in

his  discretion" - this colossus.  Let  us  look  at

class  number two "if it shall appear to him".  It

is  handy. Let us look at clause 24. Take  any  of

the  paragraphs (a) to (s) : I do not know how many

they  make.  Let us take the first  paragraph  (a)

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may refuse to register a school if

it shall appear to him that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) adequate educational facilities already

exist in the area in which it is proposed to

open the school;".



<br><br>Now,  you  will notice not that the  Director  may

refuse  to register a school it adequate education

facilities  already exist but  he  may  refuse  to

register  a school if it appears to him.  So  when

you  appeal against his decision, you have got  to

go  before the Appeals Board not to prove that  in

fact  the  decision is unreasonable but you  have

got  to  prove  that  it did not  appear  to  him.

Otherwise what is the meaning of that phrase?  Why

put  it  in  there? "The Director  may  refuse  to

register   a   school   if  adequate   educational

facilities already exist." That is fair enough. He

may  refuse,  you  appeal,  you  prove  there  are

adequate educational facilities and that,  in  the

normal course, the Director was wrong and you win.

But  no,  no,  Sir,  the Director  may  refuse  to

register  a  school  not if  adequate  educational

facilities  exist but if it appears  to  him  (His

Excellency  the Dictator) and you must  take  into

account  his personal idiosyncrasies,  not  if  it

appears  to  the common man but if it  appears  to

him.  All  he has to say when he comes before  the

Appeals Board is, "It appears to me. Now, you call

me a liar. Are you going to prove me a liar?" Take

another one, take any of these paragraphs.  Clause

24(c) reads:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may refuse to register a school if

it shall appear to him that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the fire precautions in the proposed school

premises   are   or   are   likely   to   be

inadequate;".



<br><br>Now,  for instance, you can call the fire brigade,

you can call every fireman in town to prove to the

Appeals  Board that the fire precautions  are,  in

fact,  adequate  but  if the  Director  says,  "It

appears  to  me  that these are inadequate,"  then

where  is your appeal? If it means the same thing,

why do you put the words "if it appears to him"?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must remind the

hon.  Member that he must address his  remarks  to

the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I shall not take up more of your time. Let

us  take  class three. I do want to  satisfy  you.

Sir,  that,  in fact, these discretionary  clauses

are  complete and absolute discretion  and  though

there  is supposed to be an appeal, in fact, there

can   be  no  appeal  from  the  exercise   of   a

discretion. Class three where the phrase  "in  his

opinion" is used. Let us take any one. Let us take

clause 34 (g) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may cancel the registration of any

manager-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) if after the date of his registration it

appears to the Director that he is a  person

who ought not in the interests of the Colony

or  of  the public or of the pupils  of  the

school to remain a manager."



<br><br>Now,  how  do  you appeal? You go to  the  Appeals

Board  and you say, "Well, look, there is  nothing

wrong with me except I belong to the Party Ra'ayat

or I belong to the P.A.P. although they are now in

favour but-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> In favour of

what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> In favour of the Government. Let

us  say  that  you  go along and appeal.  All  the

Appeals Board can say is, "Look, we are sorry. The

Director may cancel the registration of a manager,

not  if the manager is a person who ought not,  in

the  interests of the Colony, to be a manager, but

the manager is a person who 'in the opinion of the

Director' is not a person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>



who ought to be and the Director tells us that  in

his  opinion  he  ought not to be a  manager."  We

cannot legally overrule him because it is a matter

for the opinion of the Director. I want you to see

another one, clause 39 (b). This is rather neat:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may cancel the registration of a

teacher-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if it appears to the Director that the

teacher  has  been  guilty  of  professional

misconduct;".



<br><br>Not,   if   the   teacher  has  been   guilty   of

professional  misconduct. After all,  there  is  a

Schools  Appeals Board. The Minister has told  you

that  there  are four teachers on this  Board  and

therefore  you  can  expect them  to  enforce  the

appropriate discipline. That is fine but  yet  you

are not allowing him to go. I mean here that it is

not  the Board that will decide whether there  has

been professional misconduct if it appears to  the

Director  that  the  teacher has  been  guilty  of

professional misconduct. So you go and  appeal  to

the  Board  and all the Board can say.  "Well,  it

appears  to the Director. How do we interfere?  He

has  got the discretion under clause 39 (b)."  Or,

"Under  clause 39 (b), it appears to the  Director

that he is not competent to perform the duties for

which  he is employed." If it is the Director  who

decides,  what  is the value of an appeal  from  a

discretion except to be thrown out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the last class where the wording is

"he  may  do an act if he is satisfied". Ah,  now,

how  do  we satisfy this dictator? Let us look  at

clause 37 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to the provisions of section 38 of this

Ordinance . . . , and after such enquiry as he may

think  necessary the Director shall  if  satisfied

register the applicant [that is, the teacher]."



<br><br>Now, the applicant appeals and says, "Look, I have

been  wrongly refused registration. What  can  the

Appeals  Board do?" It says, "Clause  37  provides

that  the Director must be satisfied. The Director

says that he is not satisfied." And so he goes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these dictatorial powers under clause 14

and under these minor clauses of discretion are of

a character which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>



make  of  the  Minister through  the  Director  of

Education a complete and absolute dictator in  all

matters educational. Now, I would like to make  it

clear  that I support much of this Bill but  I  am

not  prepared to support now or at any future time

dictatorial powers to the executive when they  are

completely unnecessary. It seems to me, Sir,  that

this  Bill  should be withdrawn or  at  least  its

Third Reading postponed until the Minister has had

time fully to digest its exact implications but if

the  Minister insists on the maintenance of  these

dictatorial  powers,  then I  for  one  will  vote

against the Second Reading of this Bill today.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  there is a great deal of good in this  Bill.

It   has  followed  more  or  less  the  All-Party

recommendation to bring all schools under a single

control  so  that every school will receive  equal

treatment.  In  the  past,  teachers   have   been

differentiated: Government teachers, aided  school

teachers  as well as private school teachers;  one

type  of  teachers  receiving  a  great  deal   of

benefit, whereas the other classes are left out in

the  cold. This Bill is trying to remove the caste

system:  the  high caste of the Government  school

teachers,  the  middle caste of the  aided  school

teachers  and the low caste of the private  school

and  vernacular school teachers. However, I  think

it has not gone far enough. In this Bill, you will

find that preferential treatment is still given to

Government school teachers and although you have a

very  large  number of aided schools  because  the

private or partly-aided Chinese schools will  come

under this system, yet no teacher can ever hope to

be  promoted to Inspector of Schools. Under clause

51,  the Governor may appoint any officer  of  the

Department  of  Education to be  an  Inspector  of

Schools.  This leaves all the other  teachers  out

completely,  whether they are good,  whether  they

are  able  or  whether, shall we  say,  they  have

qualifications  far  above  those  of   Government

schools. Every teacher in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>



country  is trying to serve Singapore in  his  own

way. Every teacher is performing the same duty  in

one  school  or  in another. They  should  receive

equal encouragement and equal treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill also I find, and I must say that I

have  to agree with the Member for Cairnhill  (Mr

Marshall),  that a great deal of  power  has  been

given to the Director of Education. This, I think,

is  a  wrong  administrative act and I  hope  that

Government will take into consideration  ways  and

means  of  removing such discontent.  One  way,  I

think,  that  will best remove such suspicion,  as

the Minister for Education has said that there  is

suspicion  and  criticism of  this  Bill  by  many

people  outside this Assembly, would be to  commit

this  Bill  to Select Committee after  the  Second

Reading and I propose moving that after the Second

Reading.  If  it is agreed to, this Bill  may  yet

turn  out  to be a good Bill after it has received

the  opinion of many people outside this  Assembly

who are more qualified to help us shape this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a great number of points in this Bill

that seem to be vague and seem to need revision. I

will  just  point out a few of these. At  page  2,

clause  3,  you  will find that the  Minister  may

exempt  from registration a school that is  purely

religious  in character. I will not grumble  about

that:  but  if the institution is one  for  higher

education,  we  would  like to  know  what  higher

education means. We need a definition on  that.  I

think  in the Federation they define that  and  we

should  also  define  what  higher  education   is

otherwise  it will be left to the opinion  of  the

Director or the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education Finance Board will have four

persons  to  be  appointed by  the  Minister.  The

Finance Board is one of the most important  Boards

in  this system. To leave it to the discretion  of

the  Minister alone and to allow him to appoint  a

person  or  to  sack him afterwards would  not  be

democratic.  I  remember that we  also  have  such

Boards  in  other  Bills.  I  refer  you  to   the

Singapore   Youth  Sports  Centre  Ordinance.   We

appoint these people by statute and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>



allow     institutions    to    nominate     their

representatives.  Here,  members  of  the  Finance

Board  should  be  people who are  connected  with

education  or  know something about education.  It

would  be  absolutely useless to appoint a  person

who  is  not  at  all  connected  with  education;

perhaps  when you are discussing the necessity  of

introducing special types of apparatus or  special

lessons that need extra provisions, he will be out

of  his depth. Sir, we have many institutions that

are good enough to come within this definition and

if  this Bill goes into Select Committee, we could

think of how to appoint such people to this Board,

not  by  the  whims and fancies  of  Ministers  or

Directors but by statute. Under this provision, as

the  Bill  now stands, anyone who is appointed  by

the Minister owes him allegiance and will probably

have  to  toe his line. It will be very  difficult

for  him  to be nonpolitical. If you look  at  his

duty, you will find that it is even more important

that he should be independent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Advisory Council under clause

8  (6).  Here you find that some institutions  may

appoint  their representatives but they  have  the

right  to  revoke such nominations.  Added  to  it

again,  the  Minister can also dismiss the  person

concerned.  The arguments for that have  been  put

forward  to  you, Sir, during the  debate  on  the

Polytechnic Bill and I think those stand for  this

provision too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Board under clauses 15 and 16 is

given  some sort of a power equivalent to that  of

the  Police  and  the Court but I  wonder  whether

decisions by the Appeals Board can be contested in

the  High Court because sometimes it may be a very

important  thing, like  the  cancellation  of   a

school, and if we have our democratic system,  the

High  Court  should  be  the  highest  organ   for

arbitration.  Would  it mean  then  that  such  an

appeal  cannot go to the High Court and that  this

Bill  will give police as well as judicial  powers

to  the  Advisory Council whose members are merely

nominated by the Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For registration under clause 23 (1) (b), the

Director  can give conditions for the registration

of schools. It is very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>



vague and should be made clearer. Under clause  23

(2),  the  powers given would be very wide  indeed

and  the  Director in every case can use  a  great

deal of discretion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 (a) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may refuse to register a school if

it shall appear to him that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) adequate educational facilities already

exist in the area...".



<br><br>I  would  like to point out to Government that  if

educational facilities were adequate in any  area,

then  no  such  schools would  ever  come  up  for

registration   and   this  clause   is   therefore

unnecessary. No one in his right mind will start a

school  in an area which probably will not attract

pupils:   it  will  be  like  carrying   coal   to

Newcastle. Clause 24 (e) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the area provided for the open air recreation

of pupils is inadequate or unsatisfactory;".



<br><br>We  know that the area in Singapore left for  open

fields is very limited and it would be too ideal a

condition. Many schools today have no open fields.

What  are  we going to do about these schools? Of

course,  if we have unlimited land, we  may  solve

this problem but I know that many schools will  be

affected by this clause. Under paragraphs (g)  and

(h)  of  clause  24,  I think they  are  aimed  at

private  schools where they say that the fees  are

excessive and the qualifications and experience of

the  proposed teachers are not adequate.  I  again

say that if such conditions ever exist, then it is

the  fault  of  the Government for  not  providing

sufficient  educational facilities for  the  young

people so that they have to pay excessive fees and

they   have   to   be  taught  by  teachers   with

insufficient qualifications or experience. I would

like   to  say  that  these  paragraphs  are   not

necessary  but  they could be removed  if  we  can

provide sufficient schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except with the approval in writing of the

Director, no Committee of Management shall  exceed

five persons in number."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 gives the power to the Director to

take  over  the affairs of a school by  appointing

additional managers to such a school. Sir, I would

like  the  Assembly to understand that people  who

come in to help us start a school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>



should  not  be discouraged. Again you  will  find

that  there are many people who are interested  in

giving  our young people a better deal to  provide

more facilities for our young people but they  may

or  may not know much about school affairs and  if

we  limit  the  Committee of  Management  to  five

persons, it will be very difficult indeed  to  run

any  public  school. Clause 27 (2) will definitely

discourage  all  people  who  are  interested   in

contributing  to  schools and in  helping  in  the

management of schools because, after they have put

in so much money, time and effort for the schools,

they  may  find  that  at  the  next  moment   the

Government steps in and the schools are not theirs

but will be run by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 28, we find that to be a member of the

Committee  of Management or to be the  supervisor,

you  must  have  the approval of the  Director.  I

wonder, Sir, if a person has shown a great deal of

interest, if a person knows about education or  if

a   person   helps  financially  and   wishes   to

contribute further towards education and to  serve

on  the  Committee, he has still to be  under  the

influence of the Director and approved by him.  It

really  will  discourage all people  from  helping

schools.  Probably,  they will  sit  back  and  do

nothing about it and I think that the position  of

education in Singapore will not progress  as  fast

as  it  should. After all, I think aided  schools,

private  schools and schools that are not  run  by

Government exceed the number of Government schools

and  they  cater for a larger number  of  students

than Government schools. Yet, if these clauses are

imposed on them now, we are going to put a stop to

voluntary  efforts.  It  is  not  going  to   help

education. It is going to impede education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again under clause 30, you have the Director's

approval  again. I meet with this phrase  so  many

times  that I put a marginal note on my  Bill.  It

seems  that  the  Director's  approval  is  almost

covering the whole of this Bill and that  if  you

want  to  help in the schools, you must have  this

approval;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>



if  you want to be a supervisor you must have this

approval  and  if you want to be a member  of  the

Committee   of  Management  you  must  have   this

approval.  In short, it means that if  I  want  to

help  in the matter of education voluntarily, then

I  must be a yes-man to the Director. I would  say

that  everybody wants education  to  go  on  in  a

certain  order and then finally arrive at a  fixed

point  where  they cultivate Malayan  loyalty,  or

Singapore loyalty with a Singapore outlook, and so

on.  But  if we have this system whereby everybody

is  under the control of one man, we will  have  a

system  producing a uniform type of people. Hitler

tried it out very successfully and he had all  the

youth  behind  him all regimented and  every  time

there  was a command, they reacted in exactly  the

same  way. We, however, are living in a democratic

country,  and I think everybody should be  allowed

to  develop in his own way without losing sight of

the final aim. We must not compel every school  to

react  in  the same way and I think that the  word

"approval"  should be drawn so that we  have  more

latitude for all other schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 29, a supervisor who has to be

appointed.  A  supervisor  has  not  only  to   be

approved by the Director but he also has to  carry

out  a  great deal of work from the Department  of

Education  and if he does not carry out  his  work

satisfactorily,  he  may  be  punished  under  the

penalties of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 33 (g) says that a person may not be

appointed  if he has attained the age  of  seventy

years.  This seems to me to be very funny  because

if  a  person who reaches the age of seventy years

or  over is still capable and is still willing  to

serve, I see no reason why he should be precluded.

I  know that there are many prominent people  over

the age of seventy years still doing very well and

making great contributions to the nation. This  is

a  very small point but it does seem to me  to  be

very,  very funny to exclude people of this  type.

It seems that this Bill has been gone through with

haste  and without much thought. Even under clause

38, you will find that:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may refuse to register a person as

a teacher if it appears to him that the applicant-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) has previously been refused registration as

a  manager on grounds which would also  have

precluded...".



<br><br>Now,   if   he  had  been  precluded  from   being

registered as a teacher, conversely he cannot also

become a member of the Committee of Management; it

does  not seem to be logical. A person may not  be

capable  of  becoming a teacher but  he  is  quite

capable  of helping to run a school. A person  may

not  be  capable of becoming a manager of a school

but  he may be good enough to be registered  as  a

teacher  and teach efficiently. I do not  see  how

these two could be connected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 29 (c), the duties of the

Supervisor  shall  be to report  to  the  Director

forthwith  by notice in writing, and from  another

section of the Bill it seems that he has to answer

immediately   every   query   of   the   Education

Department. This is in clause 54, Sir. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(i) If it shall appear to the Director that any

provisions   of   this  Ordinance   or   of   the

regulations   made  thereunder  have   not   been

complied  with in any school or that  any  school

is  not  being properly or efficiently conducted,

he  may,  without prejudice to any  other  powers

vested in him, by notice in writing addressed  to

the  supervisor direct him to take within a  time

to  be stated in the notice such measures as  are

in the notice specified...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be very unreasonable and I think the

only  way  out is to amend the clause so that  the

supervisor  need not take action within  "a  time"

but  within "a reasonable time". This will help  a

person who is trying to assist us in our education

to serve on this Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 51, Sir, with which I have already

dealt,  I  would say that it leaves out all  other

schools except Government schools. Government  has

all  this  while been trying to satisfy the  other

systems  of  schools. They are telling  them  that

they are now on a par and will not be stepsons any

longer. But if clause 51



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>



(a)  remains  in  its present  form,  it  will  be

another point where there will be a great deal  of

dissatisfaction  not only from  the  English-aided

schools,  but  from  all  Chinese  and  vernacular

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 53, the Bill now gives great power

to  the Director and his officers, and very little

respect  will  be  shown to  the  principal  of  a

school. I would ask Government whether this is the

present  procedure. It seems that heads of schools

are  now  to  be given a position much lower  than

what  they  used to have. Clause 53 (2) gives  the

officers  a  great deal of power, and  clause  56,

Sir,  states  that  any person wishing  to  appeal

against  a  decision of the Director shall  within

the  period prescribed deliver to the Director two

copies  of  a  statement in the  English  language

giving notice of his appeal. We passed a motion in

this  Assembly not so long ago agreeing to  multi-lingualism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Last year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We again stated that all

schools and all languages should be equal. It will

therefore  be  unreasonable to  ask  a  vernacular

school  to  reply or to appeal to the Director  or

the  Appeals Board in English when what they  know

is  only  Chinese, Tamil or Malay.  To  make  this

clause  more palatable and acceptable to everybody

concerned, I think that Chinese schools should  be

allowed  to  appeal in Chinese, Tamil  schools  in

Tamil  and Malay schools in Malay; English schools

will, of course, use English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I find that this whole Bill, although it is

an  effort  to  correlate every type of  education

into one (which is a good thing), is very bad when

put  in  its  present form, it  is  bad  from  the

administrative  point of view.  It  will  cause  a

great  deal  of  heartburn.  Instead  of  allaying

suspicion, instead of getting the co-operation  of

a  great many more people and bringing them to our

side,  we will probably find that if this Bill  is

not  further considered, it will create  just  the

reverse  result. I hope that Government will  take

this  into  consideration and agree  to  the  Bill

being considered by a Select Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I was told that the future of Singapore  was

being   decided  this  morning  by  the  Singapore

Polytechnic Ordinance, and that I have  missed  an

interesting  discussion on this and other  aspects

of  the  future development of Singapore. However,

being  much more mundane in my approach, I  choose

to  imagine that the future of Singapore  will  be

decided   more  by  the  educational   policy   of

successive Singapore Governments than by any other

single matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education policy which the British

Administration pursued in the past is  the  reason

for    the    confusion,   the    conflicts    and

contradictions with which our multi-lingual, multi-cultural  society is confronted  today.  In  their

desire  to exploit the natural resources  of  this

country,  they kept expenses and expenditure  down

to  the  barest minimum. Large undigested cultural

and  linguistic  groups  were  left  to  care  for

themselves. The Chinese community demonstrated  to

the  British  that they could care for themselves.

Now  any  government which comes into  power  must

take  account  of the pride of all the  management

committees,  and  of the Chinese population  as  a

whole, in having had the drive and the stamina  to

keep their cultural and linguistic world alive  in

spite    of    government    indifference - colonial

government  indifference - towards  them.  But   any

government which wishes to mould a Malayan  nation

must  sooner  or  later come  to  grips  with  the

problem   of   moulding  the   minds   of   future

generations of Singaporeans and Malayans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is one of principle: Is the

Government to decide the educational policy, or is

it  not?  It is clear from the report of the  All-Party  Committee  on  Chinese education  that  the

right   of   an  elected  government   to   decide

educational   policy   cannot   be   fettered.   A

government  must have the right to  implement  its

educational policy or perish. However,  I  do  not

agree   with   the  technique  the  Labour   Front

Government  has chosen to stockade  and  barricade

itself  behind  the Education Finance  Board,  the

Educational  Advisory  Council  and  the   Schools

Appeals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>



Board. A decision must either, be a quasi-judicial

decision  or an administrative decision. Democracy

means  that a people have the right to vote for  a

government which will have the right to  implement

a programme which it has put before the electorate

from  whom it has received a mandate. This is  the

first  major premise. But the technique of fencing

a  government  behind three statutory  bodies,  in

which the government has the power to nominate the

majority - the  overwhelming majority - is  not  one

which   is   likely  to  endear  itself   to   the

electorate, The Education Finance Board, according

to  clause  5 (2), is to consist of six people - two

officials  and  four  persons  nominated  by   the

Minister.  All  six  are  therefore  to   be   the

government's   men.   The   Educational   Advisory

Council, under clause 8 (2), is to consist  of  22

members. Of these, 14 will be government men,  and

eight  will  be non-government men  but  who  must

nevertheless  have  received  the  approval,   the

clearance, of the government. The Schools  Appeals

Boards,  under  clause 12 (2), is  to  consist  of

seven members. Of these, five are to be government

men, and two are to be non-government men but they

also are to be first approved by the government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the Minister for Education cannot expect

educational  institutions in this  Colony  to  sit

back  and  see  him stockade himself behind  these

statutory  tribunals so that  if  anything  should

happen, he can take an administrative act and then

bolster  such action by the support of the alleged

quasi-judicial decision of one of these  statutory

tribunals. For these tribunals, being filled  with

government   men,  will  in  fact  be   government

decisions.   The  question  of   how   far   these

councils - the Advisory, Finance and Schools Appeals

Boards - are  to  act  as quasi-judicial  or  purely

advisory  tribunals, must be decided on principle.

My proposal is that if the Minister wishes to have

the last word in every administrative act, then he

should  have  the  courage to let the  Educational

Advisory Council have a majority of unofficial  or

non-government members, so that if he  chooses  to

go  against  the advice of the Council  (which  he

should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>



be  entitled to do), he should be prepared to face

criticism from educational institutions and public

opinion, because he cannot bulldoze an educational

policy which is being resisted by the majority  of

our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can gather, the criticisms against

this Bill are on the administrative provisions  in

clauses  5,  8  and 12 relating to  the  Education

Finance  Board,  the Educational Advisory  Council

and the Schools Appeals Board; on the registration

of  schools  and the cancellation of registrations

in  clauses 24 and 25; and on the registration and

cancellation  of  certificates  for  teachers   in

clauses  38  and 39. Whilst the Government  should

have   an   unfettered  right  in   administrative

decisions,  questions as to  the  registration  of

schools and the cancellation of registrations, and

to  the registration and cancellation of teachers,

peculiarly lend themselves to consideration  by  a

quasi-judicial tribunal. The Minister will be well

advised   to  rid  himself  of  this  very   grave

responsibility of having to take away the right of

a  school  to exist, or the right of a teacher  to

continue   to   teach.   He   should   give   this

responsibility to an independent tribunal, to make

the decision on certain given principles laid down

beforehand, whether a school is to continue to  be

allowed  to exist, or a teacher should be  allowed

to  continue  teaching or should  cease  to  be  a

teacher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, therefore, I can sum up my Party's views

on  this  Bill  as follows: Questions  as  to  the

registration  and  cancellation  of  schools   and

teachers   should  be  sent  to  a  quasi-judicial

tribunal  so that the Minister will not  have  the

power  to make or the odium of having made a party

political  decision  against  either  schools   or

teachers.  As to the Education Finance Board,  the

Educational  Advisory  Council  and  the   Schools

Appeals  Board,  decisions, except  those  on  the

registration  and  cancellation  of  schools   and

teachers, must be executive ones because they  are

decisions  on  educational policy. Any  government

which  has not got the courage to state its policy

for  the  education of the future generation,  but

goes  beating about the bush hoping to get support

from all directions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>



and  finally  winding up with support  from  none,

will  not only perish, but will make the whole  of

Singapore perish with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be seconding a motion

by the Member for Serangoon to send this Bill to a

Select Committee. It is in the interests not  only

of  the  Government  and of the  Parties  in  this

Assembly, but of the whole of Singapore, that this

question of education should be fully debated  and

settled in a thorough manner.



<br><br>3.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, I would

like  to  support the proposal of the hon.  Member

for  Serangoon  that this Bill be committed  to  a

Select  Committee for further discussion. We  just

heard  the  hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  on  the

importance  of education. Allow me to add  further

comments.  We have made known to the  people  that

our political struggle at this stage only aims  at

self-government,  and that independence  is  still

far away. Why? This question has haunted me for  a

long  time.  At this stage, we are not  ready  for

independence, but what can we do to realise it? We

have  no guns and, even if we have, there  are  so

few   hands  to  hold  them.  However,  one   most

effective  weapon we can hold is the pen.  If  the

people  of  Singapore are more capable of  holding

the  pen  than  the  gun,  the  prospects  of  our

national  struggle  will be brighter.  Our  people

should be equipped with effective pens, and it  is

the  duty of the Minister for Education to do  so,

to   provide  us  with  an  effective  educational

policy.  When I came in just now, an  hon.  Member

asked  for my opinion on this Bill. I said  I  was

not  very happy about it. Indeed, I have not  been

happy  since  last April when the Minister  rushed

through  the White Paper. I have had no confidence

in  the Government's educational policy since then

because  the  White  Paper,  which  outlined   the

background of our whole educational system, was so

badly done,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>



created so many suspicions and even tried  to  run

down  a certain educational system. I believe  the

present  Bill  has been drafted by the  author  of

that  White  Paper, or that he has at  least  been

closely connected with drawing up the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My opposition to the White Paper was that it did

not  take  into consideration the vital  political

advancement  and  changes in this country.  Multi-lingualism, for example, has been accepted by this

country, yet our educational system, to judge from

the  White Paper and the present Bill, would raise

doubts  in  the  many educational bodies,  whether

Government  is following the lines recommended  by

the All-Party Committee as it professes to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section (v) in the All-Party Committee's report

says  that  the  greatest  hope  for  multi-racial

Singapore  will  be  to ensure  that  the  younger

generation  grow up under the best  conditions  of

intermingling; and that everything should be  done

to break down mutual exclusiveness between the two

streams   of  education,  that  is,  English   and

vernacular. As a member of the All-Party Committee

seeking  to  build  a true Malayan  nation  and  a

unified education system, I wonder how much  proof

Government  can  give to the people  that  it  has

implemented the recommendations of the  Committee,

recommendations made a year ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps someone will say to me. "You are a

Chinese  and  therefore you are bound  not  to  be

impartial  on  education;  you  are  bound  to  be

fighting only for Chinese education." Sir, I  take

this opportunity to make it clear that this is not

true. I fight for justice, for the true welfare of

the  people. If we accept the principle of  multi-lingualism  in  this country, how can  we  try  to

restrict  the  free growth of educational  systems

other  than  the English? The Bill is supposed  to

further the unification of educational systems  in

Singapore,  yet  it contains so many  restrictions

and  regulations  against this objective,  as  the

Member for Cairnhill has so clearly pointed out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no doubt, at this stage, the Chinese

schools  have  become  a  problem  child  of  this

country.  A top-ranking officer told me  not  long

ago that he was not worried even about gangsterism

but  that  he  was concerned about Chinese  school

students.  From such an attitude, we  can  perhaps

gauge  the  true  spirit  which  has  guided   the

drafting  of  the  Bill. Sir, my support  for  the

Government in the riots last October is  clear;  I

am  also aware of certain subversive activities in

schools.  But  Sir, still I cannot understand  why

Government   is   trying   to   introduce    these

regulations and restrictions on the free growth of

other educational systems, especially the Chinese.

Long  before  Government  considered  a  bilingual

system,  it was already being followed in  Chinese

schools  but never in English schools,  even  now,

two  years  after an elected government came  into

power. How many English school students are  there

who can read and write Chinese? But there are many

Chinese  school  students who can read  and  write

English  even  up to Cambridge School  Certificate

standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government believes that our

entrepot trade will always boom and bring us  rich

revenue,  and we are going to control and  provide

sufficiently for all educational institutions  for

the  people of Singapore, then I have no objection

at  all to this Bill. But if the Government should

one day find that its resources are dried up, when

the  price  of rubber drops to 50 cents per  pound

and   our  trade  shrinks,  and  under  the  Bill,

management  committees  must  register  and  their

existence  be  at the discretion of Mr  McLellan,

who may say, "No"...



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot find the name of Mr

McLellan  in  the  Bill; it is  "the  Director  of

Education".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir, it so

happens that my good friend, Mr McLellan, is  the

Director of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill on the registration

of management committees of schools alone worry me

a great deal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



Why cannot we truly follow the lines of the report

of  the All-Party Committee the Chairman of  which

was  the  Hon. the Minister for Education himself?

Can  we ignore its attempt, its spirit, to provide

beneficial   educational  institutions   for   our

people?  This Bill will only end further voluntary

contributions  to  promoting  education,  and  the

people  will not easily forget it. Government  has

proudly proclaimed that Malay education has always

been looked after properly and is provided for  by

Government, yet how many Malay schools  have  been

provided? And what have the Malay schools produced

in raising Malay cultural standards today?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the suspicions of, I may say, the majority

of the people, still exist. I do not like the word

"dictator"  applied to those in power,  but  I  do

think that the discretionary, extraordinary powers

provided by the Bill for the Director of Education

are  really unsound. I hope the Hon. the  Minister

for  Education can clear my doubts. There are many

more  like me outside this Assembly who would like

to know the answers to my two questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Do you sincerely believe every word of the

All-Party Committee's Report on Education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can you convince the people-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member should refer

to the Minister for Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. The second

question  is  whether the Hon. the  Minister  for

Education  can  assure us  that  he  has  not  the

slightest intention to restrict the free growth of

other educational systems?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions I ask may look odd and quite

silly,  but this is a transitional period  and  it

happens that the present Director of Education  is

an  expatriate; and, with due respect to the  Hon.

the  Minister  for Education, the people  are  not

convinced  that the Director of Education  is  not

his back-seat driver, especially as this Bill will

empower  the Director of Education to  cancel  the

registration of any school manager. Cannot we  add

a   proviso   that  he  can  do  so  only   "after

consultation with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



Permanent Secretary"? If this can be added to  all

the  clauses so bitterly criticised by the  Member

for  Cairnhill, all the trouble and time  will  be

saved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the proposal by the Member

for Serangoon that this Bill should be referred to

a Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

unfortunate  that my Director of Education  should

have  been  brought in and called  a  dictator  of

education  and other names which I  think  do  not

befit  him.  The  public  do  not  understand  the

intricate  government machinery. The  registration

of   schools   and  teachers  is  essentially   an

executive  function and must be  performed  by  an

executive  officer, in this case the  Director  of

Education.  But administratively, the Director  of

Education receives his instructions from me or the

Permanent  Secretary, and I can assure  the  House

that,  where  the Director of Education  is  given

discretionary powers under this Bill, he will  not

exercise those powers without the authority of the

Permanent Secretary (who is my chief adviser),  or

myself.  I  will see to it that, as soon  as  this

Bill  becomes law, administrative action  will  be

taken to provide this safeguard in my Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The Member for Cairnhill has

placed  a  lot of emphasis on clause 24 (o), (p),

(q),  clause 33 (i) and so forth, and he says that

in  clause  22  there can be no  appeal  where  an

application for registration has been  refused.  I

would  like to refer him to clause 56 where it  is

stated  that any person wishing to appeal  against

any decision - any decision - of the Director, can  do

so;  and of course it prescribes the form in which

the  appeal  is to be made to either  the  Appeals

Board or to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 48, the provisions under which the

public or the aggrieved parties must appeal to the

Minister involve questions of public security.  If

I  remember  rightly,  the  Member  for  Cairnhill

supported the subversion clause imposed on  us  by

the    Colonial    Secretary   in    our    recent

Constitutional Talks; he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>



said that the Government must have the courage to

face  the  public and prevent subversive elements

from  contesting elections. Now, this is a matter

which will come under clause 48; this is a matter

dealing with subversive elements, and...



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> It does not say so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Of course it does say so. The

Member for Serangoon referred to clause 51  under

which,  he says, the Government appoints by  name

an  officer of the Department of Education to  be

inspector of schools, and that that will preclude

members    of   other   schools   from   becoming

inspectors. That is, of course, not true. It only

means  notifying  in  the Gazette  the  names  of

officers  of  the  Department of  Education;  the

appointment   or  enrolment  of   inspectors   is

entirely   an  administrative  action.   If   the

Government  appoints teachers from other  schools

to   be   officers   of  the   Department,   they

automatically become officers of that Department,

and  they  are of course entitled to be appointed

as inspectors of schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is a very important one and, as

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar rightly  said,  the

country  must be given an educational policy  and

the   Government  must  be  unfettered   in   its

implementation. It is my intention to accept  the

proposal  put  forward by the Opposition  Parties

that   this  Bill  be  committed  to   a   Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon also says that the

implementation  of certain clauses  in  the  Bill

will  be  subject  to the whims  and  fancies  of

Ministers. Well, I think Ministers do  not  exist

on  whims  and fancies, and certainly no Minister

will ever exercise any discretion because he  has

certain whims and fancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have replied to all the important

points  raised,  and as this  Bill  is  going  to

Select  Committee,  I propose  to  cut  short  my

reply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>CHANGES OF ADDRESSES FOR VOTING PURPOSES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr William Tan</b> asked the Chief Secretary if

he is aware that persons residing in one area have

changed their addresses, without actually removing

from their existing residences, in order to enable

them  to  vote in another electoral division;  and

what  steps  he has taken or will take to  prevent

such a practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> The Chief Secretary is not

aware  that  there  is  any such  practice  as  is

alleged in the Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present system of maintaining the

electoral registers, changes of address which have

been   notified  by  electors  to   the   National

Registration  Office and duly  recorded  on  their

Identity  Cards  are immediately notified  to  the

Registrar   of  Statistics  in  his  capacity   as

Registration    Officer   under   the    Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance (Cap. 53)

for amendment of the electoral registers affected.

There  is  no enquiry into the truth of statements

regarding changes of address which are made to the

National  Registration Office,  and  it  would  be

administratively  impossible  to  institute   such

enquiries as a matter of routine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru should, however, be

aware   that  there  are  provisions   under   two

Ordinances  designed  to penalise  the  making  of

false  statements  as to residence.  They  are  in

sections  17  and 21 of the Singapore  Legislative

Assembly Elections Ordinance (Cap. 53), which deal

with claims and objections at the revision of  the

electoral registers, and in Regulation 16  of  the

Regulations made in accordance with section  4  of

the  Registration of Persons Ordinance, 1955.  Any

practice  of  the kind described in  the  Question

could  be adequately dealt with by the application

of these provisions.

<div align="center"><b>CONSTRUCTION OF ROAD FROM WEST COAST ROAD TO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>JURONG ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing whether he is  aware

that the construction of a 100 feet wide road from

West Coast Road to Jurong Road has started at  the

junction of the former with Chua Keh Hai Road, and

if he will state-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) what notice was given to the farmers in

that  area that a 100-foot strip was to  be

bulldozed through the land;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the number of houses, fruit trees, pig

sties, wells and other assets which are  to

be demolished; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the reasons why a 100-foot road has been

planned for this agricultural area.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> I am aware

that a main road with a reserve 100-foot wide  has

been  planned  linking West Coast Road  to  Jurong

Road, and that construction has commenced over the

first  400 yards of the reserve of a 22-foot  wide

carriageway from the junction of West  Coast  Road

and Chua Keh Hai Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) On the 28th January, representatives of the

Public Works Department and the Land Office

visited  the area to make arrangements  for

the  clearing of the land required for  the

first  400 yards of the proposed new  road.

They  visited every householder  whose  lot

was  affected, explained the scheme to  him

and  asked him whether he had any objection

to  trees  being moved off the  road  line.

Every owner was told



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>



that  formal  notices had not yet been  served

but  that  this  would be done  and  that  all

property  affected was being noted and  proper

compensation  would be paid. The  owners  were

assured  that there was no intention to  clear

the  whole 100-foot reserve but only the width

necessary for the road pavement and drains and

none  of them raised any objection. The scheme

was  also  discussed with  the  local  Chinese

headman  and  the  headmaster  of  the   local

Chinese School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th February, the owner of an attap house at

the  junction of West Coast Road/Chua Keh  Hai

Road  began  dismantling  her  house  and  the

bulldozer then started clearing trees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 12th February, a deputation of 3 farmers

were  brought  by  a  City Councillor  to  the

P.W.D. and  were  given  details  of  further

clearance  along the road line. At  about  the

same  time  the Rural Board Member  for  Pasir

Panjang  discussed this road scheme  with  the

Land  Office  and  expressed his  satisfaction

with the proposed arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal notices were served on 19th February, 1957

in  respect of the first 400 yards of the road

from  West  Coast Road. Warning  notices  have

also  now been served on owners of land within

the balance area of the road reserve to Jurong

Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The number of improvements affected by the

first 400 yards of the road are:-

<pre>

     1 House

     1 Bathroom

     2 Earth Wells

     1 Pig run



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>



     1 Pig sty

     4 Rambutan trees

     3 Star Fruit trees

     2 Banana trees

     3 Jambu Ayer trees

     7 Coconut trees

     3 Guava trees

     1 Sugar-cane

     2 Kuini trees

     2 Chempedak trees

     2 Jack fruit trees

     2 Beetlenut trees

     2 Bamboo trees

     1 Chiku tree

     1 Durian tree

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation for these improvements have all

been  agreed and payments made. The  P.W.D.

is  now  engaged in setting out the working

boundaries over the balance of the 100-foot

road reserve, and when this is completed, a

census of all houses, fruit trees and other

assets within these working boundaries will

be   made,  owners  notified  and  payments

agreed   or  effected  before  any  further

clearance is carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A 100-foot width is a standard planning

requirement for main roads and has the  same

effect   as   a  building  line  preventing

further   development  within  the  reserve

which  may be wasted if the road has  later

to be widened. It does not mean that a 100-foot  wide  strip is to be cleared  of  all

assets immediately in order to construct  a

22-foot  carriageway. The intention  is  to

take only so much of the land at present as

is  necessary  for the 22-foot carriageway,

side tables and drains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode,</b> pursuant to his reply to the following question for oral answer asked on 13th

February,  1957  (Official Report, 13th  February,

1957, Volume 2, No. 19, Column 1393):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr David Marshall asked the Chief Secretary whether he will make available to the English-reading public of Singapore by public

subscription  the  Information  Services'   Daily

Digest of Non-English Press,



<br><br>supplied the following answer on 5th March, 1957:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I promised in the Legislative Assembly in February

to  let  you have a proper answer to your question

on making available to the public the Daily Digest

produced by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



Information Services. I am sorry that I  have  not

succeeded  in  sending  this  letter  within   the

fortnight I promised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you probably know, the main purpose of the

Digest  is  to  keep  Government  Departments  and

Ministries  informed of views,  news  and  comment

about  Government  policies  as  reported  in  the

vernacular  newspapers.  We  have  been  able   to

provide   copies   in   addition   to   diplomatic

representatives  and a number of  business  firms,

who pay a subscription.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret, however, that it would not be possible

to increase the number of copies produced daily so

as  to make it available to the general public  on

application.  You  will, I hope,  appreciate  that

there is a limit to the number of copies which can

be  produced on a duplicating machine in the  time

available each evening.
