<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Amendment

[17th April, 1962] to Question [17th April, 1962],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of

Singapore that before arrangements are finalised for  a

closer  relationship  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya

and/or  the Borneo territories, and before any  request

is  made  b the Government of Singapore to the  British

Government for transfer of territorial sovereignty over

Singapore to the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia,  the

wishes  of  the voters of Singapore will be ascertained

by referendum and the Government will act in accordance

with  the  views  of  our citizens so expressed.".-(Mr

David Marshall).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To leave out from "That" in line 1 to the end and

insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"in view of the Government's clearly stated stand on

the question of merger, this House welcomes the

Government's introduction of the Singapore National

Referendum Bill in order to hold a referendum to

ascertain the wishes of the people on the mode and

manner of the inevitable reunification of Singapore

and the Federation of Malaya before arrangements are

finalised and before any request is made by the

Government of Singapore to the British Government for

transfer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



of   territorial  sovereignty  over  Singapore  to  the

Federation of Malaya or Malaysia".'- (The Deputy  Prime

Minister-Dr Toh Chin Chye).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir I mentioned yesterday that the P.A.P. was

just  like  Hitler a few years ago. The  S.P.A. is  no

different from Eichmann. The P.A.P. wants to write  oft

with  one stroke of the pen the will and views  of  the

people  of  Singapore on tile question  of  a  national

referendum. The S.P.A. is abetting in this intrique. It

is now singing the same tune and trying to seek concord

out of differences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture yesterday said that many people believed in merger, but what should be the form of merger? That is the question to be decided upon. The Member for Farrer Park also said that, in principle, everybody supported merger. The question is, how is tile merger to be carried out and what type of merger will it be? The Government should consult the people on the question of merger. Sir, the speeches of these two

fellow travellers are very attractive and may appeal to

some people. They may appear to be very democratic. But

if  we go more carefully and deeply into this, we  will

have  no  difficulty  in seeing through  their  tactic,

which is to confuse white with black, or, pointing at a

stag,  say  that  it is a horse. If the  Government  is

sincere in its wish to consult the people and let  them

decide  on the form of merger, then, first of  all,  it

must  collect all the views and concepts of the various

political  Parties  on  this question  of  merger.  The

Government  should then ask the people  which  type  of

merger they want, i.e., the type that is formulated  by

which political Party. The Government must abide by the

decision  of  the people and proceed to negotiate  with

the  Federation Government on that basis. That  is  the

only way for the Government to consult the will and the

opinions of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. secretly proceeded

with its talks with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



Federation Government on the question of merger  before

consulting the people, and now they have presented this

so-called   White  Paper  on  merger.  Now   what   the

Government should seek is whether the people  agree  to

or  oppose their White Paper on merger, i.e., the  form

of merger the people are faced with, for their decision

today.  Mr Speaker, Sir, this question is just like  a

barrel  of  rice  before it is  cooked,  that  is,  the

opinions and the views of all should be consulted. What

kind of rice are we going to cook, Teochew porridge  or

Kongfu  porridge? But now the P.A.P. is presenting  the

rice  already  cooked and burnt to the  people  and  is

asking  their views on it. Mr Speaker, Sir, the people

are  now asked to decide whether or not they accept the

burnt  rice  that  is  cooked by the  P.A.P.  (that  is

something  already done) and not on what kind  of  rice

they  are  going to eat. Therefore, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

there  should  only  be one question  at  the  national

referendum - whether the people want this White Paper  on

merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is perhaps in

order if, in his speech, he makes passing reference  to

the  White Paper and urges that it should be put to the

referendum.  But I might remind him that there  was  an

amendment   by   the   Member  for   Queenstown   which

specifically  asked that the question  be  put  to  the

referendum,   and  that  amendment   has   been   lost.

Therefore,  there cannot be a debate now on whether  or

not  that  question should be put. As I say, a  passing

reference to allow for Continuity Of a Member's  speech

is  permitted. But not a debate now on whether  or  not

that question should be put.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

had just concluded what I wanted to say on that point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park also

said yesterday that a national referendum is meant  for

the  Government to seek the views of the  people  on  a

certain  question, so as to enable the  Government  and

the  legislature to know what kind of merger is  to  be

adopted and what they should do on a certain issue.  If

there  is  only  one question on the ballot  paper  put

before the people, it is not enough because, if that is

so, then it is not possible to get the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



views  of  the people on a certain issue. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, that is what the Member for Fairer Park said.  The

Front benches of the Government on many occasions  have

also  made the same arguments as those advanced by  the

Member  for  Farrer Park. All these arguments  are  not

worth rebutting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister on 16th

of  March,  during  the course of  the  debate  on  the

National  Referendum  Bill,  pointed  to  the  national

referendum  held  in New Zealand as  an  example.  That

referendum  concerned  the question  whether  bars  and

restaurants should carry on their business after 6 p.m.

The  question before the electorate in New Zealand  was

whether after 6 p.m, bars and restaurants should  close

their  doors, and not whether they should  close  at  a

certain  hour  or whether after 6 p.m.,  what  kind  of

liquors should be sold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the 1st of October last year, the New Zealand Government put a question to the people to decide whether they wanted to ban nuclear weapons. The question was not how to ban them or to limit their number. Mr Speaker, Sir, the independence of Algeria is inevitable. According to the Associated Press news from

Paris,  on  8th April, the question put by  the  French

Government in a referendum was whether they would agree

to  the  Algerian peace proposals put  forward  by  the

President of France, General de Gaulle. In other words,

the  French  people were asked to decide  whether  they

agreed  to the French/Algerian cease-fire proposals  as

proposed  by  General de Gaulle. The  people  were  not

asked  to  decide  on  how the  cease-fire  was  to  be

achieved. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, the question  to

be  put  by  the Government of Singapore to the  people

should also be just one question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Deputy Prime Minister's amendment

is  to  ignore positively and openly the wishes of  the

people of Singapore at a future national referendum.  I

would  ask  the  P.A.P. and the Alliance  to  name  the

countries in which more than one question was  advanced

for the people to decide, That is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



why  I  say  that  the P.A.P. is more dictatorial  than

Hitler was and this is no exaggeration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Minister for Culture

criticised  the  amendment  moved  by  the  Member  for

Queenstown to delete the word "reunification".  Perhaps

he  has  learnt  his logic from Alex Josey  for  having

arrived at the conclusion that the Barisan Sosialis  do

not  want  to have reunification of Singapore with  the

Federation of Malaya. He advanced puerile arguments  in

the  same  way when he likened the Barisan Sosialis  to

the  Dutch. This is only worth a smile. We are  of  the

opinion that any constitutional proposals on a basis of

inequality will not be conducive to the true spirit  of

reunification,  especially when  the  White  Paper  has

clearly  shown that the merger proposals  are  not  for

what  you  can  call reunification.  The  Minister  for

Culture  has once again disclosed the P.A.P.'s trickery

of deceiving the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister, when he

moved his amendment, said that the Barisan Sosialis  in

their  desperation  were trying  to  create  suspicion,

distrust and confusion among the people of Singapore in

order to block the realisation of merger. He went on to

say  that this action of the Barisan Sosialis  was  not

only  childish and puerile but also dangerous and  that

it would lead to very regrettable consequences, such as

the  outbreak of racial conflict for which the  Barisan

Sosialis would be held fully responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the speech of the Deputy Prime

Minister, it would appear that the P.A.P. are  bankrupt

in their political theories. The poverty of the various

races in Singapore can only be improved on the basis of

a  non-communal arrangement. In other words, it is only

in  a society where there is no exploitation of man  by

man  that  poverty  can  be  abolished  and  there   is

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any constitutional arrangement is based on equality

of citizenship rights for all races, then there will be

no  racial  conflict or racial inequality. The  Barisan

Sosialis have never done anything or said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



anything  to create racial conflict or suspicion  among

the  people. Sir, it is necessary to unite the  workers

of  all  races and the intellectuals of all classes  in

Malaya  in  order to thwart any attempt to disrupt  the

unity  of  our people. This has been clearly stated  in

our  manifesto when our Party was founded.  Today,  the

people  are  mostly  concerned  with  the  question  of

whether  they  will  be deprived of  their  citizenship

rights  and  whether there will be any  safeguards  for

their  future  generations. This  fear  of  the  people

should not be overlooked by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the hon. Member is not

now embarking on a debate on citizenship. As I say, all

these  points can be mentioned in passing, but he  must

not  enter  into a debate or say anything  which  might

open  up  a  debate in regard to matters on which  this

Assembly has already come to a conclusion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I accept your ruling,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister said that the P.A.P. will

recklessly force the people of Singapore to swallow the

poison  given  by them at all costs. I  would  like  to

remind  the P.A.P. Government that they should shoulder

the responsibility for all consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we firmly oppose the amendment of the Deputy Prime

Minister. We cannot issue a blank cheque to be used  by

the  P.A.P. especially in connection with  the  future

national  referendum. If the Government is  sincere  in

wanting   the   people   to  decide   on   the   future

constitutional  arrangements, then it  should  withdraw

its amendment to the motion.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, in debating the motion before the House only those

people whose blood is dirty will have skin disease, and

only those whose souls are filthy will make nonsensical

speeches.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have heard unparlimentary expressions

in this Chamber but I think the expressions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



which have just been used take the first prize! I would

suggest   that   these   expressions   are   completely

unparliamentary and they ought to be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): If you consider

such  expressions  to  be unparliamentary,  I  withdraw

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we study the aim of the motion of the Member for

Anson  to  which  an amendment has been  moved  by  the

Government, it is an attempt to obtain cheap  publicity

in order to get the support of the masses and to create

uncertainty in their minds so that they will  hate  the

Government.  When he moved his motion, I observed  that

he was pretending to be a genuine democratic fighter by

alleging  that  parliamentary democracy  would  not  be

destroyed by the Communists but by the P.A.P.  He  also

said   that   the  present  practices  of  the   P.A.P.

Government  are  of  a dictatorial nature.  I  wish  to

emphasise   that  if  the  P.A.P. runs  a  dictatorial

administration, the Member for Anson will not now be in

this Chamber. History has shown us that in dictatorship

countries-for example, in Germany - many people  suffered

to  such  an extent that even the skin of human  beings

was  used to make shoes. But we can see in this Chamber

the  Member  for Anson crowing as loud  as  he  wishes,

airing his views and throwing criticisms as much as  he

likes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson intimated that he sympathised

with  the Back benches of the Government by saying that

they  had been influenced by the Front benches  of  the

Government.  We would like to state once  and  for  all

that the stand of the Back benches of the Government is

firm, unlike the wavering stand of the Member for Anson

who at one time challenged our Prime Minister to go  to

the  people but who subsequently did not carry out  the

challenge.  We  do not whisper among ourselves,  unlike

the  Member  for Anson who conversed in a whisper  with

the Member for Nee Soon when we were debating a certain

issue  once.  That clearly shows that he  has  no  firm

stand of his own.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker, Sir, some Members of the Opposition  have

said that the stand of the Government can be likened to

the  dictatorship  of  Japan. If the  attitude  of  the

Government could be so likened, we would then see heads

of  people  exhibited at street corners. But today  the

people  are  free to express their views  in  the  true

tradition of parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should not say what we like as

regards the referendum on merger with the Federation of

Malaya. When we talk about reunification or merger,  it

means there are two things which should be agreed  upon

by  two  sides. If one side insists on its  view  only,

then  it  means  that it is forcing the other  side  to

accept its view. On the issue of merger, we must try to

understand  the  views of the other side  in  order  to

reach  a mutual agreement. Then only can we come  to  a

certain  understanding. For instance,  if  the  Barisan

Sosialis  really  believed  in  complete  merger,  they

should  have  the courage to move a positive  amendment

using  the  phrase "complete merger". But instead  they

have kept on harping on the White Paper on merger which

has  been  accepted  by  the  Assembly,  and  they  are

wavering in their stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown said that he shared the

sentiments expressed in the motion moved by the  Member

for  Anson.  This means that he agreed with  the  views

expressed by the Member for Anson. They have said  that

they  want  complete merger outside this Assembly,  but

not in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I heard the Member for

Upper Serangoon saying that the P.A.P. have twisted and

turned the merger issue into a reunification problem. I

think  there  is  no  difference  between  merger   and

reunification, because Singapore originally was part of

Malaya.   Reunification   means   a   return   to   the

fold - except, of course, if the intention is to  reunite

Singapore  with  Taiwan  or with  some  other  country!

Singapore  and  Malaya  are  one.  If  we  talk   about

reunification, it, is not incorrect in the  true  sense

of, the word, unless it is the intention of some people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



to  mislead the masses. If they cannot accept the  word

"reunification", then it is hard to understand why they

support  the  motion moved by the Member for  Anson  in

which  the  word  "reunification"  is  used.  They  are

speaking  with their tongue in their cheek in order  to

confuse the people. It should be the responsibility  of

every Member of this Assembly to give a true picture of

the situation to the people and not to twist the facts.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Did I hear the Member right when

he  said that the term "reunification" appeared in  the

motion  standing in the name of the Member  for  Anson,

because I cannot find the word "reunification" in  that

motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of order, Sir.

Perhaps I can be of assistance, Sir. You will find that

the amendment as moved by me was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House welcomes the Singapore National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain the wishes of the people ...'-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am talking about the motion. We

have  disposed of the Member for Anson's amendment.  My

question  was  whether the Parliamentary Secretary,  by

indicating  that the term "reunification"  was  in  the

motion  of  the Member for Anson, meant it was  in  the

motion standing in the name of the Member for Anson, or

in   some  other  motion,  or  possibly  the  amendment

proposed  by the Member for Anson which did  not  leave

out the word. "reunification".



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the word "reunification"

was used in the amendment. I am only touching on it  in

passing. .1 was saying that some support the use of the

term "reunification" while others object to its use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion moved by the Member for

Anson,  to  which an amendment has been  moved  by  the

Government, clearly shows that the mover is  attempting

to obtain cheap



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



publicity in order to get the support of the people and

at the same time to confuse their thinking.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I seem to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson should just

rise and say, "On a point of order," because of the

lapse of time in interpretation. So I have not really

heard what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime

Minister was going to say. The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The point of order being that the

Standing  Order says that one should not  question  the

motives of a Member of the Assembly in bringing matters

before the Assembly. Am I not right, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Possibly the Standing Order referred to

is Standing Order 46 (6) which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No Member shall impute improper motives to any other

Member.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Member for Anson is alleging

that   the  Parliamentary  Secretary  has  imputed   an

improper motive.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I suppose that is

without question an allegation of improper motive.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> And the words used being?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The words being that I am seeking cheap

publicity, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, I must confess that the Speaker

has  never been a politician, but I am sure politicians

would like publicity, whether it is cheap or expensive!



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Singapore  National Referendum Bill was tabled  in  the

Assembly and it is now to go to Select Committee.  This

clearly shows that it is the Government's intention  to

hold  a referendum, otherwise there would be no purpose

in  tabling  the  Bill. If it is against  the  Standing

Order,  I do not wish to comment further, but everybody

knows this. If the sex of a fish can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



be   identified  in  water,  what  more  we   who   are

politicians?  We should not confuse the  minds  of  the

people,  if we are true representatives of the  people;

and we should not fail to voice their views.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite

sure  that many people are perturbed over this talk  of

democracy which amounts to a big farce as propagated by

the  P.A.P.  The  issue is quite  simple:  whether  the

Government wants to seek the approval of the people  on

their White Paper proposals. And whether the Government

is  prepared  to  accept the wishes of  the  people  as

expressed in the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the very fact that the Deputy Prime Minister, in

moving  his  amendment, has conveniently left  out  the

very  last  part of the motion moved by the Member  for

Anson, viz., "will act in accordance with the views  of

our  citizens so expressed", is a clear indication that

the Government has no intention whatsoever of accepting

the views of the people if those views are going to  be

contrary  to the Government's proposals for  merger  as

contained in the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been accused of being people who want to

wreck the parliamentary system. I am quite certain that

anybody with an average intelligence will realise  that

the  way  the P.A.P. proposes to go about holding  this

referendum  will,  in  fact,  wreck  the  parliamentary

system.  It  will make the word "democracy" a  mockery.

All  that  we have been saying is: here you  have  your

proposals  contained in the White Paper as  adopted  by

this  Assembly, with the support of the S.P.A. and  the

P.A.P.  And  we  feel  that the people  must  be  asked

whether  they support these proposals or they  do  not.

The  question to be posed to the people should  be  one

that  is  simple and that does not seek to confuse  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure we can all remember the confidence with which

Government Members spoke during the debate on the White

Paper. If they are that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



confident, if they are quite sure that the only  people

who   oppose   the  White  Paper  are   the   so-called

Communists, and that everybody else wants merger on the

terms  proposed by the Government, then  why  are  they

afraid to pose a very simple question to the people?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Thomson is doing

exactly  what  I said to the Member for Choa  Chu  Kang

that he should not do, and that is to debate on why the

White  Paper should or should not be put to the people.

The  reason  is  that that question  has  already  been

debated and has been rejected by this Assembly. I  have

indicated  that, for continuity of speech,  the  Member

for Thomson can just mention the matter in passing, but

not  urge  once  again that the only question  for  the

referendum should be the White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was just going to mention that in

passing, Sir. The point I want to stress is that  if  a

referendum  is  held, it should not be merely  for  the

sake  of  form. It should not be just to show that  the

Government wants to consult the people. But, in  actual

fact,  it will merely be a form used to get the support

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has already been pointed out that what the

Government is thinking of is along the lines of  posing

two  alternative questions. And in all likelihood,  the

two alternatives will be unacceptable alternatives.  If

the  people are going to be asked to choose between two

evils,  then quite certainly there will be some  people

who  will  be uncertain. They may send in blank  votes.

And the Government has thought fit to have a proviso in

the Referendum Bill couched -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Thomson is

completely out of order. That particular clause in  the

Bill   is  now  under  consideration  by  the.   Select

Committee and he cannot refer to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> What I do want to point out, Mr Speaker,

Sir, is the motive of the Government in wanting to hold

this  referendum.  It  is not  its  genuine  desire  to

consult the views of the people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



because they are committed to consult the people.  They

want  to  work out a form which is going to be used  to

bulldoze their White Paper proposals through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the intention of the Government is not to

accept  the  decision  of  the  referendum,  then   the

consequences are going to be very serious.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> So that

you can start trouble!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Let me make it quite clear. It is not

trouble created by individuals that I am talking about.

There  have been accusations that the Barisan  Sosialis

has been responsible for creating communal tension. The

movers of the merger proposals have right from the very

beginning approached the problem purely from a communal

point  of view. We all know that if today Singapore  is

not going to be accepted as a constituent unit like any

other  State in the Federation of Malaya, if the people

of Singapore are not going to be accepted automatically

as  Federal citizens, it is because the majority of the

people  in  Singapore are Chinese. This is a  blatantly

communal  approach. And having made the approach  right

from  the very beginning on a communal basis, and  now

giving  the  people the choice to reject  categorically

the proposals as contained in the White Paper which are

based  on  inequity, it is inevitably going  to  create

trouble.  Whether this is said or not said is not  very

important. I refuse to believe that the people  can  be

forced  into  accepting a constitutional  arrangement,

whereby  they  are going to be treated as  second-class

citizens. I wish to assure you again: I do not want  to

start  and  I  am not going to start a  debate  on  the

merger  issue.  But it is pertinent,  Sir,  to  mention

this:  in  examining the motion before the  House,  the

purpose  in wanting to hold a referendum should  be  to

determine   whether  the  people  support  the   P.A.P.

proposals  or  not. And if the people  do  not  support

them, then they should not be proceeded with. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



I  have  said, if, firstly, the machinery provided  for

consulting  the  views of the people  is  going  to  be

inadequate; secondly, the form in which the people  are

going  to be asked to approve or disapprove the  P.A.P.

proposals  is going to be inadequate; thirdly,  if  the

Government  is  determined to push through  this  White

Paper  arrangement, irrespective of the desire  of  the

people;  then it does not take a superman  to  forecast

that  the repercussions are going to be serious.  As  I

have said, the Government Members have always said that

they  are  confident the people will support the  White

Paper.  According  to them, it is  only  the  so-called

Communists who oppose merger. In the words of  some  of

the Government Ministers, there are only 300 Communists

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are a big boy now!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Surely, Sir, the Government is not

suggesting now that it has lost the confidence  of  the

voters  they  had  in  the past. I  tell  this  to  the

Government benches, Sir - better not commit atrocities in

the   name  of  democracy.  Sir,  some  of  the   worst

atrocities in the world have been committed in the name

of  democracy.  I  am sure Members  on  the  Government

benches  do  not want to be democrats like Chiang  Kai-shek,  Syngman Rhee and so on and so forth. We  do  not

want  to say that we are genuine democrats and that  we

are defenders of the towers of parliamentary democracy,

etc.  It does not matter what we are called. But it  is

those   honourable  Members  sitting  on  the  opposite

benches who have been saying that they are champions of

democracy.  Let  us work out a simple, straight-forward

arrangement  so that you get the views  of  the  people

quite categorically. Do not tell them to choose between

two  evils  and  give them not even the alternative  of

putting a blank vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referenda held elsewhere in the world have always

been,  to the best of my knowledge, in the form of  one

simple  question:  "Do  you  support  the  Government's

decision on this, or do you not?"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



Yes  or no. If the purpose is not genuinely to seek the

views  of the people but to force them to give  support

to  the  Government,  then I  say,  Sir,  this  is  not

democracy.  This is hypocrisy. I am sure, Mr  Speaker,

that  we  have all heard of the term "guided democracy"

in  this  part of the world. What the P.A.P. Government

is  trying to practise is not even guided democracy. It

is "guarded democracy".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if ambitious men in an attempt to save their own

political   career  want  to  try  to  bulldoze   their

constitutional  arrangements through, the  consequences

are  going to be serious. And let this be a warning.  I

say  that whatever the consequences as a result of  the

acts  of the Government, the responsibility should  lie

squarely on the shoulders of the men who hold the reins

of government.



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

to  oppose  the  amendment moved by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister.  The original motion of the Member for  Anson

was  to seek an assurance from the Assembly that  there

will  be  a referendum on merger. Sir, since my  Party,

the   United  People's  Party,  first  called  on   the

Government  on  18th September, 1961,  to  refer  their

proposals  to the people for decision in a  referendum,

the  Government have made many pronouncements  agreeing

that  there will be a referendum. But the Deputy  Prime

Minister's  amendment goes one step  further  than  the

assurance on the referendum which the Member for  Anson

seeks.  It is going to ask the Legislative Assembly  to

provide  a cloak for the questions which the Government

are  going to frame in the referendum ballot paper.  If

the  questions framed are unfair and undemocratic,  the

Government  will try to seek cover by saying  that  the

Legislative  Assembly has approved them, which  is  far

from  the truth. What is meant by "the mode and  manner

of  the  inevitable reunification of Singapore and  the

Federation  of Malaya"? The Deputy Prime  Minister  has

not  explained  its  meaning to us. However,  from  the

speech of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Culture, it seems to us that  the  voters

will  be  asked to choose whether they want the  P.A.P.

merger  proposals  or the so-called Penang  or  Malacca

type of merger. Is that what is meant by "the mode  and

manner  of  merger"? Does it mean that the people  will

have  to  choose between two types of merger,  both  of

which  they  do  not want? Mr Speaker. Sir,  what  the

people  want  is a complete merger where all  Singapore

citizens, wherever they are born, automatically  become

Federal  citizens. The net result of the  amendment  of

the  Deputy Prime Minister is to shift the emphasis  on

whether  there  is  going to be a referendum  on  to  a

different  issue.  The Legislative Assembly  is  to  be

asked  to give its sanction to the questions which  are

to   be   framed  by  the  Government  in  the   coming

referendum.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  the  U.P.P. therefore

oppose   the  amendment  moved  by  the  Deputy   Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was, "That this

Assembly  solemnly  assures the citizens  of  Singapore

that  before  arrangements are finalised for  a  closer

relationship with the Federation of Malaya  and/or  the

Borneo  territories and before any request is  made  by

the  Government of Singapore to the British  Government

for  transfer of territorial sovereignty over Singapore

to  the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia, the wishes of

the   voters  of  Singapore  will  be  ascertained   by

referendum  and the Government will act  in  accordance

with the views of our citizens so expressed.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved, to leave out

from  "That" in line 1 to the end and there  to  insert

"in  view  of the Government's clearly stated stand  on

the   question  of  merger,  this  House  welcomes  the

Government's  introduction of  the  Singapore  National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain  the  wishes of the people on  the  mode  and

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No Member wishes to speak? The Member for

Anson has the right of reply.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first thing

that  needs  to  be asked is why the Member  for  Anson

brought up this motion. It could not be -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister has lost his

opportunity if he wants to speak in that strain. We are

now  on  the  motion as amended. In  other  words,  the

original  motion proposed by the Member for  Anson  has

been  rejected by this Assembly. Therefore, the  motive

as to why he brought that motion to the Assembly is out

of place. We are discussing the motion as amended.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> With due respect, Sir, I wanted to

explain  why  we brought our amendment. The  terms  and

wording of our amendment act as a counter to the motive

which inspired the Member for Anson to move his motion.

I am not going to discuss the merits or otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think that speech should have been made

immediately after the Deputy Prime Minister  moved  his

amendment.  That was the time to say why the Government

chose  to  move  its amendment and why  the  Government

thought the Member for Anson moved his motion.  We  are

now on the motion as amended, and the debate must be on

the content of that amended motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amended motion

is in view of the Government's clearly stated stand.  I

want  to  show that this Government has clearly  stated

its  stand,  whereas the debate has been on  the  lines

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



Government has not indicated its stand and therefore it

is   necessary   to  pressurise  the  Government   into

accepting  and  giving an assurance that  a  referendum

will  be  held. I submit, Sir, that nobody - neither  the

Member   for  Anson  nor  the  Barisan  Sosialis - really

believes that a referendum will not be held. Therefore,

in  trying to defeat the Government's amendment and  in

trying   to   call   into  question  the   Government's

amendment, they had a specific purpose in doing so  and

it is necessary for us to understand what these motives

are.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid the Minister is too

late.  That speech should have been made when  we  were

debating  the  amendment proposed by the  Deputy  Prime

Minister.  That was the time when that type  of  speech

could  have been made. Now we are debating the  amended

motion  and, therefore, the speeches should be confined

to  the content of that amended motion. The Minister is

quite  right if he says he wishes to indicate that,  in

fact,  the Government has clearly stated its  stand  on

the  question  of merger. As far as that is  concerned,

that is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Well, Sir, the Government indicated

its  determination to hold a referendum firstly on  its

own  initiative  long  before the  idea  of  holding  a

referendum was even a twinkle in the eye of' the Member

for Anson. The Government has clearly indicated that it

will consult the people on the terms and conditions  of

merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> But it is now backing out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Anson has just said

that the Government is backing out. In this connection,

Sir,  I  have made it a point that any time the Barisan

Sosialis  or the Member for Anson says, "It is  raining

outside," I suggest humbly, Sir, that before we believe

this,  we should go outside and first find out  whether

it  is  raining or not, because they have got into  the

habit - and  the  Member for Anson is obviously  learning

from the sergeant-majors in the Barisan Sosialis - of distorting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



facts. In fact, the strongest expression that I

can   use  is  to  say  that  they  are  indulging   in

falsehoods.  They  query  whether  the  Government   is

serious  about  holding a referendum or whether  it  is

going to back out. The Member for Anson has quoted  the

Prime  Minister as having said in this Chamber on  16th

March - and this is reported in the Straits Times of 17th

March:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If there was the slightest risk of merger being

frustrated and the country plunged into disaster by the

activities of the Communists, let me say that  it  will

be criminal folly on the part of the Government to hold

the  referendum and to allow the future of  Malaya  and

Malaysia to be imperilled.'



<br><br>Therefore,  Sir,  the Member for Anson  maintains  that

this  is an indication that the Government is going  to

wriggle  out  of  its promise to hold a  referendum  to

consult  the  people  on the conditions  and  terms  of

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said. Sir, I have come to the conclusion

that  when  a Member from the Barisan Sosialis  or  the

Member  for  Anson says that it is raining outside,  we

must go outside and check first. I went out and checked

the  quotation concerned. This quotation from the Prime

Minister's  speech  was  only a  part  of  an  argument

leading  to  a  conclusion.  The  conclusion  following

immediately  after the sentence is in black  type,  and

unless  the Member for Anson was as blind as a bat,  he

could not have overlooked the following sentence in the

Straits Times of 17th March appearing in black type:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If that were the position, if the risk existed then,

it  is the duty of the Government to go through with it

[referendum]  to  ensure that the peace,  security  and

happiness of the people, not just of Singapore  but  of

Malaya and Malaysia, are not jeopardised.'



<br><br>Therefore. Sir, I submit to you -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. I have been

misrepresented to the knowledge of the Chair - I  suggest

it is a point of order - that part of the speech which  I

am alleged to have been so blind as not to have noticed

was  read out by me in this Chamber in my speech on the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. But there is

an  opportunity  which the Member will have - unless,  of

course, the Minister gives way at this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



moment - an opportunity of correcting a misrepresentation

under  the  provisions of Standing Order 43  (4)  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Member who has spoken to a question may again be

heard to offer an explanation of some material part  of

his speech which has been misunderstood;'.



<br><br>If the hon. Member wishes to correct what he alleges to

be  a misrepresentation, he will have an opportunity to

do  so unless, as I say, the Minister gives way now and

the Member for Anson can explain it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, in that case, may I rise on a point

of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am always willing to give way to a

misguided -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister just gives way. That is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They are incapable of courtesy, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I now repeat what I have said, that that

is  a falsehood - the allegation that that statement  was

not  made  in this House, as the records of this  House

can  prove,  and  I ask the Minister to  withdraw  that

allegation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I understand what is the allegation

complained of?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I made a certain

speech  yesterday. It is alleged by  the  Minister  for

Culture  that  I was so blind that I did  not  see  the

paragraph  immediately following  the  first  paragraph

quoted  which  was in black type in the Straits  Times,

and   that  I  had  thereby  misrepresented  the  Prime

Minister by not reading it. I am informing you, Sir - and

I know I cannot expect your memory to recollect it, but

it  is  on  the records - that in truth and in  fact  the

Minister  for  Culture is perpetrating a  falsehood  in

saying  that  I  had not read out in full  that  second

paragraph  in  my  motion when I  addressed  the  Chair

yesterday afternoon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is always

difficult to follow the logic of the Member for  Anson,

because  I recollect, Sir, that he spent the best  part

of  about  20 minutes going through a series of  verbal

explosions   to   say   that  this   quotation   showed

conclusively that the Prime Minister had indicated that

a  referendum  may not be held: Whereas my  contention,

Sir, is that it is quite clear from the quotation -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> He

had a mental blackout!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - that the Prime Minister had

indicated that there are people who think this way  but

that  it  is  the duty of the Government to go  through

with the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> To go through with Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It does not say Malaysia. It says here

to go through with it, that is, with the referendum. If

there  is  the  slightest risk  of  the  country  being

plunged  into  disaster  by  the  activities   of   the

Communists,   it   is  the  duty  of   the   Government

nevertheless  to  go through with the  referendum.  The

reason why the Government is holding the referendum  is

also the reason which worries the Barisan Sosialis  and

the Communists who guide them and the Member for Anson.

They  are not afraid that we are not going to hold  the

referendum. They are afraid that we are going  to  hold

the  referendum. But what they really want to  know  is

what happens after that. That is what worries them, not

the  fact  that we are not going to hold the referendum

but  what  happens  to those who  have  embarked  on  a

dangerous enterprise. This enterprise started off as  a

short-cut  for  some  of  them  to  become  the   Prime

Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, and so on. But now

it  has become a hazardous journey where the Communists

follow the usual strategy of committing people first on

little things to a course of action from which there is

no  retreat;  and today, nine months after,  they  have

come  to  a  position where the battle is not  to  make

individuals Prime Minister, Deputy Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



Minister,  and  so  on.  Here is  an  issue  where  the

Communists, having committed them, are driving them  to

go  further  and  further into a  morass.  It  has  now

reached  a  stage where the referendum  battle  decides

bigger  issues - not the issue of merger as such, because

everybody  accepts  merger in  principle.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  accept merger in principle.  The  Member  for

Anson accepts merger as a concept. Even the Member  for

Hong Lim accepts merger as a concept. So the reason why

they  are  worried and will be worried by the amendment

of  the  Government  is,  first,  it  disposes  of  any

propaganda  attempt  by  the Barisan  Sosialis  that  a

referendum  will not be held. In fact,  I  submit  that

they  know  a  referendum is going to be held,  because

during the last three weeks, the Barisan Sosialis  have

been  on Sunday hikes organising their followers to  go

canvassing. If they believe that there is not going  to

be  a  referendum, they will not be wasting their  time

going  from  house to house to canvass. Most  of  these

canvassers included young children with dried  milk  on

their  lips, and they went from house to house bleating

about phoney merger about which they knew nothing.  All

these  are  indications that the Barisan Sosialis  know

that  the referendum is going to be held, and  so  they

have  started campaigning. Therefore, what then is  the

real issue? As I have said, Sir, the first is they  are

worried that the referendum might be held after all and

of  what  will  follow as a result of  it  being  held.

Therefore, their real objective is to ensure  that  the

questions  to  be put to the people are  couched  in  a

language  which will help to confuse the  people  about

the  terms and conditions of the referendum or,  as  we

have said, the mode and manner of the merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all their speeches amount to. "Please tell us

how  you are going to conduct the referendum? What  are

the  questions that will be asked? Will you please  put

them  in  such  a  way that it will  help  the  Barisan

Sosialis  to  accomplish their  one  purpose - to  defeat

merger?"  Whereas  we have said that  the  question  of

merger does not arise but only the terms and conditions

of merger. We anticipate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



that if the terms and conditions of merger  are

put  to  the  people  in  a clear  and  straightforward

manner, the chances are that the vast majority  of  the

people  will  vote for conditions which will  safeguard

their  interest.  What have the Barisan  Sosialis  been

saying in their propaganda? "Do not have merger because

Malay  shopkeepers will take over Chinese shops."  That

is  one  of  their  lines. "The Malays  will  rule  the

Chinese." So what they really want is the question, "Do

you  want the Malays to rule the Chinese?" - or something

like  that.  So  it  is  our  duty,  when  putting  the

questions,  to  ensure  that that  type  of  propaganda

becomes  pointless. I am just giving  an  illustration,

Sir.  The Barisan Sosialis have always maintained  that

they  want  merger  like Penang and Malacca.  You  will

remember, Sir, that the Member for Queenstown yesterday

had to get up and deny vehemently that he ever said  it

and  I quoted from the text of a letter. They know that

if we put the Barisan Sosialis merger proposals instead

of  the White Paper merger proposals to the people, the

chances are that the people will reject the former. Yet

they  go around telling the people, "These White  Paper

merger proposals are no good because it will mean  that

most  of the citizens of Singapore will have to reapply

and  pass a language test in Malay." So in view of  the

attempt  by the Barisan Sosialis and their henchmen  to

confuse  the  people  on the merger  proposals,  it  is

necessary  for the Government to pose the questions  in

such  a way that the people will vote not for what  the

Barisan  Sosialis allege the White Paper proposals  are

but for what the White Paper proposals in fact are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many people, not necessarily the

Barisan  Sosialis,  have  asked,  "Well,  why   is   it

necessary  for  the Government to go through  with  the

referendum  on merger? After all, for 15  years,  every

political  Party has made merger a major plank  in  its

political  platform. Now after 15 years,  merger  is  a

matter  of practical politics." It may not be the  best

type  of  merger; it may not be a perfect  merger.  But

this is the kind of merger which we, to the best of our

ability, have been able to achieve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



and  nobody  has  been able to suggest anything  better

than  what  we  have  achieved.  The  Barisan  Sosialis

counterproposals,  when  followed  to   their   logical

conclusion -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I thought we

were  on this messy motion. Are we discussing the White

Paper, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have tried to steer the debate on this

particular motion away from the debate on the merits of

one  type of merger as against another type of  merger.

But  I have also said that, for continuity of speeches,

passing  references  to these matters  could  be  made.

Perhaps the Minister will bear that in mind and not  go

into details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It has been suggested that since we

have been elected on the platform of merger there is no

need  for  the Government to go back and refer  to  the

people  for fulfilling an election promise we made.  It

has  been suggested that the Government should go ahead

and  implement  the merger proposals. But nevertheless,

though constitutionally and even morally the Government

has the right to do that, -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> P.A.P. right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - we have other reasons for going

ahead  with the referendum simply because we know  what

the  Barisan Sosialis, the Barisan Sosialis  Communists

and  their  henchmen are up to. I think the Member  for

Thomson,  in the course of his speech, gave an  inkling

that  if this merger goes through there is going to  be

trouble. We knew sometime ago that sooner or later  the

Communists having lost out on their ideological  battle

will  have to plunge into the racial battle. They  know

that  they  have  lost this round  in  the  battle  for

merger.   Merger  is  coming.  They  cannot  stop   it.

Therefore,  they are interested in what  happens  after

merger. How can they create a situation whereby in  the

post-merger period -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I do urge

that  the  rules of the House be observed and  that  we

maintain the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



speeches to the issue before the House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was watching the motion very carefully

when  the  Minister was talking. He is on the verge  of

becoming irrelevant. But if he is relating his  remarks

to   the   expression  "inevitable   reunification   of

Singapore  and  the Federation of Malaya",  perhaps  he

should not go into greater details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I was saying that we are going

ahead  with the referendum when we have no need  to  do

so.  In  bringing up this amendment, we are bearing  in

mind  not  the  battle for merger but the battle  after

merger.  It  is therefore necessary for me to  indicate

the  kind of battle that is going to be fought out.  In

bringing  up  this amendment and in going through  with

the  referendum, we are preparing the  ground  for  the

coming battle after merger. The Communists have decided

that they have lost the ideological struggle for merger

and  that  therefore they must create  a  situation  in

which  they will ensure that merger leaves in its  wake

bitterness   and  perhaps  bloodshed.   Therefore,   if

anything   happens  after  merger,  say   an   economic

recession,  they will be able to say, "There  you  are,

all  this  is  because of merger which was rammed  down

your  throats. The P.A.P. sold you out to  the  Malays.

That  is  why you are suffering." Therefore, to prevent

that  sort  of thing, it is necessary for us to  ensure

that merger comes with the approval of the people.  The

people must be satisfied enough to say, "Well, we voted

for  the conditions and terms of merger." Though  there

is  no  need  for the Government to go ahead  with  the

referendum,  that is why we decided to go through  with

it on our own initiative. Nobody prompted us to hold  a

referendum.  We  want to ensure that after  merger  the

Communists will not be able to exploit the feeling that

they  are trying to create among the people that merger

is  a  sellout: it is being rammed down their  throats.

That is why the Government have -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Why do you not accept the motion?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We do not accept it because it was

originally  propounded  for the  glorification  of  the

Member  for  Anson.  He is the paranoic  rooster  which

always  crows  and says, "Every time I  crow,  the  sun

rises."  He also wants to give the impression  that  it

was  he  who  forced the Government to  bring  about  a

referendum.  That is the whole purpose of  his  motion.

The  Government's amendment refers to the fact that  it

was  the  Government  which  initiated  the  referendum

because,  as I have said, the Member wants to give  the

impression that the cock crowed and the sun rose. But I

say  that it is a noonday rooster - a rooster which crows

when  the  sun  is  in the middle of the  heavens.  The

referendum  has  already been  decided  upon.  We  have

already decided to go ahead with it, and the Member for

Anson can keep on crowing. But the sun will move in its

prescribed course. When it sets, it will set  for  many

Members  in the Barisan Sosialis and probably  for  the

Member  for  Anson as well. That is the reason  why  we

have  brought  this amendment, to ensure that  paranoic

roosters  do  not  keep  on  crowing,  "I  have  got  a

referendum  for  the  people  of  Singapore.   I.   Mr

Conscience,  have got a referendum for  the  people  of

Singapore." This amendment sets out clearly  the  facts

how  the  referendum comes into being. That is  why  we

have  decided  to bring this amendment and  reject  the

original amendment put forward by the Member for Anson.

Sir,  a  preview of what is likely to be the antics  of

the Barisan Sosialis and, in particular, the Communists

who are directing them, after merger is this - to give to

the  merger  battle a racial and communal complex.  You

will notice from their writings in the papers -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker. Sir.

I rise again on the issue of relevancy as to the

tactics or otherwise of the Barisan Sosialis. At

some future  time the Minister will have his Radio

P.A.P. to make his speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is some substance in the

objection  of the Member for Anson. I was listening  to

the  Minister  carefully. I do not think he  should  go

much  further  than what he is saying about  what  will

happen  in  the future. I think he has already  touched

upon  that,  and that, I think, is sufficient  for  the

purposes of this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I therefore

suggest  to  the  Barisan Sosialis and the  Member  for

Anson, who has now become the devil's advocate for  the

Barisan Sosialis - he does not pass any strictures on the

Barisan Sosialis or make any reference to the Communist

connections with the Barisan Sosialis, for he is always

slightly discomfitted by any references to the  Barisan

Sosialis'  connections with the Communists. It  may  be

because, as he admitted to the Minister for Health, the

Barisan Sosialis and the Communists -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Minister -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker. It has

been  refuted  once before; it has been  refuted  twice

before.  Are  we  to  keep  on  having  this  falsehood

recurring?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister has freedom of speech

here.  He  can say what he likes. His opinion is  being

expressed;  maybe  he will express  it  10  times.  The

Speaker  is here to listen to those opinions.  I  think

the Member for Anson should try and contain himself. He

can  always refute these statements again. If they  are

said 10 times, he can refute them 10 times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in connection with

this,  he  can refute it in the Nanyang Siang Pau.  The

Member  has  been silent because he was caught  out  on

what I would say is a falsehood -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest the Minister does

not pursue that line. It is irrelevant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Anyway, Sir, may I do the same act

that the Member for Anson did yesterday? He appealed to

the  House. He was crowing softly then, because he  had

hoped,  for  his own glory, that he might  be  able  to

persuade  the  Assembly to approve his  motion  without

amendment.  May I therefore say that this amendment  by

the  Government makes it quite clear that a  referendum

will  be  held,  that  it  merely  reaffirms  what  the

Government has always stated. Therefore, if the  Member

for  Anson  and his bosses in the Barisan Sosialis  are

genuinely  interested  in  a referendum,  there  is  no

reason  not  to vote for this amendment.  If  they  are

really interested in the kind of referendum which  will

tell  us what the wishes of the people really are, they

can support this amendment. If the Member for Anson and

Members  of the Barisan Sosialis want to abide  by  the

wishes  of  the  people,  as  will  be  shown  in   the

referendum, they still can support this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You have deleted that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> But if, as we suspect, they have no

intention  of  either really wanting a  referendum  or,

more important still, of abiding by the results of  the

referendum,  as the Member for Thomson has indicated - he

has  given a warning of what might happen - then we shall

not at all be surprised if they refrain from voting for

this  amendment, an amendment which states  the  facts,

not  the original motion which was intended to give  an

opportunity to the Member for Anson - as he  did  in  the

case  of  the Education Bill - to say, "I was responsible

for  forcing  the  Government to go  through  with  the

referendum."  If  they  are  really  interested  in   a

referendum, there is nothing in this amendment to  show

that it will in anyway conflict with their desire, that

is, to hold a referendum fairly and, most important  of

all,  to  give  an  assurance that the Government  will

abide by the decision of the referendum. Therefore, the

Barisan Sosialis and their Communist mentors should now

clearly indicate that if and when a referendum is  held

and  the result of it are announced, there will  be  no

attempt, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



the  Member  for  Thomson indicated, to start  trouble,

because  this  is 1962. This is not the Hock  Lee  riot

period.  That  period  is past. Any  Communist  or  his

stooges  who  try to use the occasion to foment  racial

and  communal trouble will this time meet  a  different

enemy;  not  the British; they will meet the  force  of

Malayan -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

It  is  the  same issue, Sir, the issue  of  relevancy.

Could we limit ourselves to the motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Anson is

becoming  tired. From the way the Minister is speaking,

I understand he is in his peroration and is winding Up.

Please continue, Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, may I therefore say that this

will  be indicated by the way the Barisan Sosialis will

vote -   whether  they  are  really  interested   in   a

referendum and abide by the referendum, or whether they

are really interested in starting trouble. As I say, if

they intend to start trouble, there are people who  are

prepared  to meet it and to deal with those who  embark

upon a career of trying to plunge this country into the

throes,  turmoil  and  tragedy of racial  and  communal

conflict.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you

have just heard the usual blah-blah threats and

intimidation from the Minister for Culture. But while

threatening he is also trying to give a picture of

democratic practice on the part of the P.A.P.

Government. He says there are people who are asking,

why is there a necessity to hold a referendum? But the

P.A.P., because they are democratic and just, would

nevertheless hold a referendum. Sir, the amendment

moved by the Deputy Prime Minister has revealed the

iron hand that is hidden in the velvet glove of the

P.A.P. To the simple motion of the Member for Anson,

the Deputy Prime Minister has seen fit to bring in a

lot of controversial matters. The Minister for Culture

wants to give the impression



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Government had intended to hold a referendum

from  the  very day the idea of merger was mooted.  Let

me  tell the House that it is widely known in Singapore

that such had never been the intention of the P.A.P.  I

do  not  need  to go very far back, Sir.  Probably  you

will remember the meeting attended by the Ministers  in

the  Chinese  Chamber of Commerce. In  that  forum  the

Prime  Minister  was  asked  a  very  simple  question,

whether or not the P.A.P. would abide by the result  of

the  referendum.  To  that simple question,  the  Prime

Minister  gave a historic answer, couched in  the  most

evasive  terms possible. His answer was to  the  effect

that    history   would   decide.   Now,   these    few

words - "history  would decide" - were  evasive,  hide-and-seek, escapist words intended to confuse, frighten  and

possibly  to  condition the minds of  the  people  into

accepting whatever the P.A.P. Government was  going  to

suggest  to  them.  The train of events  that  followed

this  historic  answer of the Prime Minister  is  well-known.  It was commonly talked about in shops,  in  the

streets  and in alleys that the Government intended  to

railroad  merger. The Government intended to  force  it

through,  whether  the  people liked  it  or  not.  The

P.A.P. leaders,  knowing full well how  closely  their

own  personal  fortunes were linked up with  their  so-called merger, were even willing to sell the rights  of

the  people  down  the  drain in pushing  through  this

merger.  They  hope  thus to get  the  help  of  people

outside Singapore to prop them up in office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are well-known facts. What made it worse

was  that  when the Referendum Bill was put before  the

Assembly,  the  Second  Reading  was  postponed.   Such

postponement  of the Second Reading of  the  Referendum

Bill, especially in the midst of the talk in town  that

the  P.A.P. would not hold a referendum after all, only

heightened the fear and created more confusion. And  to

make  things  still  worse  during  the  actual  Second

Reading  of  the  Bill  the Prime Minister  said  those

terrible  words which have already been quoted  by  the

Member for Anson. I remember



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



the  Prime Minister also said that Singapore would have

to  have - I  will  try  to quote the words,  Sir - "either

merger   peacefully  by  consent  or  merger   not   so

peacefully with unpleasantness".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has been subjected to a lot of

threats,  intimidation and even coercion in many  ways.

In  days gone by the Prime Minister used to talk of the

cutting off of the water supply in order to clinch  his

arguments  for  merger. That already  was  meant  as  a

threat  to frighten the people into accepting  whatever

he  wanted  to  suggest  to the  people  of  Singapore.

Similarly  today, there are all sorts  of  threats  and

intimidation. Those words of the Prime Minister which I

have  just quoted, Sir, and those words quoted  by  the

Member for Anson, were meant to frighten the people, to

cause  anxiety and create suspense in their  minds.  If

there  is  any  doubt and anxiety in the minds  of  the

people  today, if there is any suspicion  of  the  true

intent  of  the P.A.P. Government, all the  blame  must

rest  on  the  P.A.P.  Government, and  on  the  Prime

Minister    himself   in   particular.   Under    those

circumstances.  Sir, you cannot blame  the  people  for

having  doubts as to what is, in fact, in the minds  of

the  P.A.P. leaders. It is very well known,  Sir,  that

the P.A.P. leaders know that their merger proposals are

not  acceptable to the people, but as the Deputy  Prime

Minister   has  given  an  assurance  in   the   House,

therefore, the Government is committed willy-nilly to a

referendum. But it is a referendum which they will hold

grudgingly and very reluctantly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their second thoughts on the referendum can be seen,

Sir, in their amendments to the Referendum Bill itself.

I  have  no wish to touch on the meat of the Referendum

Bill  itself.  I merely want to draw your attention  in

passing  to  the fact that they did suggest  amendments

which  have now become the talk of the town. The P.A.P.

Government,  by  these  amendments,  have  shown  their

intentions behind the actual referendum itself. I  will

not  touch  further on it. I am content  to  leave  all

further  discussion on the matter to the time  when  we

come to consider the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



Referendum Bill either in Select Committee  or  on  its

Third Reading in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in this motion the operative words are "the

mode  and manner of the inevitable reunification",  and

the  other operative words are in the first line,  `the

Government's  clearly stated stand on the  question  of

merger". They have also linked up the Barisan Sosialis'

stand  with  theirs, and have wilfully and  maliciously

distorted the Barisan Sosialis stand in such a  way  as

to  give  a completely false impression to the  people.

That  incidentally, Sir, tells us what  questions  they

intend  to pose to the people. However, I will come  to

that later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to mention again the White Paper, because

you have already ruled that we need not discuss it as a

question in the referendum. Nevertheless, Sir,  I  wish

to  stress  one point, and that is this: if the  P.A.P.

really  claim that the White Paper has the  support  of

the people and is acceptable to the people, and that it

is  only  the Communists who are opposed to  the  White

Paper  merger proposals, then it is easy  for  them  to

pose  their  proposals to the people without  fear,  as

they   have   already  given  enough  explanation   and

publicity on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in talking of the White Paper, let me answer a

couple  of  points  they  have  raised.  I  was  really

surprised  at  the vitriol that came  from  the  Deputy

Prime Minister himself. It was really a surprise to us,

because,  whether rightly or wrongly,  it  is  believed

that  amongst all the P.A.P. Front Benches  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister,  because of his  scientific  training,

would  be  the most reasonable of the lot. It has  been

said that the Deputy Prime Minister had in the past  - I

do not know how far it still holds true, Sir - exerted  a

sobering  influence on the Fascist surroundings  around

him.  Fascist  tendencies and  Fascist  utterances  can

always be seen in the Minister for Culture and in  some

of the other Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Culture

say that merger is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



a  P.A.P. pledge. Let me tell them right here and  now:

it is all poppycock and nonsense, because merger was on

the platform of all political Parties in Singapore.  If

the  1959 general elections had been held on the merger

issue,  I  think  the people would have  voted  in  the

S.P.A.,  because - with  due  respect,  Sir,  I  have  no

intention of belittling the S.P.A. - at least they have a

Tun  in  their  Party. Whereas in the P.A.P. there  is

hardly  anyone of that stature. It is well known,  Sir,

that  relations between the Tun and the Tunku are  much

better than they can ever possibly be between the Prime

Minister and the Tunku. In fact, Sir, quotations of the

Prime Minister, when he talked about the Tunku in  days

of  old,  can  be quite an embarrassment to  the  Prime

Minister today. I remember there was one occasion  when

the Prime Minister complained of the Tun getting behind

the  sarong  of the Tunku! This is really a disparaging

remark. I am sure the Prime Minister could not possibly

get  to  that  relationship with the Tunku.  Therefore,

merger  was  not  the  issue on which  the  P.A.P. was

elected.  If  fact, Sir, the P.A.P. was  elected  on  a

number  of  promises, most of which,  alas,  have  been

forgotten.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> All of them!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What has happened to the

reunification, of the trade unions? What  has  happened

to  the  release of the political detainees?  What  has

happened to the true and correct implementation -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir. If we

are  to  repeat the sins of the P.A.P.,  we  will  have

another  midnight  sitting.  Could  we,  Sir,  restrain

ourselves to the terms of the motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The objection is well taken. The Member

for  Queenstown  perhaps  is  straying  away  from  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I crave your indulgence, Sir,I was

trying  to  answer a couple of points  which  had  been

belaboured  not only by the Deputy Prime  Minister  but

also by the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



for  Culture,  one  who ought to know  something  about

culture but who does not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people talk of merger, Sir, they talk of

merger   on   the  basis  of  justice,  equality,   and

democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Like Penang and Malacca!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For mutual benefit.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I rise again on a point of order, Sir.

Could we restrain ourselves to the terms of the motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it would be best for the Member

for  Anson  to  restrain himself and leave  it  to  the

Speaker. Dr Lee, please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Excuse me, Sir. This point has to

be answered because they have been stressing so much on

it, and unless we answer it, there will be no record of

them.  Today  the  English  newspapers  hardly  publish

anything  that we say. All the space is  given  to  the

Prime  Minister  and  to the Government  Ministers.  In

fact, I know there are quite a number of people on  our

side  here who have been complaining that they just  do

not get heard outside the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Nearly every Sunday you go around.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, I will come to that.

Therefore,   it   is  important - at   least   for   the

record - and  we hope those who happen to be  here  will

pass  the  news by word of mouth outside, so that  the

people will know something in spite -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Queenstown is

referring  to the strangers in the Strangers  Gallery,

then  he  is completely out of order. He is addressing

the  Chair and he must not make any direct or indirect

reference to the people in the Strangers Gallery.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no intention, Sir, to refer

to  anybody  in  the Gallery. But, anyway,  it  was  to

suggest that people should be able to help by spreading

by word of mouth what we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



have  not  been  able  to convey  over  the  radio  and

Rediffusion and in the English Press. Sir, when we talk

of  wanting merger, we do not mean a sell-out  type  of

merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again, the Member for

Queenstown is now entering into a debate on the type of

merger. We are not on that. We are on this motion which

is  dealing with the referendum in regard to merger. It

does not deal with the type of merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will not speak much more on that

except  to say this, that although the P.A.P. say  that

merger is one of their 1959 pledges, let us remind them

that  Malaysia  has  never been mentioned  in  all  the

P.A.P. manifestoes, nor had it ever been talked about.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the Member indicate how that

is  relevant -  whether  or  not  Malaysia  was  in  the

manifesto of the P.A.P. I cannot see any relevance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is just to prove the point

that  they  are  not  true to their so-called  election

pledges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister has complained that we

in  the  Barisan Sosialis have jumped the gun  because,

according  to him, we have already been campaigning  on

the  referendum in spite of the fact that the  Bill  is

still to be considered in Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture also spoke a lot about our Sunday campaign. Both he and the Deputy Prime Minister harped on the fact that it began on 1st April and that, therefore, all those who took part in it and the people we saw were April fools. Surely the Minister for Culture with all his deep learning should know better than that, that even if a couple of chaps here may be fools, he would not consider the people as fools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The ones who play around you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know what he means by the

people who play around us. Nowadays the P.A.P. is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



making great play on the wisdom of the people. We saw a

Front Bencher running along and holding the railings of

a  bridge and saying that that is meeting the people. I

do  not know what happened. There were a couple of  men

meeting the people, seeing the bridge -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Jumping into the river!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The simple fact is that the P.A.P.

today dare not meet the people. They do not dare hold a

rally.  If they ever hold a rally, they must put  on  a

big  show, just like the political Parties in days gone

by, which had lion dances and things like that whenever

they held a political rally.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the Member for

Queenstown  hopes that this debate will  end  today.  I

suggest that he be as relevant as he can be so that  we

can complete this debate as soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Our Sunday campaign is not on the

referendum  because  as yet we do  not  know  what  the

question  will  be and we still do not  know  what  the

provisions will be. The aim of our Sunday campaign  has

been   to  expose  all  the  undemocratic  and   unjust

provisions that are embodied in the merger proposals of

Cmd. Paper No. 33 of 1961. The purpose of our house-to-house  campaign has been to tell the people the  actual

meaning of the P.A.P. proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope you will allow me to enlighten you on why

we have to take this course.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I can permit that.

He  has  answered  the  point made  by  the  Government

Benches. Let us now proceed with the motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was only hoping to explain to

you  that  today all means of communication  have  been

denied  us  and  even our holding of rallies  has  been

restricted to the constituencies of our Assemblymen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Sunday hikes are not undertaken by people

with  milk  dentition. No, Sir, these are house  visits

undertaken with a special responsibility to the people.

It  is a duty we have to undertake in order to lay  the

full  facts  before the people. If they  are  asked  to

decide on any issue, we want to make sure that all  the

facts are placed before them. Both sides of the picture

should be given to them, so that they can decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sorts of wild allegations have been levelled at us

saying  that we preach communalism; that, while on  the

one hand we sent a letter to the Tunku pledging support

for  merger and Malaysia, yet on the other hand we were

campaigning  against  a  closer  relationship   between

Singapore and the Federation. Our Party platform, which

is  based  on socialist principles, cannot be communal.

We  do  not believe in playing racial politics  because

what we are fighting for today is not the rights or the

privileges of one race over another. We are fighting to

improve  society. We are fighting to;  remove  poverty,

disease and ignorance -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> To become the Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and poverty, disease and

ignorance recognise no communal barriers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Where did you get such wisdom

from?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, in a statement which we issued

on 16th April, 1962, it ended with these four lines:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Barisan Sosialis stands for the units of workers,

peasants and intellectuals of all races in Malaya.  For

this  reason,  we arc uncompromisingly opposed  to  any

attempt from any quarter to undermine the unity of  all

races.'



<br><br>Surely, Sir, this is not communalism on our part. By no

stretch of the imagination can one link our stand  with

the  stand  of  communalism. On  the  other  hand,  the

P.A.P.,  in  their  attempt to impose a  constitutional

arrangement  which  is  completely  based  on  communal

prejudices, call themselves nationalists.  Sir,  for  a

long time we have been telling the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



Government that what they are trying to do is really to

impose communalism on the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Up to now, the Member for

Queenstown is in order because he is answering a  point

made  by the Government Benches. But I do not think  he

should  go  further into details. If he does,  then  he

becomes irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was only trying to draw your

attention to the fact that the proposals of the  P.A.P.

Government create communal feelings and it is  not  any

political  Party or any individual trying  to  stir  up

communal  troubles. No, Sir. The people have an  inborn

feeling, they have innate wisdom, and they know what is

good  for  them.  When  something  which  is  based  on

communal  prejudice  is  being  imposed  on  them,  the

natural resistance inside the hearts and minds of these

people finds expression. If the P.A.P. Government still

insist  on  rail-roading or pushing merger  through  in

some  form or other, then they are really going to stir

up  a lot of communal feelings which, like a tiny spark

that starts a prairie fire, they may find difficult  to

smother.  We  who are opposed to all sorts of  communal

practices  have  been accused of being communal,  while

the  P.A.P.,  who  support  and  hope  to  impose  such

communal  constitutional arrangements  on  the  people,

call themselves non-racialists. Of course, Sir, we  can

understand the strategy of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member be speaking a little

longer?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I propose to suspend the Assembly. I

will take this Chair again at half-past Five.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>5.02 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the

suspension  I  was telling the House  that  it  is  the

P.A.P. who are the true



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



racialists,  whereas  we in the  Barisan  Sosialis  are

totally   and  completely  opposed  to  racialism   and

communalism.  I was saying that it is, of  course,  the

strategy  of  the P.A.P. to accuse people first  before

the  truth is fully understood by everybody and  before

the   P.A.P. themselves  are  accused   of   inciting

communalism.  There  is a Chinese  saying  which,  when

translated, runs like this, "Whoever first takes action

is  the  stronger." The P.A.P. tactic on this  communal

issue  is exactly that. I would urge the P.A.P. leaders

not  to  make conditions worse, because their  constant

harping on chauvinism and communalism will only tend to

widen  the  differences - whatever differences there  may

be - and may even create differences where none exists. I

hope the P.A.P. will know the dangers that are inherent

in such a policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister also lightly touched on the

letter  incident. He even mentioned that our Secretary-General,

Mr  Lim Ching Siong, went  to  hand  over  a letter to

the Tunku in Cuscaden Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What is in it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> What is

in the letter?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Everybody likes to know, Sir,I

think  it is good to keep some of these people guessing

for  some time and see how they try to concoct  stories

to fit in with their theories.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We always catch you out!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister alleged

that we had indicated that we had pledged the Tunku  to

support  merger and Malaysia, and yet were  going  from

house  to  house fighting against merger.  I  say  that

there  are no contradictions in our actions. We support

anything  that  is fair, just and equal, anything  that

gives  mutual benefit to the parties concerned. But  we

are  definitely opposed to any form of merger  that  is

based on inequality and injustice and that gives second

class  citizenship to the people of Singapore,  and  in

general treats Singapore more like a satellite than  as

an equal. The P.A.P. have made great play of the Penang

and Malacca type



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



of  merger.  Sir, this is a very important issue.  They

have been harping on it, not only in this Assembly  but

also  outside  the  Assembly,  over  Radio  P.A.P. and

Rediffusion,  in all their leaflets and  in  all  their

talks.  They  want  to create the impression  that  the

stand  of the Barisan Sosialis is that we want a merger

like  Penang,  which, according to them,  will  deprive

half the citizens of Singapore of their citizenship  on

merger,  I had occasion only last evening to  say  that

when the Minister for Culture was reading out the text,

he  was  falsifying many things, because he was reading

out  of context and with malicious intention to distort

the stand of the Barisan Sosialis. Before I read you  a

small  extract which should have been read every  time,

instead of only just a few words which were read by the

Ministers  of  the  P.A.P. whenever they  want  to  say

anything against the Barisan Sosialis, may I remind the

House  that  last  year, in the debate  on  the  merger

issue,  it was we in the Barisan Sosialis who moved  an

amendment  to  the  motion by the Minister  for  Labour

asking for full and complete citizenship rights for the

citizens of Singapore. On that occasion the P.A.P. and

the  S.P.A. opposed it. The other Parties, the  Barisan

Sosialis,  the United People's Party and  the  Workers'

Party,  supported the automatic citizenship issue.  Let

me  now,  Sir, quote to you - I realise that I am  boring

you on this -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for

Queenstown  is  perhaps in order  in  saying  that  the

Speaker  is  being  bored. As Speaker,  of  course,  he

cannot be bored. But as an individual I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, for the record, I

think  this  has  to be given lo the House.  They  have

always  said that the Barisan Sosialis' stand on merger

is  for  a  merger like Penang. Sir, when we  mentioned

Penang  and Malacca, we could easily have said  Johore.

We  mentioned  Penang and Malacca as examples,  because

they  were  colonies, as Singapore. But that  does  not

mean that we accept everything -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate interrupting. The Member

has  indicated that it is an important point  for  him.

But  he must not now invite a debate on this matter.  I

think he has made his point. He has made his denial and

he can supplement it by reading the relevant portion of

his  letter and leave it at that. He might have another

opportunity of giving a more detailed analysis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I bow to your ruling, Sir, and I

will now, therefore, read to the House our document  as

issued  by  the  Barisan Sosialis on the  28th  August,

1961.  That  document  is  the  stand  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis on our constitutional future. I will skip  the

irrelevant  parts and go on to the part  which  follows

the issue of Penang and Malacca. It reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way ahead for real reunification of our country

and our people is in one of two directions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an immediate, full and complete merger with

Singapore joining the Federation as a constitutent

state like Penang or Malacca-'



<br><br>those are the operative words -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(b) as an autonomous unit within a Confederation with

the Borneo territories coming in when possible.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the first direction we are fully aware of the

difficulties that face us in our struggle  for  Malayan

unity. As a result of colonial rule, the differences of

race  and  religion have been emphasised and much  work

will   be   needed  to  repair  the  damage   done   by

colonialism.'



<br><br>Now, this is the relevant part which I want to come to,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, we declare that if the representatives of

the  people of the Federation are agreeable to  do  the

same,  we will pledge ourselves to wholeheartedly exert

our  influence to win the people of Singapore to accept

full  and  complete  merger forthwith,  that  is,  with

Singapore, as the twelfth state of the Federation  and

with  Singapore citizens automatically becoming Malayan

citizens  with  proportional  representation   in   the

Federal  Parliament  like any  of  the  present  eleven

states constituting the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that this is a vital question that can only

be   decided  by  the  people  of  Singapore  and   the

Federation.  In  Singapore we  believe  that  the  only

genuine  way of allowing the people to decide is  by  a

general  election during which we will be  prepared  to

persuade our people to give us a mandate for a full and

complete  merger. Let the Government of the  Federation

of Malaya tell us if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



it is prepared to persuade the people of the Federation

to  accept  the  people  of Singapore  in  a  full  and

complete merger before 1963.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, should put the record straight and stop

all  these arguments which, to quote the words  of  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister,  are  infantile,  puerile  and

totally  absurd.  Of course, Sir, we realise  why  they

have  been  stressing on that. In distorting our  stand

they  are  also  inadvertently revealing  their  secret

intentions  to  pose that particular  question  to  the

people.  But in posing the Penang type of merger,  they

are  distorting  the  truth. They  are  distorting  the

Barisan  Sosialis' stand, and that has  to  be  clearly

understood  by  the House as well as by the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion now before the House, consequent on

the  amendment,  clearly indicates  to  the  people  of

Singapore  that  although the Government  will  hold  a

referendum before merger is finalised, there will be no

honest referendum because the stress is on the mode and

manner of the inevitable reunification. Much debate has

already  taken place on these words and the  people  of

Singapore  already  know what  the  intentions  of  the

P.A.P. Government are when they use the words "the mode

and  the  manner". Because, fully realising  the  legal

training  the Prime Minister has, we can visualise  and

understand how the play of words can be used  to  trick

and trap people into accepting something which they  do

not  want. My colleagues have already stressed  to  the

House that these words actually mean that the people of

Singapore  will be asked to choose between  two  evils.

Many figurative parallels have been given and they  all

show that the P.A.P., in actual fact, have no intention

of  consulting  the  people or  of  acceding  to  their

wishes,  wishes to happiness, prosperity and well-being

in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quoted an example here yesterday. Supposing, Sir,

two  questions  are put and both of them  are  bad  and

unacceptable. I quoted the example of: "Do you want  to

die  by  drowning, or do you want to die  by  hanging?"

Either  way you will die. You are not allowed a  chance

to  choose to live, and to live is what you want.  None

of  us  want to die, not for such a cause. To give  you

another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



example: "Do you like to have your arm chopped off,  or

do  you like to have your leg chopped off?" Either  way

you  get  your  limb chopped off. I do  not  think  any

reasonable man will like any of his limbs chopped  off.

To  take yet another example which may bring us  nearer

home  to  the  question of merger. This  question,  for

example,  could be asked: "Do you want  a  merger  that

deprives  half  the  citizens  of  Singapore  of  their

citizenship, or do you want a merger that gives all the

citizens of Singapore second-class citizenship?" Either

you  have all citizens having second-class citizenship,

or you have half the citizens losing their citizenship.

Now, how do you expect the people to choose? Both these

questions  are  unacceptable  and  are  completely  the

result   of   diabolical  machinations  of  discredited

politicians.  So,  Sir, it can now  be  understood  why

there  is this constant harping on the Penang  type  of

merger  and why they lay so much importance  on  it.  I

hope  that  when  it really comes to the  question,  it

should not be about the mode and manner, but it must be

a  simple  and straightforward question. In my original

amendment   to  the  amendment  to  the  amendment,   I

mentioned the White Paper merger. I will not  touch  on

that  again. But the principle is, it must be a  simple

and straightforward question, a one-question referendum

which  can be easily answered with a yes or a no.  That

is  the only way to consult the people and that is  the

only way to ensure that the people will understand what

the  issue  is  all  about and that  they  can  give  a

straightforward answer. The question must be  fair  and

easy to understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples, Sir, have been quoted about referenda in

Australia  and  Algeria. In the  case  of  Algeria,  of

course,  it  is  still fresh in our minds.  I  am  sure

everybody must have seen how the question was posed. It

required  only  a  simple yes on no. The  Minister  for

Culture said that the question should be posed in  such

a way as not to confuse the people. He said that-not to

confuse  the  people. Sir, if the question  is  not  to

confuse  the  people,  then  it  adds  strength  to  my

argument that it must be a one-question referendum.  If

they are afraid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



and  have  no confidence to ask the people about  their

White   Paper  proposals,  let  us  set  them   another

question.   But  it  must  be  a  simple   one-question

referendum. Only then will the people be able  to  give

their  views on the matter in a simple, straightforward

manner.  Only then will the people be able to say  that

it is a fair and honest referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have already touched on the dangers to

parliamentary democracy in this part of the  world.  In

Singapore,  parliamentary democracy is  on  trial.  But

from  the practice of parliamentary democracy here  and

from  the way the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader  of

the   House,  has  been  springing  surprises  on   the

Opposition    without   even   a   simple   gentlemanly

consultation regarding procedure, we can see what  sort

of  parliamentary democracy we have from the P.A.P.  If

parliamentary democracy is going to be abused and  made

a  farce  of, then all of us in Singapore will  suffer.

Everyone  can  remember  the type  of  democracy  which

dictators practise in South Korea and South Vietnam and

I  think  we also remember with what dire consequences.

And all because of what, Sin? Because of the rigging of

elections and undemocratic practices in the election in

a so-called democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore elections have been praised for

fairness  and  have  yet  to  be  the  butt  of  severe

criticism. Let us not have a referendum that,  although

it  is  supposed to be democratic, is actually  rigged;

and  legal  rigging of a referendum  means,  in  actual

fact,  dictatorship under the guise of democracy.  They

might as well put the bayonet upon the table as they so

often harp on the theme that power comes out of the gun

barrel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mao Tse-tung

said that. You have not read the classics.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Doings like these will not give the

people confidence in the practice of democracy. It  has

often  been  said, Sir, that democracy depends  on  the

practice of those who hold



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



power.  What they say when they are not in power  means

nothing.   If   they  hold  power  and  they   practise

democracy,  then and then only will democracy  be  true

and  have real meaning. That is a danger which we  have

to guard against, and we would urge the P.A.P. that, as

they were elected to power by the people, at least  for

the  sake of parliamentary democracy and for the future

happiness  of  the  people, they should  not  pursue  a

course  that will only lead to misery and hardship.  We

do  not  say  this  as a warning in the  way  that  the

Minister for Culture has been imputing. But it is clear

to  all  the people of Singapore that this practice  of

democracy  in  Singapore has a  great  bearing  on  our

constitutional  future.  We  in  Singapore  go  by  the

constitutional  practice that has been laid  down.  Let

not  those who hold power now abuse this constitutional

practice  such  that  the people  lose  all  faith  and

confidence in this practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need to say very much more, Sir, except that

in the voting for the amendment which has given rise to

this  new  motion, you will have noticed that only  the

P.A.P. voted against all the Opposition. The  point  I

wish  to stress is this: that even the S.P.A. dare  not

vote  with  the P.A.P. on this occasion, not that  they

are  not in secret collaboration with the P.A.P. It  is

well known to the people of Singapore that although  on

the surface they are not one Party  in actual fact they

are  in  deep cahoots with them. What goes  on  in  the

P.A.P. is known to the S.P.A., and anything with  which

the  P.A.P. hope to spring a surprise on the  Barisan

Sosialis  is  already  known to the  S.P.A.  These  are

things  we  know.  The fact that  the  S.P.A. on  this

particular  occasion have not dared to  vote  with  the

P.A.P. only shows that even the S.P.A. know  what  the

temper  of  the people is today against the P.A.P.  And

they  dare not ally themselves openly with the  P.A.P.,

hoping  thereby to retain whatever goodwill they  still

have.  And  thereby hangs a moral, Sir.  The  moral  is

this:  let the P.A.P. leaders, and especially the Prime

Minister,  wake  up. Let him realise that  what  he  is

doing is contrary to the interests of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



Let  him bear this in mind, if not for himself, and  if

not  for  his P.A.P. colleagues, then at least for  his

Backbenchers and maybe for the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have been thinking of you

`mostest' of all. A special place!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let him make sure that the people

of Singapore are not sold down the drain. Let him learn

the  moral from the S.P.A., who dare not even vote with

the  P.A.P. on this particular occasion. Go  back  from

the perilous course of leading the people down into the

abyss from which there is no return. There is a Chinese

saying, Sir. It says: if you turn back you will  always

find land; don't go further into the deep sea. Think of

the  people  of  Singapore, and let us  hope  that,  in

thinking  of the people of Singapore, he will still  be

able  to  return to the shore, and so be able  to  save

himself.



<br><br>6.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it is difficult to find what

is  objectionable in the amendment moved by the  Leader

of  the  House  if the Opposition are  sincere  in  the

things  they  profess  to  believe  in.  Everybody   in

Singapore,  every political Party other than half-wits,

stands  firmly  in  favour  of  the  reunification   of

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. It has been the

political  credo  of  all nationalists  and  Communists

right  from  1945  when the British separated  the  two

territories by their constitutional arrangements in the

Malayan Union. Therefore, it is difficult to see anyone

objecting to these words in the amendment, "in order to

hold  a  referendum". Surely these words, "to ascertain

the wishes of the people", cannot be objectionable; "on

the  mode and manner" - that cannot be objectionable; "of

the  inevitable  reunification  of  Singapore  and  the

Federation   of   Malaya   before   arrangements    are

finalised", and so on - that cannot be objectionable. But

what  they find objectionable really is "reunification"

under any circumstances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



other   than   the  which  will  give  the   Communists

supremacy. That is the bare fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Member for Queenstown, in one of his

off-the-cuff speeches and in an impromptu  move,  found

himself  moving  an  amendment  to  remove  the   words

"inevitable  reunification". Sir,  the  Communists,  or

whatever  they  may be, are basically  realistic.  They

know  that reunification will happen and is inevitable.

But  they also know that when it happens, for  a  long,

long while, they will be cribbed, cabined and confined.

And  before they are cribbed, cabined and confined,  it

is  their  hope to leave behind the largest  amount  of

bitterness and hatred in order that they can  feed  and

grow upon it after merger has taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown may not know the dynamics

and  the geometry of revolution. They know that in this

round  they  have lost. The ground is cold,  the  wrong

move  has been made, the flanks are wide open.  Nothing

can  be  done  about it. But a great deal of  animosity

could  be  aroused  and  a  sense  injustice  could  be

implanted  principally  in the  minds  of  the  Chinese

community  in Singapore. That is the bare fact  of  the

matter. Nobody is in the least bit taken in by all this

nonsense    about   dictatorship   and    parliamentary

democracy. There is going to be a merger. Everybody has

said  so. It is the duty of the Government to ascertain

the  will of the majority. There are no two persons  in

Singapore  with exactly the same thoughts. The  process

of  the  democratic system is to try, in so far  as  is

possible,  to  ascertain the largest common  will.  The

largest  common will on this matter is, "We  must  have

merger." Everybody is decided on that. Nobody has said,

"No merger." Therefore, the next step is: on what basis

should merger take place?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in principle, I can see no possible

objection  to the words of this amendment.  It  is  our

duty  to implement, under the best terms and conditions

possible, what is desired by the people of Singapore in

conjunction with what is desired by the majority of the

people of the Federation. If we want to play



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



around  with  arithmetic, I say the plebiscite  on  the

referendum  could be finished off in one  fell  stroke.

That  is the way General de Gaulle put his referendurn.

He  said,  "I have come forward with the Fifth Republic

to bring peace. Do you want peace in Algeria?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was not referring to the Member

for  Anson.  I am sorry if he has mistaken himself  for

General de Gaulle. I was not referring to him at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I quite understand that, Sir,I

will surely give him an opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

referendum in respect of Algeria was "Do the people  of

France accept the agreement reached between General  de

Gaulle and the Provisional Government of Algeria?"  It

was not, "Do you want peace in Algeria?"



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This was the latest one. The first

one  was  held  over a year ago: "Do  you  support  the

policy  of  peace  in Algiers?" This one  is:  "Do  you

support  the  agreement  that has  been  reached?"  The

details  of the agreement have not been published.  All

that the agreement so far reached and published is that

there  will be a committee of men who will be in charge

of  Algiers and its government for a period  of  months

after  which Algiers will decide whether it will be  in

free association with France. That is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, if the Member for Anson wishes us to

hold  a  vote on whether there should be merger  or  no

merger,  we  will be quite happy to do it.  Members  of

this Assembly have all said that there should be merger

and   that   we  should  never  put  such  a  question.

Therefore, the next logical step is: what is  the  mode

and manner of merger? It is as simple as that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have gone through all these histrionics, and

at the end of it all, what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



it really amounts to is this: can the Communists - and  I

am   not  talking  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and  the

gentlemen here - can the boys who really move the  bits

and  pieces on the chessboard extricate themselves from

this  checkmate? In this round, the answer is  no.  But

unlike  the game of chess, the political struggle  goes

on.  Our  purpose  is  not  pulling  off  what  we  are

constitutionally  and  legally  entitled  to  do - to  go

through   with   merger  without  the  process   of   a

referendum. As I have stated, to do so would be to lend

credence  to  the  lie that anybody  was  sold  out  to

anybody  else. The object of a good Government  in  the

circumstances must be to debunk and dispel the lie made

primarily  to the Chinese community that they  will  be

second-class  citizens. Therefore, the  alternative  is

whether they want what the Barisan Sosialis, on  behalf

of  the  Communists,  have openly espoused,  i.e.,  the

Penang  or Malacca type of merger or whether they  want

what we believe to be more -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister is not giving way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I will give way to him, Sir, when

I  have  finished my sentence. That is what  they  have

proposed.  We  believe this to be more in keeping  with

the  temper and the needs of the people. Why  are  they

afraid to put their proposals to the people? We are not

saying that our merger terms are ideal and the best. If

we  could get the Tunku, his Government, the Malays and

the  Chinese in the Federation to give us better terms,

why not?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Have you tried?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Can anybody have tried harder? He

is open to do so.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Distortion -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Barisan Sosialis even went up

to  the  front  door.  The Assistant  Secretary-General

carried a message of peace that he supported merger and

Malaysia and wanted to start discussions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Again distortion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Winning generals never carry a

white  flag to talk peace. The purpose of this  motion,

as  amended,  is  to  clear any  doubts  whatsoever  in

anybody's  mind  that, in so far as  the  will  of  the

majority of the people can be ascertained, that will be

embodied  in  the  constitution of the new  Federation,

which  will  include Singapore. When we have discharged

that duty, then the Members of the Barisan Sosialis and

everybody  else  will have full opportunity,  within  a

much wider campus, within a much larger ambit, and in a

bigger   arena,  to  espouse  their  causes,  be   they

democratic, be they Communist.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Or Fascist!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Or Fascist. But it will then be a

fight to the finish. This is the happy position we  are

in - that  we  have  a  guaranteed  situation.  We   have

arranged  this guaranteed situation so that within  the

ambit  of this arena, Queensberry rules can be enforced

and they can be broken only with penalty.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Siamese boxing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We are here to hear abuse heaped

upon  us;  to  hear irrational, wild and  base  charges

repeated with gramophonic regularity. We sit down  with

patience  and in the best of humour and go through  all

this  for one simple reason: that we know that that  is

the  best  way  to  have  a calm,  collected,  rational

situation  in  Singapore. That is the  situation  which

will  prevail when the terms of this motion are carried

out by or before June 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid the Member is now too late.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose the Prime Minister will

be reading Hansard sometime. Mr Marshall, in reply?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Anson take his seat?

I  do  not know whether the Member for Cairnhill wishes

to speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Certainly, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I would not have

cared  to  rise again to speak on the amendment  before

the  House. But it would seem that the Barisan Sosialis

are indulging in a smear. The regularity of their smear

is  that the S.P.A. and the P.A.P. are nothing but the

same Party. Surely, Sir, the S.P.A. have said that  the

Barisan  Sosialis and the P.A.P. are  nothing  but  the

same  Party. They came from the same rotten egg.  There

is  nowhere they can hide. They came into this Assembly

as elected Members of the P.A.P. They sit behind us now

as  Members  of the Barisan Sosialis when  the  Barisan

Sosialis was not heard of in 1959.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Thirteen rotten eggs!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> What about the Labour Front and

the S.P.A.?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the truth sometimes hurts. In

this particular case, the truth must have hurt some  of

the Members of the Barisan Sosialis who claim that they

are much better than anybody else in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Certainly better than the S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, we in the S.P.A. have said in

this  Assembly  that we are not and never  will  be  an

irresponsible  Opposition. As elected  Members  of  the

Assembly,  we  have a sacred duty to discharge  to  the

people  of Singapore, to see that things are right  and

that we should give all our support to things that  are

right. But if things go wrong, we should be very,  very

critical. The Barisan Sosialis, however, Sir,  find  it

necessary to play politics in almost every little thing

that comes before this House. They have now done so  on

a  matter on which there is no controversy, on which no

Party represented in this Assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



has  said  that  there  should be  no  referendum.  All

Parties have said that there must be a referendum.  Yet

so  much  time  has been spent on all  these  exchanges

between  ex-comrades, who belonged to the same camp  at

one time, that the debate has degenerated to the extent

that the following words were used: "paranoid rooster",

"dictatorship  Government", "Fascist Government".  Even

the  Government has gone to the extent of  calling  the

Barisan   Sosialis   Communist,   Communist   inspired,

Communist front organisation. Sir, let us be done  with

all  these  unnecessary bitter exchanges which,  boiled

down,  are nothing but the political jealousy of people

who have fallen out. We have all agreed that there must

be  a  referendum. Even the Government  has  said  that

there  must  be  a  referendum.  The  Barisan  Sosialis

want - or  do  they? - a  referendum.  But  what  is   more

important  to  the  people  of  Singapore  is  how  the

questions  are  to be posed. It is not  the  fact  that

there  will  be a referendum - that they have lost  sight

of.  They are all worrying as to who is going to  claim

the  credit  for forcing the Government  to  conduct  a

referendum. The Government has said that it is  already

committed  to  a referendum. Therefore, the  Government

may think it must get all the credit and the Opposition

Parties  should  shut up and should  not  try  to  play

politics.  All that is not necessary, especially  in  a

matter  that affects the very livelihood of the  people

of  Singapore.  The  Workers'  Party  and  the  Barisan

Sosialis  keep  on repeating that the  S.P.A. and  the

P.A.P. are working hand in hand. What is this? I  would

like  to say, for the last time in this Assembly,  that

the  S.P.A. will be the only Party that will teach  the

P.A.P. the real lesson of their lives. It will not  be

the  Barisan, because the Barisan are nothing  but  the

P.A.P.  They are the P.A.P. Whether the P.A.P. on  that

side  are  discredited or the P.A.P. on  this  side  are

discredited is immaterial. They are still the P.A.P. We

have  said  to  the  electorate that  the  Barisan  are

nothing but the P.A.P. They have said that we are going

to  abstain  on this motion because, according  to  the

leader



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



of  the Barisan Sosialis, we even dare not support  the

P.A.P. motion  because we know that we will  lose  the

goodwill  of  the people of Singapore. As a responsible

Party,  we do not worry about such a thing. We do  what

is  right.  And we did what was right when we  arrested

the Communists in Singapore. We are not like the P.A.P.

who  keep  on describing the Barisan as Communists  and

yet do nothing about it. We are men of calibre, men  of

responsibility, and we stand by what we do. Even as  an

Opposition, if the Government do right, we will support

them.  We  do not have to be like the Member for  Anson

who  attended  their  industrial estate  and  came  out

singing  high praises of the P.A.P. We do not  want  to

sing  high praises of the P.A.P. If they do right,  and

if  they have done right, we will support them. But  we

do  not sing high praises of the P.A.P. and then  conic

to  this  place and call the Front Benches one kind  of

name,  the Back Benches another kind of name, with  all

the  unnecessary exchanges of harsh words like the cock

crowing  at  all times of the day. We do not  do  that,

Sir.  We, as a responsible Opposition, do what we think

is  right  for the people of Singapore. We say  that  a

referendum  is  necessary and that  the  views  of  the

people  of  Singapore should be consulted. Let  us  get

away  from all this talk about merger, merger,  merger.

Command  Paper  33  is not merger. Do  not  talk  about

merger  anymore.  It is a closer relationship,  a  step

towards reunification of the two territories. So let us

forget  all  this  talk about merger  when  it  is  not

merger.



<br><br>6.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are

opposed  to  the amended motion in front of the  House.

The  original motion moved by the Member for Anson only

wishes  to  seek  an assurance that  there  will  be  a

referendum  on  the  so-called  merger  proposals.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the amended motion by the  Deputy  Prime

Minister presupposes that there will be a referendum on

merger,  and  I  fully agree with  the  leader  of  the

S.P.A./U.M.N.O. Alliance, the Member for Cairnhill, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



his  speech just now that the White Paper proposals are

not merger proposals, because in a merger, that is,  in

a  genuine reunification of Malaya and Singapore, there

should  be  only one type of citizenship  and  not  two

types  of  citizenship. Mr Speaker, Sir, as  such,  we

oppose the first part of the amended motion. I remember

that  as  early  as  18th September, we  requested  the

Leader  of the House to put the P.A.P. merger proposals

to  a  referendum. A few days later, the  Minister  for

Finance,  in  a  radio forum, agreed  that  the  P.A.P.

merger  proposals would be put in a referendum  to  the

people for decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not changed our stand on

holding a referendum. Since our declaration on the 18th

of   September  till  now,  our  stand  has  been  most

constant.  The Government wish to claim credit  in  the

amended  motion that they are the first to put  forward

the idea of a referendum. We do not mind the Government

taking this credit from us. But what we do mind in  the

amended motion is that part which says "on the mode and

manner of the inevitable reunification of Singapore and

the Federation of Malaya".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the original motion of the Member

for  Anson  only  wishes to seek an  assurance  on  the

referendum.   After  the  Minister  for   Finance   was

committed  to a referendum, we felt that the Government

had  second thoughts on the holding of a referendum  to

decide  on  the  White Paper. At first, the  Government

were  assured  they  could  win,  with  the  referendum

conducted honestly, fairly and squarely. That  was  why

the  Prime  Minister, in his reply  to  the  Opposition

Party  leaders  on the 12th of October,  1961,  assured

them that the people would be asked to accept or reject

the White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

repeating  his speech which he made when  he  supported

the  amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown,  and

that  amendment was inviting the House to  welcome  the

Singapore National Referendum Bill in order to  hold  a

referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people as  to

whether or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



not  they  are  prepared  to accept  the  proposals  as

embodied in the White Paper on merger. I have indicated

that  that  topic is closed because the  amendment  has

been rejected. I have allowed passing references to it,

but  I  think the Member for Hong Lim is going  further

than just making passing references.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, my intention is not to

deal  with it at great length, but just in passing.  We

will  be  very happy if the Government can  give  us  a

categorical assurance of what is meant by "the mode and

manner of the inevitable reunification of Singapore and

the Federation of Malaya". What are the questions to be

posed to the people in the referendum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that, on the one hand, the Government had

hesitated  in  holding a referendum, but on  the  other

hand,   they   had   already  in  their  pronouncements

committed  themselves to the holding of  a  referendum.

Therefore,  having decided that they  must  go  through

with  the  referendum, they will now pose the questions

in such a way that they will be sure to win.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am only trying to trace the

reason  why  we  feel  that the  Government  have  been

delaying  the Second Reading of the Singapore  National

Referendum Bill. Meanwhile they have thought of  a  new

loophole  to  get  away  with its  White  Paper  merger

proposals which the people of Singapore have rejected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will say that I enjoyed the

belligerency  of  our  lion - like Member  for  Cairnhill

today - "We  men  of  character".  We  are  such  men  of

character,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that we have  two  minds,

and  the  one mind - which says no is equal in strength

to  the  other mind which says aye; and the one cancels

the  other  out; so we sit on the fence.  That  is  the

responsible  conduct of a Party on a  matter  of  grave

national importance in the Assembly. That is a  curious

interpretation of responsible conduct of  the  people's

representatives on an issue of national  gravity,  that

they are men of such character that they cannot make up

their minds.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson up to now is

not out of order in what he is saying. But he is out of

order  in  addressing  a Speaker  who  is  not  in  the

Strangers' Gallery. He should address the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I enjoy watching you.

You will forgive me - [Laughter] - sometimes you make a

change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had two speeches from the Government benches. I

must  confess, Mr Speaker, in the seven years  that  I

have  known the Prime Minister - I have watched him  here

for  only  a  few years - I have never known  him  so:

restrained and so brief. We are accustomed to the Prime

Minister,  once  he gets on his hobby horse  about  his

friends,  the Communists, to go on and on  and  on  for

hours.  I must say I am grateful for the discipline  he

has  displayed  today  and I can understand  his  acute

embarrassment,  having a mind that is  not  foreign  to

logic,  to  have  to- come here and defend  the  shabby

position of the Government. He says it is difficult  to

see what objections there can be to this amendment.  He

then notes that that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



exactly  true of the motion that is before  the  House,

which  only  seeks an assurance that there  will  be  a

referendum which will be complied with. He says a great

deal  of  animosity  could be aroused  if  a  sense  of

injustice could be inspired in the Chinese. But that is

exactly   why  the  original  motion  pleaded   for   a

referendum in modest terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what was their difficulty and their objection?

Ours, says the -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Minister for Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thanks. The Minister for Culture. "He

was cock-crowing and we did not want the cock to crow."

I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that had I known that - it

is possible even now - I would gladly have allowed them

to  resign,  remove and withdraw that motion,  and  let

them  move  it  in my place and any time  that  happens

again, I promise solemn secrecy for the passage of  the

motion;  if  they want it, they can take it  over.  You

know,  Sir, I think you have been here for seven  years

as a Speaker and you have probably listened to a lot of

nonsense, Sir, if I might say with respect, of what  is

sometimes mentioned here. But I wonder whether you have

ever come across anyone with the extraordinary capacity

of the Minister -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Before the Member for Anson

carries  .on, I am afraid he might involve the  Speaker

more  and  more in this controversy about the character

of  Members  who have passed through this Assembly  for

the last seven years, and I do not think he ought to do

that. He might embarrass the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, the joy of asking you

questions  is  that unlike a wife you do  not  have  to

reply,  Sir.  [Laughter] Of course, I  am  biased,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, but I must confess that never in  all  my

life  have  I ever come across a human being  with  the

remarkable capacity of the Minister to utter unpleasant

noises - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> - which achieve a pathological

pattern  of  English words cemented  by  the  slime  of

malice to the extent that he does. Mr Speaker, he  has

told  us  that he objects - and that is why - to  my  cock-crowing.  But  watch  the  amendment,  Mr  Speaker - the

paranoid amendment - "in view of the Government's clearly

stated  stand". It is the Government's introduction  of

the  "National",  bless  the Government.  Sir,  who  is

paranoid? Mr Speaker, who is paranoid?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Look at the mirror.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, the dishonesty of the

P.A.P. is  typified  by  the  Front  bench,  but   in

particular  by  this  Minister, and  I  will  show  you

examples  ex  facie  curiae in your  presence  in  this

Assembly,  in this debate, of this blatant,  unblushing

dishonesty, not that I consider the Minister is capable

of blushing, irrespective of his complexion. [Laughter]

The first dishonesty was with reference to my so-called

misinterpretation  of his Prime  Minister  who  made  a

speech on the 16th of March here, Sir. And he said, "so

the question of winning or losing a referendum does not

arise,"  as  I  quoted it. "If there was the  slightest

risk of merger being frustrated and the country plunged

into disaster by the activities of the Communists,  let

me  say  that it will be criminal folly on the part  of

the  Government to hold the referendum and to allow the

future  of  Malaya and Malaysia to be imperilled."  So,

Sir, he is saying - at least I speak English; and you and

I  speak  English,  Mr Speaker;  it  is  the  official

language  whatever  the  P.A.P. English  may  mean - this

means nothing. But if there was a chance the referendum

were  to  be  defeated, the man who sought  to  have  a

referendum  would  be a criminal  fool.  But  says  the

Minister  for Culture, his Prime Minister  meant,  when

the   Prime  Minister  continued,  "If  that  were  the

position, if the risk existed, then it is the  duty  of

the  Government  to go through with it  to  ensure  the

peace,  security and happiness of the people, not  just

for Singapore, but for Malaya." then it means the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



referendum. So according to him, his Prime Minister  is

a  criminal fool who is prepared, in spite of the  risk

existing,  to  go  through with the  referendum  which,

according  to  the Prime Minister himself  and  by  his

assessment, it would be criminal folly to hold. That is

the  first  and most blatant dishonesty.  Sir,  I  have

watched with interest, and I must say the embarrassment

of  the  Barisan  everytime the P.A.P. bring  up  this

question  of  Penang  and Malacca,  where  the  Barisan

really  put  their  foot  in it through  an  inadequate

understanding of legal technicalities. It is certain to

my  mind, Sir - I may be wrong - they did put their foot in

it  and the P.A.P. are making capital to the extent  of

the most extraordinary distortion. Now, Sir, just watch

him who blatantly in your presence in this Assembly  so

dishonestly  misinterprets  simple  English  words.  He

says, "My Prime Minister meant that despite the risk we

would  nevertheless  go on with the  referendum,"  when

there  can  be no question about the meaning  when  the

Prime  Minister  said that if there  was  any  risk  of

losing  the  referendum, no referendum would  be  held.

That  is the Prime Minister that is his democracy, that

is the P.A.P. dictatorship. It is nothing new. Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very first speech the Prime Minister made in this

House  which  I  read in Hansard was one  of  anguished

longing,  looking towards Pakistan, towards  Burma  and

towards  Indonesia  and telling you  how  inappropriate

democracy  was  for certain parts of Asia.  He  fancies

himself as a dictator, and this is one of the steps  to

dictatorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us pass on, Sir. The next dishonesty is this:

the Minister has told you here that the Government will

abide  by the wishes of the people as expressed in  the

referendum. But, Mr Speaker, you circulated  to  us  a

copy  of  the amendment to the motion of reference,  no

doubt  prepared  beforehand by the Government,  and  it

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To leave out the words "the wishes of the voters of

Singapore  will  be ascertained by referendum  and  the

Government will act in accordance with the views of our

citizens so expressed".'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



And  the  words "the Government will act in  accordance

with  the views of our citizens so expressed" have,  in

fact,  now  been deleted from the express amendment  of

this Government and are no longer in the amended motion

before the House. That is the second blatant dishonesty

of  the Minister for Culture in your presence. He  says

that  the  Government intentionally and consciously  in

writing  sought the defeat of that part of  the  motion

which says that the Government will abide by the wishes

of  the  people. It expressly excides it, and it stands

deleted,  and  it  is  no part now  of  the  Government

amendment.   So  what  is  this  hypocrisy   that   the

Government will abide by the wishes of the people  when

it intentionally asked for and obtained the deletion of

that phrase?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the third one: that it is the desire of the

Government to abide by the wishes of the people and  to

find  out  whether they wish it or not. If I  may,  Mr

Speaker,  in  passing, point out  what  has  been  ably

brought  out by the Member for Hong Lim - that there  was

an  assurance  given  by the Prime  Minister  that  the

people  would  be  given an opportunity  to  reject  or

accept  the arrangements arrived at with the Government

of the Federation of Malaya, and that it would be by  a

referendum.  But  the  Government  defeated  the   very

amendment  which sought to put that, and  that  is  the

amendment of the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Culture has complained

to  the bankrupt Opposition: What alternative have  the

opposition got to their proposals?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is part of the Speaker's duty

to  know who is speaking. And if the Member changes his

voice, I do not know whether I am right in saying  that

the  Member  for  Anson is speaking  or  not.  I  would

suggest  to  the  Member for Anson  that  he  uses  his

natural voice.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, it

goes  against the grain of my natural voice  to  repeat

words  said with such hypocrisy by the Minister. But  I

will accept your ruling, Sir, and I will seek to comply

with it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture complained that the

Opposition  had no alternative proposals. Mr  Speaker, has

the  Opposition  been given any  opportunity?  You yourself

are aware that in this very House the  motion which

suggested  that  there should  be  an  All-Party conference

on the subject to which we might be able  to contribute,

was defeated. And I say with respect,  Sir, I  believe

that  Opposition Members have  constructive

ideas  to  contribute  which could  make  possible  the

reunification  of  Singapore  with  the  Federation  of

Malaya  ultimately, and a phased reunification with  an

immediate closer relationship not very far off from the

existing   one  but  with  minor  and,  to   my   mind,

necessarily  acceptable changes. But  what  opportunity

have   we  had  to  present  these  views?  Would   the

Government listen?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what is the difficulty.., asked the Prime

Minister, that we find with this amendment? Well, I could

stomach the cock-crowing. We have to stomach so much

more from these gentlemen opposite that, in  view of

the  Government's  clearly  stated  stand  on  the question

of  merger, it is not merely the cock-crowing part,  but

their stand on the question of merger,  Sir. Does anybody

know, except that they introduced a motion

last year asking us to affirm our faith in merger when,

in  fact,  as  the Member for Cairnhill  quite  rightly

said,  supported by the Member for Hong Lim, they  were

not  talking  of merger at all. What is  their  clearly

stated  stand,  except  the  stand  of  hypocrisy   and

deception?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, excepting that stand of deception, "this

House  welcomes  the  Government's  introduction".  Mr

Speaker.  I have already said, and you have  heard,  we

welcome  the  introduction. But they want it  repeated,

and  I  will repeat it for Radio P.A.P. and I  have  no

doubt  the Minister will see it is carried, "We welcome

the introduction of the National Referendum Bill."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will notice that it does not say "and

assures the House that the wishes of the people will be

ascertained". There is no assurance. It points out that

the  referendum machinery can be used. It does not mean

it must be used. There is no assurance as sought by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



original  motion  that  it will  be  used  "to  hold  a

referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people on the

mode  and manner of the inevitable reunification". Sir,

I  am  afraid I do not know which constituency the hon.

Member sitting on the extreme left of the U.P.P. comes

from,  but  he  gave a rather homely example.  He  said

something like this: "We all agree that we like  rice."

That  is  so,  Sir,  and  if  I  might  add  that   the

Government's questions would want to be: "Do  you  want

it  cooked with arsenic sauce served for lunch or  with

opium  served for dinner?" Mode and manner!  Not,  Sir,

"Do  you want rice served for dinner?" Ah, no.  Do  you

help   the   mode   and   manner  of   the   inevitable

reunification?  Mr Speaker, all that  the  Member  for

Queenstown's  amendment  sought  was  to  clarify   the

original  motion by saying "to ascertain the wishes  of

the  people  as  to whether they want the  White  Paper

arrangements or not." But that was defeated. And now we

have, "the mode and manner", and they tell you, "We are

democrats." Yes, democrats. Not only do they  leave  it

at   "the  mode  and  manner"  but  supposing  it   is

permitted - I do not know whether it will be permitted or

not - and  you cross out both the opium and arsenic  and

indicate  you want neither, there is no assurance  that

the   Government   have  specifically   permitted   any

suggestion of any promise to comply with the wishes  of

the people. And yet they complain of abuse because they

are  told - and this is the truth - that they are the ones

who  will  kill democracy and who are killing democracy

in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, here is one delightful little vignette. I

went into a butcher's shop in my constituency and  I said

to an elderly man through an interpreter: "Do  you

think  there will be a referendum?" He said, "Oh,  yes,

the  Government promised." And I asked,  "That's  fine.

Now  what  would  you  do if, in  the  referendum,  the

Government said, `Would you like to beat your wife or

would  you rather beat your daughter?' ". Do  you  know

what  his reply was, Sir? He said, "That can't  happen.

It  won't be democratic. It isn't democracy." Now, Sir,

here  is  a simple man, and it is good to feel that  he

genuinely believes in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



integrity  of  the democratic process -  that  dishonest

things  like  that could not happen. To him  it  is  as

simple as that. And if it happens, Mr Speaker, do  you

not  visualise  what  it  would  do  to  his  faith  in

democracy?  And the faith of all the tens of  thousands

of   others   who  have  a  far  greater   measure   of

appreciation and recognition of the value of  democracy

and a desire for it than any of us recognise. What will

it  do  to  them? Who is destroying democracy  in  this

country?  There can be but one answer, and that  answer

has  been proved in the shameless smokescreen  of  this

amendment  of  the P.A.P. which seeks to  transform  a

simple but precise motion of assurance, to which no one

who is not a Machiavelli, could take objection, into  a

nebulous motion that means little, if anything, leaving

everything to the Government. "mode and manner" will be

interpreted as the P.A.P. pleases. And if the  Minister

for  Culture is given an opportunity, you will probably

need  to  know all the languages and put  them  in  one

drum, shake them all up together, and you will have  to

get  a  dictionary to interpret what the P.A.P. means.

Because, Sir, the Minister has told you that if  I  say

to him, "It rains. Go out and check," let me assure you

that  if he tells me that it is raining, I will not  go

out  and check; I am sure it has not rained and  it  is

not   raining,  because  I  know  one  thing:   he   is

pathologically  incapable  of  telling  the  truth   or

speaking   with  reasonableness  or  decency   to   any

Opposition  Member or any of his opponents. The  P.A.P.

are quite incapable in politics of playing straight  or

playing  honest. They have shown it to us.  The  people

have trusted them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in an incipient democracy one cannot blame

the people for making the mistakes that they have made.

And  the  virtue of democracy is that  within  a period

that mistake can be rectified. But it seems that our

people   having   made   a   mistake   that    is understandable,

will  never  have  an  opportunity  to rectify it because

the advantage having been gained  by the  P.A.P. with their - what was the phrase used by the

Member  for Cairnhill? - paranoid ambition, is it?  I  do

not know whether the word was "paranoid", but let



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



me  not use words that I do not know. But certainly  it

was  with an extraordinary ambition that exceeds normal

human  bounds, an ambition that considers itself beyond

all   morality,  beyond  all  decency;  their  personal

ambition supreme over the people's will. How they  sit,

glued to those chairs of theirs. How they sit and  want

to sit and want to continue to sit. And they talk of me

as  seeking to take credit. I left my chair without any

need to do so, because I considered it contrary to  the

welfare of the people that there should be a government

continuing  to  be  headed  by  me,  giving  them   the

impression that the provisions which were brought  back

from England were legitimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us pass on from that to the recognition that

the  position has been reached where our people, having

made the mistake of trusting these persons on the Front

Bench,  are now to remember them for the rest of  their

lives and their children's lives and to regret it.  And

the  people's  only  hope is  not  any  more  in  their

personal representatives, for the S.P.A. could help  us

and  can still help us to defeat this amendment, except

that  they  have got two minds, neither  of  which  can

agree  with  the other and none cancels the other,  and

with their sense of responsibility they sit on the side-line.  The people can no longer expect. And though  the

newspapers will not carry it, I make one further  plea,

Sir,  before  sitting  down. That  is  a  plea  to  our

brothers  across  the Causeway not to condone  or  lend

themselves  to  this  conspiracy  of  the   P.A.P. to

perpetrate  a major act of perfidy upon the  people  of

Singapore.

no difference.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I declare the result, I think I

had better clear the position as regards a pair. A pair

is really only necessary when there is a specific "aye"

on one side as against a "no" on the other side. But

any Member may, if he so desires, wish it to be

recorded that he has made arrangements to be paired.

Accordingly, against the Prime Minister's name on the

record will appear the words "paired with Mr A. P.

Rajah". Mr A. P. Rajah, of course, will be recorded as

being absent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 23 Ayes; 16 Noes; 6 Abstentions and 6

Absent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion, as amended, accordingly agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in view of the Government's clearly stated stand

on  the  question  of merger, this House  welcomes  the

Government's  introduction of  the  Singapore  National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain  the  wishes of the people on  the  mode  and

manner of the inevitable reunification of Singapore and

the   Federation  of  Malaya  before  arrangements  are

finalised  and  before  any  request  is  made  by  the

Government  of Singapore to the British Government  for

transfer  of territorial sovereignty over Singapore  to

the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia.
