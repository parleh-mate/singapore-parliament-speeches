Head 1201 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for head 1201 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether he

would  consider  setting up a recuperation  centre

for   people  who  are  recuperating  from  mental

illness  and  who had been treated  at  Woodbridge

Hospital. It is true that Woodbridge Hospital  has

excellent  facilities for the treatment of  mental

patients.  However, many mental patients  who  are

considered  fit are sent home to stay  with  their

families. From the medical point of view, this may

be  desirable. But from the social point of  view,

this  creates  problems for the  families  of  the

mentally  sick,  especially  those  who  stay   in

Housing  Board  flats.  On account  of  the  close

proximity of the flats, a mental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



patient  who has been discharged from the hospital

is  easily  identified  by the  residents  and  is

shunned  and  ridiculed. Such attitudes  not  only

affect  the  mental well-being of the patient  but

also  affect the relationship between  his  family

and his neighbours. As a result, tremendous strain

is  imposed  on  the patient's  family.  They  are

treated as social outcasts by their misfortune  of

having  mentally  ill persons staying  with  them.

Families  of such patients, and neighbours  alike,

request  for  transfers to  other  flats,  in  one

instance,  a  patient  pounded  on  the  doors  of

neighbouring flats in the middle of the night.  In

another  instance,  a patient consistently  abused

and threatened her neighbours, although she turned

out to be harmless. There are other instances, but

it would take too long a time for me to elaborate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Woodbridge

Hospital  authorities have been very helpful  when

such cases are referred to them. The patients  are

readmitted but discharged again after a period  of

observation and treatment. The solution  does  not

end  there.  What  we need is a place,  preferably

outside  the  Hospital, where discharged  patients

can  be  taken care of or trained to do  something

useful, maybe on the lines of the Trafalgar Home.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

addition  to this amendment on Head 1201,  I  have

another   amendment*  on  Head   1202,   Hospitals Division. Can I range over both amendments, Sir?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment, standing in the names of Messrs P.  Govindaswamy  and Ch'ng  Jit  Koon,  reads  as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1202 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, recently,

while  one  criminal  was  under  treatment  in  a

hospital,  he  got the help of an  accomplice  and

escaped. After this incident, I want to know  what

measures have been taken to tighten up security in

the wards where prisoners are being treated?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctors who work in the hospitals sometimes

have to be on duty for 24



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



hours  at  one stretch. Although they are  allowed

time to sleep in special rooms, theoretically they

are supposed to have some rest, but in practice it

does not work that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> A person whose sleep is

interrupted every few hours is not going to  be  a

person with good judgment in emergency cases.  Are

our  citizens, who are sick in hospital,  made  to

suffer  at  the  hands of doctors,  who  have  had

insufficient rest? Surely it is inhuman to make  a

person  work  under such tiring circumstances.  No

wonder,  despite  all the incentives  in  pay  and

promotion  prospects, there  is  a  high  rate  of

resignation among doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also ask the Minister why the Thomson

Road  General Hospital does not deal with compound

fracture  cases?  Recently, a person  in  a  chase

after some boys, fractured an arm and was taken to

the Thomson Road General Hospital. The authorities

made  the poor man wait for more than two hours  I

mean two hours - before advising him to go to  the

Outram  Road  General Hospital as  there  were  no

facilities available at that hospital.  We  cannot

make  boast  of our hospital service  if  we  have

cases  like this. I wonder how many citizens  have

been   made   to  suffer  unnecessarily   by   the

authorities of this particular hospital. According

to  the  numerous complaints in the newspapers,  I

guess  there  must have been many cases.  Can  the

Minister do something about this matter and remedy

the situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know how long does the

emergency ward in the Outram Road General Hospital

take  to deal with emergency cases. Recently there

was an old lady suffering from a heart attack. She

was  taken  to the hospital by an ambulance  at  8

a.m, and was put in one corner unattended till  10

a.m.  I  wonder why the hospital authorities  take

such a long time to deal with emergency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



cases.   Either  the  doctors  cannot  cope   with

emergency  cases or something is  wrong  with  the

section.  Can the Minister do something to  remedy

the  situation  at  the  Emergency  Ward?  I  have

mentioned  only one case, but I am sure there  are

many  other  similar cases which might  have  cost

some lives as a result of such delays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise, Sir, is a

complaint  I  received from a  patient  that  some

hospital  nurses,  who  attend  to  patients,  are

unable  to make out the prescriptions of medicines

written  in the case-history of patients which  is

kept beside the patient. The complaint was that  a

nurse, in going through a case-history, was  heard

to  have told another nurse that she presumed  the

medicine  should be this and that.  This  sort  of

presumption  is not a playful matter  because  the

medicine given to the patients could be the  wrong

one  and  might cause mishaps eventually. Can  the

Minister    look    into   this    complaint    of

"presumptions" by nurses and see that they do  not

discuss  such matters in front of patients,  which

may  cause  worry to the patients who are  on  the

sick bed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have just heard some complaints about the Ministry

of Health as well as the medical practitioners.  I

do  not  pretend to answer for any of these.  Sir,

half   a  year  ago  during  the  debate  on   the

President's  Address  in  this  House,  I   raised

certain issues about health and hospitals. At this

sitting of Parliament, allow me to bring to  light

again these problems facing the Ministry of Health

and  the  good  health of our citizens  today  and

tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with pride, Sir, to note, if not with

assurance,  that the standard of health  care  and

the facilities available in Singapore is today the

best  in  Southeast Asia. The Minister for  Health

has  recently announced plans for the construction

of  new hospitals in the years to come. This, I am

sure  will further boost the Republic as a  health

centre in this part of the world. Already an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



increasing number of patients have come here  from

neighbouring  countries  to  seek  expert  medical

attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in the salary revision exercise for

senior  Division I officers, additional incentives

were  given  to consultant medical specialists  to

remain in service. This is a positive step to slow

down  the  drain of the specialists into the  more

attractive  and  more  lucrative  private  sector.

However,  salary  and service conditions  for  the

vast  majority of institutional doctors, dentists,

pharmacists,  nurses  and other  ancillary  staff,

remain  much the same. It seems imperative  to  me

that corrective adjustments in terms of salary and

service  conditions must be  made  if  we  are  to

prevent the present trend, short of an exodus,  of

moving  into  the private sector. A hospital  with

top  specialists  but  inadequately  supported  by

junior specialists and doctors is no good hospital

at  all.  In  other words, it is like  a  military

establishment with generals and no army.  Perhaps,

what  is  more  disturbing  is  the  shocking  and

escalating  trend  today  for  fewer   and   fewer

students  from  our schools to enter  the  medical

schools   and  elect  medicine  for  a   life-time

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis in Singapore today on science and

technology is necessary and unquestionable at this

stage  of  national  development.  However,   this

emphasis  has  unfortunately taken  its  toll  and

amputated, quite inadvertently, one of  the  limbs

of   essential  services,  i.e, the  medical  and

associated services. Singapore today has a  doctor

population   of  approximately  1,500   registered

practitioners.  This  gives  a  doctor  population

ratio   of   1:1,300  or  1:1,400.  Many   Western

countries  have attained the figure of 1:500,  and

they  still continue to face a shortage of doctors

and its related problems. If I were to proceed  in

my  analysis  and take the figure of  1:750  as  a

desirable  ratio to work on - I have  chosen  this

figure  in  view of the enhanced living  standards

and   sophistication  and,   again,   the   rising

expectations of the people -- we are  today  short

of at least 1,000 doctors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing for this shortage, and the exercise of

natural deaths and unnatural accidents, we need at

least between 100 and 120 new doctors annually  to

join  the ranks of the medical profession.  Do  we

have these many doctors graduating every year?  As

it   is,   Government  medical  institutions   are

understaffed.  What  with  projected   plans   for

setting  up  new  hospitals? I  have  chosen  this

sitting  of  Parliament to highlight this  serious

and,  I  think, potentially catastrophic  problem.

Sir,  if  I  may  submit figures to illustrate  my point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the medical school today, from Year 5 to Year 1, the number of medical students divided into citizens and non-citizens are as follows:



<pre>

                  Singapore     Non-

                   citizens   citizens

     Year 5           87         30

     Year 4           69         27

     Year 3           54         55

     Year 2           54         58

     Year 1           38         87

</pre>



<br>You  will  notice  that for the non-citizens,  the

ratio  is  completely reversed.  To  analyse  this

figure,  let  us  take  the final  and  first-year

students  ratio.  Final year, 30 non-citizens,  87

Singaporeans. First year, exactly the reverse,  87

non-citizens and 38 Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Dental Faculty, a greater disparity is shown:



<pre>

                  Singapore     Non-

                   citizens   citizens

Final year            14         20

Third year             3         35

Second year            3         32

First year             8         37

</pre>



<br>For the School of Pharmacy, the figures are:



<pre>

                  Singapore     Non-

                   citizens   citizens

Final year            10         10

Second year            6         17

First year             7         19

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, in the medical school, the number

of Singapore students has dropped from 74 per cent

to  a  low  of 30 per cent. In the Dental Faculty,

only   28   out  of  152  students  are  Singapore

citizens. In the School of Pharmacy, only  23  out

of 69, that is 1:3, are citizens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



We need dental surgeons very badly. We  need

pharmacists very badly, and we are also  short  of

doctors. The various professional bodies can, I am

sure,  provide  more  detailed  analyses  if   the

figures  I  have just given are not sufficient  to

wake  the authorities concerned. To my mind, there

are four approaches to solve the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Ministry of Education, in streaming

students  in the late secondary and pre-university

classes,  must  advise students or allow  them  to

choose   subjects  that  will  give  them  greater

flexibility.  There should be  room  for  them  to

choose  in  gaining admissions to  the  university

between  Science,  Engineering,  or  Medical   and

associated schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A question of motivation. Parents and

students  must  be made fully aware  of  good  job

prospects   and  also  of  the  present   manpower

shortage  problem in the Health Ministry,  in  the

hospitals and related professions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A greater incentive must be provided in terms

of salary and service conditions. Of course, pride

and  interest  in the profession,  dedication  and

mobility   of  the  career  must  also  be   major

considerations in electing careers for our  school

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The question of recruitment of non-citizens

into  our medical institutions. Over the past  few

years  an  increasing number of non-citizens  have

been recruited into our expanding medical service.

The non-citizens in this year's medical graduating

class  have all      been issued with forms asking

them  to apply houseman's jobs in Singapore.  With

the figures I have given, I guess we shall have to

do  the same next year, the year following and the

year following. However, past experience has shown

that  many, if not most, of these new doctors have

taken  up  appointment  as housemen  only  to  get

themselves  fully  registered  in  Singapore.  And

then,  using  Singapore as a stepping stone,  they

leave   for  Australia,  the  United  States,   or

England, or back to where they have come  from.  I

must admit that some stayed behind, but the number

is small. Further, we have recruited an increasing

number of specialists from the Indian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



sub-continent states to help us run  our  existing

service. I do not wish at this stage to enter into

a  discussion  as  to the merits  or  demerits  of

recruiting foreigners into our essential services.

Unless steps are taken to get our own citizens  to

run the store, I can well imagine that with time



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Ong, you have already

spoken  for ten minutes. May I remind hon. Members

that  the  guillotine time for this Head  is  3.00

p.m. Mr Chua.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may first answer

the last speaker, i.e, the Member for Kim Seng.  I

have  very little to quarrel with what he has just

said.  With regard to shortage of doctors,  if  he

had, in fact, followed some of my speeches made as

far back as 18 months ago, he would have heard  me

say  that  because of our expanding  programme  of

development  for the medical specialities  and  so

on, we would be short of doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards recruitment of - doctors, since we are

short of doctors, we cannot he very discriminating

as  to  whether they are citizens or non-citizens.

If  we have our own citizens among them, they will

be   given  first  choice.  If  we  have  not  got

applications  from our citizens, we  recruit  non-citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about the intake of students

in  the medical school. We have done our very best

to  encourage  students to  go  into  the  medical

school  and,  after graduation, to come  into  our

service.  One of the steps which the  Ministry  of

Health  has done was to have a traineeship  scheme

whereby  ordinary  doctors  can  at  the  shortest

possible   time  qualify  themselves   to   become

specialists.  That, in itself, has  been  quite  a

great attraction to many medical officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of conditions of service and pay of

ordinary  doctors and nurses, may I say  that,  as

far  as  nurses  are  concerned,  a  decision  was

recently handed down by the Industrial Arbitration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



Court.  In fact, the Court made  awards  to

raise  the  salaries of nurses quite substantially

and  it  even  elevated the divisional  status  of

nurses. Therefore, I would say that the terms  and

conditions  of service and pay of the  nurses  are

now  on par with the other services which have got

salary  revisions. The' other point about ordinary

doctors  is a matter which, I think, the  Minister

for  Finance did indicate that as far as the lower

echelon  of  the  civil service  is  concerned,  a

revision  of their salaries will take place.  That

is a matter which squarely rests with the Minister

for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Toa Payoh

concerns  mental cases which have been  discharged

from  Woodbridge Hospital. I fully sympathise with

the  plight  of some of the families who  have  to

take back their relatives who have been discharged

from the Woodbridge Hospital. May I say this:  the

modern  trend  in  psychiatric care  is  to  admit

mentally-ill patients into a psychiatric  hospital

only if they require active psychiatric treatment.

As  far as possible, patients should be treated as

outpatients  so  that  they will  not  lose  their

connection  with their families and the community.

This  method  of treatment is not only  economical

but    it   also   prevents   the   patient   from

deteriorating as a result of prolonged stay in  an

institution. Outpatient management does in certain

instances  result in a social problem to  families

and  neighbours,  especially if  they  stay  in  a

Housing  Board flat, as stated by the  Member  for

Toa  Payoh. The solution is to develop psychiatric

day-centres, and it is intended to include this in

the  future development of the Outram Road General

Hospital.  Such day-centres sometimes referred  to

as  day  hospitals are, in fact, identical to  the

creche  that  we  see  in our  community.  In  the

meantime,  a  half-way home  i  being  set  up  in

Sembawang - perhaps the Member for Sembawang  will

take  note of this -  for mental patients who  are

about  to  be discharged from Woodbridge Hospital.

This half-way home is to rehabilitate them and  to

readjust them back to normal life with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



their families, so that they will not be a problem

to  their  families  when they  eventually  return

home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned the case of a

patient  who went to Thomson Road General Hospital

but  could not get himself treated for a  compound

fracture. May I correct the misapprehension of the

Member for Anson? He thinks that all hospitals can

deal  with complicated cases. In fact, if you have

a compound fracture, it is an orthopaedic case. It

is  a  case for the specialist. As far as  Thomson

Road  General Hospital is concerned, it is not  as

big a hospital as Outram Road General Hospital. It

has  less  than 400 beds, and it is therefore  not

possible  to  provide  every  speciality  in  that

particular  hospital. Orthopaedic surgery  is  one

speciality  which  cannot  be  provided  in   the

Thomson Road General Hospital. Therefore, if there

is  a  case of complicated fracture, it has to  be

referred  to  the Orthopaedic Unit of  the  Outram

Road General Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case in question, which the Member for Anson

brought up, is this: when the patient came  up  to

the  Thomson  Road General Hospital,  the  surgeon

there wanted to deal with the case on an emergency

basis. At the same time the surgeon did explain to

the  patient that it would be better  if  he  were

treated in the Orthopaedic Unit of the Outram Road

General   Hospital.  The  father  of  the  patient

concerned was quite happy to go to the Outram Road

General  Hospital, instead of being treated  first

on a preliminary basis in the Thomson Road General

Hospital. Of course, in that event he had to  wait

because   the  orthopaedic  surgeon  had   to   be

contacted.  In fact, the orthopaedic  surgeon  was

eventually contacted, and the patient was sent  to

the Outram. Road General Hospital.

the following amendment was not proceeded with:-



<pre>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1202 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*. (*See footnote, cols. 935-6.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this

opportunity, on behalf of my constituents, to make

a  request  to  the authorities in charge  of  the

Outram  Road General Hospital. This request  comes

from  people  who live in Hospital quarters.  They

are  Grade III Medical and Health servants  living

in the quarters at Outram Road. These low-salaried

staff  occupy quarters at a low rent, which  is  a

very  reasonable move of the Government.  But  the

problem  is that these quarters are too  old,  and

the facilities are too basic and inadequate. Those

who live there have to share a communal kitchen, a

communal  toilet and also a communal bathroom  for

their showers. There are many other inconveniences

in  these quarters. Very often they quarrel  among

themselves   over  the  use  of   these   communal

facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is that if one occupant unfortunately passes away, or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



is  dismissed from the service for one  reason  or

another, or retires when he reaches the age,  then

his family cannot continue to occupy the quarters.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, we all know that  in  Singapore

today  it  is  not  easy to look  for  alternative

housing.  If a person applies for a Housing  Board

flat,  he will have to wait for a few years before

he  gets  his chance. But we know that the Housing

and  Development  Board  does  give  priority   to

certain applicants under special circumstances. In

any case, at very short notice, it is not easy  to

look for a place to live in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accommodation is one of the most important things

in   life.   Under   the  present   circumstances,

therefore, these people whom I have mentioned have

this  request to make. They would like to ask  the

authorities  concerned to make  arrangements  with

the  Housing  Board  so that they  can  move  into

Housing Board flats. From my investigations, among

these  people  who  live in  these  quarters,  the

majority  of them have already applied  either  to

buy  or  to  rent  Housing Board  flats.  But  the

Housing  Board will not give priority to them.  So

they  are requesting the authorities concerned  to

liaise  with  the  Housing  Board  in  order  that

priority  can  be given to their applications  for

flats,  so that the Government could demolish  the

old  quarters  and  use the land  for  some  other

purposes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, these quarters, which the

Member for Tiong Bahru referred to, were built  by

the  former  Singapore Improvement Trust  for  the

Outram  Road General Hospital. I agree  that  they

provide  relatively poor accommodation by present-day   standards;  for  example,  the  toilets  are

communal,    as   mentioned   by    the    Member.

Consideration  will  therefore  be  given  to  the

construction of new quarters in the re-development

of the Outram Road General Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding expediting the applications of these

Medical  and  Health servants  for  Housing  Board

flats, may I say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



these   applications   go  through   the   Medical

Superintendent's Office. They are  then  forwarded

to  the  Housing  Board with  recommendations  for

assistance for suitable flats. The rest is  up  to

the  Housing  Board. As the Member  knows  at  the

moment there is heavy pressure on the Housing  and

Development Board for allocation of flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision of $250,000 is for Improvement to

Sembawang  Hospital-Works and Buildings.  Sir,  we

know that the Government is doing its best in  the

development of medical facilities, Every year,  we

spend  more  than S90 million for the  maintenance

and further development of various projects in the

medical  field. Sembawang Hospital used  to  be  a

British  Hospital. It has now been taken  over  by

the  Singapore Government. The people in Sembawang

and  surrounding  areas will be  able  to  receive

better   medical  attention  and  care.  This   is

praiseworthy  indeed. I would like to  raise  some

questions.  Firstly, when will these  improvements

be   completed?  Secondly,  what   sort   of   new

facilities will be available? Thirdly, what is the

capacity of this new hospital?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the

first  question,  tenders for  the  renovation  of

Sembawang  Hospital  are now under  consideration,

and work is expected to begin next month and to be

completed in September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the facilities that would be

offered  to  the residents of the area  after  the

renovation has been completed, they are as follows:-



<br><br>(1) surgical in-patient and casualty cases:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) treatment of minor casualty cases of out-patient, less acute cases of in-patients,

and   providing  first-aid  to  major  cases

before  transfer to the Thomson Road General       Hospital;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) caters for minor surgeries; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) care of post-operative convalescent surgical

patients  from Thomson Road General Hospital

for lying-in before complete discharge.



<br><br>(2) medical in-patients:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) observation and investigation of cases

referred    from   Sembawang    out-patient

dispensary;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) initial treatment of acute medical cases

prior  to transfer to Thomson Road  General        Hospital;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) care of convalescing medical patients from Thomson Road General Hospital.



<br><br>(3) out-patients and follow-up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The out-patient clinic will provide specialist

out-patient  services for the area  and  follow-up

services  for its discharged patients and patients

resident in Sembawang who are presently follow-ups

in  Thomson  Road General Hospital. Such  patients

require specialist services before transfer to the

general out-patient services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



(4) dental clinic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hospital will have a new two-chair dental

clinic for residents in the area.



<br><br>(5) X-ray, laboratory and physiotherapy

departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The X-ray unit and laboratory will serve the

casualty  unit,  specialists  out-patient  clinic,

minor  operation  theatre,  in-patients,  and  the

Sembawang  out-patient dispensary. X-ray  services

may  be rendered for mass X-ray of factory workers

on   request.  Physiotherapy  services   will   be

available   to   in-patients,  out-patients   from

Sembawang Out-patient dispensary and residents  of

the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope what I have just enumerated in detail will

gladden the heart of the Member for Sembawang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  thank the Minister for giving a  detailed

reply. Although the scale of this Hospital is  not

very  big, but from the explanation given  by  the

Minister, it appears that the facilities are quite

extensive. So on behalf of the people of Sembawang

constituency, I would like to thank  the  Minister

for   the  efforts  his  Ministry  is  making  for

Sembawang constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $84,165,570 for Head 1202 ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $8,827,500 for Head 1202 ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names  of Messrs Cheong Yuen Chee and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Home Affairs is entrusted

with  the responsibility of internal security  and

law  and order. The Police Department comes  under

this Ministry, and therefore it has the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



duty  and responsibility to maintain law and order

in  our society. In recent years, the Police  have

improved  their  efficiency and relationship  with

the  people. This is something which deserves  our

praise.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have a few questions to raise here. In

recent  years the corrosive influence  of  Western

countries, particularly the hippy sub-culture from

abroad, has caused certain undesirable effects  on

our  youths. One of the bad influences is that our

young  people  are now sporting  long  hair  as  a

fashion. They would grow their hair down to  their

shoulders. Some of them sport a rather long beard,

even  though  they  are  very  young.  They  adorn

themselves with all kinds of fancy clothes.  Their

behaviour really poses a social problem. The craze

for  long  hair has become more prevalent  in  our

society. It is now one of the many social problems

Government  has  to face. It is also  one  of  the

problems which parents have to face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give an example. I have a friend who

has a son between 18 and 19 years of age. This boy

keeps very long hair and is causing a lot of worry

to his mother, who has a tender heart. She used to

give  him  advice now and again, but  without  any

result.  This angered her very much. She  told  me

that  she  hoped the Government would take  action

against the practice of keeping long hair, and she

even  hoped that the Police would cut off the long

hair of these youths. I feel that this is a social

problem  which  many parents are  facing.  Parents

usually  do  not like long hair. It  is  only  the

young  people  who sport long hair  as  a  fashion

nowadays.  We  have also found  out  that  certain

Government servants, for example, office boys, are

now  keeping  long hair. They even  sport  a  long

heard.  This is really too much. Even  on  the  TV

recently, in a singing contest programme, many  of

the  participants  had long  hair  down  to  their

shoulders. They also behaved in a wild manner



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



which  caused  many of us to shake  our  heads.  I

remember sometime ago the RTS took strict measures

to prohibit people with long hair from taking part

in  any  competition. I do not  know  why  it  has

relaxed this ruling. Is it because the authorities

concerned  have  forgotten about the  Government's

policy against long hair?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a young and dynamic state. We

should therefore maintain a good social vogue  and

tradition. We should teach our citizens to behave,

wear  tidy clothes and maintain a good appearance.

I  would,  therefore, like the  Minister  to  take

action  to  prevent any undesirable practice  from

gaining a strong hold on our young people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Ministry of Home Affairs had

issued  an  order  that  all  Government  servants

should  give the cold shoulder to any  youth  with

long   hair,   should  he  come  to  a  Government

department  on any matter. People with  long  hair

were  placed at the end of the queue. But it seems

that this ruling has now been forgotten. The civil

servants  do  not impose this ruling when  dealing

with  members of the public who keep long hair.  I

hope  the  Minister  will pay  attention  to  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like the Minister to

consider  is  the question of the  recruitment  of

policemen. According to my understanding,  in  the

recent  Police recruitment exercise  most  of  the

applicants came from Malaysia. A large  number  of

our  local citizens did not come forward  to  join

the  Police  Force. This is not a good  sign.  The

Police have the important task of maintaining  law

and  order in our country. The Police Force should

consist of people who are loyal to our country and

faithful  to  our citizens. They should  be  in  a

position to protect the lives and property of  our

people.  Therefore, I am of the  opinion  that  an

important establishment, such as the Police Force,

should be filled by our local citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now why is it that our local citizens are not

interested  in  joining the Police  Force?  Is  it

because the pay of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



Police Force is very low? What I know is that  the

salary  scales  for  the Police  Force  have  been

revised to some extent. Is it because the work  is

too laborious? If it is, I would like the Minister

to  look  into  the  matter and to  take  remedial

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to raise is that if our

male  citizens do not want to become policemen,  I

wonder whether we can recruit more women into  our

Police Force. We have found that recently quite  a

number  of  our traffic police are women.  I  find

that they are quite efficient.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members of

this  House have repeatedly brought up the subject

of road accidents which have been increasing at an

alarming  rate. Apparently measures taken  by  the

relevant   authorities   have   not   been    very

successful. In 1972, 3,982 vehicles were  involved

in  serious and fatal accidents. Along  the  Jalan

Toa  Payoh expressway, for instance, in 1970 there

were  55  accidents, one fatal. Between  1971  and

1972,  for over a period of 12 months, the  number

of   accidents   increased  to  97,   with   seven

fatalities. One more case died a few months ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was given to understand that the traffic police

had conducted a survey on this stretch of the road

and  had  made  recommendations  to  minimise  the

accidents,  including the provision of  pedestrian

crossings. I wonder whether a thorough survey  has

been made in this regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether the relevant

authorities  are  aware of  the  following  facts.

First,  trishaws,  cyclists  and  pedestrians  are

prohibited  from using the flyover at  Toa  Payoh.

Therefore, such road users, from the neighbourhood

of  St.  Michael's Estate and Balestier Road,  are

compelled to make a crossing over this stretch  of

road, approximately



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



100  yards from each side of the junction  of  Kim

Keat  Road and Jalan Toa Payoh, in order to  avoid

travelling  a  distance  of  two  miles  from  the

Thomson  Road  approach. Secondly, such  crossings

are  usually  made during peak hours and  at  dusk

between 6.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. when visibility is

very  poor.  I would suggest that to  improve  the

situation the traffic police should look into  the

question  of  providing a safer passage  for  this

group of road users by putting up Slow signs  near

this  stretch  of the road. There should  also  be

special  lighting at the junction,  and  increased

vigilance  by the traffic police to apprehend  the

speedsters  and  also  to  confine  vehicles  with

restricted speeds to specific lanes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what is the

guideline  used  in  the  issue  of  permits   for

religious street processions? The authorities  are

now  issuing permits for street processions, which

are  somewhat restricted. I wonder why the  Police

should deem fit to reject some of the applications

for  permits for street procession without  giving

any reasonable explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have to make an appeal in this Chamber on

this matter because the street procession is a vow

that  some religious groups have made, and it  has

since been a tradition. Therefore, where religious

matters  arc  concerned, I feel that the  Minister

should  consider relaxing the rules for the  issue

of  such  permits. If it is a question of security

measures that these permits have not been granted,

then  I would call upon the Minister to send  more

security officers to the procession to see that it

is being carried out peacefully.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

since the matter of traffic has been referred  to,

may  I  seek your permission to speak on  it  now,

instead   of   waiting  for  the  next  amendment*

standing in my name?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment, standing in the names of Messrs J.  F.  Conceicao, P. Govindaswamy and  Tuan  Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1151.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as our

traffic problem is concerned, it is obvious to the

most  casual  observer that traffic conditions  in

Singapore  are  indeed  in a  near-lawless  state;

literally  so. Almost every regulation imposed  by

the  traffic police is conspicuously more honoured

in  its  breach than in its observance.  There  is

scant regard for speed limits. Lorries, which  are

supposed  to go at 20 miles per hour,  more  often

than  not travel at about double that speed, fully

loaded. Cars generally go at least about 10  miles

per hour faster than they are supposed to go. This

occurs  in  many accident prone areas. In  my  own

constituency,  at a particularly  notorious  bend,

the   traffic  police  have  caused  many  clearly

visible signs to be displayed, urging motorists to

slow  down to 20 miles per hour. As far as I  have

observed, only pedestrians pay attention  to  this

sign.  And  there  are also vehicles  that  travel

slowly  in  the wrong lane -going along a  40-mile

per  hour highway at about 15 or 20 miles per hour

-causing  obstruction and inducing other motorists

to  weave  in and out. Forming up correctly  at  a

junction before making a right-turn is a procedure

which  only  a few motorists are aware of.  Double

white  lines  are  appreciated  possibly  for  the

meticulous way the P.W.D, has drawn them!  Traffic

lights are ignored even when they have turned red.

Pedestrians do not use overhead bridges.  I  could

go  on  with this litany, Sir, but I think I  have

made my point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the rule of the bully that

prevails  on  the road. It is the regime  of  one-upsmanship. It is "big fish eat little fish", with

cement-mixer trucks, buses, heavy vehicles playing

the  role  of the bold, had baron on the  highway,

and pedestrians being assigned to the lowest order

of  life,  with the weak and old among this  breed

being regularly assassinated. In the circumstances

of  what  I have outlined, Sir, I feel a  profound

pity  for  our Traffic Police Chief.  He  must  be

feeling  like the Dutch boy in the story, who  had

his  finger  in a hole in a dyke. He was  doing  a

heroic job but with quite inadequate resources.

To  add  to  the  dismay of  our  vehicle  control

authorities,  we  have  today  large   number   of

vehicles,  not  bearing Singapore  number  plates,

which  are  able  to  defy  our  regulations  with

impunity.    Obviously,   Sir,   a   comprehensive

retooling  of  the  way  we  enforce  our  traffic

regulations is called for.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a few suggestions to make:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) There should be more mobile enforcement

officers; equipped with radio communication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) These officers should be trained to educate

as well as book drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Where education is concerned, it is the

business  of all Government and statutory  bodies

to act in this regard in a concerted way. Just as

a  matter  of one example, when senior Government

officers drive around, they could be on the look-out  for  infractions on the part of vehicles  in

their Ministries. In the case of the Police,  all

police  patrols  and  not merely  traffic  police

should  take notice of traffic offences and  help

educate  or  book  offenders.  In  the  case   of

selective  enforcement operations, it  may  be  a

good idea to give wide publicity to the nature of

the   offence   that  will  come  under   special

enforcement  action.  This  is  to  give   notice

beforehand.  Wide publicity and  the  mass  media

should  be  more  extensively  used  to  acquaint

people  with a particular regulation  each  time.

This  educational process should he a  continuing

one,  and should not be carried out only for  the

duration   of  a  campaign,  whoever   may   have

organised it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The penalties for traffic offences should be

reviewed. There should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



greater   use  of  licence  suspension  and   even

revocation  of licence where danger  to  life  has

been  evident. In the case of severe  injuries  or

death  resulting  from a clearly culpable  action,

imprisonment  is  called for. Owners  of  vehicles

should also, to a carefully considered extent,  be

held liable for the way their employees drive.  In

any case, owners should be taught to realise their

responsibility  for  exercising  discipline   over

their employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Government should take an extremely serious

view  of  the sad state of our traffic conditions,

it is not only because hundreds of lives are being

lost  every year, and thousands are being injured,

and  tens of thousands of accidents are occurring,

but  because fundamentally all this shows a  scant

human  regard of one citizen for another. This  is

part  of a social malaise, like drug-taking, crime

and  delinquency. The Minister for  Home  Affairs,

and  also  in  his  capacity as the  Minister  for

Health,  will  doubtless agree that  if  the  body

politic   is   showing  signs  of   sickness   and

therapeutic measures are inadequate, then a  major

operation is called for. In this, it is the entire

Government   that   should  participate   in   the

exercise, and not merely one or two Ministries.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has

been  a  fantastic  increase  in  the  number   of

vehicles  on  our  roads during the  last  decade.

Although  there  is  a  continuous  widening   and

improvement  of our road system to cope  with  the

increase in traffic, yet our traffic police  force

has not kept pace with this increase. As a result,

it   is  a  common  sight  daily  to  see  drivers

violating every traffic rule on the roads. Matters

are  being made worse by our bus and lorry drivers

who  seem  to think that they are the untouchables

in the eyes of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will the strength of the traffic police be

increased   before  we  experience  a   disorderly

society giving vent to its feelings on the  roads?

The  road  seems  to be a place for  irresponsible

behaviour  on  the  part  of  our  young   drivers

particularly. There seems to be an alarming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



increase   in  the  number  of  traffic   offences

nowadays.   The  very  small  force   of   traffic

policemen is not able to cope with the increase in

traffic.  Offences of beating the  traffic  lights

and,  in  fact, ignoring the lights, seem to  take

place too often. It is time that the ordinary beat

policeman was given the right to book offenders on

the  spot.  On  this point, may I suggest  to  the

Minister that ordinary policemen be posted at  the

usual congested areas during the peak periods?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, drug addiction is becoming quite prevalent

in  Singapore. Though the Central Narcotics Bureau

has done an excellent job so far -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy, we are not

talking about narcotics now. We are talking  about

the  Commissioner  of Police.  Narcotics  will  be

considered under subhead 1651.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, it is the same thing, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not the same, I am afraid. It

is quite different. Perhaps you should wait until

subhead 1651 comes up.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the people

of  Singapore still need education in many matters

which   involve   their  morals,  especially   our

teenagers. Most of our youths have been influenced

by  fashions and cultures from the West.  Whatever

fashion  and culture that come from the  West  are

considered modern fashion and culture. But  if  we

scrutinise and analyse most of these fashions  and

cultures,  we find that they belong to  the  stone

age, and our youths imitate these fashions without

considering whether they are good or bad. If I  am

not  mistaken,  Sir, the Minister of  Defence  has

condemned the youths who imitate Western  fashions

as  WOGs, or Western-oriented gentlemen, the steel

guitar  music  as outrageous, and the  youths  who

sport long hair as hippies. I agree with the views

of the Minister of Defence. But what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



about  the  gentlemen who wear neckties and  those

who  play golf? Are they also WOGs? What I regret,

Sir,  is the attitude of the Government in respect

of  these  matters. The authorities concerned  are

not  firm  in  dealing with them. On one  previous

occasion,  the Police and Immigration took  action

against youths who sport long hair, but there  has

been  no  follow-up. The Ministry of  Finance  has

issued  circulars  to Government  departments  and

statutory  bodies  to  take action  against  their

staff  who  sport long hair, and to  serve  people

with   long   hair   last.   Nevertheless,   these

instructions  are  not  followed,  and  there  are

senior officers who still sport long hair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of WOG society, although the

Minister  of  Defence has condemned these  youths,

the  Trade  Division still allows  the  import  of

nylon stockings and records with outrageous music.

If   the  Government  is  sincere  and  wishes  to

eradicate  the  symptoms  which  will  affect  our

youths, it should be firm in its stand and  should

not  hesitate to take action to ban the import  of

silk and nylon stockings and "bad" records. On the

other hand, Sir, if the Government depends on  the

revenue from the import of these articles, then do

not  condemn the people who admire these fashions.

In  my  opinion, a more effective way to eradicate

these  fashions  is  to hold campaigns,  like  the

"Keep  Singapore  Clean  Campaign",  "Garden  City

Campaign"   and  similar  campaigns   which   have

received good response in the past. Similarly,  if

we organise campaigns along these lines, I am sure

the results will be beneficial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that the Police hold

an anti-vandalism campaign in Singapore because  I

find  that at the moment, our society is  not  yet

appreciative  of public property.  Many  lifts  in

Housing Board flats are vandalised. Some lifts are

disfigured  with  scribbles and obscene  pictures.

Some  people urinate in the lifts and commit  many

others  acts  of  vandalism. Bus shelters,  public

telephones and vehicles are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



spared.   The   Government  has  to  provide   bus

shelters, and the Singapore Telephone Board has to

provide public telephones. But because of acts  of

vandalism  by  a small section of the  population,

many  people suffer because they cannot use  these

facilities  in  times  of emergency.  The  STB  is

trying  to  provide as many public  telephones  as

possible  in the urban and rural areas.  But  with

increased  acts of vandalism on public telephones,

the   efforts   of  the  STB  to  maintain   these

telephones  have not been fruitful. Every  time  a

telephone   is   repaired,  it   would   only   be

serviceable  for  one or two weeks  at  the  most.

After  that,  these people with low  morals  would

commit  the act of vandalism. Therefore,  the  STB

has   experienced   losses  in  repairing   public

telephones. So I hope that in launching this anti-vandalism  campaign, the Police  can  educate  our

society  to  appreciate  public  property  and  to

impose heavy penalties on those who commit acts of

vandalism.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all

I  would  like  to take the point  about  traffic,

which  has  been  brought up by  the  Members  for

Katong, Toa Payoh and Anson. I entirely agree with

them  that  the traffic situation in Singapore  is

becoming  a serious problem, especially  with  the

increasing number of road accidents. However,  may

1 point out the prevention of traffic accidents is

not the sole responsibility of the traffic police,

it   also   concerns  departments  in  the   other

Ministries. Therefore, the traffic police maintain

close  liaison with the PWD and the ROV to improve

traffic  facilities, such as devising  schemes  to

facilitate  vehicular and pedestrian movements  on

the road, and introducing necessary legislation to

enhance  road safety. In fact, they have  recently

formed    art   Accident   Prevention    Committee

consisting    of    representatives    of    these

departments. A selective enforcement squad  within

the traffic police was formed in October, 1972, to

carry  out more effectively the selective  enforce

ment policy in respect of specific



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



offences. Besides, the traffic police initiate  as

well   as  participate  actively  in  road  safety

campaigns, which are always extensively publicised

through  the mass media. Towards the end  of  last

year  the  traffic police launched a  road  safety

campaign to educate motorcyclists, scooterists and

trishaw-riders. In February this year, as  Members

are aware, the traffic police also participated in

the Road Safety Campaign organised by the National

Safety    First   Council   and   the   Automobile

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to convictions, may I say that in all

convictions in respect of prevalent offences,  the

traffic police urge for deterrent sentences. In  a

recent  case, a driver was jailed for  six  months

and  disqualified from driving for five years  for

causing  death along Mountbatten Road in  October,

1972.  Perhaps  that  road is  within  the  Katong

constituency. This conviction and disqualification

was  widely publicised by the press and  the  RTS.

The   traffic   police  recognise   that   traffic

education  is  an integral part of Police  traffic

supervision  and  make  every  effort,   including

enlisting  the  assistance of the mass  media,  to

educate  the  public  on  road  safety.  In   this

connection, we are thinking of launching a nation-wide   "Keep  our  Singapore  Roads  Accident-Free

Campaign"  in 1974, along the lines of  the  "Keep

Singapore  Clean Campaign". However, in  order  to

ensure the success of such a campaign, we have  to

put our own house in order first. We are therefore

reorganising the Traffic Police Department and are

also looking into, as suggested by the Member  for

Katong, the traffic legislation with a view to up-dating them so that at the end of the Campaign  we

will be in a position to strictly enforce the law.

It  will not be possible to achieve success unless

this  nation-wide  campaign  succeeds  in  getting

everybody  to  participate in  it,  not  only  the

motorists  but also the pedestrians as well,  just

as  everybody  was involved in the Keep  Singapore

Clean Campaign. I hope we might be able to get the

Member for Katong, who is very interested in  this

subject, to help us in organising this nation-wide

campaign.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes, I will help.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Of course, the Member for

Katong  has  experience in this sort  of  campaign

while he was a member of the Safety First Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> The experience will be put to good use.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> On the specific point referred

to  by the Member for Toa Payoh concerning traffic

accidents in the Toa Payoh constituency, may I say

that  the Accident Prevention Committee,  which  I

referred  to  just  now, had already  studied  and

analysed  the traffic situation in Toa Payoh,  and

it has taken the following remedial actions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Nine of the 27 openings in-between road

dividers have been closed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Traffic lights have been installed at road

junctions in Toa Payoh East and Lorong 6, Lorong 1

and  Lorong 2, and Lorong 2 and Toa Payoh Central.

An  all-red period has been incorporated into  the

above traffic light system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Pedestrian crossing lights will be installed

along Lorong 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Installation of pedestrian crossing lights

at  Lorong 6, near Poi Ching School and  Pei  Chun

Public School, is under consideration.



<br><br>There  is a list of all these remedies, but  I  do

not  want  to  waste  the time  of  the  House  by

enumerating them. If the Member for Toa  Payoh  is

interested, and if he were to write to me, I  will

give  him all the details. So much for the traffic

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to touch on is about

long hair, brought up by the Members for Sembawang

and  Kampung Kembangan. May I say that there is  a

standing  instruction, contained in  I.M.  No.  2,

saying that Government officers must at all  times

wear   clothing  and  hair  style  that  give   an

appearance  of  neatness  and  decorum,  and  that

outlandish or flashy clothings and unduly long and

unkempt hair styles should be avoided. My Ministry

has,  by circular, reminded all its staff of  this

standing   instruction  and  requested  heads   of

departments to enforce the rules strictly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite recently, my Ministry has also set up an

Action Committee, chaired by a very senior officer

of  my  Ministry,  comprising  representatives  of

other  Ministries  and  statutory  bodies  to  co-ordinate  action to implement the  anti-long  hair

policy.   The   Ministry  of  Finance   which   is

represented  on  this Committee,  in  consultation

with  the  Public Service Commission,  is  looking

into  the question of suitable penalties for civil

servants   who   contravene  the  instruction   on

clothing   and   hair  style.  The   Ministry   of

Education,  I  understand, has also  directed  all

schools to ensure that male pupils keep their hair

short  and  neat. Assurances of co-operation  also

have been received from the institutions of higher

learning anti from representatives of the Chambers

of Commerce. The Ministry of Labour is also paying

due  attention to the longhaired males  who  apply

for   work   permits.   So  is   the   Immigration

Department,  in  the  case  of  applications   for

immigration clearance. Foreigners with long  hair,

wishing  to  enter  Singapore  on  a  visit,   are

required  to cut their hair short before they  are

allowed  in at the various check points. Returning

Singapore  students  with long  unkempt  hair  are

required  to  surrender  their  passport  to   the

Immigration  officers on arrival. Their  passports

will be returned to them after they have cut their

hair  short. Persons with long unkempt  hair  also

stand the risk of being checked by the Police,  as

they  invariably look suspicious. The question  of

how  to deal with long-haired performers in  night

clubs   and  places  of  entertainment  is   under

discussion  with the Tourist Promotion  Board  and

the Ministry of Culture. The mass media is also co-operating  not  only by giving less  publicity  to

long-haired  characters and their  activities  but

also  giving due prominence to speeches by Members

of  Parliament, like some of our Members here, and

other  responsible persons critical of long  hair.

The  National  Sports  Promotion  Board  has  also

issued  a circular to sports bodies drawing  their

attention to the anti-long



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



hair  rule  and  requesting their co-operation  in

implementing it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Action Committee, which I have just

mentioned,  is also discussing as to what  further

effective action can be taken to discourage  males

from  drifting towards the hedonistic way of  life

represented by long hair and hippism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I come to the Member for Anson and his

religious  procession? As a rule,  religious  foot

processions  in  the streets are not  allowed.  An

exception to this rule is Thaipusam kavadis, which

are  not similar to other foot processions in that

they  comprise  individuals who proceed  from  one

temple  to  another  in fulfilment  of  individual

vows. In issuing permit for kavadis, the following

conditions are imposed: that kavadi carriers  must

proceed  singly  or in small groups,  and  by  the

shortest  route to the designated temple.  Permits

may  be granted for religious foot processions  to

be  held  within the grounds of churches, temples,

mosques  and suraus. In the case of Kiew  Ong  Yah

and other religious processions involving deities,

permits are granted for processions but these  are

subject to the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Only vehicular processions are allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Distances travelled must be the shortest

possible route from point to point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) No music, gongs, drums or cymbals shall be

played en route.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The procession will be restricted to small

groups in vehicles, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) There shall be no stoppage en route.



<br><br>There   have   been  applications  for   religious

processions  which involve pulling a chariot  with

bullocks.  This was in connection with processions

on  Lord Krishna's Birthday. As these animals were

banned from the streets of Singapore - Members may

remember  the Cattle Act that we had  passed  some

years ago - organisers should consider the use  of

a motorised chariot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Sembawang spoke about

the  recruitment of non-citizens into  our  Police

Force. May I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



say  this  to him? It has always been the  aim  to

fill  all  vacancies  in  the  Police  Force  with

Singapore  citizens. Unfortunately, in our  recent

recruitment  drives, the response  from  Singapore

citizens   has  been  poor.  There   are   various

contributory factors, one of which is the  raising

of  the  minimum qualifications for entry. At  the

moment   the  qualifications  are  the   Singapore

Cambridge GCE Examination with a minimum of  three

Ordinary levels, whereas previously a Secondary II

certificate  would suffice. Moreover, many  others

who have the necessary qualifications are enlisted

into full-time national service on leaving school.

Those   who  have  completed  full-time   national

service  prefer  to take up jobs  in  the  private

sector.  Therefore, this recruitment of foreigners

is an interim measure which will cease immediately

when   the   response  from  local   citizens   is

sufficiently  good to cope with the needs  of  the

Police Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, something about what the Member for

Kampung  Kembangan has said - WOGs  and  anti-WOGs

campaign.  Although  we  can  organise   a   "Keep

Singapore Roads Accident-Free Campaign"  or  "Keep

Singapore Clean Campaign", I do not think  we  can

organise an "Anti-Nylon Stockings Campaign". I  do

not think it is possible.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what I meant was the anti-vandalism campaign

as a lot of public telephones have been damaged.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir, to

have  left  that  out. With regard  to  the  anti-vandalism campaign, may I say that it is  part  of

the  crime  prevention  campaign  which  has  been

organised by the Police Force throughout the year.

We  have been doing this in a number of ways.  One

is  the Police Week open house and exhibitions and

crime  prevention for festive seasons. The  Police

Week for 1972 was held at the Singapore Conference

Hall  concourse and at various community  centres.

This year, the Police Week



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



will  be  held  at the Victoria Memorial  Hall  in

June.  Open houses and exhibitions were introduced

in   September   1972.  These  open   houses   and

exhibitions are held over a period of  three  days

at  different times at the Headquarters station of

the  eight  land  divisions.  To-date,  five  open

houses  and exhibitions have been held.  The  next

one  will be held at the Beach Road Police Station

from  30th  March  to 1st April, 1973.  The  crime

prevention campaign for festive seasons for  1972-73  was conducted from 1st November, 1972 to  28th

February, 1973. The purpose of this campaign is to

plan,  co-ordinate, and implement counter-measures

to  combat  crime, including vandalism,  theft  of

motor-cars  and  motor-car  parts,   in   a   more

concerted  and  aggressive manner.  These  various

campaigns,  public warnings and  crime  preventive

measures  to  be  taken by the public  are  widely

publicised  through the mass media.  In  addition,

pictorial  and  graphic exhibits labelled  with  a

distinct crime prevention message in each case are

also displayed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding

the  religious foot procession, the hon.  Minister

has   not  given  an  answer  as  to  why  it  was

restricted last year. I had a lot of trouble  last

year.  When the devotees were all gathered in  the

Perumal  Temple and were ready to go to  Mariamman

Temple  for the fire-walking ceremony, they  found

that  the Police had blocked the place. They could

not move because they had no permission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these people have been holding

that procession for more than a hundred years,  so

what is the reason for stopping them last year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Times have changed!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> You cannot give that reason.

Has  there been any trouble previously? Has  there

been  any religious quarrel? This procession is  a

tradition. The Minister must not allow the  Police

to   stop  issuing  the  permit.  I  cannot   bear

listening to people talking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



about this, and, therefore, something must be done

regarding this procession. I would like to ask the

Minister to reconsider this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

explanation is quite simple. The Member for  Anson

himself  has stated the reason why we do so  -  he

did  mention the point about security. May  I  add

that the traffic problem has to be considered too.

That  is  why  we have advised them that  if  they

wanted  to  have  a vehicular procession,  perhaps

they could think of motorising the chariot. As the

Member  for Changi has just remarked, we  have  to

keep  up  with the times. Conditions have changed,

and our roads and traffic have also changed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, there is an increase in

the  volume of traffic, which cannot be controlled

at  the  moment.  And  on the last  occasion,  why

should they want to stop the procession? I do  not

think the Minister's reply is proper. The Minister

will  have  to  reconsider this  matter  and  give

favourable consideration next year. I do not  want

to say any more on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  before I withdraw my amendment, there  is  a

question  which  the  Minister  has  forgotten  to

answer.  This  is in regard to the recruitment  of

policemen. Not many of our male citizens have come

forward  because  many of  them  have  to  go  for

national  service. Since the number is  small,  he

has  to recruit non-citizens. May I put forward  a

suggestion?  If we have fewer male policemen,  can

we  not recruit more females? In other words,  can

we  not  recruit more policewomen  to  take  their

place?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I entirely agree with the

Member  for  Sembawang. In fact, this is  what  we

have  done.  Where  Police work  can  be  done  by

females, we see to it that they are done by  women

police constables. For example, we have gone round

to  the  various  departments of the  Police,  and

whenever we find that the work can be done



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



by  a  woman  police constable, such  as  clerical

work, the male police constable is released to  do

other jobs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  thank the Minister for his reply. On  the

question  of  long  hair,  he  has  given  a  very

detailed  explanation: that  all  the  departments

have  been  instructed to act against people  with

long  hair.  Sir,  this  goes  to  show  that  the

Government  is  going  all  out  to  tackle   this

problem. We are waiting to see the results. I hope

the  other  departments will take  more  effective

action against people with long hair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1601.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Vigilante Corps has a glorious history.

In  the face of external confrontation, a group of

civilians came forward in response to the call  by

the Government to take on the job of defending our

country  and  maintaining internal  security.  The

Vigilante  Corps was thus formed. At  its  maximum

strength,  the  number exceeded 10,000.  Recently,

only a few thousand members of the Vigilante Corps

are  left.  But  now  that we  have  the  National

Service  Vigilante Corps, every year a  number  of

new  recruits are taken into the Vigilante  Corps.

After  a  period  of fairly strict training,  they

become members of the Vigilante Corps. My question

is this. To-date, how many of these members are in

the  National  Service Vigilante Corps,  and  what

sort  of  work have they been doing? My  point  is

that  these members should be treated in the  same

way  as  the volunteers. In other words, we should

send them to various areas for patrol duties,  and

to assist the Police in the maintenance of law and

order.  This  will  enable  the  members  of   the

Vigilante Corps to gain more experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to raise is this.

The Vigilante Corps is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



volunteer organisation. Each member is given  only

two  sets  of uniforms. After a year or so,  these

uniforms  become  tattered  and  torn.   But   the

headquarters   does  not  issue  them   with   new

uniforms.  So  when they go out to  perform  their

duties, they have to wear faded uniforms. I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister if he  would  consider

issuing  a  new  set of uniforms annually  to  the

volunteer members of the Vigilante Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask is the

transport allowance for the group leaders  of  the

Vigilante  Corps.  These  group  leaders  have  to

travel  a  few  times  a  week  to  check  on  the

performance of duties by other members. They  have

to spend on petrol and transport, but they are not

given  any transport allowance. This has become  a

burden to the Vigilante Corps leaders. So I  would

like  the  Minister to consider giving  them  some

transport  allowance so that they  can  carry  out

their duties without being out of pocket.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wonder if the Minister will consider

recruiting volunteers. As far as I know, there are

many  people who would like to join the  Vigilante

Corps  so  as  to be able to contribute  something

towards  the  society. I think if we should  admit

them,  we  will  inculcate a sense of  duty  among

these people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I correct

one statement by the Member for Sembawang which  I

think  is  incorrect? He has stated  that  at  the

moment only a few thousand Vigilante Corps members

remain. That is not correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, do let the Minister make

his point. You may clarify later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> There are altogether 23,678

Vigilante Corps members. The other query he  asked

was:   what  duties  do  Vigilante  Corps  members

normally perform? They do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



perform  duties, Mr Speaker, Sir, but they  attend

training  once  a week. However,  members  of  the

Corps  are  often  called to augment  the  regular

Police  Force in crowd control, e.g. National  Day

Parade, Chingay procession, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the training of National Service

Vigilante  Corps  members, may I  say  that  after

having   completed  the  first  year  of  service,

Vigilante Corps members will proceed to  the  next

phase of training. They will be deployed for three

years'  service, but at the same  time  they  will

continue to attend training once a week for  three

hours. At the training centre, the men spend  half

the  time in civil defence services, such as fire-fighting,  first-aid, rescue and fire  drill.  The

other  half  of  the  time  is  utilised  in   the

promotion  of  one of three skills,  i.e, sports,

marine  or  cultural. Deployment  units  are  also

required  to conduct an annual hike and  overnight

camp.  A one-week unit in-camp is conducted during

the first year of deployment training, and another

week for a civil defence residential course in the

third year.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to uniforms, may I say that if we have

the  finance we would, of course, be very glad  to

issue new uniforms. But I do not think that  if  a

Corps  member  puts  on  an  old  uniform,  he  is

discouraged.  In fact, one of the qualities  which

we  want  to  promote  among our  Vigilante  Corps

members  is  thrift. Therefore, a good example  of

thrift is to put on a uniform which is not new.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to transport allowance, I have looked

into  the  matter.  I doubt  whether  I  am  in  a

position  to give transport allowance  because  if

members  of  the  Vigilante  Corps  get  transport

allowance,  I  am  sure  members  of  the  Special

Constabulary will also claim transport  allowance.

There will be no end to the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to encouraging more volunteers to

join  the  Vigilante  Corps, of  course,  we  will

always encourage that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  did  not  get  my figures  wrong.  I  was

referring to the Volunteer Vigilante Corps.  There

are   only  a  few  thousand  volunteers  in   the

Vigilante  Corps.  I  am  not  referring  to   the

National Service members. I quite agree that there

are  about  23,000 members in the Vigilante  Corps

who  are  national servicemen. But I  was  talking

about  members  of  the Vigilante  Corps  who  are

volunteers, and they number only a few thousand. I

think the Minister did not hear me right, and said

that my information was wrong. I therefore want to

clarify the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, the Minister has given a

satisfactory reply, and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1651*.

(* The  same amendment also stood in the  names  of Messrs  Teong  Eng  Siong, Sim  Boon  Woo  and  P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the spectre of the evils of drug abuse is

looming in a more and more ugly way in our  midst.

Although  we have been commended for our anti-drug

action,  we  have to do more. The  scenario  which

forms  the  background  to  our  drug  problem  in

Singapore is briefly as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Drug production on a large scale is taking

place  in  South-east Asia in countries  close  to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Singapore stands squarely on the supply route

from producer to large-scale consumer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Problems in certain surrounding countries may

well have their spill over here. For example, Hong

Kong, the Philippines and Australia are reportedly

experiencing  rapid increases in the incidence  of

drug-taking, including the so-called hard drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not be surprised if the Director of our

Central Narcotics Bureau feels that it is a matter

of time before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



our young people are hit by a similar epidemic, if

more vigorous measures are not taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come to the situation in Singapore. It can be

expected  that the Misuse of Drugs  Act  with  its

severe  penalties  will cause those  suspected  of

trafficking  in  or taking drugs to  claim  trial,

when   apprehended,  rather  than  submit  without

resistance  to such penalties as are  provided  in

the  new  law.  This will mean that a  significant

proportion  of  the  Narcotics  Officers  and  the

Assistant  Narcotics Officers will be tied  up  in

court and in allied administrative procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is not too clear as to what

categories of people take drugs. But young  people

from  well educated and affluent family background

as well as those from the lower income groups have

been  involved. What is significant is that  drop-outs  are more exposed to the temptation  to  drug

abuse.  The  circumstances are compounded  by  the

fact  that both parents and teachers do  not  have

very  clear  ideas about drugs, the conditions  of

their abuse, causes of addiction, and so on.  They

know  that  the devil is around, but  they  cannot

recognise   him  early  enough.  It  would   seem,

therefore,   that   a  concerted   and   organised

educational  programme has to be directed  towards

teachers  and parents so that they will be  better

equipped  to  combat this problem in  co-operation

with  the authorities and other relevant voluntary

organisations. This again means that  the  Central

Narcotics  Bureau, which bears the  brunt  of  the

responsibilities  for  education  in   the   anti-narcotics  field,  will have  to  have  additional

manpower of various categories. This position  may

be   further  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  drug

traffickers  are well organised,  resorting  to  a

variety of sophisticated equipment and strategy in

their  operations. I understand  that  flexibility

and  adaptability  are their particular  hallmark,

and  we,  therefore,  need more  manpower,  better

trained and well equipped to deal with them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum total of what I am trying to say, Mr

Speaker, Sir, is that the strength of the  Central

Narcotics Bureau, increased as it has been in  our

present  Estimates,  does not  go  far  enough.  I

cannot  restrain  from remarking  that  the  first

target  of  educational measures  by  the  Central

Narcotics  Bureau  should  be  directed   to   the

relevant  officials  in the Finance  Ministry,  so

that these housekeepers may understand the problem

more  ably  and thereby sympathetically  give  the

Central  Narcotics  Bureau the personnel  to  ably

deal with drug trafficking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  entirely agree with the Member for Katong

with what he has spoken about the problem of drug-taking in Singapore, and the steps which should be

taken  to  combat  this menace.  We  know  that  a

significant number of our youths are taking drugs.

In   1971,  200  people  were  arrested  for  drug

offences.  In  1972, 444 people were arrested  for

drug  offences.  This  shows  that  there  was  an

increase of more than a hundred per cent from 1971

to 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in the United States of America and

in  many  Western  countries  drug  addiction  has

pervaded all strata of society. In these countries

all traditional values have been thrown overboard.

If  we  do  not wish to see a similar  tragedy  in

Singapore,  we  must take action  now  before  the

situation  reaches the point of  no  return.  Drug

addiction among our youths brings with it a number

of  other problems. Although drug addiction can be

caused  by  poor environment, another contributing

factor  is the external influence of hippies  from

abroad.   We   must  tackle  this   problem   very

vigorously.  We  cannot allow this  phenomenon  to

continue, or the end-result will be disastrous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House last month I asked the Minister

concerned if it was possible to conduct  an  anti-drug  campaign  so that everyone in  our  society,

especially parents and teachers, would take action

against  drug-taking. Just now I heard the  Member

for Katong say that educational



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



measures  should  be  taken.  The  schools

should do something about drug-taking. I hope  the

Minister  will consider this matter.  If  for  any

reason  we  cannot conduct a nation-wide anti-drug

campaign,  I  wonder  whether  we  can  conduct  a

publicity  campaign against drugs in our  schools.

In  this  way,  at least 50,000 to 60,000  of  our

students  will appreciate the problem and  dangers

of drug-taking. We know that the majority of drug-takers   are  youths.  Therefore,  the   anti-drug

campaign  should  be  directed  against  them.  We

should  start our campaign in the schools so  that

they  will  recognise  the  ill-effects  of  drug-taking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two further questions to raise. First,

since  the  setting  up of the  Central  Narcotics

Bureau, what sort of work has been done? What  new

plans  are  afoot  for  the  elimination  of  drug

addiction? Secondly, how many people have  so  far

been  arrested for offences associated with  drug-taking?  What is the Minister going  to  do  about

these people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members of this

House know very well the problem of drug addiction

in  our schools, especially in the English stream.

I  was approached by many parents for help in this

respect.   We  have  talked  a  lot   about   drug

addiction,  how it has come into our  society  and

the  price we have got to pay for urbanisation.  I

think  it  is  high time that we sought  a  highly

positive  measure to fight this evil. As  a  large

percentage of our youths are still schooling, they

could  seek  the  help of school  teachers.  Their

parents should also encourage them to come forward

and  give  information  to the  Central  Narcotics

Bureau.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, principals and teachers are reluctant to

come  forward and give information. It is  because

when a drug-taking case is reported by any school,

the  Ministry of Education will ask the  principal

or  the teacher to submit reports after reports to

the Ministry. What is worse is that the school  is

black-marked by the Ministry, and life



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



is  made very unpleasant for the principal and the

teacher.  Sir, I would like to suggest that  every

encouragement  should be given to  principals  and

teachers  to  bring to the notice  of  the  proper

authorities of any case of drug-taking. When  they

do  so,  they  should  be highly  commended.  They

should  not  be  black-marked or their  life  made

miserable. If we encourage information,  we  would

be able to get better results in our fight against

the problem of drug abuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to suggest to the Director

of  the  Central Narcotics Bureau that when  drug-pushers  or traffickers are arrested, they  should

be  made to take the drug themselves for some time

and then to stop giving them the drug. They should

be  made to suffer. This is to show them how  they

make other people suffer. Sir, I hope the Minister

for  Health and Home Affairs and the Minister  for

Education will take note of my suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many Members

have spoken about the Central Narcotics Bureau.  I

have a few points to raise. Sir, drug addiction is

becoming  quite  prevalent in Singapore.  We  have

established the Central Narcotics Bureau to  fight

this menace. Although it has done an excellent job

so  far,  I  would  suggest  that  the  Bureau  be

expanded immediately and officers be placed at all

entry points of drug traffickers. At present,  the

small  Bureau is tied down with work and  soon  it

may  not be able to cope with the increase in  the

incidence  of drug abuse. I wonder whether  a  few

prison officers can be seconded to the Bureau  and

be  given the power to arrest drug traffickers and

addicts  because  they are in a position  to  deal

with  the  situation through information  gathered

from  drug  addicted  prisoners.  In  addition,  I

suggest  that to fight drug addiction,  we  should

set  up an effective national youth council  whose

sole  function will be to help people who are drug

addicts.   At   present,  there   are   inadequate

facilities to help drug addicts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first

deal with the points brought up by the Member  for

Katong?  May I say that talks on drug  abuse  have

been presented to parent groups and student groups

at   service   clubs,   religious   organisations,

community  centres,  tertiary  institutions,   and

schools.  Many  parents, brothers and  sisters  of

drug  abusers  have come to the Central  Narcotics

Bureau  to seek help for their loved ones who  are

drug    abusers.   Those   concerned   have   been

effectively   counselled.  The   Singapore   Anti-Narcotics  Association has been gearing itself  to

provide  a  counselling and assistance service  to

drug  abusers  and to educate the  public  on  the

dangers  of  drug  abuse. The Association  is  now

considering  organising a counselling  course  for

volunteers  comprising members of the public.  The

Association welcomes all the help it can get  from

the rest of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong suggested that the Central

Narcotics  Bureau  should have more  officers.  Of

course,  I  welcome  that suggestion.  However,  I

would  say that, in the nature of things, we  have

to  start  from a small beginning and we  hope  to

enlarge the Bureau eventually. The point is not so

much having so many posts but having the bodies to

fill  the posts. At the moment, many of the  posts

have  been filled by way of secondments  from  the

Police Force and the Customs. We will try our very

best  to get the Police and the Customs to  second

more men to the Bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang warns to know how much

has  been  achieved since the setting  up  of  the

Central  Narcotics  Bureau. May  I  say  that  the

Bureau  was  set up in mid-November 1971  to  deal

with  drug trafficking and drug abuse? In the year

1972,  the  Enforcement  Section  of  the  Central

Narcotics  Bureau carried out an  average  of  264

raids   each   month.   It   also   carried    out

investigations  into  complaints  and  information

given  by the public, which amounted to an average

of  30  complaints  monthly. In co-operation  with

overseas  enforcement agencies,  the  Bureau  also

undertakes investigations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



into   international  drug  trafficking.   Several

successes have been obtained in this area of work.

In  the  year  1972,  the  Bureau  effected  2,634

arrests.  These  include  111  persons  who   were

convicted for major drug offences. These were  the

traffickers, distributors, pedlars of the  various

dangerous drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publicity section of the Bureau provided

speakers  for talks on no less than 36  occasions.

The  talks were presented to school teachers, army

personnel,  doctors, nurses, University  students,

community   centres,  service   clubs,   religious

organisations   and  schools.  It  also   provided

exhibits for various organisations. It is  now  in

the    process   of   preparing   pamphlets    for

distribution. These pamphlets will only deal  with

drug abuse locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau is also acting in an advisory capacity

to the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, which

is  a  voluntary  organisation geared  to  provide

counselling and assistance services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for

Sembawang  that we should organise a  campaign  to

discourage  drug  abuse,  may  I  say  that   many

organisations   have  organised  exhibitions   and

campaigns   against   drug  abuse.   The   Central

Narcotics  Bureau has provided exhibits and  acted

in  an  advisory  capacity to these organisations.

The  Bureau  intends to organise a joint  campaign

with the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association this

year.   However,   the  Bureau  feels   that   the

prevention of drug abuse should be done on a long-term  basis  by developing attitudes against  drug

abuse. Campaigns by themselves have limited  uses.

Therefore,  I  agree with the suggestion  that  we

should try to have more anti-drug education in the

schools.  I  believe  this will  be  part  of  the

curriculum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point made by the Member for Changi with

regard  to principals and teachers being reluctant

to  report  cases  of drug abuse  in  the  schools

because  it  would mean involving themselves  with

much  paper  work with the Ministry of  Education,

and the school being black-marked, if this is true

I sympathise with them. I assure the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



Member that I would use my good offices to get the

assurance  of  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for

Education, that such things do not happen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson has

suggested  expanding the Central Narcotics  Bureau

by getting the secondment of prison officers. I do

not think we need prison officers, although we may

need more police officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is my

suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy, please allow

the Minister to finish his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the other point brought

up  by  the  Member for Anson is  that  there  are

insufficient facilities to treat drug  addicts.  I

am  afraid I cannot agree with him on this.  If  I

may  be  permitted,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  say

something  about the various facilities  that  are

available  for  the treatment of  drug  addiction.

Drug  abusers who need medical attention  will  be

treated  within  the  existing  framework  of  our

medical services but at different levels. They are

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The outpatient and school clinics will accept

persons  who  may  be brought in directly  by  the

Police or other persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The drug-dependence clinic at Outram Road

General  Hospital is a referral  centre  and  will

deal   with  cases  which  need  more  specialised

attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Alexandra Hospital is in the process of

establishing  a  ward  for  addicts  who   require

hospital care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Opium Treatment Centre at St. John's

Island  caters for addicts of all types of  drugs.

This   is   an  isolation  centre  which  provides

diversional  activities such as carpentry,  rattan

work,  tailoring, horticulture, fish-rearing,  and

so  on.  Plans are afoot to reorganise and enlarge

the Opium Treatment Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for

Changi that when we arrest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



a  drug  trafficker, we should make him  take  the

drug;  in other words, to give a dose of  his  own

medicine,  we will not do such a thing because  to

do so would mean adding another drug addict to our

pool of drug addicts at the moment. This will,  in

fact,  enlarge the problem. What we have done  was

to  pass  the  Misuse of Drugs Act in  this  House

recently,  which  provides  very  heavy  mandatory

penalties, including the rotan. I think that would

be sufficient "medicine" for the drug traffickers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They should be shot!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggested

secondment of prison officers because they can get

information  from  drug  traffickers  who  are  in

prison.  The  prison officers can co-operate  with

the   Bureau   officers  and   arrest   the   drug

traffickers. I do not say that all of them  should

be  prison officers, but I feel that at least  two

or three prison officers should be seconded to the

Bureau to track down the drug traffickers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

agree  with  the Member for Anson that  we  should

second  prison  officers to the Central  Narcotics

Bureau. I think their job is quite different.  The

job is for the Customs or Police officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, information on drug trafficking is a

different matter, and we do not need secondment of

prison   officers  to  the  Bureau  just  to   get

information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I withdraw

my amendment, I just want to make a small point of

clarification.  Perhaps  the  Minister  was  being

satirical when he thought that in my asking for an

increase  in strength I meant just the  number  of

posts. No, I meant the number of bodies, and  from

the tenor of his answer, I am sure he himself will

see  to it that this is achieved. I can assure him

of my support



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



even for any supplementary estimates that  he

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1301 (contd.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1701*.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names  of Messrs  P. Govindaswamy and Tuan Haji Mohd.  Ariff Bin Suradi.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of citizenship is still a

matter  of serious importance to many people,  and

has  become  a problem to them. Some  people  have

applied  for more than three times, and yet  their

applications have been turned down.  Thus  it  has

caused  great inconvenience and disappointment  to

them.  At  a time when we were faced with economic

difficulties, it was quite excusable  to  restrict

the granting of citizenship to applicants. But now

that we have greatly improved our economy, we  can

afford  to relax our restrictions and regulations.

In my "Meet the People" session every week, I used

to receive complaints about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



applications  for citizenship having  been  turned

down. Some complained that they have waited two or

three  years  without any result. I give  my  full

sympathy to all these cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time when our economy is highly developed

and  we are faced with a shortage of labour, I  do

not  see  any valid reason to refuse to relax  our

regulations  on the granting of citizenship.  Even

with  all the attendant problems that go with  it,

for   instance,  housing,  education,  social  and

medical  care, I do not think these are sufficient

reasons  to  justify the refusal  of  citizenship.

Because  these  problems, if they  can  be  called

problems  at all, are ever present in  our  social

life;  they do not count very much in the granting

of citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the applicants for citizenship have

stayed  in Singapore for quite some time. Most  of

them have children and even grand-children who are

enjoying the rights of citizenship, medical  care,

education  and other things. So giving citizenship

to  these  applicants would not cost us  any  more

economic loss or burden, because all of them  have

their  own proper jobs with good income. They  are

able to provide for their households.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question of housing, even if we do not

grant citizenship to them, we are still faced with

this  social  problem. In the past years  we  have

been building at the rate of 20,000 units of flats

per  year. Now we intend to increase the  rate  to

30,000  units a year, and there are 60,000  people

on  the  waiting  list. So  if  this  new  lot  of

citizens  is  added  on to the  waiting  list  for

Housing  Board  flats,  it would  not  affect  the

priority at all because the Board has a policy  of

first  come first served. So even if they were  to

wait  for  their turn, they would not  impose  any

more difficulty on us in respect of housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all these matters should not be an excuse for

refusing  to give citizenship to these applicants.

On   behalf   of  the  applicants  who   are   not

successful, I make an appeal for the relaxation of

the   restrictions  imposed  on  these  applicants

because many of them have relatives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



who are citizens. For instance, we all  know

that  the spouse of an applicant, whether  husband

or wife, is usually a citizen and the children are

citizens. The Minister can look up the Citizenship

Regulations. Though these applicants  may  not  be

successful  so  far  in  their  applications   for

citizenship, however, their husbands or wives,  or

parents,  or  children, may be citizens.  I  would

therefore  appeal  to the Minister  to  relax  the

restrictions   in  respect  of  applications   for

citizenship on these grounds in order to alleviate

any difficulty on their part.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that

citizenship  is  not a right but a privilege,  and

the  law  changes from time to time, depending  on

the  existing situation of the country.  I  wonder

what  are  the conditions at the moment  regarding

the  granting of citizenship. There  are  so  many

stateless  persons in Singapore who are  "floating

characters",  i.e, they are neither  citizens  nor

are  they  ever  likely to become citizens.  These

poor persons, because of their status, cannot  get

jobs.  They  can neither apply for a flat  nor  go

across  the causeway to visit their relatives  and

friends.   Why  cannot  we  issue  them   with   a

certificate of identity so that they can at  least

go across the causeway in case of emergency!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when both the

Members  for Sembawang and Anson talk  of  persons

who  are now permanent residents but unable to get

citizenship,  may  I say that  most  of  them  are

responsible for their own plight. They could  have

acquired  Singapore citizenship years ago  without

any  difficulty, because in those days  conditions

for  the granting of citizenship were much easier.

But  they  would  rather keep their  options  open

then,  and  as  such have elected  to  take  their

chances. If things in Singapore are not as good as

they  are  today,  I am sure there  will  be  less

demand for Singapore citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the citizenship policy of the

Government  is concerned, it is always kept  under

constant review. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



a  matter  of  policy, many of the applicants  are

kept  under consideration so that, when conditions

change or when circumstances make it possible  for

the  Government  to allow more  people  to  become

citizens,   they  may  be  favourably  considered.

Therefore,  delay  in finalising the  applications

means  a  source of hope. However, the  Member  is

assured  that there is no delay. Once a  decision,

on  an  application is made, action  is  taken  to

notify the applicant of the result immediately  it

is known.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Sembawang and Anson said that

circumstances  have  changed. Maybe  circumstances

with  regard to employment and so on have changed,

but one big problem at the moment is housing. That

has  not  changed. The Member for  Sembawang  said

that there is a waiting list of 60,000. The Member

for  Anson will know much more because he  is  the

Chairman of the Allocations Committee. If we  were

to  grant  citizenship to more people,  what  will

happen?  The  present waiting list of 60,000  will

come  up  to  80,000 or even more.  But  then  the

Member for Sembawang - it was quite clever of  him

to  put  it this way -said that the priority  will

not change because it is based on first come first

served.  He  has  forgotten  one  crucial   point,

because   sometime  ago  I  did  announce   in   a

Ministerial  Statement in this  Chamber  that  the

allocation  for  housing as from the  1st  August,

1973,  will  no  longer be on a first  come  first

served  basis, but it will be on a priority  basis

based  on  the concept of a two-child  family.  In

other  words,  those applicants with two  children

will  have a higher priority after the 1st August,

1973.  That nullifies the point made by the Member

for  Sembawang. I hope the Chairman of the Housing

Allocations Committee will also bear that in mind.

The  point is that Members may not be aware of the

fact  that when this happens, then some  of  their

voters who are citizens may have a lower priority.

So  I  would  like  them to think  very  carefully

before they advance these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



propositions because they might get themselves  in

hot   water   when   they   go   back   to   their

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the point brought up by the Member for

Anson that some non-citizens cannot get work, I do

not  think  that is true, because they can  always

get a work permit now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his point that a blue identity card

holder,  who  is a permanent resident,  should  be

considered for a certificate of identity so as  to

enable  him to travel across the causeway,  may  I

tell  him  this: if that person produces  evidence

that he is a stateless person and also that he  is

in  urgent need to travel across the causeway,  he

will be granted a certificate of identity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, some of

the  points given by the Minister in his reply are

quite  reasonable, but others are  not  quite  so.

Anyway,  one  good point he has made is  that  his

department is constantly reviewing the  matter  of

citizenship  and  that  there  is  hope  that  the

applications  may  be favourably  considered.  But

when he brought up other matters, such as housing,

these  are not reasonable excuses because even  if

you  do not grant citizenship to these applicants,

the  citizens  who are already  on  the  list  for

housing units will still have to wait for  a  long

time.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that applicants with

smaller  families will be given  priority.  So  in

this   case,  there  is  no  priority  for   local

citizens.  This  is  not a good  practice  because

after the applicants with small families have been

given   housing  units,  they  can  produce   more

children,  and so expand their families.  This  is

not  a  very good method to adopt. Their  families

will  definitely  become  bigger  because  at  the

moment  they practise family planning in order  to

get priority in the allocation of a flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $72,981,970 for Head 1301 ordered to

stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,276,560 for Head 1301 ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1302 --



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1302 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what measures has the Minister taken to

prevent   illegal  immigrants  from  coming   into

Singapore? Since there are so many points of  easy

entry   into   Singapore,  are  there   sufficient

precautions  to  stop  this  traffic  of   illegal

immigrants?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since we have numerous requests from people

to  have their stay in Singapore extended for more

than  six months, can we not charge a nominal  fee

for endorsing the extension? This privilege should

also be given to those people who have gone abroad

with  good  reasons. This will  be  an  additional

source of revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, may I ask what steps are being

taken   in   respect   of  Malaysians   who   have

overstayed? It seems that they can enter Singapore

quite  easily  and  stay on  indefinitely  without

being  found  out. I suggest that we  introduce  a

card-system  similar to the  one  adopted  by  the

authorities across the causeway. At present, I  am

sure   there   are  many  persons  who   are   now

overstaying  here in Singapore, and this  makes  a

mockery of the passports issued to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this problem

of  illegal  immigration is largely  presented  by

illegal  immigrants  entering  Singapore  by  sea.

Illegal immigrants enter Singapore in small craft,

such  as  motorised  boats,  sampans,  or  sailing

boats.  It is believed that the majority  of  them

are  brought  in  by  organised  syndicates  which

handle  the illegal trafficking of people  between

Singapore    and   the   neighbouring   countries.

Interrogation  of arrested illegal immigrants  and

their   traffickers  has  revealed   the   various

purposes of illegal entry, chief of which is  that

the  majority  of them have come to  Singapore  to

seek employment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the distance involved is short and the

Singapore coastline is accessible to small  craft,

control  of  illegal entry is  a  difficult  task.

Within  the resources available, concerted  action

has  been,  and is being, taken by the Police  and

Immigration Department against illegal  entry  and

stay. The Marine Police patrolling the territorial

waters  of Singapore are on the lookout for  small

vessels which sneak in illegally. Members  of  the

Police  Force,  on beat or other duty,  carry  out

frequent  checks  to detect those  who  manage  to

enter  illegally. Surprise checks  and  raids  are

carried  out  by  the  Immigration  Department  on

information  received.  In  addition,   Divisional

Police  mount  occasional surprise checks  on  the

various worksites all over the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such concerted action throughout each year has

resulted   in   arrests  of  over  1,500   illegal

immigrants   last  year.  It  is,  however,   Snot

possible   to   say  exactly  how   many   illegal

immigrants enter Singapore every year, or how many

remain here illegally. When illegal immigrants are

arrested,  they  are  detained,  prosecuted,  and,

wherever   possible,  removed  out  of  Singapore.

Traffickers  of  illegal immigrants  are  severely

dealt  with.  The courts are asked to  pass  heavy

sentences  on  them, and to order the confiscation

of their boats and equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal immigrants manage to enter Singapore by

landing  at  unauthorised  landing  spots.  It  is

recognised that, in spite of the efforts  so  far,

many   illegal  immigrants  do  manage  to   enter

Singapore easily and remain undetected until  much

later. As an effort to stop or greatly reduce  the

inflow  of  illegal  persons  by  sea,  a  special

intelligence  unit  is  being  set   up   in   the

Immigration Department. The function of this  unit

is  to  penetrate  into the organised  syndicates,

ambush  traffickers or craft at the landing spots,

and  expose  the  local harbourers.  It  is  hoped

therefore   that  the  efforts  of  this   special

intelligence unit will result in better control of

illegal immigration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the point made by the Member for Anson about Malaysians



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



overstaying, we are considering some measure of

exit control, but that will take some time to

implement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to charging fees for extension of

visas, that is a matter which I suppose my

colleague, the Minister for Finance, will consider

when he wants to increase the revenue.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the

explanation by the Minister, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,137,260 for Head 1302 ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,000,000 for Head 1302 ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1303 --



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how many warders and officers have resigned

from  the  Prisons Department? I think the  number

must  be  enough to create staffing problems  that

can  be  described  as critical.  May  I  ask  the

Minister  concerned, why has this  situation  been

allowed  to deteriorate to such an extent?  Is  it

because  of  the  working  conditions  that   have

aggravated  these resignations?  The  warders  and

officers,  who are supposed to guard some  of  our

most  dangerous  criminals,  are  not  even  armed

properly.   As  such,  some  criminals   who   are

desperate  might think of beating  up  warders  in

their  attempt to get away. Probably this  may  be

the  reason  why  there are so many  resignaations

among our warders. To make matters worse, the  pay

is  too  small  and  is not in  keeping  with  the

responsibilities attached to the job. I understand

the Prisons Department is going to be reorganised.

If  such is the case, I suggest that a revision of

pay  for the Prisons staff be considered so as  to

promote better morale among them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not

correct to say that Prison officers are resigning

because they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



not provided with fire-arms. In fact, every prison

is  equipped with sufficient modem weapons to cope

with  any  situation. The armaments are backed  by

arrangements to rush reinforcements to any part of

the prison within two minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in furtherance of our modern concept of

rehabilitation through inculcation of good  social

values  and  attitudes in the prisoners  and  thus

stimulate  within  them  the  desire  to   reform,

officers  performing duties within the prison  are

not  provided  with fire-arms. To do otherwise  is

not    conducive    to    good    officer/prisoner

relationship,   which   is   the   foundation   of

rehabilitation.  However,  officers  on  custodial

duties,  such as guards posted on watch-towers  or

escorting prisoners to hospitals or the courts are

fully armed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of Prison officers of warder rank

resigned  perhaps  because of working  conditions,

especially   in  maximum  security   prison.   The

unfavourable  conditions  are  aggravated   by   a

consistently high rate of turnover and  a  serious

shortage  of  manpower over the last  five  years.

Against   our   present  background  of   enormous

economic expansion and industrial activities,  and

consequently  abundant  employment  opportunities,

the  salaries  offered to the Prison officers  are

perhaps  not  sufficient  enough  to  attract   an

adequate  inflow of recruits. In this regard,  the

service  conditions and salary structures will  be

examined   by   the  recently  appointed   Prisons

Reorganisation Committee, headed by the  Permanent

Secretary (Home Affairs), as part of the terms  of

reference of the Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of $266,700 is for the

development of the Prison Industries. I think this

provision is timely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



because  this  will enable the prison  inmates  to

learn a trade so that they can be independent  and

make  a  living when they are discharged from  the

prison, and will not fall into evil ways again.  I

would  like  to  ask the Minister  two  questions.

Firstly,  what sort of courses are being conducted

in  the Prison Industries and how many instructors

are  there?  Secondly, what kind of  products  are

being  produced for the market and  what  are  the

proceeds from the Prison Industries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to

the queries from the Member for Sembawang, I would

say  that  industries within the prison have  been

established with the following objects in mind:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) helping the prisoners to rehabilitate whilst

under detention;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) training the prisoners to make good use of

their  individual talent by learning a  particular

industrial trade which they will be able to pursue

after  their release from prison, so as to  become

useful citizens of the Republic;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) making valuable contribution to the national

output.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prison Industries commenced with only six

workshops.  Today, there are 19 workshops  in  the

various   penal  institutions  catering  for   the

following trades:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) laundry;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) woodwork machine shop;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) cane workshop;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) tailor workshop;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) printing and book-binding workshop;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) timber seasoning kiln;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) footwear, leather, and upholstery workshop;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) metal workshop;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) concrete and cement workshop;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) miscellaneous light industries, which

includes components of transistors, and so on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facilities acquired over the years have

enabled  us  to provide every convicted  prisoner,

who  is  required to labour, with  employment.  In

spite of the unavoidable limitations pertaining to

operating  within the prison complex, the  revenue

derived  and  savings accrued to  Government  have

been  consistently increasing year after year.  In 1959,  the revenue from the Prison Industries  was

$335,065.52.    In   1972,   the    revenue    was

$1,104,527.31. The figures I have  quoted  do  not

include revenue derived from the sale of bread  to

the  Ministry  of Defence and the  social  welfare

homes,  which is approximately $30,000 per  month.

Besides  providing a service to  other  Government

departments, the finished products of  the  Prison

Industries are exhibited for sale to the public at

the  following  showrooms: (a) Prison  Industries,

Changi; (b) the Council of Social Services, Penang

Lane.  I hope the Member for Sembawang will pay  a

visit to these two centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the terms of reference of the recently

appointed Prisons Reorganisation Committee  is  to

look  into  the  possibility of  expanding  Prison

Industries as an important rehabilitative  process

for  prisoners.  The problem of expansion  is  the

shortage of space in our existing prisons. If  the

Member  for Sembawang is interested, and if  other

Members  of Parliament are interested too,  I  can

organise a tour of the workshops in Changi Prison,

followed  by  lunch  pre-assembly  and  pared  and

cooked by our prisoners.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am satisfied with the Minister's reply that

the  prisoners are given training in  the  various

trades as a rehabilitative process in the prisons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether the inmates engaged

in   these   various  industries  are  given   any

allowance  for their work. What about their  food?

Is  it  satisfactory? Has there been any complaint

with  regard to the food, such as the food  served

is  not good or that they have not enough to  eat?

If  the Minister would like to organise a tour for

Members of Parliament, he should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



not  inform the Prison authorities in advance,  so

that they will not prepare the food beforehand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as

food is concerned, there has been no complaints at

all.  Perhaps we will organise the tour and invite

the Member for Sembawang to taste the food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to allowances we are now devising a

scheme  whereby if they work hard  in  the  Prison

Industries, they will be given a bonus.  In  fact,

the  Prisons Reorganisation Committee  is  looking

into  the  possibility  of devising  a  bonus  and

savings  scheme whereby prisoners  who  work  hard

would  be  given a certain payment as bonus.  This

money  will be kept for them by welfare  officers,

so  that they can help their families outside.  In

my "Meet the People" sessions, I find that quite a

number  of  the families of prisoners do  come  up

with stories of hardship and of not being able  to

make  ends meet. The proposal to expand the Prison

Industries,  together with the bonus  and  savings

scheme, should to a certain extent alleviate  such

hardship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

reply  given by the Minister is very satisfactory.

It  shows that his department is looking after the

welfare  of the prisoners. I beg leave to withdraw

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Finance is a very important

Ministry.  It  is responsible for formulating  the

Government's  financial policy. In  the  last  few

years,  the Ministry of Finance has done  a  great

deal towards the development of our industries and

of  our  external trade. As a result  we  are  now

enjoying  the  fruits of economic  prosperity.  We

have  achieved a very high GNP growth rate  of  13

per  cent  last year, and our average  per  capita

income  is  increasing year by year. In 1971,  our

per  capita income was $3,321 and in 1972  it  was

$3,687.  This  is indeed a gratifying achievement.

However,   the   constant   upheavals    in    the

international  monetary system have  affected  our

economy.  For  example, there is now  inflationary

tendencies in our country, resulting in  a  rising

level  of  prices. This makes life more  and  more

difficult  for  our  people.  May  I  quote   some

examples?  The price of rice used to be  35  cents

per  kati.  Now, it is 55 cents per kati.  Chinese

cabbage used to sell at 20 cents per kati, but  it

is  now 60 to 80 cents per kati. Sugar, flour, and

many   other   commodities  have  also   shown   a

tremendous increase in price. There is  a  general

increase in price levels, and this indeed  worries

everybody. Has the Ministry of Finance  any  plans

to counter this trend? Has the Ministry of Finance

carried  out the necessary investigations to  find

out  the  reason for these rising prices? Are  the

price  increases justifiable? The Ministry  should

take  immediate steps to stop prices  from  rising

any  further  in order to stabilise  the  cost  of

living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I would like to raise is the

question of trade deficits. Our trade deficit  has

been  on the increase over the last few years.  In

1971, the deficit was $3,200 million. In 1972,  it

was $3,400 million. Although the Minister has told

us that this trade deficit will be offset by other

invisible sources



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



of income, such as services, in the long run, this

situation will be abnormal. Of course, this  trade

deficit is not like cancer. It can be compared  to

gastric  trouble  in  the stomach  which  gives  a

person  frequent pain. We must, therefore, try  to

do  our  best  to  remedy the situation.  In  this

respect,  I  would like to ask the  Minister  what

effective  measures are there to reduce our  trade

deficit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that a few years ago we set up INTRACO, a

joint  venture  between  the  Government  and  the

private  sector. Its main object is to  assist  in

the development of trade with Communist countries.

The  increase  in  trade with Communist  countries

will  be  to our mutual benefit. I would  like  to

know  what has been done to promote external trade

since  the establishment of INTRACO. What progress

has  been achieved? What is the increase in  trade

before and after the setting up of INTRACO?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to raise is the

salary  increases for Divisions  II,  III  and  IV

Government  officers.  I asked  the  Minister  for

Finance   this  question  on  16th   of   February

[Hansard, Vol. 32, col. 401], and he told me  that

he   would   consider   the  recommendations   and

guidelines of the National Wages Council, and that

the  Ministry  had  been doing a restructuring  of

salary  scales for these grades of officers.  This

shows that this matter is receiving attention.  Of

course,  this  is  good news  to  these  officers.

However, I would like to ask the Minister  whether

he  could  give  the House more  specific  details

regarding  the salary increases for Divisions  II,

III and IV officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is on the decrease of capital

investment  in the shipbuilding industry.  In  his

Budget  statement the Minister revealed  that  the

investments   in  shipbuilding  and  shiprepairing

dropped  from  $142.2 million  in  1971  to  $66.9

million  last  year. This is quite  a  substantial

reduction.  What is the reason for this reduction?

Is  it because of the non-availability of suitable

sites  for shipbuilding? I hope the Minister  will

carry out the necessary investigations and take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



remedial measures so that our country will  become

the  centre for shipbuilding and shiprepairing  in

Southeast Asia.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when can the

people,  who  are involved in the two  major  chit

fund   companies,  expect  settlement   of   their

investments?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another point. There is a great

anomaly  in  the  clerical service.  The  clerical

assistants  are  not given the  same  pay  as  the

clerical  officers. Yet they do the same work.  To

add insult to injury, too many clerical assistants

are doing the work with no prospects of promotion.

Many  of  them do not even know when they will  be

promoted  to  clerical officers. Can something  be

done about the matter?



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when will the National Wages Council

officially  announce its recommendations?  It  has

been  a  long time since they sat, and the  public

and  private sectors are keen to know the  outcome

of its discussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard about the rise in the salaries

of  the top civil servants. Some of them have also

been  given the opportunity to enjoy a maximum  of

four  increments under the Merit Increment Scheme.

This  is well and good, and I must say that it  is

timely for we must try to retain the brains to run

the  country. But, at the same time,  let  us  not

forget  the middle and lower income groups in  the

civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, where will these top

civil  servants be without the help of  the  lower

grades  of civil servants? Surely the lower grades

of  civil  servants are as essential to the  civil

service. As such, they too deserve an equal number

of  increments. After all, the actual work is done

by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also point out the plight of the middle and

lower grades of workers in the Government service?

The cost of living is rising continuously, not  by

leaps and bounds but enough to cause a pinch  into

the workers' earnings. To a certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



extent,  these are the workers who arc  neglected,

and  they  find it extremely difficult to  stretch

the dollar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the reduction of leave scheme,

Government  servants are compensated  financially.

But in the case of some statutory boards, although

the  officers  are  considered  to  be  Government

servants,  they  are not accorded the  same  leave

scheme.  A compensation, similar to that  accorded

to  Government servants, should be paid  to  those

officers in the statutory boards for loss of leave

during the past years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increase in CPF contribution from 10 per

cent  to 12 per cent in 1972 has resulted in lower

take-home pay. This greatly affects the middle and

lower   grades  of  officers.  Their  incomes   as

compared  to  the private sector are  meagre,  and

they  suffer more because o the increased cost  of

living. When the CPF contribution is increased  to

15 per cent, they will suffer even more. Is it not

time that some form of increase in salary be given

to  these  grades  of workers to  alleviate  their

sufferings?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to mention the

rise in the cost of living in Singapore. Recently,

the  prices  of many consumer goods  and  services

have  gone  up greatly. The excuse given  by  most

manufacturers is that they have not increased  the

price  of  their  products  for  many  years  and,

therefore, it is justifiable to raise their prices

by  a  nominal sum. It appears that most of  these

proposals  are  coming  one  after  another.  Some

retailers   are  only  waiting  for  such   slight

increases in the cost of manufactured products  so

that  they  could extort a higher price  from  the

poor  consumers.  I would like to  call  upon  the

Minister to view this grave situation with  utmost

concern  before it gets worse. The  Government  in

the  past  has been successful in getting  rid  of

pirate taxis, banning cigarette advertisements and

has  also  been  successful  with  many  important

national campaigns. Therefore, I have little doubt

that a remedy will be found for this major problem

which affects the lives of the majority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



of  our  people. Nowadays, the ordinary  housewife

finds  that  her marketing budget  dries  up  very

fast.  I  would suggest that the Government  takes

control  of  all  essential  foodstuffs  and,   if

possible,  to open and to manage as many effective

co-operative  centres  as  possible.   These   co-operative centres could deal with the needs of the

public  so that there would be no unfair means  of

profiteering  by any Tom, Dick and Harry.  At  the

moment,  it  appears that most of the  people  are

under  the  clutches  of the  shopkeepers  because

their  attitude  is  "take it or  leave  it".  The

Minister    should   also   consider   introducing

controlled prices for foodstuffs in certain places

where   the  majority  of  the  people  do   their

shopping.  And publicity on the actual  prices  of

essential foodstuffs should be communicated to the

people daily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago, the Member for Telok Blangah

raised  the  question of the payment of  the  13th

month  allowance  to  civil servants  who  retired

before  the end of the year, to which the Minister

gave  a  negative  answer.  The  Member  had  also

referred to cases of new recruits who are entitled

to  receive  the allowance even though  they  have

served  for only a few months. The civil  servants

who  retired before December had put in many years

of  loyal  and dedicated service and yet they  are

not   privileged   to  receive  the   13th   month

allowance,   just  because  they  retired   before

December.  Sir, I wonder whether the Minister  can

reconsider the matter, because I feel that a civil

servant  should be given a good send-off  when  he

retires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point is that pensioners have all

along been drawing pensions computed on their  old

basic salaries. I am not speaking for myself. With

the  consolidation of salaries a few years ago and

also in view of the rising cost of living, can the

Minister  look  into the matter and  do  something

concrete to revise the pension rates?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister

whether  he has any intention of transferring  all

civil servants, who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



at  present under the pension scheme, to  the  CPF

scheme?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in our efforts to promote the use of

locally-made   products  through   the   Progress,

Quality   and   Reliability  campaign,   we   have

forgotten   one   aspect.   Foreign   manufactured

articles  are allowed to compete with locally-made

products at prices where the difference is  small.

Surely  some  form  of tariff can  be  imposed  on

foreign products so that they can be priced out of

the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, is that the income tax forms

sent  out  in  January to taxpayers are  literally

causing  a headache. The print of the text  is  so

small  that  in  some columns one cannot  see  the

instructions     clearly.     Furthermore,     the

instructions  seem  to be too complicated  for  an

ordinary worker to fill in the particulars. Can it

be  modified  in such a way that fewer particulars

are only necessary, because taxpayers seem to fill

in the form wrongly? I myself find it difficult to

fill in the form.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I raise a question relating  to

the  exemption of income tax for associations  and

societies?  In  Singapore, there are  about  2,000

organisations registered under the Societies  Act.

These societies are useful for the promotion of  a

closely-knit society and they are financed by  the

subscriptions  from members. Most of  the  office-bearers  are  voluntary  workers.  Some  of  these

societies  may  employ full-time staff  and  their

salaries are paid from the subscriptions collected

from  members. Occasionally these societies  carry

out  fund-raising activities for the  construction

of  new  premises,  for  the  establishment  of  a

scholarship   fund,  or  for  sports   and   other

recreational activities. Sometimes fund-raising is

also  carried  out for the purpose  of  organising

study   missions  and  friendly  visits  to  other

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these funds which are collected by the

societies  after  making a great  effort  are  not

exempted from income tax, unless more than half of

the  amount are from members' subscriptions.  Sir,

what I do not understand is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



this.  Why  cannot  the  Government  exempt  these

societies  from  paying income  tax?  The  office-bearers of these societies voluntarily play  their

part  in  running  the affairs of  the  societies.

After great painstaking efforts, they find that  a

great  chunk  of  their  collection  goes  to  the

Government coffers. They are rather discouraged. I

think  the societies which contribute towards  the

development of our country should be exempted from

paying  income tax. If we do not grant  exemption,

then  the  desire  to serve our  country  will  be

dampened. Therefore, from the long-term  point  of

view, this is undesirable. Sir, if these societies

can  be exempted from paying income tax, they will

have  more  funds for certain projects  which  are

beneficial to the society as a whole. For example,

they  will  have more money for scholarship  funds

and   for  the  promotion  of  sports  and   other

recreational  activities. In this  way,  they  can

help  promote  the development of our  society.  I

sincerely  hope  the  Minister  for  Finance  will

consider   favourably  the  question  of  granting

exemption of income tax to these societies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the questions which have been  asked

by  Members cover a very wide field. Some of  them

perhaps are more appropriate to other Heads,  e.g.

Inland  Revenue, in respect of income tax.  But  I

hope  that I can deal with all their queries under

this particular Head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may take the first question raised by the

Members  for  Sembawang and Anson, I would  assure

them  that  in  regard  to the  rising  prices  of

foodstuffs  and  commodities, the  Government  has

always  been  very conscious of  their  effect  on

costs   of  living,  and  has  therefore   devoted

considerable  time and effort to try and  minimise

the price increases of these commodities. However,

it  is not always possible to do very much because

of  the  nature of our economy. Being an  entirely

open  economy, Singapore is heavily  dependent  on

imports  for  almost  all of its  requirements  of

foodstuffs  and  essential commodities.  In  1972,

imports of foodstuffs totalled $1.2



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



billion.  Of these imports, $570 million  was  re-exported.  But  the  balance, approximately  worth

$630  million, was retained for local consumption.

The  prices  which are charged for  these  imports

must,  of  course, reflect the conditions  of  the

countries  from  which  these  imports  come.  Our

locally-produced livestock, vegetables and  fruits

totalled only $160 million. We process, of course,

some  commodities  such  as  sugar,  wheat  flour,

condensed  milk, and so on. But the raw  materials

which  are produced abroad are imported, and  they

make  up  more  than  70 per  cent  of  the  cost.

Therefore, there is not much we can do as  far  as

this 70 per cent is concerned.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As inflation is rampant in the countries from

which  we  buy our requirements, we  can  do  very

little to prevent price increases. However, we can

try to moderate some of these price increases. For

example,  in  the  case  of sugar,  current  world

prices  of raw sugar are about 100 per cent higher

than  they were a year ago. The price of sugar  in

Singapore has increased by only 16 per cent.  This

was   possible  because  the  Sugar  Industry   of

Singapore,  which produces all the sugar  consumed

locally,  had  the foresight to secure,  over  the

next  five years, supplies of raw sugar on a long-term  contract basis at prices lower than  current

world prices. In the same way, in Australia, which

is  the  cheapest  source of  wheat,  wheat  grain

prices  increased  by  nearly  50  per  cent.  The

Government   has  allowed  the  two  flour   mills

increases of only 25 per cent. In the case of rice

too,  because of our stockpile requirements  which

we   impose  upon  rice  importers,  consumers  in

Singapore benefit from the imports which were made

at  lower than current world prices. A very  sharp

rise  in  the  price  of  rice  in  Singapore  has

therefore been avoided. I think the figure  of  50

cents  mentioned  by the Member for  Sembawang  is

very  reasonable  in comparison  with  the  prices

charged in other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



countries, where there is even a physical shortage

of  rice  at  those  prices. The  Government  will

continue  to be alert to any possibility of  price

increases in other essential commodities. However,

it  must  be recognised that because of the  great

dependence  on imports price increases  cannot  be

avoided.  A  close watch on wholesale  and  retail

prices to prevent any undue profiteering, hoarding

or manipulation, will be maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may take the second question of the Member

for  Sembawang. He spoke of our very  great  trade

deficit  and asked what action was being taken  to

reduce   such  great  deficits.  In  past   Budget

statements  I  think  I mentioned  the  fact  that

deficits  in  our trade, while very serious,  have

been   covered  by  our  invisible  earnings  from

tourism,  by  capital inflow, and so on,  so  that

there is really no need for much concern. Some  of

the  trade  deficit is also due to the importation

of  capital  equipment and  goods  which  will  in

future produce a greater possibility for export of

goods.  Therefore,  to that  extent,  the  figures

would  be  self-balancing.  I  thank  the  Member,

however,  for his concern for what he  called  the

"ulcer in our economic bodies".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as his question on INTRACO is concerned,

the  intention was that the setting up of  INTRACO

would  help  in  the  export of our  manufactures.

While the primary objects have been achieved, they

are  now exporting to 40 countries, including  the

United States, Australia, the EEC countries, ASEAN

countries,  and  some  socialist  countries.   The

increase in our trade with the socialist countries

has not been all that is desired. However, exports

over the last two years have accounted for some 65

per  cent of the company's total turnover. I think

greater  efforts will have to be  made  in  export

promotion  and, while INTRACO will be one  vehicle

for  such  export promotion, it will be  necessary

over   the   next  few  years  to  develop   other

institutions.  The Export Promotion Centre,  which

has  been  set  up  in the Trade  Division  of  my

Ministry, will be responsible for further progress



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



in  the drive for more exports  to  various

countries, including the Communist countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang then turned to the

question  of what he called the sharp  decline  in

investments in the ship-building industry in 1972.

My  Budget  statement did not, however,  refer  so

much  to  the  decline in investments  as  to  the

decline   in  investment  commitments,  which   is

something  different. If he will look  closely  at

col.  466  of  Hansard, he will see that  this  is

really  what  I  meant: 1971 was,  of  course,  an

unusually   good   year  as  far   as   investment

commitments    were   concerned,   and    although

commitments  in  1972 were by comparison  smaller,

our  computation  has not taken into  account  the

expansion   of  existing  shipyards  which,   from

provisional  figures,  amounted  to   some   $83.1

million in 1972. As I have mentioned in my  Budget

statement, there is really not very much need  for

concern  about  investment  commitments  in  ship-building  and shiprepairing because our locational

advantages  are  such  that  we  would  expect  to

maintain   our  competitive  advantage  in   these

industries. The investments which have  been  made

in  the past and which are continuing to be  made,

whether  by expansion or by new commitments,  will

ensure that we will have an output of $600 million

by   1975,  as  I  have  mentioned  in  my  Budget

statement, and some $800 million by 1976. I  think

what we are now looking forward to is an expansion

of  the  supporting  industries for  shipbuilding,

such  as  ship equipment and machinery,  and  this

will, I hope, upgrade our ship-building machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further matter which the Member for Sembawang

raised was the question of salaries of officers in

Divisions  IT,  III  and IV. In  my  statement  in

Parliament on the 16th February, I indicated  that

after  the restructuring and realignment of salary

scales,  which have now been virtually  completed,

it  will  be  Government's intention  to  consider

increases  for Divisions II to IV,  and  even  for

those  in Division I, namely, on the basis of  the

guidelines  issued by the National Wages  Council.

For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



the  benefit of the Member for Sembawang, I  would

reiterate  that  it is Government's  intention  to

adopt, so far as this relates or is applicable  to

the  public  sector, the agreed general guidelines

of the National Wages Council for salary increases

every year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the questions asked by the Member

for  Anson.  He  raised a considerable  number  of

points over a wide range of subjects. Let me first

deal  with  the  chit funds.  The  last  date  for

receiving   claims   against  Gemini   Chit   Fund

Corporation was the 6th January, 1973, and against

Stallion   Corporation  Limited   was   the   16th

December,  1972. Since then the Official  Receiver

has  been  actively  processing  the  claims  from

subscribers of these two and nine other chit  fund

companies  being wound up by the court. There  are

approximately  42,000  claimants  altogether,  and

each  claim  has to be individually  verified.  No

effort  is being spared to expedite the settlement

of  these claims. I do not think a date can as yet

be set for such settlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also touched on the question

of  the  National Wages Council. I have  mentioned

this  in another connection, but he wanted to know

when they will be meeting and what is the time  at

which they will submit their recommendations. This

is  something  which, of course, I  am  not  fully

aware  of,  but they have met since December  last

year,  and  I  believe they are hoping  to  submit

their  recommendations to the  Government  by  the

middle  of  April. I believe some Members  on  the

other  side of the House will be able to give  him

more information on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also touched on the question

of  price control. I have already answered this to

some  extent  in  my  reply  to  the  Member   for

Sembawang.  But let me assure him again  that  the

Trade   Division   and   the  Primary   Production

Department  conduct checks on prices of  essential

foodstuffs.   The  Government  will  continue   to

exercise  some  control  on  such  commodities  as

sugar, wheat, flour and condensed milk, which  are

protected by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



tariffs and are therefore to some extent dependent

on Government permission for price increases. They

have to justify such price increases by giving  us

figures of cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson made some suggestions as to

how  to beat the price increases. I appreciate the

proposal   he   made  for  the  establishment   of

cooperatives.  This, I think, will  contribute  to

free and fair competition, which would be the best

safeguard  against unfair and manipulated  prices.

However,  such co-operatives are best  managed  by

non-governmental organisations, such  as  the  one

established in Toa Payoh. I hope that  this  pilot

project will prove successful and be the precursor

of many other such co-operative stores.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to price tagging, it has already been

introduced by shopping centres and emporiums,  and

no  doubt this tagging could be extended to  other

shops.  I  do not think that legislation  to  this

effect  would  help  to overcome  the  problem  of

profiteering by retailers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for daily publicity of prices of essential

foodstuffs, the suggestion is interesting and  can

be  given consideration. But many prices, such  as

those  for  condensed  milk, sugar,  soft  drinks,

coffee,  and so on, are fixed for long periods  of

time  and do not really require publicity. In  the

case  of  other essential foodstuffs, prices  vary

from locality to locality. In the rural areas, for

example,  I think it may be possible to buy,  say,

papayas  or  eggs at cheaper rates than  in  urban

localities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, I think, also mentioned

about  terms  and  conditions of  service  in  the

Government   sector,  relating   particularly   to

clerical officers and clerical assistants. I agree

that  as far as clerical work is concerned, it  is

very  difficult  to  distinguish  the  duties   of

clerical   officers   from   those   of   clerical

assistants.  The  general rule  is  that  clerical

officers   are  given  more  responsible  clerical

duties. It is not true that clerical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



assistants  have  no prospects  of  promotion.  In

fact, a promotion exercise was held in early 1972,

and  out  of  833  clerical  assistants  who  were

eligible  for consideration, 277, or 33 per  cent,

were  promoted to clerical officers  as  from  1st

April,  1972. 1 have already said that  Government

employees will get salary increases based  on  the

National Wages Council guidelines, and it  is  not

true therefore that the lower grades of workers in

the Government sector are totally neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about compensation for

reduction  of  leave  for  officers  in  statutory

bodies. I think this matter is being reviewed  and

will  be  the  subject of further negotiations  or

offers by the statutory bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the Member mentioned the question of

increase  in CPF contributions from 10 to  12  per

cent  in 1972, resulting in a lower take-home pay.

This may be true if one considers just the pay for

a  single month. But if the pay is taken in  terms

of  a  year,  then  the 13th month non-pensionable

allowance, which was paid last year and again this

year,   more   than   offsets  the   increase   in

contributions to the CPF. If anyone feels that his

take-home  pay  for  the  other  months  has  been

adversely   affected  by  the  increase   in   CPF

contribution  rates,  he can always  instruct  the

Accountant-General to have the total contributions

for  the  year  deducted at source from  his  13th

month payment. This would help in alleviating some

of  the hardship. I would remind the Member  that,

apart  from  the deduction from the worker's  pay,

the increased CPF contribution is also paid by the

employer. This will result in some benefit to  the

worker  because it can be used as payment  to  the

Housing  Board,  so  that  lime  amount  which  is

previously paid from his salary is now substituted

by   the  amount  available  from  the  employer's

contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned the question of

transferring  workers from the pension  scheme  to

CPF  arrangements. The Government is  thinking  of

transferring pensionable officers in Divisions III

and IV to CPF terms when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



these   have  been  improved.  Details   of   this

conversion are still being worked out,  and  I  am

therefore  not in a position to say  more  at  the

moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also made a very eloquent

plea  for  the plight of civil servants,  who  are

retiring  before 31st December, to  be  given  the

13th  month  payment or a proportion  thereof.  He

also  wanted  to  know whether  I  would  consider

increasing  pension rates in view  of  the  rising

cost  of  living. As a pensioner  myself,  I  have

considerable sympathy for the case of  pensioners,

but  I am afraid I will have to say no to his very

eloquent pleas. I can hold out no hope of  varying

the decision on these cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned the question of tariffs on

foreign  manufactured articles. The  policy  which

Government  has always adopted has been  to  grant

tariff   protection  to  efficient  and  deserving

industries  faced  with  unfair  competition  from

foreign products, and which are able to contribute

to the development of the economy. Such protection

is  normally  given on a very selective  basis  so

that  we  will be able to retain the  stimulus  of

competition and avoid undue increases in the  cost

of  living. The imposition of too liberal  tariffs

must  be  detrimental in the long run. The present

position   of   manufacturing  is  that   we   are

encouraging more technology-based industries,  and

these  industries would usually have their markets

abroad  and  would  not therefore  require  tariff

protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another matter which the Member for Anson

raised  was the question of the income tax  forms.

He  complained  that the forms are in  very  small

print and too complicated for ordinary workers  to

fill  in.  I  have considerable sympathy  for  the

Member  for  Anson  who,  like  myself  and  other

gentlemen of advancing years, find it difficult to

read  what they now consider small print but which

they   previously  found  quite  readable.  I   am

informed  that  the print used in the  income  tax

return  is of the same size as that used in paper-backs and in certain pages of our daily news-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



papers  which are very widely read and  appear  to

give  no  difficulty  to the  average  or  younger

reader.  If a larger print is required,  then  the

income tax form would run into more pages and cost

considerably  more.  The  income  tax   form   has

remained  the  same over the last  few  years  and

there  is really no reason for the ordinary worker

to  be confused by the requirements. But I do  not

blame  him if, like Professor Albert Einstein,  he

does  not find the filling in of these income  tax

forms   easy.  I  am  told  by  the   Income   Tax

Department,   and   I  received   it   with   some

incredulity, that from experience they found  that

the  majority  of  the forms  received  have  been

correctly   completed.  But  if   there   is   any

difficulty in filling in the forms, the Income Tax

Department  is  willing to  offer  assistance  and

there are officials who can help taxpayers to fill

in the forms correctly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Jurong who raised

the  question  of societies registered  under  the

Societies  Act  and the possibility  of  exempting

them  from income tax. I think he asked a  similar

question at Budget time last year, and T gave  him

a fairly lengthy reply. It seemed to be exhaustive

enough. But if I may recapitulate: I confirm again

that  where  the  objects of a society  registered

under the Societies Act are wholly charitable  and

benefit  the community at large, there is specific

provision  in the Income Tax Act for exemption  of

tax  on  its  income.  This then  leaves  us  with

societies  which  are not wholly charitable.  Even

among these societies, very few would be liable to

income tax as tax is only liable if less than half

of its receipts come from members. I think most of

the  receipts  of the societies he mentioned  have

come  from  non-members and  that  it  was  rather

painful that it should be lost in income tax.  But

as  I  said,  the legislation enables us  to  give

exemption to those societies which have more  than

half  of  its receipts from members. The rationale

for   this  is  that  if  the  society  is  mainly

dependent on its members for its funds and for its

existence, it is not trading or profit-making.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the contributions received

from  non-members  of  the  society  outweigh  the

subscriptions collected from its members, then  it

can  be  assumed  and deemed  to  be  carrying  on

business  and,  therefore, tax is  liable  on  any

surplus  in  its  accounts, just  like  any  other

trading organisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding

the  income  tax form, is it right for the  income

tax  officers to fill in the forms for the public?

I  repeat: the income tax officers are filling  in

the  income  tax  forms for the  public.  Is  this

right?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Yes. They will help them to fill

in  the  forms.  But,  of  course,  they  are  not

responsible for the contents.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> There is something wrong

there. I am mentioning this because I think  there

is  a loophole here. It is dangerous to allow  the

public  to ask the income tax officers to fill  in

the forms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to clarify one point. I feel that  the

Minister   for   Finance  regards  the   societies

registered under the Societies Act as  a  kind  of

trading concern. I think basically this is  wrong.

These  societies have volunteered to work for  the

good  of  the  community and  their  members.  For

example,  they  raise funds  to  build  their  own

premises or to give scholarships. They raise funds

to   give   money   to  their  members.   In   the

circumstances, I would like to ask  whether  these

societies can be exempted from income tax although

they are not charitable organisations as such.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that

if they are charitable organisations they would be

exempted  from  tax. If the objects  are  for  the

benefit of the community at large, that is another

condition. But if they benefit only a small group,

say, the people living in one particular road,  or

they give scholarships to the children in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



neighbourhood of say, 10 houses, obviously  it  is

not  something which is of general benefit to  the

community  at  large. In such cases we  would  not

give  exemption.  In cases where  the  benefit  is

spread over the community at large, I think  there

would be no difficulties. I would suggest that  if

the  Member has any particular case he could refer

it  to me and, if there is any doubt, then we will

clarify the exact reasons why income tax exemption

cannot be given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I thank the Minister for his detailed answer

to  my questions. We know now that the Ministry of

Finance  has adopted certain measures  to  control

the  increases  in the prices of commodities,  and

that  the Government is doing something to  put  a

stop  to the rising cost of living. I believe this

will help the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the trade deficit, he said that

there  was  no  reason  for  concern.  I  am  much

relieved to receive his assurance. But I feel that

to allow the trade deficit to continue is not good

in  the  long run. I hope the Government  will  do

something  to  see  that  our  trade  deficit   is

decreased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of

Messrs Sia Khoon Seong and Teong Eng Siong:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1021.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1021.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item relates to the Budget Division. It

is  a  new  division. I would  like  to  make  one

suggestion for the consideration of the  Minister.

In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



drafting   of   the   Budget   for   the   various

departments, certain provisions are connected with

two departments. For example, in making a loan  to

the  Housing and Development Board, the  provision

is  made  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  vote.

Therefore,  in the past when the House debated  on

this  item  there  was  some confusion.  In  other

words,  the  loan  provision for the  Housing  and

Development Board was made under the vote for  the

Ministry  of  Finance, but when Members  spoke  on

that loan provision and made certain criticisms on

the  Housing  and Development Board, the  Minister

for  Finance turned round and said that  this  was

not   within   his  ambit  as  the   Housing   and

Development  Board came under the jurisdiction  of

the Ministry of National Development and that such

criticisms  should be directed to the Ministry  of

National  Development.  But  there  was  no   such

provision  under  the  vote for  the  Ministry  of

National Development. Hence, the confusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting the Budget for next year, I wonder

whether   it  is  possible  to  place  this   loan

provision  under  the  vote for  the  Ministry  of

National Development, namely, "Loan to the Housing

and  Development  Board". I do  not  know  whether

there  will be any administrative difficulties  in

order  to carry out this suggestion. We know  that

provision  for  the  People's Association  is  put

tinder  the  Ministry of Culture. So if  provision

for  such an organisation can be placed under  the

Ministry  of  Culture, I would like to  have  this

item, "Loan to the Housing and Development Board",

placed under the Ministry of National Development.

I hope the Minister will consider my suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the suggestion of the Member

for  Sembawang has some merit in that, for  better

reflection   of  the  true  position,   the   loan

provision  should be made under  the  Ministry  of

National Development. I appreciate his suggestion.

It  is  correct  that if he wants details  of  the

operations  of the Housing and Development  Board,

then  his  inquiries  should be  directed  to  the

Ministry of National Development. I believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



he  has  taken every opportunity to do so  in  the

discussion  of the Estimates for the  Ministry  of

National Development. The Member can raise  a  lot

of questions under the provision for the Minister,

in fact, any matter which relates to his Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the particular loan item appears

under  the Ministry of Finance is that the quantum

and the terms of the loan are matters in which the

Minister  for Finance is involved. That means,  if

he   wants  to  know  why  in  the  allocation  of

financial resources the Minister gave $20 million,

or  $30  million, or $100 million, or $300 million

which is nearer what was provided, then it is  the

responsibility  of  the Minister  for  Finance  to

explain.  And sometimes the Minister  for  Finance

has  to exercise the responsibility whether or not

to  give $300 million if he only had $200 million.

That  is  why the provision is entered  under  the

Ministry  of  Finance. Similarly,  the  terms  and

conditions under which the loans are given to  the

Housing and Development Board, whether it  is  for

20  years, 25 years, or 30 years, and so on, would

be  a matter under the jurisdiction of the Finance

Minister. If there are any questions on this, this

is  the  particular item under which it  could  be

raised. But I accept the fact that perhaps matters

on  Housing  and Development Board could  also  be

presented   under   the   Ministry   of   National

Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it is better to present this

provision   under  this  Ministry  or  the   other

Ministry, that is a matter of judgment. I hope the

Member  has not been inhibited in any way  by  its

being  placed  under the Ministry of Finance.  The

People's  Association is in a  somewhat  different

category in the sense that the Ministry of Finance

does  not  give loans to the People's Association,

and   although  there  is  a  provision  for   the

operational  expenses of the People's Association,

it  comes  under the control of the  Minister  for

Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Minister  has  said  that the  provision  for  the

Housing and Development Board should perhaps  come

under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



Ministry of National Development. However, we  can

easily solve the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the loan provision for the Housing

and  Development  Board, when Members  move  their

amendments  on this item they may raise  questions

relating  to  the  Housing and Development  Board,

which   comes  under  the  Ministry  of   National

Development. But the Minister for Finance will not

be  able to answer such criticisms because  he  is

only  responsible for making loans to the  Housing

and  Development Board. He is not responsible  for

the   detailed   working  of   the   Housing   and

Development  Board. In past debates  it  has  been

found  difficult whether to confine the debate  to

the  Ministry of National Development  or  to  the

Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister for Finance, the

People's  Association is in a  different  position

because the Ministry of Finance does not make  any

loan  to  the People's Association. On  principle,

this  should not be different because the Ministry

of Finance makes a loan to any department. It is a

loan  in  the  account  books  and  it  can  claim

repayment of the loan. I feel that there should be

some   arrangement  between  one  department   and

another department. Perhaps this will only involve

a  change in the name of one department only.  But

the Minister may have other technical difficulties

and   may   have  to  consult  other  departments.

However, I am patient enough to wait.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Minister has said that my suggestion

has  some  merit, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 11*.

(* The  same amendment also stood in the name  of Mr Ho Kah Leong.)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision for this subhead is

$140,200,000 and this is a loan to the Jurong Town

Corporation.  The  Jurong  industrial  estate  has

become  famous and is a pride to the nation.  Many

development projects have been carried out. To me,

it  does not matter whether the industrial  estate

is in Sembawang or in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister how this

huge  provision of $140,200,000 is to be utilised.

I hope the Minister can give me a detailed answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am grateful

to the Member for Sembawang for his lavish praises

on  Jurong. However, I feel that there is room for

improvement in the development of Jurong  Town.  I

would  like to ask some questions relating to  the

development of Jurong Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of flats in Jurong Town;

one is low-cost housing and the other is executive

housing.  Priority is given to workers in  Jurong.

Low-cost   flats   can  be  purchased   with   CPF

contributions.  But  one cannot  utilise  his  CPF

contributions for the purchase of executive flats.

The  first few blocks of executive flats were sold

a  few  years ago at a price of $33,000 per  unit.

The  second  lot  is  about  to  be  sold,  and  I

understand  that  the price per  unit  is  $38,000

upwards. To purchase an executive flat, one has to

make  a down payment of 20 per cent of the selling

price. Not every executive can afford such  a  big

sum of money for the down payment for the purchase

of  executive flats. I understand that the Housing

Board  is building five-room flats, and the  price

of  these  flats  in  the urban  areas  is  around

$30,000  per unit. These HDB five-room  flats  are

about the same as those executive flats in Jurong.

I  do  not understand why one can utilise his  CPF

contributions for the purchase of five-room  flats

but  one cannot utilise his CPF contributions  for

the purchase of executive flats in Jurong. I would

like  the  Minister concerned to  explain  to  the

House the reasons for this difference.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is related to children's

playgrounds  in  Jurong. There  are  about  40,000

people  living in Jurong but there are only  three

children's playgrounds. One playground is still in

good   condition,   but   the   other   two    are

unfortunately in a state of disrepair.  The  play-things like the swings and the other equipment are

already damaged. I feel that the people in  Jurong

do  not  have  sufficient recreational facilities.

The ground floor of the blocks of flats cannot  be

used  as a playground for the children, as is  the

case with the new blocks of Housing Board flats. I

would  like to ask the Minister whether the  flats

to   be  built  in  Jurong  will  have  playground

facilities for children on the ground floor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third point is related to the question of

hygiene  and  health in Jurong. The  environmental

condition in Jurong is getting from bad to  worse.

I  know that the cleaning up or sweeping of public

places  and the collection of refuse in Jurong  is

done  by  contractors. If the contractors are  not

able  to  employ enough workers to carry  out  the

job,  perhaps because they pay very low  wages  or

for  any  other  reason, the result  is  that  the

drains  are clogged up and rubbish begins to  pile

up  in  these public places. Sir, Jurong Town,  as

pointed  out  by  the Member for Sembawang,  is  a

model  industrial  estate  in  Singapore.  It  has

attracted many tourists from abroad. If all  these

untidy and dirty conditions prevail, it will leave

a  bad impression on the tourists. I would like to

ask  the  Minister  to  request  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation to pay more attention to environmental

hygiene  in  Jurong.  If the contractors  are  not

doing   their  job,  change  them  and   get   new

contractors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the provision of $140.2

million   for  the  Jurong  Town  Corporation   is

required to partly pay for an expenditure of  $189

million  in  development projects. The surplus  of

the  Jurong  Town  Corporation  is  sufficient  to

supply $48.8 million, to make up the total of $189

million for development projects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the financial year 1973-74, the projects

which  are  intended  to be  carried  out  are  as

follows. Firstly, industrial projects: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Industrial projects in Jurong Town - about

1,000   acres   of   land   with   the   necessary

infrastructure  will  be  prepared,  and  over  40

standard factories built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Industrial projects in other industrial

estates, covering a total area of 268 acres to  be

prepared. They are as follows:



<pre>

                                     Acres

Ayer Rajah                             61

Telok Blangah                          10

Kallang Basin, including Kolam Ayer   180

Toa Payoh                              17

                                      ---

                        Total         268

                                      ===

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, seven blocks of multi-storey

factories  will  be completed and construction  of

another six will commence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Work on the extension of the Jurong Port to

add  another 3,000 feet of deep-water berths  will

commence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, housing projects: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Over 5,000 units of low-cost flats will be

completed, and another 5,000 units will  be  built

on  220  acres of land at Neighbourhood II, Jurong

Town.  In  addition, construction  of  over  4,000

units  of flats on 94 acres at Kampung Java Teban,

Jurong Town, will commence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In Sembawang, 528 units of low-cost housing

will be completed, and construction of another 572

units will commence covering 17 acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On executive housing, over 3,000 units

designed in the condominium standard will be built

in Jurong Town, covering 10 acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, social amenities. The Chinese Garden and

the   sports  complex  in  Jurong  Town  will   be

completed in 1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Jurong Town Hall will be completed

by the end of 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question on executive flats asked by

the Member for Jurong, the purchaser of such flats

is   not   allowed  to  make  use   of   his   CPF

contributions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



The  reason  for  this is quite  simple.  The  CPF

contributions are only allowed to be used for low-cost  housing, and these $38,000-units are not  in

the low-cost housing class.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member made a comparison with the

five-room flats of the Housing Board. These are in

a  slightly  different category.  They  are  lower

priced  for one thing, and for another,  they  are

still  limited  to  people  with  combined  family

incomes  of  $1,500 per month and  under.  So  the

regulation  still  is that CPF  contributions  can

only  be  used  for purchase of  a  low-cost  flat

constructed  by the Housing and Development  Board

or  the Jurong Town Corporation. The JTC executive

flat  is intended for the need of the professional

and managerial staff in the higher income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the children's

playground  in Jurong. There are at present  three

children's playgrounds in the residential area  in

Neighbourhood  I.  He  said  that  a  lot  of  the

equipment,  swings and so on, is damaged.  If  so,

the  attention  of  the  Jurong  Town  Corporation

should  be brought to bear on this problem and  to

have   the   damage  repaired.  The  Jurong   Town

Corporation  is,  however,  planning  seven   more

playgrounds  in Neighbourhood II,  four  of  which

will  be  completed in 1973-74  and  the  rest  in

1974-75.  In  addition, the Jurong  Park  with  80

acres  of park land will be opened soon to provide

added  recreational  amenities  for  the  children

living  in  Jurong Town. The Member for Jurong  is

really  more fortunate than most other Members  in

this House, so far as recreational facilities  are

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he spoke of the problem of taking measures

regarding hygiene in the residential areas  within

the   jurisdiction   of  the   Ministry   of   the

Environment.  Therefore, this is  not  so  much  a

problem   for   the   Jurong   Town   Corporation.

Enforcement measures are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



taken  by  the Ministry. The Corporation, however,

works  very  closely with the  Ministry,  and  has

assisted  in  this  matter  since  some   of   the

Corporation  officers, 24 in the  supervisory  and

technical  grades, have been empowered  to  ticket

offenders.  The  number  will  be  increased,   if

necessary, to cope with the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 47.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision is for Housing Scheme for Public

Officers.  I  would  like  to  ask  the   Minister

concerned a very simple question. Are teachers and

employees in Government-aided schools entitled  to

the benefits of this housing scheme?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the housing scheme for

public  officers is a pilot scheme. At the  moment

it   is  intended  for  Government  officers   and

officers  of statutory boards, of whom  Government

is  virtually the employer. It is not possible  at

present  to  extend the scheme to Government-aided

institutions. These institutions are numerous  and

aid from Government takes many different forms. It

is  not possible at this stage to do anything else

other  than  draw  a line between  the  Government

institutions and these other institutions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like

to ask the Minister whether the housing scheme can

be  extended  to  teachers in the Government-aided

schools.  We know that in the teaching  profession

more than half the number of teachers are employed

in  Government-aided schools. Those who  teach  in

Government-aided  schools have the  same  teaching

load  as their counterparts in Government schools.

I  am glad that the Government has already granted

the   same  medical  facilities  to  teachers   in

Government-aided schools. So, on the same  ground,

I think we should extend the housing scheme to the

teachers in Government-aided schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, as to whether the scheme can

be  specifically extended to staff of  Government-aided schools, I am afraid the answer is still no,

for  the  reason  that  they  are  not  Government

servants.  Even the current housing  loan  schemes

are  not  extended to the Government-aided  school

staff  so that, apart from the allocation of  this

housing scheme for public officers, they would not

be eligible for such loans. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



reason  is  simply  that they are  not  Government

employees.  The  distinction has  been  made,  and

their  terms  of  service  are  not  the  same  as

Government  in all respects. Maybe their  teaching

load is the same, but they are not subject to  the

same obligations, say, to be transferred from  one

place to another.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am still

not   satisfied  with  the  reply  given  by   the

Minister. He said that teachers in the Government-aided schools are not Government servants. I quite

agree with this. However, I seem to have heard the

Minister say that those officers in Divisions  III

and  IV would be given the option to convert  from

the  pension scheme to the Central Provident  Fund

Scheme.  If this is done, then there is  not  much

difference  between Government and  non-Government

servants.   The   Minister  also  mentioned   that

teachers in the aided schools are not entitled  to

the current housing loans given by Government.  So

I  would  like to ask the Minister whether  he  is

prepared to consider granting housing loans to the

teachers of Government-aided schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I do not think that

consideration  can be given at  this  stage.  That

answer  should be sufficient. Whether or not  they

deserve to be given a scheme is not an appropriate

matter  to discuss under this particular  subhead.

Whether  aided school staff should  be  given  the

same  facilities  as  all Government  officers  is

something which should be taken up, first of  all,

at  Ministry level, before he comes to  this  more

specific question. As you can see, Sir, the  title

to   this  item  is  "Housing  Scheme  for  Public

Officers".  Therefore, whether  the  teachers  are

deserving  cases and ought to get  them,  that  is

quite  another matter. I am saying  that  at  this

stage  it is not possible. In any case, the scheme

is  a  pilot scheme. The number of public officers

who  are eligible are so numerous that we have not

been able to satisfy them, so that even if we  did

admit  teachers eventually, they will  have  lower

priority on the basis of first come first served.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am still

not satisfied with the Minister's reply, but owing

to  the  time  limit, I beg leave to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 51.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to clarify one

point   regarding  the  loan  to   the   Singapore

Teachers' Union. I would like to know what is  the

purpose  of  this loan to the Singapore  Teachers'

Union,  and what is the rate of interest  charged.

If other teachers' associations would like to have

a  loan  from the Ministry will their  request  be

considered?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the total loan granted in

December, 1972, to the Teachers' Union  is  a  sum

larger than the amount which has been provided. It

is,  in  fact,  $100,000, for  which  $60,000  was

provided by virement this year and is expected  to

be  drawn  before the end of the current financial

year. The loan is to help finance part of the cost

of  the  Teachers' Centre project in the  Teachers

Housing  Estate at 12 1/2 m.s. Yio Chu  Kang  Road.

The  Centre, estimated to cost $1.5 million,  will

include    library,   educational   and   research

facilities, and is expected to serve  as  a  focal

point  for  teachers in professional,  social  and

recreational activities. Members will surely agree

that  this is a project which is worthy of support

not only by teachers but also by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the privilege of a similar nature

will be extended to others, each case will have to

be  examined on its merits. Where the projects are

sound,   and  where  self-help  is  evident,   and

prospects  of repayment of the loan are reasonably

good,   consideration  will  be  given   to   loan

applications.
