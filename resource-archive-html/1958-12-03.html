Excellency the Governor dated the 14th November, 1958,

informing  me that, in accordance with the  provisions

of  Section 62 (2) of the Singapore Colony  Orders  in

<div align="center"><b>MEMBER'S PROTEST AGAINST SPEAKER'S</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>RULING THROUGH PRESS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is my duty to direct the attention of

the  Assembly,  in  its capacity as  guardian  of  the

prestige  of  the Speaker, to a report of a  statement

purported  to have been made by the Honourable  Member

for  Queenstown to the Singapore Standard and reported

in that paper of the 27th of November, 1958, under the

caption:



<br><br><div align="center"><b>"Mr Lee & new Chief Justice's appointment<br>He protests against Speaker's ruling"

<br><br></b></div>



Reference  in  the  article is made to  two  questions

disallowed  by me as being inadmissible,  one  on  the

appointment of the Chief Justice for Singapore and the

other  on  the proposal to abolish Teochew, Hainanese,

Khek and Foochow radio programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article, inter alia, states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Lee said that it had been the usual practice for

the   Speaker  to  give  reasons  whenever  he   ruled

questions as "inadmissible".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this case, no reason had been given", he added.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset it is my duty to point out that action

of  the  nature  reported to have been  taken  by  the

Honourable Member in protesting against the ruling  of

the Speaker through the Press is not only discourteous

but  also  improper, the more so in the light  of  the

implication  of  a  sinister motive contained  in  the

passage quoted by me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to be able to say, however, that the

Honourable  Member  has assured me  that  he  did  not

intend  to  be  discourteous or improper.  He  further

assures me that he told the reporter concerned that he

accepted  my  rulings  but was disappointed  that  the

questions  could  not be tabled.  Had  he  desired  to

protest he would have protested, as he is entitled  to

do,  to  me direct and not through the medium  of  the

Press. He would then, of course, have been informed of

the reasons for my rulings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members are, I am sure, aware that if they

are  dissatisfied with the rulings of the Speaker, the

proper  course would be to raise the matter  with  the

Speaker  direct in an interview or by letter,  and  if

thereafter  they are still dissatisfied, their  remedy

is by way of substantive motions for review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add that although the relevant Standing Order

in  regard to questions does not provide that  reasons

should  be  given  for  any ruling,  I  have  for  the

convenience  of Members directed the Clerk  to  revive

the  practice  of acquainting Honourable Members  with

the  reasons for any adverse ruling to enable them all

the  better  to decide whether they will or  will  not

raise the matter with the Speaker.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>CHINESE RACE IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Breakdown Figures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Secretary to

state  the  latest  approximate  estimated  number  of

persons  in  Singapore  who  are  Hokkien,  Cantonese,

Teochew, Hakka, Hainanese and Foochow.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> Sir, the figures approximately are

Hokkien,   432,000;   Cantonese,   236,000;   Teochew,

234,000;  Hakka,  60,000; Hainanese, 79,000;  Foochow,

14,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RADIO BROADCAST OF CHINESE PROGRAMMES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  he is aware of the strong opposition  of  the

various  Chinese community associations and guilds  of

Singapore  to the Government's decision to discontinue

using   the  Teochew,  Hakka,  Hainanese  and  Foochow

dialects  in  the  local  broadcast  of  the  Chinese,

programme   from   January  1959,  and   whether   the

Government will reconsider this decision.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the Government has received a number

of  representations in this matter. As I informed  the

House  on  5th November, the aim of the Government  in

making  these changes is solely to improve the balance

and   content   of   the  present  Chinese   broadcast

programmes   and  advice  was  sought   from   several

representative  bodies  and  individuals  before   the

decision was taken in agreement with the Government of

the  Federation of Malaya. Nevertheless, I welcome the

opportunity  of  giving  more  details  of   what   is

proposed,  since  I think it will  be  seen  that  the

apprehensions  underlying  these  representations  are

largely without foundation. No changes will be made in

the   cultural   contributions  made   by   the   four

communities in question to the Chinese broadcasts. The

opera, music and songs will continue as before and, in

particular, the Teochew story-teller and those of  the

other  dialects will remain on the air. The only major

practical  change will be to cut out the regular  news

bulletins  in these dialects. The present practice  of

broadcasting  the  news bulletins in  seven  different

dialects  means that, out of a total weekly  programme

of  83½  hours, no less than 10½ hours is consumed

in  the repetition of news bulletins. Moreover,  since

these have to be broadcast at fixed times of the  day,

it    leaves   little   flexibility   for   periodical

adjustments   and   improvements   in   the   cultural

programmes. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



should  add  that in times of emergency,  arrangements

would always be made for important announcements to be

given in as many dialects as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I should mention two other improvements

which  it  is  proposed to make from 1st January.  All

Chinese programmes will from that date be broadcast on

a single frequency. This will save listeners having to

retune  their sets in the course of listening  to  the

programmes.  Moreover,  the  total  weekly  hours   of

Chinese broadcasts will be slightly increased.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Do we understand

from that explanation, Sir, that the primary reason is

to save broadcasting time and not to save cost?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the main object is to save time in

order to give more time for cultural broadcasts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do we understand from the statement

that in times of emergency there will be broadcasts in

all dialects, and that in fact the staff necessary for

broadcasting in all dialects will still be there?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> I do not expect that there will he any

difficulty in making the necessary arrangements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does that mean that as and when

they  are  required, they will be ferretted  out,  but

that there will be no maintenance of constant staff?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> I would like notice of that question, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Is the Chief

Secretary  prepared  to give an  opportunity  to  this

House   to   have  a  debate  on  this  issue   before

implementing that decision?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> I do not think that sufficient reason has

been shown, Sir, to justify that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

according to the Chief Secretary's report, the  figure

for  Teochew is 234,000 and that for Hakka is  60,000.

Leaving out the Hainanese and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



Foochow, will the Chief Secretary accept the fact that

in this quarter of a million and over population there

are  many  illiterates who cannot  write  or  read  in

either  Chinese  or Malay, and therefore  they  cannot

read  the  daily  newspaper? So  the  only  source  of

information that they can get is either through  Radio

Malaya  or  Rediffusion, sitting in a  coffee-shop  or

somewhere  else  to listen. Since the Chief  Secretary

has assured us that during an emergency they are going

to announce in all the other dialects, why not issue a

daily news bulletin for these people so that they  can

enjoy  getting  the  new bulletins through  their  own

dialects?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I am advised that a person speaking

in  the  Teochew dialect can converse perfectly easily

with a person speaking in the Hokkien dialect -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> - and that, in fact, 80 per cent of the

words used are the same.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, since the Chief Secretary is

not  prepared to have a debate, is he aware that  this

is a very important issue and that it has caused great

concern to the four Chinese communities in Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>BAN ON PUBLICATIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FROM HONGKONG AND CHINA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Secretary what

progress   has  been  made  in  the  examination   and

exemption of the publications affected by the  general

ban  on  the publications of 53 publishers in Hongkong

and China.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, satisfactory progress has been made

and in response to applications so far received as  at

2nd December exceptions had been authorised in respect

of 450 books.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT TUBERCULOSIS SURVEY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statistics)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Health whether

he will state-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the total number of persons who have been X-rayed under the Government Tuberculosis Survey;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) what percentage of these persons showed evidence of tuberculosis, both healed and

active;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) what percentage of these persons have been found to require active treatment; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) whether there is a waiting list for the admission of infecting tuberculosis cases to

hospital, including cases not discovered by the Survey.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to (a), a total

of 54,829 persons were X-rayed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to (b), the percentage varies with the

locality surveyed. In the Jalan Sultan area where  20,288  residents were X-rayed, the percentage of persons

showing  evidence  of  tuberculosis  both  healed  and

active was 13.2. In the Chinatown area, of a total  of

20,742 residents X-rayed, the percentage was 15.4.  In

the  Bukit Panjang area, of a total of 5,168  X-rayed,

the percentage was 7.2, and in the Geylang Serai area,

of a total of 4,474 X-rayed, the percentage was 7.4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to (c), Sir, it is regretted that it is

not  possible  to give a full answer  because  a  full

assessment has not been completed. Only in  the  Jalan

Sultan  area  have  investigations been  substantially

completed and, in consequence, it is possible only  to

give  figures in that particular area. The  percentage

of those found to be suffering in the area from active

tuberculosis  is estimated to be 3.5. The  reason  for

this estimate is this. From the Jalan Sultan area, 662

persons   are  now  under  treatment.  That  gives   a

percentage  of  3.26, but of the 13.2, that  is  2,675

persons,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



called for assessment, 219 have not yet turned up.  We

are  trying  to trace them by domiciliary service.  An

allowance  therefore has to be made for those  persons

who  might  require treatment out of the 219  not  yet

assessed. That is why, Sir, we are giving an  estimate

of 3.5 instead of 3.26. Of these 662 persons, 213 were

found to require hospital treatment, that is less than

a third of those requiring treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to (d), there are about 850 persons on

the waiting list. This includes some 56 cases found in

the  survey from all the four areas and, while on  the

waiting   list,   they   are   receiving   out-patient

treatment.  It  often  happens that  when  one's  turn

arrives  one's  condition has so improved,  Sir,  that

hospitalization becomes unnecessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a fact

that  a  total of 80,000 persons were to have been  X-rayed at the four centres, but will the Minister state

why  this  figure  fell short by  about  approximately

25,000?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it must be realised that

the figures quoted refer only to residents in the area

under  survey.  There are some 4,000  persons  X-rayed

additionally.  They came from places  other  than  the

area surveyed, and those X-rays were not refused.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> The Minister has not answered my question.

The  original  intention  of  the  Government,  as   I



understand it, was to make a survey in the four  areas

affected,  of  20,000  in  each  area,  making  80,000

altogether.   We   have   been   given   figures    of

approximately 55,000 leaving a shortage of 25,000, and

is  this therefore making a survey less accurate  than

otherwise it should be?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Sir, the survey was conducted by the

experts and the target, that I announced sometime  ago

was 50,000, intended by Government for the purposes of

the survey.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr John Ede.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>FURTHER MEASURES AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Health whether

he  will make a statement on what further measures the

Government  proposes to take in the  campaign  against

tuberculosis  in  the  light of the  findings  of  the

Government Tuberculosis Survey.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Until the financial position becomes

clearer   and  the  full  facts  of  the  Survey   are

available, I am not as yet in a position to  formulate

with  any definiteness further measures. But the whole

matter will certainly be reviewed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that

there  will  be  more cases of tuberculosis  requiring

hospitalization, in addition to those already  on  the

waiting  list  mentioned  as 850,  will  the  Minister

please  explain why it has been decided  to  change  a

T.B. ward into a Nurses' hostel?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member

does not remember what was said here in the debate  on

the  1958  Estimates. At page 421, the House  approved

only  $1,000 with which to construct a Nurses'  hostel

and training school, although the estimated cost is $2-million, the reason being that it was then beyond  the

building capacity of the Public Works Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the use of the present wards for

training  of hospital nurses, I do not mind  admitting

that  there  is  a  shortage of staff.  It  was  found

necessary  for  the present to get the number  of  our

trained assistant nurses up to scratch.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I remind the

Minister that only last month we sanctioned $62,000 to

convert,  a  T.B. ward into a Nurses'  hostel  on  the

grounds that there was no need for extra beds for T.B.

patients. Would he now explain what is meant by 850 on



the waiting list?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that although

these  people  are on the waiting list for  treatment,

very often by the time their turn comes, they have  so

improved that they do not need hospitalization.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Government

consider  presenting  a White Paper  setting  out  the

whole  T.B. problem as revealed by the  survey  as  a

matter of public importance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> That will be duly considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, did I hear the

Minister right? In effect he is suggesting that it  is

better  to  be outside the hospital waiting  for  your

turn to get in, and recover before you get in, than to

be inside the hospital receiving treatment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I made no such suggestion, Sir, although I

did  say  that  those on the waiting  list  are  being

treated. In the Tan Tock Seng Hospital there are three

wards  each  with a 34-bed capacity lying vacant,  and

the reason why we have not been able to use these beds

is  that  there is a great shortage of nursing  staff.

One  block of 206 beds, originally intended  for  T.B.



patients, is used temporarily as a hostel and a school



for  the  training  of assistant  nurses.  This  is  a

temporary measure. In order to meet the need of staff,

we  used part of the accommodation as a nursing school

and  hostel.  Consideration  has  been  given  to  the

recruitment of nursing sisters from elsewhere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



There is additional accommodation available in the new

building  environments  of  the  Woodbridge  Hospital,

having a bed capacity of about 240.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Will the Minister explain why the beds at

the  Woodbridge Hospital are not yet ready to take  in

the patients?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I believe they are ready.

<div align="center"><b>IMPORT OF CHINA GOODS INTO SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Effects of Suspension)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry whether he will make a statement on  the

effects of the suspension by China, as reported in the

local  press,  of  the import of  certain  goods  into

Singapore, and what steps does he propose to  take  to

ensure  that the entrepot trade of Singapore will  not

be   jeopardised  and  that  the  cost  of  living  in

Singapore   will  not  rise  as  a  result   of   this

suspension.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have had no official

intimation  of any suspension of exports by  China  to

Singapore.  If, however, the reports in the newspapers

of  suspension of exports of certain preserves, salted

vegetables  and  fruits are correct, it  could  create

some difficulty in supplies for those who prefer these

articles;  but it is unlikely to have any  significant

effect  on  the  cost of living as a whole.  It  might

perhaps   be   beneficial  by  switching   the   taste

preference  of  consumers to similar locally  produced

articles.  It is also unlikely to have any significant

effect on our entrepot trade, as indications show that

not much of the above goods go into the entrepot trade

stream and also because most of the goods required for

our  entrepot  trade are freely available  from  other

sources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the picture of China's trade as a whole

with  Singapore, we have been exporting to China  much

less than we have been importing from China. In short,

the  balance  of trade is against us. Our total  trade

with China in January to September 1958 has been under

four per cent of our total overseas trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must take the opportunity of correcting some

misimpressions  that might have been  created  in  the

minds of the people of Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was wondering whether that

statement would not arise on the adjournment, as I see

that the hon. Member for Changi has obtained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



the  right  to  raise the matter of the importance  of

unrestricted  trade between Singapore  and  China.  If

what  the  Minister is saying would more appropriately

be  said  at the adjournment, I would suggest that  he

say it at the adjournment.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> With respect, Sir, when the

Member for Changi finishes his adjournment speech,  it

is possible that the time might be too short for me to

give an appropriate reply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister agrees then that

what he has to say will arise on the adjournment, then

I am afraid he is anticipating, and he cannot do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I do not think it will

arise, but I was wondering whether what I have to  say

might  better  be  a  part of my statement  in  reply,

because  the Member has been asking me for a statement

on the effects of this suspension of trade by China.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister then assures me

in no uncertain terms that what he has to say will not

arise,  or  is  not  relevant to  the  subject  to  be

discussed on the adjournment, then he can continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I do not know what the Member

will say in his adjournment speech, but I can give the

assurance  that what I am going to say is relevant  to

the question asked.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is quite irrelevant to my

ruling.  If the hon. Member for Changi, in the process

of  asking  supplementary questions, also  anticipates

what  he  wishes to say on the adjournment,  then,  of

course, he will be out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> To continue, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member can, if he assures me that

what  he  is  going to say will not be raised  on  the

adjournment.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir, I will do that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I must take this opportunity of

correcting some mis-impressions that might  have  been

created  in  the minds of the people of  Singapore  by

certain  statements  alleged  to  have  been  made  by

trading agencies in China in their correspondence with

Singapore merchants, as quoted in Press reports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been alleged that the reported suspension by

China   in  certain  lines  of  exports  to  Singapore

resulted  from certain discriminatory actions  of  the

Singapore  Government. The only  action  by  Singapore

which  could be construed as such was the ban  imposed

last month at the request of the Federation Government

on imports of certain types of textiles. The first and

foremost duty of any elected Government in any country

is  to safeguard the economy of the country. As far as

Singapore  is concerned, the economy of Singapore  and

that  of the Federation is so closely interlinked that

any  damage to the economy of the Federation is  bound

to have a much stronger repercussion in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are looking to a merger with the Federation, it

is  the clear duty of any Singapore Government  to  do

its  best  to  prevent the undermining of the  Malayan

economy. The step taken by the Singapore Government at

the   request   of   the  Federation   Government   to

temporarily  safeguard their textile industry  is  not

therefore a discriminatory step against China as such;

but  a  step  taken  for the benefit  of  the  Malayan

economy  as a whole. I can well conceive such  a  step

being  taken  against  any other  country  if  it  was

considered necessary in the interests of our  economy,

bearing  of  course in mind any officially  recognized

contractual obligations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might bear a little explaining why the step was

taken  against  the particular types of textiles  only

from  China.  It  is quite apparent that  the  trading

policy  of  China is strongly influenced by  political

considerations,  as is evidenced from  the  fact  that

China has been selling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



these  goods below the comparative producing  cost  of

countries like Japan, where there is a high degree  of

automation  and  labour is cheap. In fact,  China  has

been  able to underprice her goods even below the cost

of  Hongkong  producers who have had at their  command

cheap refugee labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent, therefore, that China's policy has

been  to dump its goods in certain markets at a  price

which  has  no  bearing on the cost of  production  in

order   to   undermine  the  industries   of   certain

countries.  This undercutting cannot, however,  go  on

indefinitely  without  having  an  effect  on  China's

economy, and it is possible that the present move  may

be   due  to  the  adverse  economic  results  of  the

undercutting policies being felt in China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible that long-term credit

arrangements may have been stretched too far and  that

China  may be feeling that the time has come  to  stop

these credit facilities and ask for cash payments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Fair competition in trade has

always been encouraged by the Singapore Government but

where  undercutting with political motives results  in

damage  to  the Malayan economy, the Government  feels

that it has an obligation to the Malayan economy as  a

whole,  even though the particular industry  concerned

may be located in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, while the Singapore Government has no

intention  or wish to hamper trade between  China  and

Singapore, it is its clear duty to see that such trade

is not to the detriment of any of our industries or to

the  Malayan  economy as a whole, and  this  not  only

applies to China but to any other country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To blame the Singapore Government in the fashion

reported  by the Press is therefore a clear indication

of  China's  desire to make political capital  out  of

what  is  purely a step dictated by economic necessity

to   Singapore  as  far  as  Singapore's   action   is

concerned, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



possibly  for  the  same reason to  China  as  far  as

China's present reported action is concerned.

<div align="center"><b>LEAKAGES OF EXAMINATION QUESTIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Education)</b></div>



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the black clouds that have gathered over

my   Ministry  since  6th  November,  1958,  are  only

partially  cleared, and I feel that it is my  duty  to

make  a statement on the part that is cleared so  that

the public can know the facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am referring to the two leakages of examination

questions  set by my Ministry in the English Secondary

Schools   Entrance  Examination  and  the   Government

Chinese Senior Middle III examination. Of course,  the

public  reaction to both leakages - especially when  the

second  one followed the first one so closely - is  that

my  head and the heads of my Ministry officials should

be  delivered on a charger to this House, in  addition

to a public enquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the concern of the people over these

leakages   because  these  examinations  are  national

examinations.  But,  when  serious  things  like  this

happen,  we  must  keep calm and refrain  from  saying

anything  that  might prejudice the issue  before  the

truth is out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English Secondary Schools' Entrance Examination

is  a  stepping stone to secondary education which  is

much  sought  after,  and  for  which  there  may   be

insufficient  places  for  those  who  want  it.   The

Government Chinese Senior Middle III examination is  a

national  examination enabling those who  pass  it  to

obtain employment in the public service and to go  for

higher  studies. Those who are responsible  for  these

leakages,  either  through negligence  or  dishonesty,

will  be  punished  and their identities  exposed  for

public disgrace.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement that I am making today, and any future

statements that I will make on this subject,  will  be

made   without   fear  or  favour.  Those   who   have

dishonestly  caused the leakage or  dishonestly  taken

advantage of the leakage are a disgrace to the  people

of  Singapore.  By their action, they have  undermined

our educational system and the morals of our students.

These people stand publicly condemned before the House



today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if only our public-spirited citizens will give

us   information  of  the  type  we  received  on  3rd

November, 1958, then every crime in Singapore will  be

satisfactorily  solved.  At  4.30  p.m. on   3rd   of

November,  my Permanent Secretary received information

that   examination  questions  set  in   the   English

Secondary    Schools'   Entrance   Examination    were

obtainable  at No. 141 Carpmael Road. The Police  were

informed immediately and by 8.30 p.m. a copy  of  some

of the questions had already been obtained by a Police

officer  from  someone  living  in  that  house.   The

questions obtained were found to be identical  to  the

questions  set  in  the paper for the  next  day.  The

Police officer paid a second visit to the house on the

following  evening and obtained further questions  for

the  next day. At ten minutes past ten that night, 141

Carpmael  Road  was  searched by the  Police  under  a

search  warrant  issued  by a  Magistrate,  and  other

copies  of  the questions were found, but no  original

printed copies. From there the Police commenced  their

investigations and in a few days the Police had traced

the  source  of the leakage and brought to book  eight

persons.  There was no doubt where the source  of  the

leakage  was.  Swift and firm action  is  being  taken

against the persons concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee of the Government Printing Office and

three   clerks   of  another  department   have   been

interdicted. Action has been taken under the Education

Ordinance  against the three teachers concerned - one  a

re-employed  retired teacher in a  Government  English

School,  and  the  other  two teachers  in  a  private

school. They have been struck



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



off  the  register as teachers. The allegation against

the  City  Council employee has been referred  to  the

City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the leakage in the Government Senior

Middle  III  examination,  investigations  are   still

proceeding and I do not propose, for obvious  reasons,

to  disclose  progress at this stage.  I  would  like,

however, to appeal to everyone who has information  to

assist  my  Ministry and help us in eradicating  these

people and in punishing all those who were responsible

for  this leakage. At the risk of repetition, I  might

again add that this is a national examination and must

be   absolutely  reliable.  Possession   of   a   pass

Certificate  will  entitle the  holder  to  enter  the

public services and I am, therefore, determined to see

that  the  fair name of Chinese education is kept  up.

And  for this reason, I am equally determined to  deal



with  the culprits ruthlessly. Security measures  have

been taken to ensure that such a leakage will not take

place in future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Whilst we are reassured by the firm

manner  in which the Minister says he intends to  deal

with  the  culprits,  could he  tell  us  if  he  also

proposes  to deal with those in supervisory  positions

who,   by  their  lack  of  vigilance,  enabled  these

culprits to do what they did?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Yes, Sir, investigations are

being made, and if there is evidence in respect of any

person, be he a supervisor or invigilator, firm action

will be taken against that person.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, Sir, I am sorry I have not made

my  point  clear  enough. There are  people  who  were

directly  responsible for the leakage,  and  who  were

making  money out of it. There are others who,  whilst

not   being  directly  responsible,  must  have   been

negligent  in  their  duties  to  have  allowed   such

culprits to do what they did and remain undetected for

some time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, action will be

taken against those people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of course,

this  House welcomes the firm assurance given  by  the

Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



Education. Sir, as we have heard the Minister say, the

leakage   was   due   to  two  causes - negligence   and

dishonesty. Therefore, is the Minister prepared to set

up  a  body  within his Ministry to  carry  out  these

investigations,  rather  than  just   issue   a   firm

statement, because negligence and dishonesty -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member can stop

there.  He  has asked a question. Would  the  Minister

like to answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Yes, Sir. In fact, the Permanent

Secretary and myself are investigating into  this  so-called  negligence. I have given  the  source  of  the

leakage  in the first examination, and in the case  of

the  second  examination, that is, the Chinese  Senior

Middle  III examination, investigations are proceeding

and  we  are  taking  a  personal  interest  in  those

investigations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister

aware that there are some people who believe that both

his  Permanent Secretary and himself might  have  been

negligent  in  their  supervision  in  allowing  these

things  to  happen?  It  is no use  his  investigating

himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Opposition  think  I am negligent  they  can  bring  a

substantive motion against me in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition

are  in  no  position to say whether the  Minister  is

negligent or not. But somebody should be equipped with

all  the  facts, either to clear the Minister  of  the

scandalous  charges that have been circulated  against

him  and  the dark clouds that have gathered over  his

head,  or a thunder storm may well break over him!  If

he  persists in being both investigator and  judge  of

his own position, then what is the use of it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Do I understand the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar to say that I am dishonest  or  that  I

have been implicated in all this?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think there was any imputation

of that nature.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am so sorry

the  Minister for Education has misunderstood what the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar has said. May I ask  further

whether -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I had better put this

matter  in its right perspective. We are not  here  to

debate  this  matter  but if the  hon.  Member  has  a

question to ask, he can ask it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> The Minister for Education has

not  answered my question. What I said is that  it  is

better for the Ministry of Education to form a body to

investigate but not for the Minister and his Permanent

Secretary to do so, because I know they are very busy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The Police have been brought into

these investigations, and I must publicly say that  my

conscience  is clear, and so is that of  my  Permanent

Secretary. I shall be the true judge.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Am I correct in saying

that the Minister has just now informed us that two of

the   culprits  were  dismissed?  In   view   of   the

seriousness  of this crime, why cannot we impose  more

severe punishment like imprisonment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> No, Sir. No crime has been

disclosed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is customary at this time to refer briefly to the

accounts  for 1957 and to deal rather more fully  with

the  workings  for 1958 before passing  to  the  Draft

Estimates for 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference has been made to 1957 in the Memorandum

which   accompanied  the  Draft  Estimates   and   the

Statement  of Accounts will be published  and  in  the

hands of hon. Members very shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1958 has not been a particularly easy year. When the

Draft Estimates were introduced in December, 1957,  it

was  said that, although a deficit was budgetted  for,

it  was  probable  that revenue and expenditure  would

balance   in   the  event,  provided   that   economic

conditions   continued  favourable  and  supplementary

votes  were  reduced to a minimum. Almost immediately,

the  recession  in trade, which had been  threatening,

struck in the United States. By the early spring,  its

effects  were  beginning to be felt in  Singapore.  By

May,  there was no doubt that it had arrived.  Revenue

collections  began to fall below the  estimate.  Money

became  tighter. Trade drifted into the  doldrums.  It

was  impossible to say how severe the recession  would

be,  or how long it would last. We were fairly heavily

committed  as  far  as expenditure  was  concerned.  A

severe  and prolonged recession could have  a  serious

effect on our finances. We were more vulnerable to the

effects of a trade recession than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



we  had  ever  been before because we  now  relied  on

company and income tax for 26 per cent of our revenue.

If the recession were severe or prolonged, we would be



in danger of incurring substantial deficits on current

account which would in turn run down reserves. It  was

already clear that we had started off the year with  a

much  smaller balance in the Development Fund than  we

had  expected, and there was certain to be  a  deficit

which would have to be met from reserves. A severe and

prolonged  recession would also limit our  ability  to

raise   loans  and  to  contribute  from  revenue   to

development.  We might be in some danger  of  entering

into  capital  commitments  which  we  might  find  it

difficult to meet. In short, the cumulative effect  of

a severe and prolonged trade recession would be to run

down  our  basic reserves below the safety  level.  It

therefore  seemed  essential  to  take  stock  of  the

position  and to introduce such precautionary measures

as seemed necessary while there was still time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  are already aware of the  steps  which

were  taken in this connection. As far as the ordinary

estimates  of expenditure were concerned,  all  vacant

posts  were  "frozen" until they could be reviewed  in

the light of the changed financial position. Heads  of

Departments   were  asked  to  review  all   recurrent

expenditure in order to effect the maximum  economies.

Items  of  special expenditure not yet committed  were



examined  and  many  which  were  not  essential  were

ruthlessly   cut  out.  As  far  as  the   Development

Estimates  were concerned, a halt was  called  on  all

projects  which had not yet been started, in order  to

avoid any danger of becoming over-committed. Advantage

was also taken of the halt to re-examine the immediate

need  for some items of capital development which  had

hitherto been given a high priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps which were taken have achieved the purpose.

As   far   as   ordinary  expenditure  is   concerned,



considerable   economies   have   been   effected   in

expenditure  on  personal emoluments  over  and  above

those which were to be expected,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



and my latest information is that expenditure will  be

about $104 million compared with the original estimate

of  $123 million. Economies have also been effected on

Annually Recurrent expenditure and it now looks as  if

expenditure will not exceed $106 million compared with

the  original estimate of $111 million and the revised

estimate of $108 million given in the Memorandum which

accompanied the estimates. Special expenditure is  now

estimated  at  about  $38 million  compared  with  the

estimate of $42 million. In all, total expenditure now

seems likely to be of the order of $248 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, revenue has not suffered as

seriously  as  it  was  at one  time  thought  likely.

Collections  of  customs duties have certainly  fallen



below the estimate, particularly in respect of liquors

and  petrol, but it appears probable that  Income  Tax

collections will achieve the estimate. Fortunately,  a

total  shortfall of close on $5 million under Class  I

is  likely  to  be  offset by corresponding  increases

under  Classes  IV and V and the total should  not  be

very  far  off the original estimate of $249  million.

With   some   luck,  therefore,  actual  revenue   and



expenditure might balance at about $248 million which,

when all things are considered, is very satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as development was concerned, the steps taken

were  equally effective. Expenditure was brought under

control and any possibility of becoming over-committed

was  avoided. A number of large items were re-examined

and  awarded a lower priority than had previously been

attached to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of the latest information available, it

seems likely that development expenditure in 1958 will

be  of the order of $62 million which is approximately

the  same  as the total of development expenditure  in

1957.  The  largest item of expenditure  is  Singapore

Improvement  Trust  housing  which  accounts  for  $21

million  compared with $8 million in 1955, $9  million

in 1956, and $18 million in 1957. The final instalment

of the loan to the Singapore Telephone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



Board amounts to $5 million. Works and buildings  have

cost $21.4 million and the balance has been devoted to

Special   Development  Expenditure.   To   meet   this

expenditure,  the  resources of the  Development  Fund

have  totalled  $49 million. In this  connection,  the

balance of the Development Fund carried over from 1957

was  over-estimated by $16 million. This was due to  a

rapid  and unforeseen increase in expenditure  between

the  time when the estimates were drawn up and the end

of the year. There is therefore likely to be a deficit

of  the  order of $13 million in the Development  Fund

which will have to be charged to reserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year should therefore end with revenue and

expenditure balanced, with a deficit of $13 million in

the Development Fund, and a charge of about $4 million

in  respect  of Malayanisation Compensation,  both  of

which  will  have to be met from reserve. The  general

revenue balance, which stood at $78 million at the end

of  1957,  will stand at about $83 million  after  $20

million has been added in respect of Christmas. Island

and allowance made for appreciation of investments  on

the one hand and deduction made for the deficit in the

Development  Fund and in respect of Malayanisation  on

the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally comforting is the fact that the recession now

appears  to be definitely on the wane. It seems  clear

that  the tide had already turned in the United States

by  the  time the worst effects of the recession  were

beginning to be felt in Singapore. It is also true  to

say that the recession has been "cushioned" as far  as

Singapore is concerned by the fact that the volume  of

rubber   handled,  and  its  price,  have  been   well

maintained throughout the year, and by the  fact  that

trade  with  Indonesia has remained good.  There  are,

however,  still one or two disquieting  features.  For

example,  the present state of the tin industry  gives

much cause for concern, although it is hoped that this

may  pick up in the second quarter of 1959. But on the

whole  it  looks as if the tide has definitely  turned

here  also  and  there is a reasonable hope  that  the

recession may be a thing of the past by the middle  of

next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us turn now to the Draft Estimates of Revenue and

Expenditure  for 1959. Revenue has been estimated,  on

the  basis  of  existing taxation, at $243.6  million.

Collections  under  Class I have, in  the  main,  been



estimated  on  the  basis  of  collections  in   1958.

Allowance  has  been  made for a  slight  increase  in



collections of entertainment duty due t, the fact that

some new cinemas will be in operation in 1959. It  has

been estimated that liquor duties will yield much  the

same  in  1958.  The consumption of  petrol  tends  to

increase  but  at a slower rate than in the  immediate

past and allowance has been made for a slight increase

in collections. The estimate for collections of income

tax  shows a decrease of $10 million compared with the

estimate  of  collections for 1958,  allowance  having

been  made  for  the  reduction of  earnings  of  some

companies  in  the  last  twelve  months.  The   total

estimate  for the Class is $185 million compared  with

an  original estimate of $196.8 million and a  revised

estimate of $191.8 million for 1958. The estimate  for

Class  II  at  $17.5 million shows an increase  of  $2

million  compared with the revised estimate for  1958.

allowance  having  been made for the  increased  yield



from  the  Education  Rate recently  approved  by  the

Assembly. It is estimated that collections under Class

III   will  be  maintained  at  about  the  level   of

collections in 1958. The estimate for Class IV shows a

reduction of $2.2 million compared with 1958 due to  a

reduction  in the estimate for interest on investments

and  loans.  This  however is  counterbalanced  by  an

increase  of  $2.4  million under Class  V,  it  being

expected  that  profits from the  currency  fund  will

exceed the share received in 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates of expenditure for 1959 total $268.5

million  compared with $277 million in 1958.  If  hon.

Members will look at the table which appears on page 5

of  the  Memorandum which accompanied  the  Estimates,

they  will  see that the estimate of expenditure  each

year  has  tended to exceed, sometimes by considerable

amounts, the estimate for the previous years. I  think

that it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



be agreed that it is a considerable achievement on the

part  of  all officers responsible for the preparation

of  departmental estimates to have managed to keep the

estimate  for  1959 not only within, but  considerably

below,  that for 1958. It has been achieved by a  most

meticulous  examination  of  all  proposals;  by  more

realistic   estimating  of  expenditure  on   personal

emoluments   in  the  case  of  the  larger   spending

departments:  by insisting that, as far  as  possible,

all  existing  vacancies should be filled  before  new

posts  are created; by measuring demands for new posts

and  additional recurrent expenditure against services

which  will  actually  come into  being  in  1959;  by

keeping  to a minimum the number of recruits necessary

to  maintain  the pipe line in Education;  by  cutting

provision  for recurrent expenditure to the bone;  and

by   being  quite  ruthless  about  items  of  special

expenditure  which were not absolutely  imperative.  I

feel  sure  that  hon.  Members will  find  cause  for

considerable  satisfaction in the results  which  have

been achieved by these measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time I must make it clear that, while it

has  been possible to keep the estimate of expenditure

well  within the limits of the 1958 provision, it must

not be expected that actual expenditure can be limited

in  the  same  way.  An  increase  in  expenditure  is

inevitable.  A  glance at the table which  appears  on

page  13  of the Estimates will show how it  tends  to

increase,  department  by department,  each  year.  An

increase  over 1958 levels must be expected  in  1959.

Increments  under  approved  schemes  must  be   paid;



vacancies in essential posts must be filled;  recruits

hitherto   lacking   will  almost   certainly   become

available;  and there is of course the ever increasing

recurrent expenditure on Education arising out of  the

policy  approved by the All Party Committee  in  1955.

But the action taken in connection with the 1959 Draft



Estimates  will  mean  that the rate  of  increase  is

slowed  down, and the great point, of course, is  that

the  ceiling or limit of possible expenditure has been

lowered very considerably.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the format of the estimates is concerned,

there  has  been  only one major change,  namely,  the

creation  of  a  separate Head for District  Councils.

Another  change  is  the disappearance  of  the  Royal



Malayan  Navy,  it  having  been  transferred  to  the

Federation  of Malaya. As far as content is concerned,

there is little which is novel or new or likely to  be

contentious in the Draft Estimates. The only points of

this nature to which attention might be drawn are  the

creation of a Guard and Escort Unit absorbing the bulk

of the Special Constabulary under Police, the creation

of  a  section  for  Community  Recreation  under  the

Ministry  of  Labour  and  provision  in  respect   of

budgetary   deficits  and  scholarships  for   Nanyang

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate of expenditure on personal emoluments

totals  $114.9 million compared with $123  million  in

1958.  The action taken to achieve this reduction  has

already been described. New posts have been limited to

the  absolute minimum required to maintain  efficiency

and  to provide for new and expanding services. A list

of  the  new  posts entered for 1959 is given  in  the

appendix to the Memorandum which accompanied the Draft

Estimates.  The total of 885 compares  with  1,584  in

1956, 1,727 in 1957 and 1,723 in 1958. The list  does

not  include  the  posts required for  the  Guard  and

Escort  Unit, since the creation of this  Unit  merely

involves a switch of posts from Special Expenditure to

Personal Emoluments. The bulk of the new posts  appear

under  Police, where the Special Branch and the C.  I.

D, have  been  strengthened; under  Education,  where



provision  has  been  made to  maintain  a  supply  of

recruits for the training pipe line; and under Medical

where  provision  has  been  made  for  recruits   for

training  in various branches and for the staffing  of

the  Chronic Sick Hospital. As I have said, everything

possible  has been done to estimate realistically  the

sum   required  for  emoluments  in  1959.   In   this

connection, it will be noted that, in the case of some

departments - Education  and  Medical  in   particular - a

special reduction has been made to take account of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



hidden under-expenditure. The total provision is  $114

million  and  I  do not think that actual  expenditure

will fall very far short of this amount. There will no

longer be the savings under Personal Emoluments  which

have been a marked characteristic of previous years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate of expenditure under O.C.A.R. is $118

million compared with $111 million in 1958. Everything

possible  has been done to perpetuate the  substantial

economies effected in 1958 but these have been  offset

by  the  expansion of the Social Services and  by  the

increased  provision required for  District  Councils,

Public  Debt  and  Pensions.  For  example,  Education

requires a net increase of $4.6 million. The provision

for  Grants  in  aid  has risen  by  $2  million.  The

Polytechnic, which will be in full operation in  1959,

will  require  $1.7 million. The contribution  to  the

University of Malaya, which has been transferred  from

O.  C.  S.  E.,  will  amount to $2.676  million.  The

Medical  and Health Department requires $10.9  million

compared with $9.7 million in 1958. Provision for  the

Public  Debt  has  been increased by $1.1  million  to

provide  for charges in respect of the new loan  which

it  is  hoped  to float in 1959. Pensions  require  an

additional  $1.5  million. As far  as  expenditure  is

concerned, actual O.C.A.R. expenditure always tends to

approximate  to  the estimate and it is  doubtful  if

expenditure  in 1959 will fall very far short  of  the

estimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum provided for Special Expenditure is $35.3

million  of  which  $20 million is a  contribution  to

development. The main items of expenditure  have  been

indicated  in  the  Memorandum which  accompanied  the

Draft  Estimates. As will be seen from an  examination

of   the  Draft  Estimates,  the  Special  Expenditure

estimates have been drastically pruned. Taking  under-expenditure on the one hand and unforeseen revotes  on

the  other into account, it is considered that  actual

expenditure  in  1959  will be of  the  order  of  $33

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, if I may be allowed to hazard a guess as

to  what  actual  expenditure on the  basis  of  these

estimates is likely to be in 1959, I should  say  that

it will be of the order of $264 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position therefore is that, for 1959, we have

revenue   estimated   at  $243  million,   expenditure

estimated  at $264 million and a deficit  of  possibly

$21 million to be bridged by increased taxation. It is

proposed to bridge this gap by raising company tax and

the  rate of tax on non-resident individuals to 40 per

cent; to increase the rate of individual income tax on

all  chargeable  incomes of over  $4,000  with  a  new

maximum  of  50  per  cent on  chargeable  incomes  of

$50,000  and over; and to make certain adjustments  to

the  tobacco duty tariff. It is estimated  that  these

measures will yield about $21 million in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to company tax, it has been considered

for  some  time  that  an increase  in  the  rate  was

justified  but  circumstances have prevented  us  from

taking  action.  It  has  now  been  agreed  with  the

Federation Government that the rate of tax  should  be

increased  to 40 per cent and the Minister of  Finance

in  the  Federation is making an announcement to  this

effect today. This new rate will be effective from the

1st  of January. At the same time, it has been decided

to   increase   the   rate  of  tax  on   non-resident

individuals, trustees and executors to the same level.

In the past, it has been found desirable that the rate



of  tax on companies and non-resident individuals etc.

should be the same. A bill amending section 43 of  the



Income  Tax Ordinance in these respects will be tabled

today. It is estimated that these measures will  yield

$10 million in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to raise the rate of tax on

individual incomes on all chargeable incomes of $4,000

and  over, rising to a new maximum of 50 per  cent  on

incomes  of  $50,000 and over. A motion to  amend  the

Second Schedule of the Income Tax Ordinance will be in

the  hands of hon. Members this morning. The new  rate

of  tax is shown in the Schedule which is attached  to

the motion. A comparison of this new schedule with the

existing Second Schedule will indicate the changes  in

rate.  Chargeable  incomes of  under  $4,000  are  not

affected   by  the  change.  An  individual   with   a

chargeable income of $5,000 will have to pay $40 more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



than  he  does  at  present. A man with  a  chargeable

income  of  $7,000 will have to pay $60 more  than  he

does  at  present; a man with a chargeable  income  of

$15,000,  $300 more; a man with chargeable  income  of

$25,000, $800 more an so on. The new maximum is 50 per

cent  which  is  attached  to  chargeable  incomes  of

$50,000 and over. At this level, the increase  in  tax

will  be $3,800. A table showing the increases in  tax

at  various levels of chargeable income is attached to

the  motion which will be in the hands of hon. Members

today. The Federation Government cannot see its way to

take  similar action at the present time.  However,  I

can  say  that  the  Federation  Government  sees   no

objection,  from  the  point of  view  of  Pan-Malayan

income tax, to Singapore taking independent action  at

the present time. The fact that different rates of tax

on  individual  incomes  are being  used  in  the  two

territories   will   not  cause   any   administrative

inconvenience  or  difficulty. It  is  estimated  that

these  new  rates  which will be  effective  from  1st

January, 1959 will yield rather more than $5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to alter the tobacco duty

tariff.  The system of charging an ad valorem duty  on

the  c.i.f. price of certain brands of cigarettes  and

pipe  tobacco which was introduced in October has  not

worked  particularly well in practice.  It  has  given

rise  to  certain  anomalies and the  yield  has  been

disappointingly low. It has therefore been decided  to

revert  to the old system whereby duty was charged  on

weight  alone, and to increase the duty on most brands

of  imported cigarettes and pipe tobacco to the levels

which  have been maintained in the Federation for  the

past  five  years.  In revising the duty  on  imported

cigarettes,  a  distinction  has  been  made   between

cigarettes  with a tobacco content of less  than  2.32

lbs, per thousand sticks and cigarettes with a tobacco

content  of 2.32 lbs, a thousand sticks or more,  that

is,  between  cigarettes like Double Ace, Rough  Rider

and  Torchlight, and all other brands. The duty on the

former will remain at the present levels of $8.60 a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



pound  full and $8.10 a pound preferential  while  the

duty  on  the  latter  will be  raised  to  Federation

levels,  namely $10.50 a pound full and  $10  a  pound

preferential. This will mean that while  the  cost  of

the  poor man's smokes remains unchanged, the cost  of

the more expensive brands will go up by 5 cents for  a

packet   of  10  cigarettes.  The  price  of   locally

manufactured cigarettes will also remain unchanged  as

it  is  not proposed to raise the rate of duty on  cut

tobacco imported for local manufacture of machine-made

cigarettes  for the present at any rate. The  duty  on

all  brands  of  pipe  tobacco will  be  increased  to

Federation levels, that is $10.10 a pound full and $10

a  pound  preferential. These changes in  the  tobacco

tariff  took  effect at midnight last night  and  have

since been gazetted. A motion under section 11 of  the

Customs  Ordinance  will be debated  on  the  12th  of

December. The changes should yield about $5.5  million

in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These increases should yield a total of about $21

million  and should bring the total revenue collection

up  to $264 million. This approximates to the estimate

of  actual  expenditure which I have given  and  which

comes   within  $4  million  of  the  total  estimated

expenditure  of  $268 million which is  shown  in  the

Draft  Estimates.  In short, we have  come  within  $4

million of balancing the budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates are shown on pages 431 to

459 in the volume of Draft Estimates. It will be noted

that,  in framing the Development Estimates, provision

has  only  been made for the completion of work  which

will  be  in hand at the end of this year, for  a  few

services  of a recurring nature, for one  or  two  new

projects  which  are regarded of such importance  that

they  must  go  on, and for an entirely  new  project,

unemployment  relief works. Estimated  expenditure  on

these  services amounts to $42 million and it will  be

financed  by  a  contribution  of  $20  million   from

revenue, by the repayment instalments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



of long term loans due in 1959, by  a  small

contribution  from C.D.W. fund for the  completion  of

schemes  in progress, and by further appropriation  of

$18.5 million from surplus funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons which have persuaded the Government to

prepare  development estimates of  this  comparatively

limited scope are three-fold. In the first place,  the

Draft Estimates as now drawn up represent the limit of

what  can  be  financed with safety and  certainty  in

1959.  In the second place, from now on we shall  have

to  rely  to  a  great  extent  on  loans  to  finance

development  and  it  is impossible  to  say  at  this

juncture  with  any degree of certainty - certainly  not

that  degree of certainty which would justify entering

into specific expenditure commitments - when we shall be

able to float a loan, what amount we shall obtain, and

at  what rate subscriptions will come in. In the third

place,  it is considered only fair that the  hands  of

the  incoming Government should not be tied in advance

but  that it should be given a reasonably clear  field

to  implement its own ideas in respect of  new  works,

within the limits of funds likely to be available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the first reason, this is really a

question  of  the extent to which we can make  further

calls on reserves to finance development. It would  be

dangerous  to  allow our reserves to be run  down  too

far. We must safeguard ourselves against the financial

consequences of a severe recession in trade;  we  must

retain enough to finance public works as a measure  of

unemployment relief in time of depression; we must  be

able to meet all unforeseen contingencies; and we must

at all times have sufficient to serve as a revenue and

expenditure equalisation reserve. I should not like to

see our general revenue balance reduced much below $65

million  at  the  present time.  Our  general  revenue

balance  at the end of 1958 should be of the order  of

$83  million  and  we can perhaps  afford  to  make  a

further  and  final  allocation of  $18  million  from

reserves to development. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



allocation, in addition to an allocation from  revenue

of  $20 million and sums resulting from the payment of

loans,  will  enable  us to finance  with  safety  and

certainty   the  programme  outlined  in   the   Draft

Estimates in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second reason, namely the fact

that development will in the future have to rely to  a

great extent on loan finance and that the prospects of

loan floatation in the future are uncertain, there are

a number of points on which I should like to touch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, the question of reliance on loan

finance  in the future. Over the past four  years,  we

have  spent  an  average  of $55  million  a  year  on

development.   It   has  been   spent   on   essential

development - on housing on which $56 million  has  been

spent  in providing 9,000 living units, on schools  of

which  we  have  provided  68  primary  and  secondary

schools, on medical facilities, on communications  and

rural  development. Part of this expenditure has  been

met from substantial annual contributions from revenue

and  the balance has been met from reserves which have

accumulated  as  a  result  of  the  prosperity  which

Singapore  has  experienced since the  war.  It  seems

likely  that  the demands of Singapore for development

will  continue on much the same scale.  One  does  not

have  to look beyond the growth of population for  the

reason.  It  is  hoped - indeed it is essential - that  it

will  continue to be possible to finance a substantial

part  of development from revenue. But this will  only

go  a  part  of  the way to meet the total  bill.  The

greater part will have to be financed from loans.  And

the total available from all sources will not meet all

demands.  There will have to be a strict  planning  of

priorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as regards the raising of loans, it must be

confessed that the prospects seem to be becoming  less

and less bright. Looking back over the years since the

war,  Singapore has had a quite astonishing record  as

far  as  loan  floatation is concerned. In  1946,  the

Government  raised a $50 million rehabilitation  loan.

Since  that  date,  the  City Council,  excluding  the



present  loan,  has  raised  7  loans  totalling  $220

million in all. I doubt if any territory of comparable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



size  has anything like this record. It speaks volumes

for  the prosperity and stability of Singapore and for

the  external reputation of the business acumen of its

citizens and the soundness of its administration.  But

the   fact  of  the  matter  is  that  it  has  become

increasingly  difficult to float loans over  the  past

four years. In the first place, in a period of general

inflation, there is an increasing reluctance to tie up

large  sums  in long term low interest bearing  loans.

Secondly,  money has become increasingly  tighter  and



the banks and other bodies which subscribed handsomely

to loans in the past have no longer the same resources

to  do  so.  Thirdly, a large number  of  the  private

provident funds which invested in Government and  City

Council  loans  in  the past have  been  wound  up  or

reduced in scope. Fourthly, there is the disability of

the  lack of an active local market for Government and

City  Council  stocks. Lastly, with so much  political

change  and  uncertainty  in the  air,  investors  are

unwilling  to  commit large sums until  they  see  how

things  are going to develop. The net result is  that,

at   the   present  time,  with  one  or  two  notable

exceptions,  the Central Provident Fund is practically

the  sole  contributor to local loans. In  short,  the

prospects of raising loans are not particularly bright

at  the  moment. Nor do I think that they will improve

until  uncertainty is removed from the political scene

and  investors  are satisfied that  the  attitude  and

policies of the Government in power in the future  are

likely to be such that the investment of large sums on

long  term is safe. In short, one cannot say with  any

degree  of  certainty how much it will be possible  to

raise  by  way  of  loan in 1959 and  1960.  In  these

circumstances,  the  Government  is  not   unnaturally

reluctant  to enter into any commitments  which  would

have to be met from loans until it is clearer just how

much  can actually be expected, and when and  at  what

rate the  funds are likely to become available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there are certain factors about the

immediate  future  which perhaps alleviate  the  gloom

which I may possibly have spread. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



think  that the Central Provident Fund can be  counted

upon  to support a Government loan, Secondly, the 1940

War  Loan is due for redemption in October, 1959  and,

if  suitable terms are offered, it may be possible  to

persuade holders of this stock to convert into  a  new

loan. In this connection, consideration might possibly

be  given  to a conversion issue on the lines  of  the

recent  Australian conversion issue. Thirdly, I  think

that  it  is  probable that, if the  revision  of  the

existing  Currency Agreement between  the  Federation,

the  Borneo  and the Singapore Governments at  present

under discussion goes through, the Currency Board  may

be  prepared  to  invest a certain percentage  of  the

Currency  Fund in a Singapore Government loan,  taking

care  of course that adequate backing for the currency

is  maintained. But these are all to a certain  extent

uncertain  factors.  Whether they materialise  or  not

will  depend  to  a  large  extent  on  the  political

climate,  and  on  the  acts  as  distinct  from   the

protestations of the Government in power at the  time.

Lastly it is considered desirable to give the incoming



Government as clear a field as possible in  the  field

of  new development and not to tie its hands more than

necessary  with  heavy  commitments  from  the   past.

Development  projects  are costly  and  even  a  small



number  of them demand large sums over a comparatively

long  period. It is probable that the funds  available

for  development  in the future will be  more  limited

than  in  the  past.  It will be necessary  to  assess

priorities  and  plan  expenditure  with  great  care.

Thoughts may change about the emphasis which should be



placed  on  the different branches of development  and

about the standards which should be achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development estimates, drawn up with the limited

scope  the reason for which I have described,  provide

for  expenditure of $42 million of which $20.8 million

is  Special Development expenditure and $21.2  million

Public   Works   Non   Recurrent   expenditure.   This

expenditure  compares with actual expenditure  of  $48

million  in 1955, $50 million in 1956, $62 million  in

1957 and an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



estimated  $62  million in 1958. As  I  said  earlier,

provision is made in the main for completion  of  work

actually  in hand at the end of the year. $700,000  is

provided  for  the completion of schemes for  quarters

for  the  Police  now  in hand principally  at  Duxton

Plain.   $1.4  million  has  been  provided  for   the

Reformative Training Centre or Borstal institution  at

Changi which will meet a pressing need. $7 million has

been  provided  for  the  further  implementation   of

schemes  under Programmes 6, 7 and 8 by the  Singapore

Improvement Trust, and $340,000 has been provided  for

a  Malay  Resettlement Housing Scheme, the details  of

which  the  Minister  will, I am  sure,  be  happy  to

describe.  $2.2  million has  been  provided  for  the

continuation of work in hand in the rural  areas.  The

provision  compares  with actual expenditure  of  $2.8

million  in  1956, $3.8 million in 1957 and  estimated

expenditure  of  $3.6 million 1958. A  total  of  $8.2

million has been provided for Education. Of this  $2.5

million refers to special expenditure and $5.3 million

to  capital works. Capital grants to schools have been

limited to revotes of sums voted in 1958 but not taken

up.   $4.4   million   has  been  provided   for   the

construction  of  primary  and  secondary  schools  in

completion of programmes now in hand. $1.4 million has

been  provided for the Raffles National Library  which

will  be  completed in 1960. Under Medical, the  first

half  of  a contribution of $850,000 is made  for  the

construction  of  a Hospital at Mt.  Alvernia  by  the

Franciscan  Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood.  In

addition     to    providing    additional    hospital

accommodation, this will provide much needed  training

facilities for nurses. $5 million is provided for  the

completion of capital works in hospitals. Under  Civil

Aviation,  $800,000  is  provided  for  work  on   the

operational  building  at the airport  which  will  be

completed in 1960 and $1.6 million for further work on

the airport itself. $2 million is provided for further

expansion  of the revenue producing telecommunications

services.  $3.3  million  is provided  under  P.W.N.R.

(General) of which over $1 million refers to flood



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



relief  measures  and  $1.5 million  for  unemployment

relief  works,  which  will  take  the  form  of  road

development in rural areas and the necessary extension

of the Airport runway to cater for jet aircraft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, expenditure on works and buildings is

estimated   at  $21.2  million  which  compares   with

expenditure  of  $21 million in 1955, $22  million  in

1956,  $21  million  in 1957 and  an  estimated  $21.4

million  in  1958.  It should be  sufficient  to  keep

contractors and their labour employed at least until a

supplementary programme is drawn up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Special Expenditure, $7 million is provided for

further  work  by  the  Singapore  Improvement   Trust

compared with an expenditure of $8 million in 1955, $9

million  in 1956, $18 million in 1957 and an estimated

$21 million in 1958. Housing must have a high priority

in  whatever development plans are implemented in  the

future,  and  the next Government will no  doubt  give

consideration to this matter as soon as possible after

it  comes  to power. At the same time, it  is  thought

that  it  will  have to be accepted that,  in  future,

fewer housing units can be built each year than in the

recent  past.  The fact of the matter is that,  having

regard  to the competing claims of schools, hospitals,

clinics  and other similar works and to the amount  of

money likely to be available for them, it will not  be

possible  to make as much money available for  housing

as  it  has  been  in the past. I do  not  think  that

anybody  could  reasonably expect that expenditure  on

housing  should  be maintained at the average  of  $20

million of the past two years. A more likely figure is

perhaps $10 million which is nearer the average of the

years preceding 1957 and 1958. It may be said that the

answer  is  to reduce standards, that in the  past  we

have  built too well. But I beg leave to doubt if very

much  can be achieved in this direction. I think  that

it will be generally agreed that Singapore improvement

Trust costs are as low as they can possibly be for the

type of accommodation which is produced. Something can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



possibly  be  achieved  in the direction  of  one-room

flatlets - a  development  of  the  Hongkong  idea.  The

Government   has  been  working  on  this  complicated

problem  for  some  time.  Again,  something  may   be

achieved  by decentralising housing and building  more

in  rural  areas  where  land  is  cheaper  and  semi-permanent   accommodation  can  be  built  with   less

objection.  This  is  also  a  problem  on  which  the

Government   has  been  working  but   it   also   has

difficulties of its own. Something may be achieved  in

these  directions  to  make  the  funds  available  go

further  in terms of housing units but it is  doubtful

if  it can be substantial. In short, unless the amount

of   loan   money  obtained  in  the  future   exceeds

expectations, we must reconcile ourselves  to  a  more

restricted housing programme than has been achieved in

the  past.  On  the  other hand, we  can  congratulate

ourselves  that  we have been able to  build  so  many

units  of  such good quality as we have  done  in  the

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may possibly be suggested that this limited

development  programme  will  lead  to  a  hiatus   in

development, that plans will not be ready when a  loan

has  been  successfully floated and the new Government

wishes  to  go ahead. This is not the case. Plans  now

exist,  or are in course of preparation, for  a  large

number  of  the items to which the present  Government

attached  a  high  priority and  which  have  hitherto

appeared  in the Estimates with a token vote  awaiting

their  turn  to  be  brought  forward.  Planning  will

continue  and, in so far as the new Government  wishes

to  proceed  with  projects of its predecessor,  there

should   be   no   delay.  Similarly,  the   Singapore

Improvement Trust can go ahead when given the word  to

the  limit of the funds which the Government considers

can  be  made available for housing in the future.  As

far  as volume of work and employment is concerned,  I

think that the Draft Estimates provide enough to  keep

the   building   and  allied  trades   going   for   a

considerable time. Overall, in terms of dollars and on

the  basis  of  past performance, we are providing  in

this limited development budget for at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



least two-thirds of what has in the past been a normal

year's  expenditure, and this should keep the  various

branches of the building industry going until the  new

Government  has  had  an  opportunity  to  frame   its

supplementary development budget in the light  of  its

declared   policies  and  the  funds  likely   to   be

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to

review  the record of the Government in the  financial

field. When the Government assumed office in 1955,  it

inherited  a financial position which was very  sound.

The  public debt was small. Reserves were substantial.



The  out-turn  for each year had shown  a  substantial



surplus.  At  the  same  time,  the  future  presented

certain  problems.  Expenditure, particularly  on  the

social  services, was mounting and revenue had  to  be

increased to meet it. Expenditure had to be kept under

strict  control. Care had to be taken that accumulated

reserves were not squandered in the implementation  of

development  plans.  These  problems  have  all   been

successfully  solved.  Revenue  has  been   increased.

Expenditure  has been kept under control.  Accumulated



funds  have been used to best advantage. Now,  on  the

eve of the end of its term of office, the position  is

still  very  sound. The public debt remains  unchanged

and  adequate provision continues to be made  for  its

redemption.  Basic reserves are adequate.  The  budget

has  been  virtually balanced. A great deal  has  been

achieved  in  the  way  of development.  Security  and

confidence  in  Singapore as one of the  main  trading

centres of the world have been maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During its period of office, the Government has

increased revenue from a total of $207 million in 1954

to  an  estimated total of $264 million  in  1959,  an

increase  of  27  per cent. Company tax,  income  tax,

estate  duty, customs duties on tobacco,  liquors  and

petrol,  stamp duty, totalisator duty, driving licence

fees  and  initial registration fees on cars have  all

been   increased,   and  other  measures   have   been

introduced.

The increases have been achieved within the pattern of

taxation  to which the population has been accustomed.

Nothing  has  been  done  to  upset  the  economy   of



Singapore.  The  incidence of  taxation  has  been  in

strict  proportion to capacity to pay and no  hardship

has been caused to anyone. The increases have not been

uniformly popular. It was not expected that they would

be.  But  the  Government has not been concerned  with

popularity in these matters. It has merely  done  what

was required to make income meet expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure has increased, particularly in the social

services. It has risen from a total of $197 million in

1954  to  an estimated total of $264 million in  1959.

Expenditure on Education has risen from $30 million in



1954 to an estimate of $63 million in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on Medical and Health has risen from $20

million in 1954 to an estimate of $34 million in 1959.

Expenditure  on  Social  Welfare  has  risen  from  $7



million  to  $11  million over the  same  period.  But

expenditure has always been kept under strict control.

It  has  never  been allowed to get out of  hand.  The



pressures  which were inevitable on the first  elected

government to spend lavishly on vote-catching projects

have  always been strenuously resisted. Provision  has

been   made  for  services  which  were  regarded   as

essential.  Extravagance and waste have  been  rigidly

suppressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these measures, the Government has

been  able to pay its way. Now, at the end of its term

of  office,  it has managed to present a budget  which

comes  within  $4 million of being balanced.  This,  I

think, is a most notable achievement in every respect.

A balanced budget is essential for financial viability



and  the maintenance of confidence in Singapore  as  a

major trading centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of development, the achievements of the

Government have been equally impressive. In all,  $223

million  has been spent on development, including  $56

million on housing and $85 million on other works  and

buildings. In the field of public housing,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



over  9,000  units and 300 shops will have been  built

within the lifetime of the Government, out of a  total

of  just  over 20,000. In the field of Education,  the

Polytechnic  has  been  completed  and  will   provide

advanced  technical education for 4,000  students.  59

primary  and 9 secondary schools have been built.  The

total  school population has increased by 66 per  cent

during  the lifetime of the government and  there  are

now  over 300.000 pupils in all categories of schools.

A  new  Teachers Training College has been  built  and



training   facilities,  particularly  for   vernacular

school teachers, have been greatly increased. In 1958,

2,300 teachers were in training compared with 1,760 in

1954. In the Medical field, considerable additions and

improvements  have  been made to  hospitals,  and  bed

accommodation has risen from 4,500 in 1954 to 6,500 in

1958,  an increase of 44 per cent. In the near future,

the  new  hospital  for the chronic sick  and  further

accommodation at Kandang Kerbau will be opened, and  a

further  525  beds will be available, making  a  total

increase  of 55 per cent. Outpatient Departments  have

increased  from 4 to 14 and 6 more will be  opened  in

1959.  The  number  of  Maternity  and  Child  Welfare

Clinics  has  risen from 44 to 60.  In  the  field  of

communications generally, the International Airport is

in  operation,  the Merdeka Bridge and Nicoll  Highway

have  been completed, 9 miles of dual carriage-way  in

the  Bukit Timah road have been finished. 35 miles  of

other  metalled roads have been brought into use,  and

80  miles  of  earth roads in rural  areas  have  been

constructed  in the last year. 6 new post offices  and

22  new  postal agencies have been opened and  84  new

letter boxes have been installed. Some $12 million has

been spent on rural development over the past 4 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remarkable progress has been made in the sphere of

animal husbandry. Based on the new stations at Lim Chu

Kang   and   Sembawang,  teams   of   veterinary   and

agricultural officers have brought extension  services

to  the kampongs. As a result, the pig population  has

been  increased  from 287,000 in 1954  to  450,000  in

1958,  and  the poultry population from 5  million  to

about 24



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



million  over  the  same period. In  1958,  6  million

chickens were inoculated against disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of industrial development, an Industrial

Promotions  Board  has  been established,  legislation

giving  tax relief to selected industries  is  in  the

process  of being introduced, arrangements  are  being

made for the protection of selected industries, and  a

"Buy  Singapore" campaign is about to  be  started.  A

Tourist Promotion Bureau has been established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations are at present in progress with the

Governments  of  the  Federation of  Malaya,  Sarawak,

North Borneo and Brunei for a revision of the existing

Currency Agreement which, if successful, will maintain

the  Currency  Commission in  being  and  the  Malayan

dollar  in  circulation for a  period  of  years,  and

enable the Currency Commission to invest a portion  of

the Currency Fund in local government stocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the record of the present Government in the

financial  field. It is one of which a  first  elected

government in any country might well be proud.  It  is

the   outcome   of   the  courage,   moderation,   and

commonsense    which   have   been   the   outstanding

characteristics  of  the  elected   Members   of   the

Government with whom it has been the privilege of  ex-officio Members to be associated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incoming government will continue to face many

problems  in  the financial and economic field.  These

problems    will    require   for    their    solution

statesmanship,  an appreciation of the  importance  of

issues  wider  than  local  party  politics,   and   a

realisation   of  the  need  to  maintain  confidence,

internally and externally, in Singapore as a centre of

finance,   shipping,  communications  and   trade   of

international importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem will be to reach an understanding

with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in the

field   of  monetary,  fiscal  and  economic   policy.

Fortunately,  the  wisdom and  farsightedness  of  the



Government of the Federation in agreeing to  remain  a

party  to the existing Currency Agreement, subject  to

certain    amendments   which   should   present    no

difficulties to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



other  parties,  and to continue to use  the  existing

Malayan  dollar  for the time being, has  given  us  a

period  of grace in which to reach agreement on  these

matters.  For  agreement there must be. In  my  humble

opinion, while an integrated Pan-Malayan economy would

be  to the incalculable advantage of both territories,

Singapore  has  no satisfactory future unless  she  is

associated  in  the  closest  possible  way  fiscally,

financially and economically with the Federation.  All

possible efforts must be directed over the next two or

three years to achieving this association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem will be to raise revenue to meet

mounting  expenditure. I do not say that the  measures

which  the  Government have introduced have  exhausted

the  taxation  potential of Singapore. But  they  have

gone a considerable way towards doing so, and the  new

Government  will  be considerably  exercised  to  find

means of taxation which will not weigh penally on  any

particular  section  of  the  community  or   business

interests  in  Singapore,  which  will  not  harm  the

economy, and which at the same time will fit into  the

Pan-Malayan fiscal scheme which it must be its aim  to

achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mounting expenditure on the social services,

particularly education, will be a major problem facing

the  new Government. Each year 50,000 children  demand

education  in  primary schools. This  demand  requires

more  schools, more equipment, and more  teachers.  In

addition,  there are heavy and increasing  commitments

in  the field of higher education. Statistics for  the

past  four  years suggest that the recurrent  cost  of

education  will  increase by at least  $10  million  a

year,  and possibly more, in the future. Having regard

to  the  difficulties of raising revenue, to the  fact

that  recurrent  expenditure on  other  services  will

inevitably increase, it will clearly be difficult,  if

not  impossible, to meet a bill for education of  this

magnitude.  It  is clear that means will  have  to  be

found to reduce it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major problem will be the question of

planning development in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



years   to  come.  I  have  already  touched  on   the

difficulties  which are likely to  be  experienced  in

raising loans in the future and on the need to  pursue

policies,  not  only in the central but  also  in  the

local  government  which will  commend  themselves  to

would-be  investors.  I  have also  at  various  times

stressed   the   necessity  of  continuing   to   make

substantial  annual  contributions  from  revenue   to

development. At the same time, even allowing  for  the

creation of the most favourable climate for investment

and  for  the most substantial contributions from  the

revenues of all interested authorities, it seems  more

than probable that demands for development expenditure

by  central and local government authorities will  far

outstrip  the capacity of these authorities  to  raise

funds, that development will have to be planned on  an

island-wide  basis  with  the  strictest  regard   for

priorities,  and that development expenditure  in  the

future  will  have  to be on a greatly  reduced  scale

compared  with  what it has been in the  past  decade.

This  will  not  be  an easy task. Each  claimant  for



funds,  whether  it  be the Minister  for  Housing  in

respect  of  public  housing,  or  the  Minister   for

Education  in respect of schools or higher educational

facilities, or the Minister for Health in  respect  of

hospital  beds  and  clinics, or the  City  Electrical

Engineer  in respect of power or light, or the  Health

authorities  in respect of sewage, will consider  that

his  claim  is more important than all the others.  It

will  be  an  exceedingly difficult task  to  allocate

priorities amongst the various claimants and  to  draw

up  plans  for  some years ahead in the light  of  the

funds  likely  to be available. The task  of  deciding

priorities  and  how much should be  devoted  to  each

priority  and  over what period is a  matter  for  the

Government   after  consultation  with   the   various

interests  concerned; but it is a  matter  which  will

demand  the greatest goodwill and co-operation in  the

interests  of  Singapore, and will call for  knowledge

and  ability of the highest order on the part  of  the

planning authorities. It is a task which will have  to

be  started as soon as possible. A certain  amount  of

ground work has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



done  but  progress has been held up by  the  lack  of

suitably  qualified  and experienced  staff  with  the

necessary time at its disposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, difficult though they undoubtedly

are,  I  do  not think that any of these problems  are

insoluble. Given goodwill, wisdom, commonsense and  an

appreciation of the broader issues involved, I am sure

that  the Government which comes into power after  the

next election will find solutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I should like to pay a tribute to the

Treasury  officials who have prepared this budget  for

1959. They have worked with exceptional diligence  for

very  long hours over a very difficult task and I  owe

them a deep debt of gratitude.

<div align="center"><b>NANYANG UNIVERSITY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Nanyang University Bill before  this

House  today is a new milestone in Chinese  education.

When  Nanyang University was established in  1954,  it



was  a  private  institution that aimed  at  providing

higher education in Chinese. Chinese education was not

the  concern of the Government at the time because  it

was not part of the Government educational programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from giving partial aid to Chinese schools, the

Government then was not committed to Chinese education

in any way. Nanyang University



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



proceeded  under its own steam from  the  day  of  its

registration as a limited company providing courses of

study  in Arts, Science and Commerce, entirely on  its

own.  There was no consultation between them  and  the

Department of Education before the introduction of the

Ministerial  form of Government and later  on  between

them  and  the Ministry of Education. Such a state  of

affairs   was   clearly  unsatisfactory   and   indeed

undesirable  because,  unless  the  University  had  a

system  and  courses of study that can fit  themselves

into  the  local pattern of education,  the  graduates

will  find  very  little outlet after they  have  gone

through the portals of the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October, 1956, when the Government committed

itself  to  Chinese  education  with  the  opening  of

Government  Chinese  schools  as  a  result   of   the

students'  unrest,  the chance had come  for  bringing

Nanyang  University into the whole educational  set-up

in   Singapore.   Because  Nanyang   University,   was

essentially a private institution, it is natural  that

to  bring it into the setup it must meet with  various

difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say that the time had come to bring Nanyang

University  into  the  whole  educational  set-up   in

Singapore, I do not mean that Nanyang University would

be   a   Government  institution  or  even  Government

sponsored,  but  it  would  be  an  institution   with

Government  representation so as to make certain  that

Government's views are brought to the attention of the

people who run it and vice versa, and so that it  will

not  develop into a foreign university. Can we imagine

a  university in Singapore providing education for our

children under a system foreign to ours?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that this Bill has come very closely upon

the  recent Government decision to give financial  aid

to  Nanyang University. What better evidence can there

be  of the sincere desires of both the University  and

the  Government  to see that hereafter the  University

should  form part of the educational system. Also  the

appointment  of a Commission to examine the  standards

of Nanyang University should clear the doubts of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



people  once  and  for all whether  both  parties  are

determined  to  see  that the  academic  standards  of

Nanyang  University are adequate  and  worthy  of  its

name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission is expected to assemble some time in

February next year and it is my earnest hope that  the

Commission will be able to accomplish its task  within

the  time  set  for it. Meanwhile I  hope  that  those

persons who are now responsible for the academic  work

and administration in the University will maintain the

highest standards possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Bill itself, I want to draw Members'

attention   to  the  cardinal  principle,   that   the

administrative and the academic must remain  separate.

For the administration of the University, clause 19 of



the  Bill provides for a University Council consisting

of  the  President of the University and  twenty-seven

other members. Three of the twenty-seven members  will

be  Government nominees, two members from  Members  of

the  Senate,  two members from the Guild of  Graduates

when  there is one, and the rest elected from  members

of the University. The membership of the University is

a special feature in the Bill because many people have

contributed  various sums of money to  the  University

when  it was established in 1954, and obviously  these

benefactors cannot be forgotten with the incorporation

of the University under the law of Singapore. Clause 8

of the Bill provides for this membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 of the Bill provides for a University

Senate  who will be responsible for academic  matters.

Looking further ahead we have provided for a Guild  of



Graduates under clause 25.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 provides for a Council. In the Council, the

members  will  be elected for a period  of  two  years

consisting  of the Chairman (elected), a Vice-Chairman

(elected),  the President, who shall be the  executive

and  academic  officer of the University  and  also  a

member  of every Committee. The President is  actually

equivalent to the Vice-Chancellor and, in addition, we

will  have a Secretary appointed by the Council and  a

Treasurer who may be a salaried officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the main features of the Bill before the

House and the rest is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



matter  of detail. The subject of this Bill is one  of

public concern and it will be necessary to consider it

more fully in Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you have rightly ruled that this is a hybrid

Bill and I shall move at the end of the Second Reading

that  this Bill be committed to Select Committee,  and

in  Select  Committee I propose also to  make  certain

amendments  to  the  Bill one of  which  will  be  the

addition  of some provision for the setting  up  of  a

Students' Union in the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.54 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

Nanyang  University was created as a  private  limited

company, but when this Bill is passed by the Assembly,

it  will  be  incorporated as  a  public  institution,

having as it were come of age. It is befitting that on

coming of age it should be recognised by Government by

having  three  members  of its Council  of  Management

nominated  by  the Council of Ministers and  having  a

grant  of  $854,000  for current expenses  and  future

bursaries.  This  grant, Sir, I  am  sure  is  only  a

beginning   and  when  the  University  enlarges   its

activities,  larger  grants  will  be  made.   Nanyang

University has filled a gap in our educational  system

by  providing post-graduate education for our children

who have attended Chinese schools; because, until this

University  started, there was no place for  them  for

further studies unless they left for foreign shores.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure, Sir, that Nanyang University and

the University of Malaya will in the future provide

most of the men we require to run the very complex

business of self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to thank the founders and generous

donors for their courage and foresight in providing

such an institution to fill a very vital need for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heartily support this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.57 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, despite the

gloomy political and economic picture during the  last

few  months,  this is a very beneficial  move  by  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I extend my hearty congratulations to the Government,

especially to the Minister for Education, for  finally

launching this important Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not only going to support the speech just

delivered by the Member for Paya Lebar who extends his

thanks to the founders of the University, but I  would

also  call  upon  this House to place  on  record  the

beneficient  gesture  and the  courage  shown  by  the

founders  of  the Nanyang University, and particularly

the support of the taxi-drivers, trisha-riders, coffee-shop assistants and amahs who have contributed to make

Nanyang University possible. I would also like to call

upon  this House to recognise the fact that this  Bill

is  of  significant importance. I expect it  will  not

only meet with popular support but will also meet with

unanimous approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Nanyang University is the result of a movement

which has proved that our people are able and prepared

to accept the challenge of the future, irrespective of

race,  culture and religion - a movement with  a  united

force.  I  particularly appeal to Malayan  readers  to

realise   this,  no  matter  what  barrier  has   been

created - Malayan  Malays  and  Malayan   Chinese.   The

creation of Nanyang University has sown certain doubts

and fears particularly among the Malay community. Sir,

I  think  this  is  now  the opportunity  for  Malayan

leaders  to  speak their minds on what they  think  of

Nanyang  University. What do they think  of  the  mass

support  given  to this University, and  what  is  the

importance of this University in the future?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is high time for all the

communities,  not only the Malays, to  recognise  that

Nanyang  University belongs to the people of Singapore

as  well  as Malaya. Judging by the number of students

attending the University today, more than 60 per  cent

of them come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



from   the  Federation,  it  is  therefore  a  clearly

accepted  fact  that  local  consciousness  and  local

loyalty  and  even  the building of a  greater  Malaya

exist in their hearts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that from this year a Malay Department

will  be  set  up in Nanyang University.  I  ask  hon.

Members  to consider whether this should be encouraged

and,  if  so,  whether  it  should  be  enlarged   and

strengthened to cope with the political development in

this   country.  I  also  understand  that  an  Indian

Department is about to be launched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is obvious that Nanyang University is no

longer  confined to the Chinese community, because  it

is  already making an important contribution and is an

important asset to this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we learn from the Minister for Education that

this  Bill  is  going  to  be committed  to  a  Select

Committee,  and I will therefore not go  into  details

now.  But I wish to add a few important points. First,

is   it  possible  for  the  Singapore  Government  to

negotiate  with the Federation of Malaya to  recognise

the  importance and the nature of Nan-yang  University

and  to  give it not only their moral but  also  their

economic support?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, whether the Government of the Federation of

Malaya  and  the  Singapore  Government  can  give  an

assurance  that  Nanyang University  degrees  will  be

recognised in future?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would ask the Government to recognise

that,  although  they have made a subsidy  to  Nanyang

University,  this is but only a temporary measure  and

that a long-term economic aid policy will be drafted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I would urge the public to continue giving

its  support to Nanyang University and should  not  be

led  into  believing that, just because the Government

has  extended its support to the University,  its  own

support  should be stopped. I wish to place on  record

my statement that public support is not only important

but also necessary at this juncture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish the Minister for Education would

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

must  congratulate the founders of the University  who

have  had  a very trying time and who are now  nearing

success.  I have been to the University many  a  time,

and  I admire this fine institution and the work which

it is doing and will do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Members from this side of the House said

that  it should be a University for all races. Let  me

tell  him that there are quite a few Indians  who  are

full members and who were among the first to donate to

the founding of this institution. It is rather late in

the  day  for  this Government, now with  a  different

label,  to acknowledge and help, and help only with  a

paltry  sum.  I hope the future Government  will  give

this University its due place in the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I must remind those in charge of the

University is that they should not produce people  who

will  do  clerical jobs only. The time will come  very

soon when we will be free and independent, and what we

want   is   to  run  our  own  country.  The  colonial

period - 134  years  now - has  not  yet  produced  enough

people with required diplomas who could manage our own

affairs. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



is  only recently we have been trying to send students

to the universities abroad to get their diplomas.



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy of the

Government  is  to  provide equal  treatment  for  all

schools. Why cannot the Minister for Education  accord

to  Nanyang University the same treatment as is  given

to  the  University of Malaya? As we all know, Nanyang

University  came  into being through  the  efforts  of

certain  rich  merchants and  a  very  big  number  of

workers  of  all  types, who,  because  they  had  the

interest  of  Chinese education  of  this  country  at

heart,  voluntarily devoted their time  and  money  in

building Nanyang University in 1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University, established this year, will

provide  further  studies for those  students  leaving

Chinese  schools after they have passed Senior  Middle

School   examinations.   I   cannot   understand   why

Government  should  delay the recognition  of  degrees

from Nanyang University. The University should deserve

the fullest support from Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also remind the Minister for Education that

60  per  cent  of the students at present studying  in

Nanyang  University  are  from  the  Federation.   The

Government should therefore make an attempt to try and

get  financial support from the Federation Government.

If you look at the two Bills - one for the University of



Malaya  and the other for Nanyang University - you  will

see that there is discrimination. Why should there  be

discrimination? Even the Nanyang University Students'

Union,  a very important organ of the University,  has

been  left out of the Nanyang University Bill. Is  not

this  discrimination? Government, instead  of  showing

equal treatment for all the students of Singapore,  is

thinking  of  barring the students from forming  their

union.  The Minister for Education just said  that  he

will  amend  that clause. The students'  body  of  the

University  of  Malaya also raise their  objection  to

this omission. I think it is the concern of Government

that Nanyang University should be put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



under its wing, and grant-in-aid extended to it.



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

one   of  the  eleven  original  founders  of  Nanyang

University,  I thought I ought to rise,  not  only  to

support  the Government, but to thank it for  bringing

this Bill to the Assembly. I might perhaps also try to

clarify  some  of the misunderstandings about  Nanyang

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University was proposed at a time when the

founders  were  convinced that,  because  the  student

population in the Chinese schools was very much bigger

than  that in the English schools, they had a need  to

go out for higher studies. That need was not available

here,  in  view  of the state that the  University  of

Malaya  was in. They could not accept enough  students

so  as  to prevent them from being attracted to  China

and   other  overseas  territories  for  their  higher

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start, a lot of misunderstanding was created

and  there  was strong opposition to the establishment

of  this  University, because it was thought that  the

founding  of  Nanyang University would divert  private

donations from the University of Malaya; and secondly,

it  might create a divergence of loyalty. The founders

were  convinced that they would be helping the country

by  helping to absorb these surplus students for their

higher  education. I hope it is now fully proved  that

not only does it not divert the common loyalty, but it

is  also now taking in students whom the University of

Malaya  cannot  take, students in  fact  from  English

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common misunderstanding about Nanyang University

is perhaps this - as a Member has just mentioned - that it

is only for Chinese education. In fact, it is not. Any

student  of  Nanyang University must know English.  In

fact,  a lot of the subjects in the faculties have  to

be  taught in English - Science, Commerce and  so  on - so

that, in fact, it is at least a bilingual university.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was due to the unity of purpose of the founders

and  the  people  that  we have been  able  to  create

Nanyang  University. Last year, Sir,  professors  from

the United Kingdom who came over here and paid a visit

to   the   University  had  variously  estimated   the

buildings, hostels, the library, including  the  three

faculties, to cost round about $25 million when we had

actually spent about $6.8 million. I am still  one  of

the Treasurers of the University, and we know that the

cost  of this University would, in fact, be less  than

that  of  the  Polytechnic  which  the  Government  is

building.  Now  that  is one of the  misunderstandings

which  I  want to remove. It is not only a  university

for  Chinese learning. In fact, we already have  plans

to  teach Malay. All students, whether they be  Malay,

Indian, or even European would be equally welcome into

the   University.   We  hope   also   that   if   this

misunderstanding  is removed, the  Government  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya will realise, as the  Singapore

Government, I think has fully realised now, that it is

in  fact an undertaking on the same national basis  as

the  University  of  Malaya, and  will  give  it  more

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite recently, we had to debate whether an increase

in  fees  should be introduced next year. The fees  at

the  start  were $30. The original students still  pay

$30,  but for the students who joined last year,  they

will  have  to  pay  $60. For next year  it  has  been

proposed  that  this  fee,  in  order  to  cover   the

necessary expenditure, should be increased to $100 per

pupil.  It  is  quite  understandable  that  with  the

present   trade  recession  the  merchants   who   had

originally  undertaken to contribute very  large  sums

are  perhaps finding difficulty in doing so  now,  and

the  Government  of  Singapore  must  be  prepared  to

support  Nanyang  University to  a  very  much  larger

extent if it is to be kept going as it is now. I  also

hope  the  Federation Government will fully understand

the  purposes of the University, and in time also give

their support to it, since it has been pointed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



out  that over 60 per cent of the students in  Nanyang

University are from the Federation.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

was  somewhat  disturbed to hear  the  speech  of  the

Malays in connection with the Nanyang University  Bill

which was introduced by the Minister for Education.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> To my mind, Sir, I think that this

is  a  dangerous  and  deliberate  attempt  to  foster

Sir,  from  the  Member  for Changi  is  this.  Is  he

insinuating that we, the Malays of Singapore, are anti-Nanyang  University? Is he trying to say that we,  the

Malays of Singapore, are anti-Chinese culture?

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, we, the Malays of Singapore,

are  anti  no  one except those who are dishonest  and

those who would stoop low enough to become stooges  of

a non-Malayan way of life and that, Sir, would include

those  who  are  disloyal to  this  country.  On  this

question,  we  the  Malays  of  Singapore  will  never

compromise. To make my point clear again, Sir, on this

question  of the Bill which Government has introduced,

I for my part and my Party support it fully.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with the

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order I think the hon. Member is going

beyond  the limit permitted by Standing Order  30  (4)

which merely says:

allegation  made by the Minister for Local Government,

singled  out  the Malays as anti-Chinese  culture  and

anti-Nanyang University. I only said that it  is  time

for  the  Malayan  leaders  to  open  their  eyes  and

contribute towards its success.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that all

the  speakers who have contributed to this debate were

aware   of   the  massive  demonstration  of   Chinese

enthusiasm  in support of Nanyang University  when  it

was  opened earlier this year. Today I think they  all

join  in  paying tribute to an institution which  they

all  know has the unquestioned support and loyalty and

which symbolises the determination and ambition of the

mass of the Chinese population throughout Malaya. Sir,

therefore it becomes a time when a few more votes  are

attempted at. I would like to take this opportunity to

say  how difficult it is for us to find a solution  to

our  long-term  problems unless we have our  political

leadership  willing,  able and courageous  enough,  to

face up to its problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one great difference between Nanyang

University  and the University of Malaya which  nobody

has pointed out, namely, when we passed the University

of  Malaya  Ordinance, there was  a  parallel  in  the

Federation.  There is none in the Nanyang  University.

What  it means today is that it is a demonstration  of



the  answer to the conflict of forces in the Singapore

situation.   Within  the  context  of  the   Singapore

situation, with a population of 1½ million of  which

a  little  over a million are Chinese, the  answer  is

obvious.  With  a  resurgent  and  rejuvenated  China,

powerful,  and with a proud people, where the  culture

is  undergoing a renaissance, it is inevitable that it

must  find  its  ripples and its echoes in  South-East

Asia,  and nowhere in South-East Asia amongst  the  15

million  overseas Chinese are the overseas Chinese  so

fortunately  placed as in Singapore.  Nowhere  in  the

capitals  of any of the independent nations in  South-East   Asia - Rangoon,  Bangkok,  Saigon,   Manila   and

Djakarta - have Chinese commercial ability  and  trading

skill won them a place of such importance. In none  of

them  are they able to wield the political power which

today  makes  the  Government  openly  recognise   the

establishment of Nanyang University.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this raises tremendous problems if we do not

understand  the difference between the  long-term  and

the  short-term approach. If we want to look for a few

votes for next year's elections, then the line we  can

take in this Chamber, and outside in Press statements,

will  be different from the line we will take, if what

we  have  at heart is not a few votes, but the  future

well-being,  prosperity, harmony, national  solidarity

and unity of seven million Malayans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one million Chinese unfortunately cannot

determine the future of Malaya. Not even three million

Chinese in the Federation can determine the future  of

Malaya.  And  it  is  that future  which  we  have  to

determine - or at least the basis of a solution to  that

future  (the formulation of the Malayan nation has  to

be   agreed) - before   we  will  get   the   Federation

Government  to agree to acknowledge Nanyang University

as   a   Malayan  institution  to  which  they   grant

recognition, and which they also subsidise.  Otherwise

let  us  face  the fact: what Nanyang University  will

become is a Singapore University - and a Chinese one  at

that - despite all the efforts to try and colour it, and

despite  all the efforts to introduce the teaching  of

Malay and Indian languages, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at the back of the minds of the Malay

people - the Tunku is a very honest and a very frank man

who agreed that the P.A.P. analysis of why there is no

merger  is  correct - they want to know what happens  to

the  Malay language and the Malay culture in  the  new

Malayan nation. If theirs is going to be the secondary

language and the secondary culture in a free and  open

competition of cultures and languages, then there will

be  trouble.  Then you will never get  recognition  of

Nanyang   University,   because   Nanyang   University

represents to them the dynamism, drive, and ability of

a  very  powerful culture and of a very  able  people.

When we settle this question of national language, and



the  basis  upon which the new Malaya is to be  built,

and  we  satisfy them that the Malay language  is  the

national language, then they will not object to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



anybody learning their own language and fostering  the

development of their own culture within the context of

a Malayan society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no university can exist as a good university in

the  modern  world without State grants. A  privately-endowed  university which is able  to  carry  out  its

duties  as a seat and centre of learning and  research

and  the  quest  for  human knowledge,  is  no  longer

possible  unless  the  large  expenses  which  a  good

university must incur in equipment and recurrent costs

are  met from Government funds. The fact that a  group

of  Chinese  leaders  have been able  to  get  Nanyang

University started is a tribute to their determination

and drive. But I think that they will be the first  to

acknowledge, now that they have started it,  that  its

future prosperity as a University cannot depend on the

fluctuations  in  the  rubber  or  tin  trade.  Having

started the University, you cannot put up or cut  down

your  fees  and  admit more or less students,  as  the

price  of  rubber goes up or comes down, or  the  bank

accounts  of your rubber brokers go up or  come  down.

Let  us  face this that in Singapore, so long  as  you



have  an  electorate such as it is, it must inevitably

mean that Nanyang University will be subsidised by the

Singapore  Government and its degrees will  ultimately

be recognised by the Singapore Government. There is no

escape  from  that logical conclusion so long  as  you

seek  the  answer  in a Singapore context.  Given  the

facts  obtaining  in the Singapore election  register,

the answer is obvious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to know the answer to is not

Nanyang  University  in  the context  of  a  Singapore

situation, but Nanyang University in the context of  a

Malayan situation and, more, Nanyang University in the

context  of  a  South-East  Asia  situation.  Let   me

elaborate. By the curious twists and turns of  British

colonial government, Singapore is emerging as a  semi-independent  City in which, as a result  of  the  past

immigration  policy  of  the  British  Government   in

wanting efficient and cheap labour, the power  in  the

hands  of  the electorate is largely Chinese.  Let  us

face the facts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



The  Chinese, including those who have been  here  for

generations, are determined to preserve their language

and  culture.  If  we deny that,  then  we  are  being

dishonest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, this power poses acutely the

problems  which the Malay people have  to  face.  They

have  not been able to found a Malay university.  They

have,  it  is true, a college to teach the  tenets  of

Islam. It is unlikely that, without State grants, such

an  institution would ever be found. They  watch  this

institution,  therefore,  with  a  certain  amount  of

apprehension because they would like to know what  the

ultimate   future  holds  for  them.  What   does   it

symbolise?  I  believe that the  leader  of  Singapore

U.M.N.O. is  quite sincere when he  says  he  is  not

against Nanyang University. He cannot be because he is

in  a Chinese situation in Singapore, but, at the same

time, I would like to admit that I do not believe that

this is the answer which the South-East Asia situation

would give.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethnologically, Singapore stands in the centre of a

belt  of  Malay-speaking people, stretching  from  the

north  of  Sumatra right down to the Celebes,  perhaps

nearly  to the tip of West Irian. There are 80-million

such  people, and one day they are going to put  their

house  in  order.  When that happens,  this  is  their

region.  Therefore I say, as a Chinese,  I  would  not

wait  and  create  problems  which  are  difficult  of

solution  later  on, but would resolve these  problems

now before they get out of control. It is as simple as

this.  60  per  cent  of  the students  are  from  the

Federation. But the Federation Government is not going

to  pay one cent in support of Nanyang University,  or

the   students,  let  alone  pass  a  statute   openly

recognizing  it  as  a  seat of  learning  and  as  an

institution  for  the advancement of human  knowledge,

until  they  are quite sure that it fits in  with  the

scheme of things which is acceptable to them. And what

I would like to pose to this Assembly is the long-term

problem of finding that basis which is acceptable, not

only  to  the Malays in the Federation, but one  which

will fit in with the pattern of South-East Asia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang as a university, where primarily the

Chinese foregather, is not objectionable, and will not

be,  provided  it  does  not  pose  a  threat  to  the

indigenous language and indigenous culture. And if  we

want  a  solution, then I say, openly  recognize  this

fact  today - that  the  basis for  national  unity  and

solidarity in Malaya is only possible on the basis  of

a  Malayan  national  language.  When  that  offer  is

acceptable, then not only accept it, but translate  in

into  practice  where your students in Nanyang  pursue

their  studies of Confucius, be it with the imprimatur

of  the  Communists, or without the imprimatur of  the

Communists,  depending upon whether the textbooks  are

imported  from the mainland of China or  from  Taiwan.

The  time  when  all those students can converse  with



Hon, the Dato, who is our Deputy Chief Minister, in  a

language  which he understands, and perhaps even  with

more  erudition if he has had the time to  study  that

language, is the time when we have struck the basis of

national  solidarity.  Nobody minds  it,  provided  he

knows  that  it is not a language which  is  going  to

replace Malay. But so long as he believes that it is a

language which may well not only claim an equal status

but  ultimately claim more than an equal status,  then

you will find no solution to the problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Changi today not only pleads his

case  but  is able at the same time to demonstrate  to

the  Malay people that he can speak Malay as  well  as

everybody else, or as well as every other Malay,  then

we  have a basis for national solidarity; because then

nobody  will be worried if the Member for Changi  does

speak  English which is heavily accentuated  with  the

Teochew, Mandarin and Cantonese dialects. It  is  only

when  we have settled the base that we can put Nanyang

University at the apex of an education pyramid. At the

moment  its  base  is  different  from  that  of   the

University of Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



The  University  of  Malaya has a diversified  Malayan

base and, for that reason, although the Tunku and  his

education  experts want to try and insulate  Singapore

students - in  case  it is believed that  radicalism  is

endemic only to Singapore - he acknowledges that  it  is

the   stream   from  which  the  administrators,   the

technicians and the technologists who are going to run

the  apparatus of State, the organs of government  are

to come. What is going to happen now, unless we find a

solution  quickly,  is  that  hundreds  of  able   and

energetic graduates of Nanyang University (60 per cent

of  whom have come from the Federation) will be unable

to get jobs in the Federation, and they will therefore

remain here to seek employment. Therefore, all that we

are  creating is a more difficult situation to resolve

as  the population and this group of people expand and

become  more  and more dissatisfied with the  existing

order.  If, however, an attempt is made now to explore

the  possibilities  and  to formulate  the  terms  and

conditions under which Nanyang could become a  Malayan

university,  and  not  merely a Singapore  university,

then we might be able, in the early formative years of

the University, to shape and design its policy and  to

lead  it  along parallel lines with the University  of

Malaya.  If we do not do that, then we are  in  for  a

very  difficult  time, which will get  more  and  more

difficult year by year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we admit that Singapore and the Federation

are  one  economic unit, as I heard the  Minister  for

Commerce  and Industry admit, and we do not want  this

one  economic  unit  to be torn  asunder  by  all  the

stresses and strains of ethnological, linguistic,  and

other  divisions,  let  us resolve  them  before  they

become  acute.  In  the last and  final  analysis,  we

survive  or  fail according to whether we can  find  a

solution  which is not only acceptable to the  Malays,

but  also to the Chinese and the Indians. The  Indians

do  not  pose the same difficulty because they do  not

pose as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



counter  culture competing for supremacy. The  Chinese

do,  and it does no good not to acknowledge this.  Let

us openly acknowledge it and find a solution, and when

we  find  it, then we have got the basis of a  healthy

state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the easiest thing in the world today is to stir

up   deep-seated   emotional  prejudices.   When   the

Ceylonese   united  left-wing  group  won   the   last

elections  on the basis of Singhalese as the  national

language,  with the aid of Buddhist monks,  I  do  not

think  they envisaged that ultimately there  would  be

martial law in Ceylon as the Tamils revolted.  In  the

same  way,  I do not believe for one moment  that  the

Federation  Government,  whatever  its  policies   and

desire,  can  prevent the continuance of  the  Chinese

language as the mother tongue, and one of the media of

instruction  of the Chinese in their schools,  unless,

of  course,  a  bloody revolution is not considered  a

deterrent  enough. But at the same time,  a  state  of

deadlock  where  one views the other  with  suspicion,

because  one  believes the other wants  ultimately  to

obtain supreme control over the minds and the, tongues

of all, must lead to a gradual deterioration of racial

relations.   In  Singapore  we  have   a   very   good

opportunity in a numerically Chinese-dominated city to

demonstrate   to  the  Malays,  both  here,   in   the

Federation  and  in  South-East  Asia,  that  we   are

prepared to be part of the Malayan scene and  part  of

the  South-East  Asian context. The less  we  have  of

chauvinist  slogans or sentiments whilst discussing  a

matter  highly charged with emotion, and  particularly

Chinese  chauvinist slogans, the healthier it  is  for

everyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support this Bill but, at the same time,

express  our regrets that a Malayan solution  has  not

been found to the problems of Nanyang University, both

as   regards   its  recognition  and   its   financial

continuance.



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

glad to see the support given by this House to Nanyang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



University. All the support is deserving but the  most

important  of this support is that coming from  UMNO's

representative. Without the Nanyang University,  where

could  the  Chinese  students, having  finished  their

secondary education in the Chinese schools, go to?  If

they were to go to the Chinese mainland, they would be

given  a one-way ticket from which there would  be  no

return.  If they were to go to Formosa, their  loyalty

to  Malaya  would be questioned. So Nanyang University

offers  them  a solution. Hence we have full  support,

with students coming not only from Singapore, but also

from the Federation of Malaya to Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to have personal contact with the

students,  I  spend  two  hours  every  week  at   the

University  and I can give my assurance  to  the  non-Chinese communities in Singapore that the students  of

Nanyang University are loyal citizens of Malaya.  They

were  proud of their Federation of Malaya citizenship;

so  they  told me when they came to me. That assurance

also  applies to the Nanyang University students  from

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other assurance I would like to give to

this  House,  to  the  whole  of  Singapore  and   the

Federation of Malaya, and it is this: that the Nanyang

University  students  accept  Malay  as  the  national

language of the whole of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future, Sir, can be this. Nanyang University

might become one of the colleges of the University  of

Malaya.  A  portion  of the University  of  Malaya  in

Singapore  might  also be known as Singapore  college.

Nanyang  college, Singapore college and  Kuala  Lumpur



college, might form the University of Malaya in a Pan-Malayan setup. Let there be no fear of the loyalty  of

the students of the Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad that there will be some provision

made  for the Students' Union; that perhaps a building

will be given to the students of Nanyang University



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



over which they shall have absolute control. I

remember, when I was in the University of Hongkong  as

an undergraduate, that the whole building was given to

the students and they had absolute control so much  so

that they had even the right to exclude any member  of

the  teaching staff. We enjoyed that, Sir, and  it  is

from these little things that we have such loyalty  to

our  alma  mater.  Sir,  in  my  vision,  the  Nanyang

University  will  be a lighthouse in South-East  Asia.

May it be so.



<br><br>3.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this. Bill represents a

necessary  and  proper  evolutionary  development   in

Singapore's educational progress, and few  would  wish

to  do other than welcome it. But as the taxpayer will

have to help pay for the running of the University, it

is  reasonable  that Government should participate  in

its  administration and guide its deliberations. What

is  vital,  however,  is that the  academic  standards

should  be proper University standards, and  it  is  a

pity  that it has not been able to establish this  yet

at  this  stage. We hope that the Commission  will  be

able  to  complete  the  work next  year  as  soon  as

possible  and  solve a vital problem. We welcome  this

Bill,  and  the  fact that it will go  to  the  Select

Committee for further examination so that if there  is

still  any controversy or misunderstanding in  any  of

the  provisions they can be ironed out.  I  think  the

Assembly  has contributed in the past few years  to  a

broader-minded   understanding  of   the   issues   in

Singapore, educational, academic, cultural and social,

call them what you will. It is important to bring  the

Nanyang   University  within  the  comity  of  Malayan

educational  institutions, and we hope that  the  Bill

will  be  a  step  towards this end.  I  think  it  is

important  to  realise that, as the  hon.  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar has said more eloquently than I  could,

it is the first step and not the last.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

welcome  this Bill, and I say that the Malays have  no

fear  of Nanyang University as a threat to them. I  do

not  believe that when we start anything  it  will  be

perfect.  Rome was not built in a day. Today  we  find

that Nanyang University has already started Malay as a

language,  and I am certain that it will be  developed

in  such  .a  manner as to make it  one  of  the  very

important subjects in that University. Those  who  are

sitting  in  control  of that University  are  men  of

intelligence  and experience, and I  am  certain  that

their guidance will not lead Nanyang astray, but  lead

it so that it becomes .a pattern in our Malayan scene.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the University is concerned, Sir, I welcome

the  establishment of another institution  for  higher

education.  The  addition  of  another  university  to

Malaya  and Singapore is a blessing for the  whole  of

Malaya and will give opportunities to a greater number

of  students  to have a chance of higher  studies.  In

fact,  as a school teacher, I have found that many  of

our  students  cannot get places in the University  of

Malaya,  and that a large percentage of them has  gone

overseas  to study, even in English universities.  All

of  them, or a very high percentage of them, did  well

and  returned  with  degrees from foreign  lands.  The

creation  of  Nanyang University will help  those  who

have  no means to travel abroad, and I certainly think

that we have to give it the fullest support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years ago, a long time before the war, we did

not  hear  of  any university in Malaya.  Anybody  who

wanted  a  degree must go overseas, coming  back  with

degrees  either  from  English universities,  European

universities or American universities. Today, we  find

that  we are starting Our own university. I hope  that

we  will be able to develop our university so that  it

will  not  only serve Malaya and Singapore alone,  but

will serve the whole of South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is the focal point for trade and

communications, and I hope that it will  also  be  the

centre for learning in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



South-East Asia. This is a land where democracy  still

rules.  We  all  support  the idea  of  democracy,  we

support this ideal, and if we have students from other

countries  around us coming to these  universities  to

learn  our ideals, then I think democracy will  thrive

in the whole of South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous to the opening of Nanyang University, we

have  only  the Malayan University meant for  students

who  are  educated  in English. Those  who  were  from

Chinese schools were forced to go to China for further

studies.  If Nanyang University were not opened,  they

would  either  be stranded in Singapore or  Malaya  or

they  had  to start their schooling all over again  in

order to get admission into English universities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a fear expressed by the Member for

Tanjong Pagar that, by creating Nanyang University, we

are turning out many trained people who will be coming

out  and yet cannot find employment. I feel that there

should be no such fears. Many able people are required

in commercial firms. I would say that the best talents

are  absorbed  into  all these institutions.  Business

must  progress  and today we find many  of  the  local

businesses   progressing  to  as  high  a   level   of

efficiency as those of the European communities.  They

need  men,  and  they need men who are  trained  in  a

language   that  will  be  useful  to  them.   Nanyang

University  students know Chinese, and  certainly  our

trade  needs this language. If we trade with the  West

we  need  English and European languages;  and  if  we

trade with the East we need Chinese. We need both  the

languages,  and we need Malay if we are  trading  with

Indonesia.  I think from these institutions  you  will

find  men  coming out well able to take care  of  this

need.  I  am certain that they will not come out  with

the  problem of unemployment aggravated, but certainly

they  can  be  absorbed into the commercial  firms  or

Government Departments of all territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Minister for Education has pointed out that

the   Government  has  come  to  the  aid  of  Nanyang

University. We welcome that, and we certainly feel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



that  this is a gesture that Government will come  out

with  greater assistance as time goes on when the need

is   proved;   but  I  would  like  to   stress   that

universities  must  not have assistance  granted  them

with   strings   attached.  Universities   should   be

independent  institutions, free from  rigid  controls,

and they should develop and contribute to this land in

the  best way they can, and not in the manner dictated

by   Government.  Nanyang  University  will  have  the

guidance  of  its  elder brother,  the  University  of

Malaya,  and with mutual assistance exchanged  between

these two universities, Nanyang University will have a

bright future.

<div align="center"><b>NANYANG UNIVERSITY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think we have heard more than we had expected

to  hear  and  I would not like to tire  you  and  the

Members  down in this Assembly. So I will add  just  a

little  to  what has been said, and that is,  I  would

plead  to  the  Government to look after  the  Nanyang

University as a second son just as well as it has been

looking after its elder son, the University of Malaya.



<br><br>3.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should not like

to  be  the only silent Member in the House when there

is  unanimous support given to the Nanyang  University

Bill, support which I myself would give.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have recently been reading an article by Professor

Lewis, who is an economic expert on the developed  and

under-developed  territories, and he, after  examining

various  types  of investment, felt that  perhaps  the

highest priority of all was for education, since it is

the  educated  who  in  the end could  carry  out  the

planning and management which will be necessary for  a

detailed  investment of all kinds. For that reason,  I

believe  that it is right in Singapore that we  should

have  been pouring money into the building of  primary

and  secondary  schools and that we  should  have  two

universities  on  our tiny island, because  from  that

high rate of investment in education, we can hope to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



reap a high rate of economic benefit if all goes well.

Without   that  high  rate  of  investment - the   basic



investment -  we  should  have much  less  prospect  of

mastering the problems which undoubtedly face us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Serangoon referred to the great

importance  of Nanyang University being  independent,

free from outside control and running itself. I am not

going to discuss that in detail, but I would say  that

I  most fully agree with that principle with regard to

universities. There are always difficulties, because a

university in the world today, certainly in Singapore,

has  not got a free endowment in its own hands. It has

to  go to one financial source or another for support,

and  the English have a proverb - he who pays the  piper

calls  the  tune. That is a problem which will  always

recur in all matters affecting universities. It  is  a

problem which must be in the minds of the Assembly and

the Select Committee of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hon. Member - I have forgotten who - referred to the

hope   that  the  Government  would  support   Nanyang

University and he hoped that the Federation Government

would   do  something.  Sir,  this  House  is   almost

unanimously a Socialist House and I would myself  draw

no  more  than a practical distinction between private

finance and public finance. They are all parts of  the

total national wealth and where the details of control

lie,  it  is an accident of history and a subject  for

discussion.  But  the  fact  is  that  investment   in

education, whether it is private investment or  public

investment, is a national investment and  it  must  be

considered in the light of the national interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have heard a statement from the Minister for

Education about the leakages in examination questions.

Nobody supposes that leakages in examination questions



were  because students had a curiosity about them,  or

because  they had a passionate desire to  score  extra

marks because their fathers would he happy to see them

get more marks. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



simple   and  sole  reason  why  examination  question

leakages   are   liable  to  occur  is   because   the

competition to get up to the highest possible point of

the  education  ladder is so very great  and  so  very

urgent,  and it is such a disaster to fail and  to  be

thrown off the ladder at whatever point it is - Form IV

or  Form VI - because the fruits are at the top  of  the

ladder. If you do not get to the top, the fewer fruits

you will get.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have heard references in speeches this

afternoon  to  the fact that from our universities  we

draw the managerial cadres who go into commerce and go

into  the  Government, and go into all the controlling

activities  in  Singapore and the Federation - positions

of  importance,  which people must  have  skills  for,

skills  which  can only be acquired by  what  we  call

higher  education. That is true. It  does  present  us

with  a danger which the Socialists must bear in mind.

The  danger is the creation of a new managerial  class



subsidised from public funds. The cost of educating  a

student  at  a university, as it falls on  the  public

purse,  comes to a few thousand dollars a  year - up  to

$6,000  or $8,000 a year - and over a series of  years.

At  the  end of it all, the student goes out with  his



diploma  in his hand and his degree, and if  he  likes

to,  he  can  sit back and sell coloured  water  at  a

dispensary and charge $10 for it. He can have  a  very

big car and a nice house and several wives and have  a

very happy life to himself. All this has been achieved

by  a  certain  amount of hard work  by  himself,  but

essentially because he has been carried by  the  sweat

and  suffering of the poor and the taxation which they

carry  has lifted him up and given him the opportunity

of  making  a  very  good thing for himself.  That  is

always  the  danger which we must bear  in  mind,  and

perhaps one way in which it can be reduced is to  have

a  very  ample  supply of those who have been  through

higher education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. friend and colleague, the Financial

Secretary,  has  pointed to some of the  cost  factors

with  regard to our educational problems in his Budget

speech,  and  those are going to pose us very  serious

problems  in the future. We must accept the fact  that

investment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



in  education  is vital to the wealth, prosperity  and

happiness  of this country, but we must  also  do  all

that we possibly can to ensure that investment is wise

and  fruitful  investment and that it will  serve  the

needs and provide benefits for all the people and  not

for  any section of the people or for the creation  of

any new class.



<br><br>3.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  glad  to notice that practically every  Member  of

this  House is supporting the Bill. I only  hope  that

they  are all sincere in what they have expressed just

now.  What worries me is this, Sir: I have noticed  in

the  past, especially when elections are coming,  that

they have expressed their views just for the mere sake

of   vote-catching.   In  my   honest   opinion,   the

contribution that the Government has made this year to

Nanyang  University is inadequate, and I hope that  if

the Government finds that the University requires more

help,  it will give it. I feel it should treat Nanyang

University  on the same terms as it has been  treating

the University of Malaya.



<br><br>3.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning

when the Minister for Education was about to move  the

Second Reading of the Bill, there was complete silence

in  this  House until the Member for Changi jumped  up

and  so  drew your attention. Arising out of that,  it

has  sparked off a debate in which, as the Member  for

Cairnhill has just said, almost every Member  of  this

House has taken part. Sir, this morning I thought  the

Bill  was  going to have unanimous support  without  a

thorough debate - hence the silence that prevailed  just

when  the  Minister  was  about  to  move  the  Second

Reading.  But  as the Minister for Communications  and

Works  has  said,  it  appears that  everyone  has  to

express his views and not just give silent support  to

the  Bill.  I for one would not like to be accused  of

being  a  silent supporter. So I would like to express

my support for this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



I  welcome  it  and at the same time I would  like  to

congratulate the Government for bringing up this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much has been said on the Bill that I do not think

it  is  necessary for me to elaborate on it very much,

especially on the merits of Nanyang University and the

question of the national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar this afternoon expressed

his  fear  in  regard  to the position  in  which  the

students  of  Nanyang University will find  themselves

when they pass out. I agree with him on that point. We

cannot  provide employment for everyone of  them.  The

Member for Tanjong Pagar also expressed the view  that

we  should not just look at the issue from a Singapore

outlook. It should be from a Malayan outlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of educational qualifications, I was

told  that  a Commission has been set up to look  into

the  possibility  of  recognising  Nanyang  University

degrees.  What I am thinking of is this: if  Singapore

is  prepared to recognise the University's degrees, is

the  Federation of Malaya prepared to do the same?  We

are  separated from the Federation of Malaya  and  the

Federation  is  an independent country.  It  does  not

recognise  any  of  the laws we make;  neither  do  we

recognise any of the laws it makes; but at times we do

follow  the  laws  that  it makes,  or  at  least  the

Government is prepared to draft a Bill to follow suit.

Now if it is the case that 60 per cent of the students



in  Nanyang University are from the Federation, can we

provide employment for them in Singapore? If not, they

will  then have to go back to the Federation,  and  if

Nanyang  University degrees are not recognised  there,

then  how  can  they  seek  employment  in  their  own

country?  I  think the most important  issue  that  we

should look into is whether Nanyang University degrees

will  be  recognised by the Federation of  Malaya  and

internationally.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not intend to speak



in  this  debate, but seeing that practically everyone

in  this House has spoken on the Bill, I would like to

chip  in with a few words. This is not for the purpose

of  vote-catching, Sir. As a Member of the Government,

Sir, it follows that this Bill has my support; but  my

real  purpose  in standing up is to set  at  rest  one

criticism which has been expressed on the floor of the

House,  and  that is that the amount  which  has  been

granted by the Government to Nanyang University is not

enough.  I  just want to clarify that this  amount  is

exactly what they have asked for.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chew, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> In reply, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  think one hon. Member hit the nail on the head when

he  said  that we had heard more than we had expected.

At  the same time, it is also distressing to note that



some Members spoke without finding out more about  the

facts of the case, or they spoke in ignorance, or they

spoke  with an eye to the votes that will float  about

in  March  or April; especially the Member  for  Tiong

Bahru who asked why was not equal treatment given? Why

was  that amount given to Nanyang University?  I  have

said to this House, and I have said publicly - I suppose

the   hon.   Member   does   not   read   the   papers

carefully - that   the   amount   given    to    Nanyang

University - some $450,000 - is the very amount,  to  the

exact  dollar, that the University has asked  for.  We

could  have given more, but we would have been accused

of   playing  politics.  So  if  that  is  not   equal

treatment, I do not know what is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru also asked why the

Nanyang University Students Union had been left out of

the  Bill,  and  said  that  this  was  discrimination

against  a Chinese university. May I tell him for  his

own  benefit that the Nanyang University Bill was  not

drafted by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



the  Government? It was drafted by the legal  advisers

of the sponsors of the University. I think now he will

change   his   opinion   and   say   that   there   is

discrimination   by  the  sponsors   against   Chinese

education. I wish Members would come to this House and

speak  at  least some truth, instead of  making  false

accusations  against  the Government  as  to  what  is

contained   in   the  Bill.  Do  something   that   is

constructive, for the sake of Singapore at least.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was wondering whether the word

"truth"  in that context is a parliamentary word.  The

opposite  of that is "lie", I suppose? I suggest  that

the Minister withdraw that word



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> As you please, Sir, I withdraw

that word. There was mention by I think the Member for

Changi  and the Member for Paya Lebar that, thanks  to

the  small  men,  Nanyang  University  has  come  into

existence,  and the help which they have  given  is  a

symbol of their support for Chinese culture. For  that

reason,  Sir,  Government has given bursaries  to  the

extent   of   $400,000  to  the  children   of   those

people - Singapore citizens - who cannot afford  a  higher

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognition of Nanyang University degrees will

come  when  the Commission, which will be  set  up  in

early  February and which has been referred to  in  my

speech earlier this morning -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Minister inform us

whether   any  attempt  has  been  made  to  ask   the

Federation  Government to associate itself  with  this

Commission?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I will come to that after I have

finished my explanation of the Commission. As  I  have

said,  the Commission will be set up in February  next

year and the question of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



recognition  of  Nanyang University  degrees  will  be

decided  then.  I have not officially  approached  the

Federation Government on this question, as it is quite

clear  from  the Federation's point of  view  at  this

juncture  that  they would not like to be  drawn  into

this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the points which I feel need answering. I

welcome the support that has been given by all Members

of this House to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr

Speaker  as  Chairman  and  such  Members  as  may  be

nominated  by  the Committee of Selection.  [Mr  Chew

<div align="center"><b>PIONEER INDUSTRIES (RELIEF</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>FROM INCOME TAX) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the



Governor's  consent to proceed with this  Bill  and  I

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that I stated in this House about

two  years  ago that Government was investigating  the

question  of  making tax concessions,  more  popularly

known  as  tax holidays, to industries whose expansion

or establishment it was desired to encourage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of territories grant tax holidays to new

industries. Sometimes this is done under the  existing

Income  Tax  Ordinance and sometimes it is done  under

special  pioneer industry legislation. From  available

information  at  the  present  time,  Ghana,  Nigeria,

British Guiana, Trinidad, and some of the smaller West

Indian Islands grant tax holidays to industries.  Hon.

Members  are  of course, aware that the Federation  of



Malaya   has   recently   enacted   pioneer   industry

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided that tax concessions to

industries should apply not only to enterprises  of  a

pioneer nature but also to enterprises which undertake

approved extensions or expansions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



of  their  present plant. For the sake of convenience,

the  Government proposes that this should be  done  by

two  separate Bills, that is, by the Bill  now  before

the House and by the Industrial Expansion (Relief from

Income Tax) Bill which is next on the Order Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation is a further step forward in

Government's policy of creating conditions which  will

encourage the establishment of industries here. It  is

imperative  that  we  should  turn  our  attention  to

secondary  industries  to provide  further  employment

opportunities as it is only too clear that trade alone

will not sustain our growing population. Government is

confident that with the policy of selective protection

as  announced  by  me a few months  ago  and  the  tax

concession proposals which are before the House today,

the  necessary  conditions  will  be  created  for  an

increased rate of industrial development resulting  in

the  strengthening of our economy and the creation  of

more employment opportunities in the industrial field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Bill now before the House is to

attract  capital both local and foreign to  invest  in

new  industries  in  Singapore by  means  of  offering

freedom  from income tax for a period of  five  years.

Such  tax relief or tax holiday may, however, only  be



enjoyed by an enterprise which has obtained from me  a

Pioneer Certificate for a specific product. This would

mean  that  the  production of the particular  product

concerned  is considered to be of economic benefit  to

Singapore.  The tax concession will also be applicable

to  benefits and dividends paid out by the  enterprise

possessing a Pioneer Certificate. The criteria  to  be

applied before an industry could be declared a pioneer

industry are, broadly speaking,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that it is in the public interest; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that it is an industry not being carried out in

Singapore  on an adequate scale and that  there

is favourable prospect for further development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



Again,  before  any  enterprise  may  be  declared  as

producing a pioneer product, regard will at all  times

be  had  to  the  public interest and  sources  within

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill vests in the Minister for Commerce and

Industry the power to declare any industry or  product

to   be  a  pioneer  industry  or  a  pioneer  product

respectively, and if necessary, he has  the  power  to

prescribe conditions in the order declaring  either  a

pioneer industry or a pioneer product. Before such  an

order  is  made, however, the Bill provides  for  full

opportunity  for those affected to object against  the

making  of such an order. Once an order has been  made

affording  pioneer status to an industry  or  product,

applications  may  be made to the  Minister  by  firms

seeking  pioneer enterprise status in respect of  such

pioneer  industry or pioneer product. Every  applicant

will be required to furnish particulars of the capital

expenditure  incurred or to be incurred,  the  maximum

production capacity, and so on. On the approval of  an

application, a Pioneer Certificate will be  issued  to

the enterprise concerned. Provisions also exist in the

Bill  for  the  Minister  to  revoke  an  enterprise's

pioneer status if the conditions under which a Pioneer

Certificate had been granted have not been fulfilled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, there is in Singapore a body of opinion

opposed  to the granting of such discretionary  powers

to a Minister as they consider that misuse can be made

of  such powers. They would prefer an appointed  Board

to exercise such powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, however, forget that in a democratic

parliamentary system it is the Government, through the

various  Ministers, that is responsible to the  people

for   the  carrying  out  of  Government  policy,  and

therefore  it  would  be  totally  Inappropriate   for

important discretionary powers which can have a direct

bearing  on  or  can affect Government policy,  to  be

given  to a Board which has no responsibility  to  the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as this Bill and the next Bill are concerned,

the  effect  is  to  grant  a concession  through  tax

relief, and tax collections are very much a Government

matter.  Again, these Bills do not give  the  Minister

any power to take away any rights from anybody - only to

grant  a  concession - and  therefore  no  one  can   be

aggrieved in the real sense of the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister

has  said, the object of the Bill is to encourage  the

investment  of  local  or  foreign  capital   in   new

industries.  I  think  this  Bill  should  have   been

introduced much earlier. Anyway, I welcome this  Bill,

but  I  want to ask the Minister whether he  is  aware

that  at  the moment the City Council has made  a  new

ruling  whereby any people wanting to set up factories

or  housing projects will have to pay 50 per  cent  of

the cost of laying cables and pipes for the supply  of

electricity, water and gas. Previously this  cost  was

borne  by  the  City Council if the company  concerned

could prove that they could erect a certain number  of

houses or factories. Personally, I would like to  have

an  answer from the Minister whether such an important

ruling  passed  by the City Council  will  affect  the

Bill.



<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that

this  House genuinely welcomes this Bill but I am also

sure  that  this  House has genuine  fears  about  the

success of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem facing us today is not whether to

have  tax  holidays  or  that  industries  should   be

subsidised.  Sir,  I think all this  is  of  secondary

importance. The only issue lying ahead is  whether  or

not  it  is  high  time  for  the  Government  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya  to have a  long-term  economic

policy  towards Singapore in the light of our entrepot

trade,    and   the   necessity   for   boosting    up

industrialisation. If not, no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



matter how hard the hard-working Minister for Commerce

and  Industry  tries  his very  best  to  promote  and

encourage  the industrialisation of our  going  to  be

unsuccessful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to quote a simple example.

Federation - manufactured goods can come into  Singapore



past  the  Johore Causeway, or by boat from Penang  or

Malacca or from any port, free of tax into Singapore.

<br><br>4.01 p.m.





<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the subject which

I raise on the Motion for the Adjournment is the

importance of unrestricted trade with China. Before  I

say  anything, I wish to quote a few news cuttings  to

support my motion. First, a rubber market report  from

the Straits Times of Saturday, 29th November reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The market felt a backwash resulting from the

announcement that amendments were being  made  to  the

proposed  banking legislation in the Federation  which

would  have  the effect of closing down  the  Bank  of

China branches in Kuala Lumpur and Penang."



<br><br>Further down, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They feel uneasy about the rubber price, fearing that

China  will  not  buy  more Malayan  rubber  with  the

consequent bearish effect on this market."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headline is:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>"LESS BUSINESS DONE ON LOCAL SHARE MARKET NOW"</h4></div>



Now,  Sir,  the  Sin  Chew Jit Poh of  22nd  November,

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stoppage of sending goods from China has shaped

the whole market."



<br><br>Another one, 23rd November, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Customers line up in front of the food stalls. The

prices  of  textiles have increased  by  5  per  cent;

foodstuffs from China have increased 20 per cent."



<br><br>It  is an economic report from the Sin Chew Jit Poh of

23rd November. Taking another, 25th November, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Importers in Hongkong have raised their prices owing

to  the  stoppage  of  sending  goods  from  China  to

Singapore."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that the Sin Chew Jit Poh?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes, Sir. I am quoting all these

extracts in support of my motion on the importance  of

trade with China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we all know, Singapore's life blood depends



on  its  entrepot  trade. It is essential  to  develop

strong   and   friendly  trade  relations   with   all

countries,  particularly our neighbour - China.  Because

of  her  geographical position and her growing ability

to   produce  a  wide  range  of  products   at   very

competitive  prices, she is becoming  an  increasingly

important   factor  in  our  entrepot   trade.   Trade

statistics for the past few years reflect her  growing

importance, and I will quote some figures. Exports  to

China  increased from a mere $12.9 million in 1954  to

$74.3  million  in 1957. Imports from China  increased

from  $87.1 million in 1954 to $159.9 million in 1957.

Sir,  these  figures clearly indicate an  increase  of



nearly  100  per cent in imports from  China,  and  an

increase of 600 per cent in exports to China. There is

therefore  no doubt that China has now become  a  very

serious competitor with other producing countries.  We

need to buy cheap goods and it will be much easier for

us  to  sell  them at a high price. This will  perhaps

smooth   down   our  entrepot  trade  a  great   deal,

especially  our external trade. This competition  will

help us to procure more business and keep our entrepot

trade  going smoothly. It will help to lower our  cost

of living and, in return, raise the standard of living

of our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If China were to stop sending us her foodstuffs, such

as  vegetables, eggs and fruits, particularly  Chinese

herbs  and medicines which no other country can supply

in  substituted form, and we were forced  to  purchase

them from other countries, I do not know how much more

we  would have to pay for them. Assuming that  we  cut

off  supplies from this particular source. What do  we

gain?   Nothing,  Sir,  absolutely  nothing.  On   the

contrary, our pattern of trade would be disrupted. Our

volume  of  external trade would go down, because  our

customers  would  turn to China or  any  other  direct

source to get the goods they want. And, of course, our

people  here  would  have  to pay  unnecessarily  high

prices  for the goods they want, and that will add  to

their hardships. But I must emphasise, Sir, that I  do

not  for a moment favour the importation of any  goods

from any source if such importation will endanger  our

infant  industries. Let us, however, be  rational  and

impartial and treat all countries alike. We definitely

cannot  pinpoint  any one country  and  say  that  its

export  of  certain  articles is  detrimental  to  our

economy and yet at the same time allow other countries

to do that very thing. Naturally in the circumstances,

Sir, we would be accused of showing discrimination and

being unfriendly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote two specific examples on this

aspect. First, the banning of certain publications and

textiles  from  China.  The  books  were  imported  in

accordance  with Government regulations and  with  the

sanction of a censorship board. But now we turn  round

and tell them that all these books are undesirable and

should be totally banned. How are we going to gain  or

retain  the  confidence of the public? Sir,  when  the

Government takes such inexplicable action,  it  easily

destroys  the  faith  of  the  public.  How  can   the

Government  convince  the public  that  the  knowledge

gained from reading such books as the Dream of the Red

Chamber and the Romance of the Three Kingdoms poses  a

subversive  threat to our country, when it takes  such

action? The real danger by taking such action is this:

that it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



lead  the  masses into believing that the  banning  of

such  books is part of a campaign launched by  certain

neighbouring countries which are ready to  crush  down

Chinese  culture  and  economic potentialities.  I  am

sorry  to say that S.E.AT.O. has an influence on  this

action to ban books and textiles from China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the second specific example, Sir - the

banning  of  Chinese textiles. I will quote  from  the

editorial  of  the Straits Times of 5th  November.  It

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up to the end of July piecegoods imported from China

totalled approximately $12 million, which is less than

the  Chinese  vegetable trade and about one-eighth  of

Japanese textile imports into Malaya."



<br><br>Sir,  it is not sufficient for us to believe that such

a  ban  on  Chinese  textiles is  going  to  help  the

Japanese  directly.  Let  us  see  what  the  Japanese

delegation  to Seattle had to say. It was reported  in

the Free Press on 12th November.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr H. Ikeda, Japanese Minister of State, said in

Seattle yesterday:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We cannot sit back and let the less developed

countries in South-East Asia be influenced and  swayed

by the intensified economic drive of Communist China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that purpose, free nations, especially the United

States  and  Japan, must work together  to  give  more

vigorous  and  well-organised economic  assistance  to

these countries.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we read about the Russians starting to dump

their  tin and the Japanese openly saying, "No, sorry,

we  do not buy Malayan tin. We can get some cheap  tin

from   somewhere  else."  Sir,  whatever  action   the

Government takes, is it merely to respond to the  call

and wishes of the Japanese? Or is it an obligation  on

our  part? Is it the responsibility of this Government

to  antagonise our no less powerful neighbour,  China?

Sir,  not  for  a moment do I think the Government  is

that. I cannot imagine it is, because the Japanese are

already backed by the American capitalists. Any person

who has ever paid the slightest attention to our trade

relations with China will agree that the time has  now

come - and it is a crucial moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am even more unhappy about the political

interpretation  of  the banning of Chinese  goods.  In

fact, by being the only country discriminated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



against,  that  can  be construed  unmistakably  as  a

hostile  attitude  towards her. We have  to  face  the

fact,  whether we like it or not, that  Red  China  is

here  to  stay; that her power, with her  600  million

people behind her, cannot be totally ignored. It is in

our interest to adopt a policy of treating all nations

alike  and  to live harmoniously with our  neighbours,

for  we are a small country and our livelihood depends

on our entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to warn the House that we are now facing

a  most dangerous state of affairs - the danger of being

dragged  into  the cold war between the East  and  the

West,  between the Russians and the Americans. We  may

be in danger of losing the valuable independence which

we have been striving for, for so long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the present separation of

Malaya and Singapore is absolutely artificial, because

geographically, culturally and economically Malaya and

Singapore consist of one unit. Although the people  of

Singapore are crying out loudly to the skies  that  we

must  all  strive  for ultimate unification  with  the

Federation of Malaya, there is silence from the  other

side  of  the Causeway. As long as we remain separate,

we  have to find a solution to our problem of a merger

with  the  Federation. We cannot  just  be  blind  and

obediently follow what the Federation tells us, unless

Singapore's  interests  are well  looked  after,  well

considered and well protected by it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now quote from the statement made by the

Hon. the Minister for Commerce and Industry to this House on 13th August, 1958:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After careful consideration Government has come to

the  conclusion that the principle of protection  must

be  recognised for our industries and Government  will

therefore  commence taking immediately all such  steps

as  are  necessary for this policy to be  implemented.

Government recognises that entrepot trade will  always



continue  to play a major part in our economy  and  is

therefore  determined that the operation of protection

should be carried out with the minimum possible damage

to, or dislocation of, the entrepot trade."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at what the Minister has done since then.

He  has banned books and textiles from China. When you



ask  him  to look after the entrepot trade,  he  says,

"No,   we  must  look  after  the  interests  of   the

Federation's industrial projects." And when we ask him

to  look after our local industry, he replies, "No, we

must look after our entrepot trade status." Sir, I  do

not  know when the Minister can decide how he is going

to  find  a  wonderful solution. On the one  hand,  he

wants  to  maintain the entrepot status  of  Singapore

and,  on  the  other hand, he wants to carry  out  his

policy of industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have been asked by the Federation to protect a

single textiles mill - the Malayan Textile Mills Ltd. If

I am not wrong, it was first established in Singapore.

Sir, as we know, the Malayan Textile Mills, until this



very  moment,  is  still unable  to  supply  our  home

market.  How  can it supply sufficient  quantities  to

feed  our entrepot stomach? Therefore, I wish  to  ask

the  Minister  this. Are we maintaining  the  entrepot

trade,  or are we protecting the interests of industry

by  this action? I say no, we are not doing either one

of  them,  because  this  Government  is  giving  more

importance  to  protecting the  Federation's  industry

than   to  maintain  our  entrepot  trade;  and,  more

important,   it  is  more  concerned   to   keep   the

Federation's   factories   running   than   to   solve

Singapore's growing unemployment problem. I  must,  of

course, make it clear, especially after the row I  had

with  the  Minister  for Local Government,  Lands  and

Housing, that I am not suggesting for one moment  that

we  must  not have the interests of the Federation  of

Malaya  at  heart.  I  just want  to  plead  that  the

Federation   should   also  look   after   Singapore's

interests.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate interrupting the hon.

Member,  but  I  must  remind him  that  the  time  of

termination of the sitting is half-past four,  and  if

he  wishes the Minister to answer, he should give some

time to the Minister.



<br><br><!--Tun Lim Yew Hock(Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

obvious   that  the  hon.  Member  is  under   the

impression  that the Government can have  half  an

hour  to answer after the hon. Member has his half

an hour!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let me disabuse the mind of the

hon.  Member.  The  time for  termination  of  the

sitting is half-past four and not later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> There is one further

controversial point which I must mention.  I  have

tried  to  avoid as far as possible commenting  on

the  present political activities in spite of  the

harmful  effect  they have on  Singapore's  future

development. I do not wish to widen  the  gap  and

increase   the   misunderstanding   between    the

Federation  and  Singapore, but I  must  warn  the

Singapore  Government,  in  the  gravest  possible

terms,  that  any  attempt by  it  to  follow  the

Federation's example in banning the Bank of  China

would have serious and harmful repercussions of  a

permanent nature. I want the Government to  assure

us  that it is not going to follow the example  of

the  Federation in banning the Bank of China. Sir,

we  cannot afford to ignore the role that the Bank

of  China  has  been playing. It is financing  our

local industries and important business houses  to

a  great extent, and it is only natural to let the

trade with China be done through this Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I call upon the Government to answer some

questions.  First,  is it not wise  to  extend  an

official invitation to Red China to send  a  trade

delegation   here  in  order  to  clear   up   any

misunderstanding and to heal the wounds that  have

been  caused?  Since we are a British  colony  and

since  Britain herself has normal trade  relations

with  Red  China, I do not think there is anything

wrong in doing so. It only needs a little courage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Tunku Abdul Rahman is one of the few

national leaders who win wide support. The  people

not  only of Singapore and the Federation but also

in Borneo regard him as the only person

who   is   eligible  to  be  addressed  as  "Bapak

Merdeka",, and he is "Bapak Merdeka" not  only  to

Malaya  but  to Singapore and Borneo as  well.  We

have  full confidence that he will be prepared  to

reconsider  the measures that have been  taken  by

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There is now less confidence in merger.

Singapore's    entrepot    trade    status     and



industrialisation are seriously  threatened  by  a

series  of trade measures taken against us by  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There is the fear of racial discrimination.

There  is also the ban on textiles and books  from



China  and  this is considered by  the  people  as

being part of the move organised by S.E.A.T.O. to

mislead  the people as being anti-Chinese  culture

and anti-Chinese economic potentialities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Furthermore, there is the fear of being

dragged  into the cold war. As we know, the  Tunku

has  taken the stand of not joining S.E.A.T.O. and

it is sufficient that we also should not join this

Organisation and be involved in the cold war.  But

now, it seems the picture has changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, let me repeat what I have

said  to  both  the Russians and Americans  alike.

Hands  off  Asia! Let the Asians rule  and  manage



themselves!

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> As the hon. Member has given

me only one minute to reply, I must in that minute

assure the House that many of the statements  made

by  the  hon.  Member have been  misconceived  and

based on false premises. It would be futile for me

to  attempt to reply to him in detail  now.  I  am

not,  however, going to accept the situation  with

complacency,  as  he  did not  extend  to  me  the

courtesy  of leaving me time to reply. I may  give

him  a  reply in the Press or perhaps  during  the

debate on the Pioneer industry legislation, if Mr

Speaker will give me latitude.

<div align="center"><b>(Registration refused or cancelled)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and Welfare to state -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) how many applications for registration as Trade

Unions  were refused between January  1948  and

October 1958, and the grounds of refusal; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) how many Trade Unions have had their

certificates of registration cancelled  by  the

Registrar  of  Trade Unions for not  submitting

their  annual returns for the year ending  31st

March, 1958, by 8th September, 1958.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Between April 1955 and October 1958 during

which  period  this  Government  has  been   in

office,  five applications for registration  as

trade  unions were refused under section 14  of

the  Trade Unions Ordinance (Cap. 154)  on  the

ground  that the Registrar of Trade Unions  was

not  satisfied that they had complied with  the

provisions   of  the  Ordinance   or   of   the

Regulations made thereunder. This Government is

not responsible for action taken before it came

into office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Eight Certificates of Registration were

cancelled by the Registrar of Trade Unions  for

not  submitting  their annual returns  for  the

year ending 31st March. 1958, by 8th September,

1958.

<div align="center"><b>(Assault on suspects)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  he  is  aware  of allegations  that  suspects

rounded up by the Police are assaulted inside police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



vehicles en route to police stations, and if  he  will

cause an investigation to be made into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> I am aware of two such allegations,

both  of which have already been investigated. In  the

first  case the investigation revealed that the  complaint could not be substantiated. In the second  case

the   allegation   of   assault  was   confirmed   and

appropriate disciplinary action has been taken against

the two police constables concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Financial

Secretary,  in view of the distress reported  to  have

been  experienced  by an accused in a  Traffic  Court,

when  his  payment of a fine exceeding two dollars  in

one  cent coins was at first not accepted, if he  will

consider  issuing  instructions to  revenue-collecting

Government Departments to accommodate members  of  the

public as far as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Cases of this nature are of very

infrequent   occurrence  and  it  is  not   considered

necessary to issue instructions concerning them. Large

quantities of coins can always be exchanged for  notes

at the office of the Currency Commissioners.

Accounts  Committee (Sessional Paper No.  L.A.  17  of

1958),  and  what  steps have been taken  to  date  to

recover the overpayments.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> It is not considered appropriate

that  the  names  of the two persons  referred  to  in

paragraph  38  of  the First Report  from  the  Public

Accounts  Committee (Sessional Paper No.  L.A.  17  of

1958)  should  be made public at this stage  when  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Commerce and Industry if he is aware of any opposition

by  ship-owners' organisations and seamen's unions  to

the  compulsory medical examination required under the

provisions  of  section  44 of the  Merchant  Shipping

Ordinance (Cap. 207), and what action he has taken  or

proposes to take in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am not aware of any opposition

by shipowners' organisations or seamen's unions to the

principle  of compulsory medical examination  required

under  section 44 of the Merchant Shipping  Ordinance,

Chapter  207. Subsequent to the receipt of  notice  of

this   question  however  I  have  received  a  letter

disagreeing  with  this legislation from  the  Malayan

National   Seamen's  Union,  which  union  being   now

defunct, I propose to take no action on the letter.

<div align="center"><b>(Discrimination; Signing of agreements)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Commerce and Industry whether -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Seamen's Registry Board, in supplying

registered  seamen  to employers,  discriminates

against seamen who are members of unions;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) he will arrange for permission to be given for

an  official  of  the union to  which  a  seaman

belongs  to be present when the seaman signs  an

"agreement with the crew"; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) he will arrange for a copy of such agreement to

be provided to the seaman concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The answers are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Certainly not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Union officials can be and are allowed to be

present  outside  the counter  in  the  Shipping

Office  when  seamen  are  signing  Articles  of

Agreement.  Provided good reasons are  furnished

to   the   Shipping  Office  and  upon   written

application  by  the  seamen  themselves,  Union

officials may be present behind the counter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) There is no legal provision for such a

procedure,  but  the  law does  require  however

that  the  Agreement be read over and  explained

by  the  Port  Officer to each  seaman.  At  the

commencement  of  every voyage,  the  Master  is

also  bound by law to post up a legible copy  of

the Agreement in some part of the ship which  is

accessible  to  the  crew. This  arrangement  is

being  observed and has been found to work  very

satisfactorily on all British ships  since  1854

and   conforms   with   international   shipping

practice.

<div align="center"><b>(Import ban)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Commerce and Industry whether he will consider lifting

the  ban on the import of cottons into Singapore  from

China.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It will be recalled that when

the  Federation  requested our  co-operation  in  this

matter it was for a period of three months pending the

finalisation of the Federation's anti-dumping  law  to

protect its industries. It was on this basis that  the

Singapore   Government  agreed  to  the   Federation's

request.   The  Singapore  Government  will  therefore

review  this suspension at the end of the year in  the

light  of  the  circumstances then  existing  and  the

progress of the Federation's anti-dumping legislation.

Meanwhile, import licences which have been  issued  up



to the date of the ban are confirmed without hindrance

on proof of commitment before the ban.

<div align="center"><b>TRADE MISSION TO CHINA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Permission)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Commerce and Industry whether he will permit  a  Trade

Mission  from Singapore to go to China to improve  the

trade relations between the two countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In general the policy of my

Ministry  is  to  encourage visits of  trade  missions

either from abroad or from Singapore with a view



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



to  improving  trade relations and thereby  increasing

trade.  The  purpose  of  trade  missions  however  is

generally  to  expand sales in the countries  visited,

but  since  it  is  the Chinese People's  Government's

express  policy  to  trade on  a  basis  of  bilateral

agreements,  thus  purchasing  direct  from  producing

countries  rather than through an entrepôt, and  since

we  have  no  products of our own in  which  we  could

expand  our sales to China, Government considers  that

no economic advantage to Singapore will be gained by a

trade mission to China at present.
