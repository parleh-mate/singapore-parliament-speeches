<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee.





<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 41-<cont.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The original Question was,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A20, line 13, after "(1)" to insert "No person shall wear, use, carry

or  display or cause to he worn, used, carried or displayed any symbol,  set  of

colours,  flag, banner or placard as political propaganda during the  period  of

any referendum:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the use or

display of any symbol, set of colours, flag, banner or placard on the day and at

the site of a referendum meeting.".



<br><br>Since which an amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out the words proposed to be inserted and insert "No badge, symbol,

rosette, favour, set of colours, flag, banner, advertisement, handbill,  placard

or  poster  or  any  replica of a ballot paper shall be worn, used,  carried  or

displayed  by  any  person  or  on any motor-car, truck,  or  other  vehicle  as

political propaganda on polling day".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I was explaining how it would be very difficult for us to canvass if we were not allowed posters, banners and placards. Sir, when you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 796</b></font><br><br>



want  to  communicate with the masses, the commonest way, as you  know,  at  the

prescnt moment, is by way of the newspapers, the radio and Rediffusion.  So  far

as  we  know,  orders have been given to newspapers that at least two-thirds  of

newspaper  space be given to Government Benches and only one-third of  newspaper

space  be  given  to Opposition Benches. Since we have been limited  under  such

circumstances, Sir, we will have to depend on other means of communication  with

the  public,  and  one of these very important means is by the  use  of  posers,

placards and banners. The use of posters, placards and banners can be seen  this

way,  Sir. When you have a mass rally or a referendum meeting, you speak to  the

parsons  who can come to listen to you. There are many persons in Singapore  who

may not be able to attend rallies because the time is not suitable, because they

may  have  to  do work or because of the distance between their  homes  and  the

places  at  which rallies are held. Under those circumstances,  the  only  other

means  left for us to communicate with the masses would be by means of  posters,

banners  and  placards. On the banners, on the placards and on  the  posters  we

shall  be  able to tell the people what we may not be able to tell them directly

by  word  of mouth. It is imperative that this be allowed in order that  we  may

really  and  truly communicate with the masses and let them know what  we  would

like them to know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has already explained that canvassing would

be  allowed  as  in  general elections and when I asked him last  night  whether

rallies  would be allowed in parks, playgrounds and other places which  are  now

prohibited,  he  said,  "Yes."  In other words,  places  like  Hong  Lim  Green,

Fullerton  Square and other parks and playgrounds will be available to political

Parties  for  the holding of rallies when canvassing starts for the  referendum.

Sir,  all  these  localities are available to political Parties at  least  three

months  before the date of a general election. Today we know that the referendum

will  probably  be  held  either at the end of July or early  August.  There  is

already a guillotine on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 797</b></font><br><br>



our  debate  in order that the Prime Minister may sell the rights  of  Singapore

down  the  river on time. Therefore, if we were to ask for the use of  Fullerton

Square  and Hong Lim Green at this moment, the Government should have no  reason

to  reject  our  applications for the use of these places. Yet,  we  have  their

curious official explanation as to why they have disallowed three public rallies

which  have  been requested for by the Council of Joint Action.  Concerning  the

application for the use of Dhoby Ghaut, they say that the details have not  been

sent  in; so they cannot give the answer. As regards the application for a rally

in  Colombo  Court, they say that it is too near the precincts of the  Assembly.

Then as regards the application to hold a rally at Fullerton Square, I will read

the  explanation given by the Government, Sir, It is in the Malay Mail of today,

col. 7:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government statement explained that application for Fullerton Square

rally  was refused because meetings there during office hours were allowed  only

during election time.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is already referendum time. Election time means three months before

the date of the general election. If the Ministers are sincere in their granting

of  canvassing  as  in  a  general election, then  they  have  no  justification

whatsoever  for  refusing us the use of Fullerton Square at the present  moment,

unless  they  want  to give us a promise that the referendum will  not  be  held

within the next three months.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will



give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I thought I heard the Member saying that an election

campaign starts three months before polling day. Did he say that? If so, will he

quote an authority for this statement?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I think the Minister is talking with his tongue in his

cheek. He knew what happened during the 1959 elections. The campaign started,  I

think, even four months before polling day of general elections, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 798</b></font><br><br>



former  Chief Minister can confirm it right here. I do not have to quote chapter

and  verse  every time. I do not carry a library with me. Surely,  the  Minister

does  not expect me to carry a whole library with me every time I come  here  to

speak. He must know better than that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Will the Member please say whether during the series of pre-election meetings we had whether we ever mounted a platform in Fullerton Square?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I will tell you the story about Fullerton Square-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Say yes or no.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -because at that time I was in the Ministry of Home Affairs-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Answer the question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see in previous by-elections, rallies could only be

held  in the division where the by-election was to be held. You see in the  case

of  Hong Lim, Fullerton Square is outside Hong Lim and therefore, by right,  any

rally in Fullerton Square should not have been allowed. But then, Sir, the Prime

Minister, being the Prime Minister, can do anything that he likes. He gazetted a

notice  saying  that Fullerton Square was allowed because it was on  a  national

issue,  or because the P.A.P. wanted to explain more things to the people.  That

was  exactly how it was done. It was done overnight, Sir, I was quite surprised.

We  in  the  P.A.P. at that time complained to him of his dictatorial  abuse  of

powers,  because  we  thought it would be unfair to do things  arbitrarily  like

that. For example, on many occasions when meetings were held and when they  were

supposed to terminate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 799</b></font><br><br>



by a certain time, say 10 p.m., just because our Prime Minister was speaking, he

could  extend  it  to 10.30 p.m. In the case of permits up to 2  p.m. he  would

extend it to 2.30 p.m. They always went beyond the time allotted whenever-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member has not given way. The Minister will be able

to speak later.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will give him a chance to explain, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I asked a simple question, "yes" or "no"? It is not a

question of whether he likes. I said, "Did we during the three months before the

last general election hold meetings in Fullerton Square?" Yes or No?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> He has been trained by the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see how the P.A.P. can twist and distort. Whenever the

argument suits them, "This is a general Referendum Bill." When the argument does

not suit them, "This is a specific Bill."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown gave way on a point of

elucidation,  and  the  point of elucidation has been  raised.  The  Member  for

Queenstown now either answers it or says he does not wish to answer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes or no?

That is all I ask.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In the case of the P.A.P., in spite of their being a

minority Government, they will still be able to do whatever they want to do.  If

they want to allow us to hold a rally, they will say, "Yes." If they do not want

to,  they  will say, "No." This is an abuse of power, and it is because  of  the

lack  of  human material that parliamentary democracy in this part of the  world

has failed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 800</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need these posters, banners and placards to inform the people of the

true  position  because, as has already been indicated by  the  Government,  the

questions  which they want to pose in the referendum will be more or less  on  a

party  to  party basis. And they have distorted the Opposition's stand  to  mean

completely - am I out of order?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to hear what is said first.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to

explain  that since the P.A.P. have all the time been boosting their own version

of the P.A.P.'s stand on merger and distorting the Opposition's stand, if we are

not allowed the same facilities to canvass and to tell the people, then only the

falsehoods of the P.A.P. Government will be made known to the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have already remarked right through the course of this

debate  that  there  has  been a great deal of repetition,  and  repetition,  of

course,  eats  into time. I think the Member for Queenstown was very  vociferous

when  there  was  the debate on the guillotine motion. I would suggest  that  if

there  has  not been and will not be any repetition. Members will probably  find

that  the  time allotted will be quite sufficient to complete all the amendments

that we have to go through today.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, since the Minister for Health and Law is here,

I  want a categorical answer whether or not we in the Opposition will be allowed

to  hold rallies in parks, children's playgrounds and Fullerton Square as  in  a

general  election,  i.e. at least two or three months before  the  date  of  the

referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Forgive me for pressing this, Mr Speaker, but I really rise on

a  matter of elucidation. I would first point out that we have had no indication

why  it is necessary to have this provision preventing these five articles  from

being utilised during the period of propaganda. That is one. Two: I have pointed

out,  Sir, that having, say, this placard showing the sign of the Workers' Party

outside  our headquarters is political propaganda, although it is not  referable

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 801</b></font><br><br>



the  referendum. It is unfortunate that they have not sought to  substitute  the

word "referendum" for "political" here because it would make criminal those whom

they  have no intention, I am satisfied, to attack. Now, Sir, further than that,

I  would also ask you to notice this: the amendment under this clause refers  to

five articles: (1) a symbol; (2) a set of colours; (3) a flag; (4) a banner; and

(5)  a  placard.  Now,  Mr Speaker, if you will look  at  the  next  amendment,

amendment (ii) to clause 41, it seeks to leave out the same.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> What about rosettes?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> All these are dealt with and they are purely for the purposes of

polling day. It seems to me, Mr Speaker, that there is one other matter I would

like  to  obtain clarification on. Do the Government distinguish between placard

and poster, or do they say that those two mean the same thing? I do not know;  I

am really asking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a placard is something that you can carry

about.  It  may be the size of a poster in which there is a handle  for  you  to

carry it. A poster is something which you stick on the wall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, in answer to that, would the Minister look at his own

amendment,  which  is amendment (iv)*, to the same clause? There,  he  talks  of

anybody  carrying or displaying a poster, not a placard. If you carry a  placard

and  you  merely exhibit a poster, surely he has used the wrong term  there.  He

seems to use it interchangeably in the first amendment and the fourth amendment

- poster meaning placard, and placard meaning poster.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Amendment (iv), standing in the name follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) In page A20, line 20, at end, to add -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) No person other than the Superintendent shall make, print, publish, distribute, post up, wear, use,

carry or display or cause to be made, printed, published, distributed, posted

up, worn, used, carried or displayed any poster in connection with any

referendum during the period of any referendum."

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is obviously with respect to the display of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 802</b></font><br><br>



any poster during the period of the referendum. Only posters that are printed by

the Superintendent will be permitted to be displayed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we made an amendment to the provision in the

Singapore  Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance by which there is  specific

reference to prohibition with regard to the use of any badge, symbol,  rosette,

favour,  set  of  colours, flag, banner, advertisement, handbill,  placard,  or

poster,  or any replica of a ballot paper to be used on polling day itself.  In

fact.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in this amendment to this clause the provisions  with

regard  to the use of badges, rosettes, favours, advertisements -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What is a favour?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> - handbills and placards have been deleted for use in connection

with  a  referendum. This is the equipment which political Parties  use  in  the

course of their canvassing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What is a favour?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What is a favour? It is something that political Parties devise and

distribute  for  use by its members. That can be a favour;  anything  can  be  a

favour. Or sometimes, Mr Speaker, Sir, they give little children little symbols

which they exhibit on their clothing during the period of an election - those  are

favours.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Is it not a Ministry of Culture-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Like political badges, huh!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose the Minister for Law can say that a poster can be worn

or used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I mean it can be an eccentric circle like the Member for Anson is

wearing about him.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 803</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> A poster could be

worn?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, I suppose it could be worn like what we

see  the  cinemas do - sandwichmen. They are men who wear one poster in front  and

another at the back.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> With the man carrying a hammer!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That, of course, is what the Minister for Home Affairs calls a

placard.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Well, I think the best

thing is for somebody to offend and then the Judge decides.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He has not answered my question, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b>

They have not answered theirs yet.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No Minister is compelled to answer any question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I think there was an

assurance  given  yesterday by the Minister for Home  Affairs  that  during  the

period of the referendum the political Parties would be given the opportunity to

use  parks and playgrounds for the referendum meetings. That assurance was given

in this House yesterday. But no assurance is given that these facilities will be

open  to  political Parties three months before the referendum; but only  during

the period of the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be left out, be left out."

rise to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A21, to leave out lines 9 and 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind the House that these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 806</b></font><br><br>



are the lines I want left out:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'visit an elector on polling day at his home or place of work for any purpose

in connection with a referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, first let me indulge in the delightful gambit of reductio ad absurduin. I go to the Singapore Cold Storage Creameries on polling day and I

buy hot coffee and curry puffs for the counting agents of the Workers' Party  at

the  various counting stations. I have committed a criminal offence,  because  I

have  visited an elector. There is no doubt, Sir, that the adults  in  the  Cold

Storage  Creameries are Singapore citizens who are electors, and I have visited

them at their place of work, that is, the Singapore Cold Storage Creameries, for

a  purpose in connection with a referendum in that I am supplying refreshment to

a  person who is being engaged in referendum work. Let us take another instance,

Sir, I go and visit a friend in his home, and together we share a taxi to go  to

the  polling station. I have visited a person who is an elector in his own  home

for  a  purpose in connection with a referendum. I do not understand,  Sir, the

purpose  of  this extraordinary provision. The fact that it has no precedent  is

accepted. But that in itself, I agree, does not necessarily mean that it is bad.

The question is, what is it intended to meet and why is it so ineptly framed? As

it  stands, it is going to make everybody in Singapore a criminal, including the

P.A.P. only they will not be prosecuted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it  is  a  provision  taken word for word from the  Singapore  Legislative

Assembly Elections Ordinance, 1959. The whole purpose of this sub-clause  is  to

prohibit canvassing completely on polling day.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I did not get it. Could the Minister assist me

again? What section is it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Section 73A.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, in those circumstances, could I ask whether it

would be acceptable to the Minister if,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 807</b></font><br><br>



instead of the words "for any purpose" the words "for the purpose of canvassing"

be inserted?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is tautologous in view

of clause 43 (1) (a) which prohibits all forms of canvassing on referendum day.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is rather delightful, Sir. We are told that the purpose is

to  prevent canvassing and when it is suggested that those words be used, we are

told,  "Well,  we  are already covered by clause 43 (1) (a). So  that  would  be

tautologous." If that is the purpose and the purpose is tautologous, then  I  am

sure  the  Minister  will  agree  with me that logic  requires  he  supports  my

amendment. I trust that logic will carry the day for a change.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No. I think it is necessary for a clause which prohibits all forms

of  canvassing  to  include in the same clause a prevision that  all  visits  to

electors  at their homes or places of work on referendum day in connection  with

the referendum should be prohibited and punished as an offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.

displayed and badge, rosette or favour in connection with a referendum."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in allowing the use and display of badges, rosettes or

favour  during the referendum period, it is necessary to have this provision  to

prohibit their use on polling day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there was a similar provision in the case of elections on polling day.

in contrast with an irresponsible Government which will not listen to logic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move [amendment (iv)],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A2l, line 13, at end, to add -

<pre>



  Cap. 132.        "(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of the

                   Criminal Procedure Code  relating  to  the

                   powers of search of any police  officer,  if  any

                   police  officer has reasonable cause to believe

                   that an offence  is  being committed  under the

                   provisions of this section, the said officer  by

                   virtue  of his office shall be empowered to enter

                   and search any premises  or place  for  the

                   purpose of ascertaining whether such an offence

                   is  being committed."

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this sub-clause (3) is to empower any police officer who "has reasonable

cause to believe that an offence is being committed under the provisions of this

section"  to  enter  and  search any premises  or  place  for  the  purpose  of

ascertaining whether the offence of canvassing is being committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From previous experience, it was found difficult to prove that such canvassing

was  taking  place  under the provisions of the Singapore  Legislative  Assembly

Elections Ordinance and therefore this amendment is introduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

Government is always ready to add to its police powers without right of  redress

from  the  Court.  The Minister emphasised "if a police officer  has  reasonable

cause to believe". Who is to judge that? Of course, the police officer. Who is a

police officer? Anybody from a constable upwards. Good show!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, he will be empowered to go into any home and into any office at his

will and pleasure to indulge in inquisitorial activities. Why? Mr Speaker,  we

are  not unconscious - in fact, we are all too conscious - of the activities of this

Government in abusing the powers it has for intimidatory





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 809</b></font><br><br>



purposes. I say to you that this provision is

the  seed  of  the possible abuse of the police for political intimidation.  The

offences  that  it  is  sought to unearth are not of that  gravity  which  would

normally  require the utilisation of power of search. If you will  notice,  Sir,

Section  73A of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance to  which

the  Minister referred me, there is no power to go in and search. The only power

is  to  arrest  if the offence is committed in the view of a police  officer - not

even otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not like these additional powers. I do not consider they are necessary.

In  the context of our experience of the conduct of this Government, I say it is

not unreasonable to assume that they may be abused.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we

strongly  oppose the addition of this sub-clause especially when the  Government

have  passed  unreasonable  clauses to ensure that they  will  always  win.  The

addition of such a sub-clause goes to show that the Government intend to use it

to  deal  a blow at the people who do not support them and also against  Members

sitting  on  this side of the House. The police officers should be  employed  in

other  fields. They should use their power in a more useful way. The  Government

should make use of policemen on criminal offences, such as thefts and robberies.

etc. It is not right to give the police such powers as are embodied here because

the  P.A.P. and their supporters may suppress our supporters with the  help  of

police  officers. For instance, police officers can always resort to the powers

given  under  sub-clause (3) to enter any home or place of work to  disturb  our

supporters and cause trouble to us by searching for documents, papers, and other

things  in our premises. We know this from experience when we found it necessary

to  carry  out publicity work to educate the people. If the Government  want  to

suppress  and persecute any of our members, they will find it easy to resort  to

the powers provided in this sub-clause. That is why I say that after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 810</b></font><br><br>



the  Government  have  passed  clause 29 and  other  unreasonable  clauses,  the

addition  of  this  sub-clause is unnecessary. It is very  wrong  to  have  this

provision in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move [amendment (v)],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A21, line 17, at end, to add-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(5) For the purposes of this section any

person  who  enters  or is seen at more than two houses or  places  of  work  of

electors in the same polling district other than his own home or place  of  work

on  polling  day,  shall, unless he proves the contrary,  be  presumed  to  have

committed  an  offence under paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection  (1)  of  this

section.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a clause which presumes that any person who enters

or  is  seen to enter more than two houses or places of work of electors in  the

same  polling  district - I wish to repeat "in the same polling district" -  other

than  his own home or place of work on polling day, shall, unless he proves  the

contrary, be presumed to have committed an offence of canvassing. The purpose of

this new amendment is to make detection and production of evidence of canvassing

easier.  From  past  experience, it was found that it was almost  impossible  to

produce such evidence. As the Member for Anson has said just now, the police can

only  make  an arrest if the offence is committed in his view. Unless  there  is

this  presumption  clause, it will be almost impossible for  the  police  to  do

anything.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr

Speaker, we are going to have a field day on polling day. Every single political

opponent whom they dislike can be arrested by the P.A.P. because there is not  a

single human being I should imagine who does not on the same day visit more than

two  places in the same polling district. I will not refer you, Sir,  merely  to

salesmen who go from house to house and from shop to shop. I will not refer  you

merely  to the housewife who goes to one shop in Orchard Road, another  shop  in

Orchard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 811</b></font><br><br>



Road,  another shop for flowers in Orchard Road, another shop to have a  cup  of

coffee;  she  is presumed and is required to be arrested. Sir, we  have  reduced

legislation to the point of a farce.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, this new sub-clause is the more absurd because the  previous

amendment  allowed the police to search any premises or place which  the  police

suspect.  With this new sub-clause, it means if the police go into  premises  to

search  and  if nothing incriminating is found, then the people whom the  police

have  searched  will  be asked to prove that they have not done  anything  wrong

although  they  have not committed any offence. Now this is very ridiculous  and

absurd. This National Referendum Bill is infringing on and destroying the  basic

rights  of  our  citizens. This sub-clause proposed by  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs will even infringe on the normal freedom of our citizens in their  daily

activities. If the

P.A.P. Government want to make use of this sort of absurd provision to safeguard

democracy,  then  the peopie will ask: how much is this sort of democracy  worth

per katty?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has worked himself up to

such  a passion over the provision which is so necessary for the enforcement  of

the  law against canvassing on polling day. All that this sub-clause does is  to

lay  down a legal presumption that if one is found going into two or more houses

or  places  of work of electors in the same polling district on referendum  day,

one  is  presumed  to be canvassing. It is just a presumption and  it  does  not

follow  that  one  is convicted just because one does that. One  can  then,  Mr

Speaker.  Sir,  be  given  the  opportunity  of  proving  the  contrary.   These

presumptions are found in all legislation dealing with the enforcement of  laws,

Mr Speaker. It is not anything new that we are introducing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 812</b></font><br><br>



tied  hand  and  foot  by  the Government. Even our mouths  are  gagged  by  the

Government.  This  sort  of Government is worse than the Hitler  Government.  If

Hitler were alive today, then he would have to learn from the P.A.P.

This sort of democracy is ridiculous and absurd. On polling day, if women living

in  the  rural areas are caught in the rain when they are on their way  to  cast

their  votes, where will they go for shelter? If they meet their friends on  the

road, of course, they will be able to go to their friends' houses to get shelter

from  the  rain.  Now, can we say that these women have committed  an  offence?

Therefore,  I  say  the  whole National Referendum  Bill  is  absurd.  The  most

important  part  of the Bill is the clause on blank votes. I hope  the  Minister

concerned can give us an explanation as to why there should be such a provision.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr

Speaker,  the  Minister for Law expresses surprise that  I  should  fly  into  a

passion.  May  I, Sir, draw your attention to the existing clause 43  (3)?  What

will  happen to a lady with her shopping basket who goes first to Lim  Koon  Ann

and then goes to Prince's Flower Shop? She has been found in two "places of work

of electors in the same polling district" - places which are other than her home

or her place of work. What happens to her, Sir? Let me read sub-clause (3):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any police officer [an officer includes a constable] may arrest without

warrant  any person offending in his view against any of the Provisions of  this

section  and take him before Magistrate's Court to be dealt with according  to

law.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the lady can be forthwith arrested and she will be taken to the police

station. If it happens to be a Saturday

- and  it happens after Court hours - she will be detained in the police station

until  she  gives  bail. Then she will be released until  the  following  Monday

morning,  when she will have to appear and a date will be fixed for  hearing  on

the  charges  against her and thereafter she will have to defend  herself  as  a

person  presumed to be a criminal, not according to the law which  we  have  the

privilege of having inherited - and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



which  the P.A.P. seeks to sully in this fashion - that a person is deemed  to  be

innocent  until he is proved guilty. Here she is deemed to be guilty  until  she

proves herself innocent. So, Sir, why should a man get excited if all non-P.A.P.

citizens  in Singapore can be arrested, can be taken to the police station,  can

be produced in a Magistrate's Court, can then be prosecuted and can be subjected

to  this  persecution, although they are decent and law-abiding  and  have  done

nothing wrong except pursue their normal vocations, exercise their normal  right

of going shopping and doing their normal work on polling day? Why should one get

excited?



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are perfidious provisions in this Bill. The very spirit of the Bill is perfidious. But I do want to say this, and I do not think I am

exaggerating. To make everybody in Singapore a presumptive criminal is even more

perfidious than the clause which says that all negative votes shall be deemed to

be positive. Sir, this sub-clause that takes it as a matter of course that every

Singapore  citizen  by definition is a criminal is the most perfidious  thing  I

have  seen. Sir, you will forgive me if I take up the time of this House to call

for a division in respect of this clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, according to

the  general  law  existing in Singapore, for example, if the  police  arrest  a

person  who  is  suspected of robbery, they have to produce enough  evidence  to

prove  his crime in Court. Only if there is ample evidence to prove his criminal

activity  can  he  be deemed a criminal and be convicted. But according  to  the

words in this sub-clause "unless he proves the contrary", a person seen entering

more  than  two  houses or places of work will have to prove  that  he  has  not

committed an offence. This sub-clause is contrary to the general law prevailing in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



country.  It  also  goes to prove that the police are incompetent  because  they

cannot produce ample evidence and they have to ask the suspected person to prove

his  innocence,  it  looks  as if the Government are  going  to  deal  with  its

political  opponents  in  an  unfair manner by using  this  provision.  If  this

provision  is  passed, there may be an atmosphere of fear on  polling  day,  and

electors will be forced to cast their votes in an atmosphere of fear on  polling

day. When an elector goes to cast his vote, he cannot enter more than two houses

to talk to the people living in them on polling day. On that day, if a person on

his  way  to  the  polling  station enters a coffee shop  to  buy  a  packet  of

cigarettes, and at the same time has a chit-chat with the shopkeeper, and  after

that  because he forgets to buy a box of matches, he enters a grocer's  shop  to

buy  it and if at the same time he talks to the shop, keeper, then by virtue  of

this  provision, he can be deemed as having committed an offence because he  has

entered more than two shophouses and talked to the different shopkeepers. He can

be accused of canvassing and therefore the police can arrest him. But the police

cannot  produce  ample  evidence, and, therefore, he is required  to  prove  his

innocence. This provision is very unfair and infringes upon the individual  freedom of the citizens. I oppose it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, amendments (iv)* and (v)+ were introduced

because  of experience in past elections. Numerous complaints have been received

in  the  past  that canvassing took place on polling day despite the  fact  that

there  was  a  prohibition on canvassing activities. The  police  officers  were

helpless to deal with such breaches of the law as they had to catch the culprits

red-handed.

Speaker, Sir, if we are sincere in wanting to prohibit canvassing completely  on

polling  day,  then we must see to it that such prohibition can  be  effectively

enforced. It is no use supporting prohibition on canvassing on polling day while

at the same time no provision is made for its effective enforcement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints of intimidation and canvassing were well known in the past, and if

there  is  still  any  conscience left in the Barisan Sosialis  Members  of  the

Assembly,  they  will  admit that the assistance of secret  societies  had  been

sought by unscrupulous politicians in the past-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> - to canvass for the support of voters by intimidation and

instilling  fear  into the hearts of the voters. Take the Hong Lim  by-election,

for  instance,  which took place in 1961. The Barisan Sosialis  Members  of  the

Assembly  were  then on this side of the Floor, and they knew that  considerable

canvassing activities took place despite the prohibition. In fact, some of  them

made  reports  to the Police at that time. The Hong Lim by-election  is  a  good

example because many of the Member for Hong Lim's canvassers happened also to be

ex-P.A.P. members  and therefore they were easily identified.  Complaints  were

made to the Police but they were-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> On

a point of clarification, Mr Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member will be able to speak later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Numerous complaints were made to the police, as I said, but

the  police  officers were just helpless. Nothing could be done. There  were  no

less  than five or six elections in the past and there was not a single instance

where the police were able to apprehend the culprit on polling day. From this, I

think  Members of the House will realise that it is almost impossible to enforce

prohibition on polling day unless we have this presumptive clause.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I, just want to clarify what happened in

the  Hong  Lim by-election. I had been in the P.A.P. since its formation  and  I

knew  most  of the members of the P.A.P. During the Hong Lim by-election  I  saw

more  P.A.P. members than anyone else going on a house-to-house canvassing  even

on  polling day. We had never authorised people to canvass. You see, the  P.A.P.

canvassers in those days had identification marks

- lieutenants had one red ball-point pen, colonels had one red and one blue ball-point  pens,  generals had two red and one blue ball-point pens. And  we  picked

them all out, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Get the Member for Queenstown to confirm!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> They were all

issued free of charge from businessmen.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am surprised, Sir, at the Minister for Home Affairs

talking of conscience. If the P.A.P. Ministers had any conscience left in  them,

they  would not try to push through this Referendum Bill. The whole of Singapore

are  against  them  on  this particular Bill. Whatever their  ideology  may  be,

whatever  their  political stand and beliefs may be. For the Minister  for  Home

Affairs to talk of conscience makes one laugh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this clause here says anybody who enters or is seen to enter will be

presumed  to  have  committed an offence. This additional clause,  if  you  will

remember,  is  an  entirely  new  clause and  is  not  found  in  the  Singapore

Legislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance, and has been put in  because  of  the

P.A.P. plot  to  force  the  voters  to choose  between  alternatives.  Even  if

canvassing  were to take place on the final day, I do not think  it  would  have

made  any difference, Sir, If you remember, in Select Committee we thrashed this

out  in  some detail, and it was pointed out to the Ministers that long  before

polling day the people had already made up their minds. So what difference  does

it make whether canvassing is really done on polling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



day  or not? That is just to argue against the allegation that people who  visit

houses will be canvassing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have all the time been stressing on one thing - that we have been denied

our  democratic rights. And what do we see here? Anybody who is seen entering  a

house is already presumed to be committing an offence.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Or of place of work.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What sort of

democracy  is  this?  What  sort of freedom are we supposed  to  get?  Just  the

P.A.P.'s  democracy and the P.A.P.'s freedom. Anybody who happens  to  be  doing

business or paying a social call will be presumed to be canvassing. As you know,

Sir,  the police have already been used on many occasions to intimidate  workers

and  to  prevent workers from even holding meetings. And the fear we have  about

this  clause is that abuse of this clause will lead to further intimidation  and

the  destruction  of  democracy.  The  Minister  talks  of  experience  in  past

elections. The Member for Hong Lim knows more about abuse or experiences than he

knows.  But surely the Minister is not contending that our running along to  pay

social  calls  on that particular day will make much difference to  our  present

type of referendum.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, in actual fact, allowing canvassing under the circumstances will have no

meaning.  They are relaxing on canvassing simply because they have this sure-win

plot in clause 29.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us not

have  all that over and over again. Here is a clause which raises a presumption.

Let us argue for or against that presumption.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As I said, Sir, what we fear about this presumptive clause

is  that  there  will  be grave misuse and abuse of the powers.  And  from  past

experience we know that the P.A.P. will be using this clause in such a way as to

make  a  mockery  of democracy. This clause is open to a lot of interpretations,

and from the abuse that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



follows such different interpretations, it will actually mean a curfew in  Singapore on polling day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the passing

of this clause will mean that on referendum day the P.A.P. wants everybody to be

dead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we know this clause gives police officers too great a power. If

your  memory  is  good,  you  will remember that the Assembly  has  amended  the

definition  of  a "police officer". From what I know, before the definition  was

amended, a "police officer" meant a police inspector or the Police Commissioner.

But  with  the  amendment, the P.A.P. has amended the  definition  to  mean  any

policeman. Therefore, applying that definition to this clause, we see  that  any

policeman, irrespective of his political affiliations, will have the  power  to

arrest anybody who commits an offence under this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to procedure in the judiciary, if a person commits

an  offence it is up to the police to charge the offender in court, that  is  to

say, the police must bring up the charge against the offender in court, and also

to produce evidence. And in prosecuting, the police must at least be represented

by a police officer who must produce the evidence to prove his charge. But under

this  clause the Government is going against common judiciary procedure.  It  is

not the accuser who has to produce the evidence but the accused who has to prove

his innocence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has every day been crying out in defence of legal

procedure,  but  at  the  same time, as we can see from this  clause,  they  are

disrupting  the  rule  of  law.  This procedure for  prosecution  is  completely

unacceptable  to  us.  It  is  also an infringement  on  personal  freedom.  For

instance, a teacher finds that his student has committed a dishonest act  in  an

examination. Now, he must produce evidence before he can punish the student. And

according to the definition laid down by Government, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



student  must  himself produce evidence to show that he has not  committed  this

dishonest act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this kind of provision of the law can only be made by the

P.A.P.  Government  which has no serious regard for the law. According  to  this

amendment,  of which we are very much afraid, during the poll on the referendum,

the  Government allows only the Superintendent to supervise the proceedings. But

every  Opposition Party has its offices, and there will be a lot of  workers  in

each  of  these  offices. Those workers may be transferred from  one  office  to

another. Accordingly the Opposition workers will be prosecuted by the provisions

of  this  clause, unless they can prove that they have not been  canvassing  and

have not infringed any of the clauses in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear that in a referendum, unlike in a general election, there are no candidates, and the Government will do all the work of the

referendum.  Since it is like this there is no necessity for  the  inclusion  of

this clause. Therefore, we can see very clearly the motive of the Government and

the plot behind it in bringing out this clause. The Government are making use of

this  clause to deal with their political opponents, that is, those who  do  not

agree  with the P.A.P. The Government will be able to use this clause  for  this

type of suppressive act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the reply of the Minister for Home Affairs was to

the  effect  that  according to past experience in the elections,  there  was  a

necessity for adding this clause. He also pointed out that in the Hong  Lim  by-election  certain  things  took place which make the inclusion  of  this  clause

necessary. Mr Speaker, Sir, are the P.A.P. Government adding this clause  after

their  experience in the Hong Lim by-election? I can see it is not like this  at

all, if the explanation of the Minister for Home Affairs is well founded on  the

Hong Lim by-election, such incidents took place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs should have amended the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance before the Anson by-election and added this clause

82



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



to that Ordinance. The addition of this clause is not for the purpose of preventing  other  political Parties from canvassing on polling day or influencing  the

voters  in their decision on the referendum, but the Government's real intention

is  to  take  action, through this clause, to deal with those  people  whom  the

P.A.P. do not like.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  for  Home Affairs has pleaded that we should give powers  which  would

provide  effective  enforcement of the provision against canvassing  on  polling

day.  Let  us see how this clause will work if it is passed. Imagine  me  for  a

moment,  Sir, to  be one of those deep-dyed cleverly trained subversive  P.A.P.

cadres. I am trained to go on polling day with contempt for the law in order  to

canvass house-to-house for the P.A.P. point of view. I go into one house  and  I

say,  "If you do not vote for this referendum, you know what the Government will

do?"  I come out and I go into another house, and then let us assume that  there

is a policeman with courage enough to arrest the known P.A.P. canvasser and I am

arrested.  It  is  Saturday afternoon. I am taken to the police  station.  I  am

granted bail. I come back on Monday morning to the Magistrate's Court. A date is

fixed  for trial and in about two months I am tried. The evidence is given  that

the  police constable watched me as I went into house A, remained there for some

time, and I went into house B and I went into house C. Now, Sir, that is all the

evidence.  If  that  is  all the evidence, it means that  the  persons  who  are

resident in houses A, B and C or shops are not prepared to give evidence against

me.  Otherwise  there will be no need of a presumption and those  witnesses  can

come  forward and say, "This man came to our house and tried to canvass for this

referendum." There would be no need for this clause. So it is when  we  envisage

the  possibility  that  if  no  witnesses  are  forth, coming  to  support  the

prosecution's case, it means that those witnesses will be coming to support  the

defence  case  and  the defence case will be, "Oh yes, I went  to  house  A  and

inquired after his daughter's health; I went into house B in order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



to  have  a drink with an old friend of mine, and I went to house C in order  to

play  mahjong." And I call these people and they all say that it is true.  Where

is  the effectiveness of this clause? Quite seriously, the Minister, I see,  was

earnest,  and  in  his  earnestness he stumbled upon  a  horrible  provision,  a

provision  which  says that everybody shall be deemed to  be  guilty  unless  he

proves  himself innocent. Even then, Sir, does it provide an effective means  of

enforcing  this clause? The truth is it does not. Unless you can  get  evidence

from the persons who are approached by the canvassers, no amount of presumptions

are  going  to be of any weight. The Minister says that not a single person  has

been  apprehended  in the years past for this offence of canvassing  on  polling

day.  Surely  the Minister recognises that there can be two or more  answers  to

that.  First,  no such offence was committed. He says he knows  the  P.A.P. had

committed it. All right. I will accept his word for that. Second, if the offence

was committed, the police did not notice it. Third, if the police did notice it,

they  were  afraid to arrest the P.A.P. Now, Sir, a presumption is necessary  in

order  to  bring home a conviction to a person already apprehended, it does  not

help  you  to  apprehend  him. The Minister tells us that  no  person  has  been

apprehended for this offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law has made an extraordinary statement, considering that he is the Minister for Law, Sir. He says that this is in the tradition of presumptions of guilt which are to be found peppered in our law. I say to you with respect, Sir, I question that statement. There are presumptions of various kinds

but  never  a presumption of guilt of this character in respect of circumstances

which  are wholly consistent with innocence. Sir, can there be any circumstances

more  consistent with innocence that you should in a twenty-four day - let us make

it  a  twelve-hour day in order not to exaggerate - in a twelve-hour day that  you

should visit more than two homes or places of work in one polling district?  Can

you  imagine  anything more consistent with innocence than that?  Where  is  the

indication  of  guilt in the conduct of that character? Where in all  the  laws,

whether democratic or not, can the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>

Minister find me

a  presumption  which  makes all human beings in the  normal  pursuit  of  their

ordinary  activities,  criminals in the eyes  of  the  law,  unless  they  prove

themselves innocent? This is a horrible provision, Sir, I could see the value of

clause  29  to them. I am not going into it. But I could understand  the  Machiavellian  plan  behind it whereby the Government had to have  it  for  their  own

nefarious purpose. All right. They went through it with cold-blooded calculating

dishonesty.  They  need it. But this one is not necessary for their  plan.  This

clause  is  not necessary for a Machiavellian purpose. This clause is  merely  a

gratuitous  exhibition of inordinate sadism. This clause is totally unnecessary.

This  clause  merely proves in a manner beyond question the  incapacity  of  the

Government  to understand the elements not only of democracy but of the  concept

of criminal law that is inherent in respect for the human being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister speaks of conscience. Mr Speaker, I do not like to say this because the Minister may well in his private capacity be a man of complete

decency. I have no reason to think otherwise. But I do say to the Minister  that

in  the context of the present debate, the word "conscience" comes ill from  his

mouth.  I  say  this,  however necessary the other foul clauses  of  this  Bill,

however  necessary we might think it was to make an exhibition of the  potential

of  democracy for cold-blooded traitorous conduct towards their own people, this

is not necessary. There is no sense in pursuing this clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (in Mandarin):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I find it necessary to add something to our reason for objecting to this sub-clause.



<br><br>4.23 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision for a presumption as embodied in this sub-clause will cause

trouble  to  the person who is presumed to have committed an offence under  this

clause. Let us examine the person who is presumed to have committed the offence.

Let  us  see  what is the nature of the offence a person would presumably  have

committed. Does it mean that he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



has  destroyed any State property? Has he infringed on the personal  liberty  of

other  people?  Or has he attacked or done any harm or wounded anybody?  Has  he

slandered the reputation of any other citizen? No. It is not so. And yet to  presume  that  such a person has committed an offence the presumption is only  that

he has tried to influence the thoughts of other electors! For instance, can  he

influence anyone just by a chance meeting? The answer is no. That is impossible.

When  an elector goes into a polling station at the time of voting, nobody would

he  able  to threaten or intimidate him. That is why I say this presumed offence

is  in  fact groundless because this person has not done anything wrong. He  has

not  caused any damage to State property and has not infringed on the  right  of

freedom  of  any other citizen. Under such circumstances, why should the  Government  give  so much trouble to that person? The Government itself has  obviously

deprived the people of speech and freedom of expression by passing certain laws.

Why do the Government not provide some provision to make such an act an offence?

I  would  like  to  tell  this to the Ministers of the P.A.P.  The  people  will

remember  who  have committed offences. The people will know how to  deal  with

such people who have committed such offences against the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen, I do not wish to play the same old record again

and  again  like the Members of the Barisan Sosialis. I just want  to  be  brief

about  it.  The  purpose  of this amendment is to see that  the  prohibition  on

canvassing  on polling day would be effectively enforced. It is not  to  prevent

law-abiding citizens from their normal pursuit of earning their living. That  is

not  the  purpose. The examples quoted by the Member for Punggol and the  Member

for  Tampines are ridiculous. No sensible police officers will try to  interfere

[Laughter]. Those examples -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order. The Member for Upper Serangoon, not the Member for Tampines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes. Mr

Mammen, Sir, the Member for Upper Serangoon was saying that this is not a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



serious  offence. He said this is not an offence that infringes on the  security

of the nation. Mr Mammen, Sir, an election, or for that matter a referendum, is

a  national matter. If the true wishes of the people are to be ascertained, then

the  Government  must ensure that the referendum or the elections  are  properly

carried out. Knowing very well that the Communists and their stooges are  intent

on wrecking the referendum and thus trying to prevent merger and Malaysia taking

place,  it is not beyond their capacity, judging from past experience, to resort

to  all forms of canvassing by means of intimidation to get the voters to do the

things which they want them to do.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, let us examine again why the leaders of the P.A.P.

want  to  provide such a sub-clause as this in the National Referendum Bill.  We

can  see very clearly from this provision that the Government has been and  will

continue  to  be  very undemocratic and very unreasonable in  carrying  but  the

national  referendum. We can further see, from this provision, the  Government's

intention and its guilty conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, the Government has this provision in the National Referendum Bill for the purpose of carrying out an undemocratic national referendum and to

provide  for  occasions when there may be certain incidents when the proceedings

of  voting  cannot be continued, so that the Government may find scapegoats  for

not carrying out the national referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, you can see that this Bill is very unpopular, unconvincing and unacceptable to the people. We can also see that the leaders of the Party in

power  are  very,  very  cunning,  and that their  usual  trick  is  to  set  up

commissions  of  inquiry. That is what they are most clever in  doing,  but  in

future when their falsehoods and the true nature of the national referendum  are

disclosed  to  the people - when everybody can see through their acts - then  they

may set up again Commissions of Inquiry to cover up their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



shameful acts with regard to the provisions in this Bill. Their acts are usually

very ugly, and these are facts which everybody can see.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, today the fact is that the Government are bent on forcing

through  their White Paper merger proposals. They will resort to  all  kinds  of

tactics  and methods, however mean, to achieve their purpose. Through  this  provision, they try to explain that they want to better their relations between the

police and the people, but in fact it is to the contrary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that since the P.A.P. Government came to power, they have only

been  pretending to do good things. Though they have been giving wide  publicity

to  the  co-operation between the police and the people and co-operation between

all  classes,  the fact is that their true colours have been revealed.  For  the

purpose of forcing through their White Paper merger proposals, they even try  to

make use of police officers to achieve their purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, in the past, the relationship between the police and the

people  was very bad. Indeed, we could all see that. The people were  not  happy

about how the police carried out the policies of the colonial government and the

Lint  Yew Hock Government. The P.A.P. Government was aware of this. After coming

to  power the P.A.P. used to say that the people and the police should mix well,

and  the people should regard police officers as public servants. But today  the

addition of this provision in the National Referendum Bill is giving the  police

great  powers. There is such a provision here and I believe that all responsible

policemen will feel that such powers given to them are really a burden, and they

can  realise that the addition of such a provision is for the purpose of  asking

them  to arrest more people during a national referendum, especially those  whom

the  P.A.P. do not like. In other words, if there is a policeman more  liked  by

the  P;A.P. or an officer liked by the P.A.P. and eager to get promotion, he can

always  arrest more people to please the P.A.P. From this we can  see  that  the

plots and intrigues of the Government have been exposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, in the system of parliamentary democracy, the people have

democratic  rights. They elect their representatives in order to  improve  their

livelihood and to pass good laws to provide for good government. In deciding  on

any  matter  of national importance, the Government should let the people  take

part  in the decisions on such matters. The people will then be pleased if  they

are given such a chance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the matter before us is another chance for the Government to let the

people participate in deciding on matters of national importance, but the P.A.P.

Government are trying to make use of the Bill for the purpose of achieving their

own  ends  at  the  expense of the people, forcing them to  vote,  and  this  is

contrary  to the spirit of democracy. Everybody knows it very well, Mr  Mammen.

From this provision, we can see that on the day when the people go to cast their

votes  to decide their destiny, it should be a happy day for them to cast sacred

votes.  But  what  should be so will, instead, become a day of  terror  for  the

people, as they will not have the occasion to be merry because polling day  will

be  like  a curfew day to them. The P.A.P. are only trying to use good names  to

cover their shameful acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the P.A.P. used to accuse the Lim Yew Hock Government of showing

a  goat's head while selling dog's meat, but the P.A.P. Government are now doing

the same, that is, selling dog's meat while showing a goat's head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, I wish to point out to the Government leaders that to sup

press  by  force will not achieve good results. The people will not  succumb  to

force. The strength of the people will decide everything. They are confident  of

the future.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Mammen, we have wasted a lot of the time of this Assembly,

because  there  are, too many people who claim themselves to  be  champions  of

liberty  and  democracy. If we had counted we would have noted how  many  times

democracy  has been mentioned and that any step taken by the Government  is  not

democratic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I should also like to explain more of this in my future speeches; but now

I  would  just like to say this - they say that every law and procedure is anti-democracy,  because there is unity under that one law and one procedure.  "Nothing

can be done as one likes; this is to limit liberty," they say, because there  is

one  law.  Thus they say that this Bill is to limit their liberty.  Up  to  this

time, they have been free and independent to rob; now because there is a law  to

restrict  that freedom, they cannot do what they like. For a thief to  say  that

there  is  a  restriction on their liberty is not democratic; so  also  for  the

gangsters, the thieves and the robbers and so too for those who commit offences.

"There  is  no  democracy,"  they  say, "and the  purpose  of  this  law  is  to

retaliate." But because of this same law the public are at liberty to move about

and  to  liberate themselves from gangsters and evil-doers. Their peace in  life

will  not be interfered with because there is law and order. So the term  "good"

or  "bad"  of any arrangement or law depends on the motive of the person  making

use  of the law. If the mind of the person is dirty, then the interpretation  is

also  dirty. But there are some Members of the Barisan Sosialis, not the people,

who  have to be forced to see that there are Members of this Assembly who cannot

be forced. They are the persons who bring letters to compel people! We have seen

what  they  have done! Yet they protest against just anything, against  any  law

which  gives  freedom  to the people to think and so on: they  say  this  is  an

arrangement which restricts freedom and is not democratic!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem before us is a national problem. It is a national matter. It is a

thing  which  will decide our future and that of our children - a future  that  is

free  from  all suppression and evil influence - so that people can go  and  vote

according  to  their own feeling and conscience. I ask the Member for  Anson  to

say, if a person wants to buy meat here and fish there, or if a person goes to a

textile  store to buy cloth, whether all this is nonsense? If he  wants  to  buy

some fabric, surely it is reasonable. If we shake



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>

hands with a woman, for instance; if we are honest and do not have a guilty  conscience,  we do not think otherwise. It all depends on the motive of the  person

shaking  hands with the woman; and this can be proved. In the same way  too,  it

all depends on the mind of the person who interprets this law.,



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Parliamentary

Secretary to the Prime Minister is rather delightful, but I think he will  agree

with  me  that it would be undemocratic to pass a law to say that everybody  who

shakes  hands with a woman is to be presumed to do so lustfully and  criminally,

unless he proves the contrary. Ha, ha, ha! He must agree that, Sir. And this  is

what, in fact, this law is doing. You see, this law says that if a person enters

more than two places, whether a house or a place of work in the same polling district,  he  is  presumed to be a guilty person and he can  be  arrested.  It  is

presuming  it  and  that is why I say language has no meaning  if  this  is  not

undemocratic. I know he has his feelings and we should repeat it,  but  I  would

ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister to recognise, for example,

that the Singapore National Union of Journalists - it is not a Communist body, it

is  not  a Barisan body - but does he know that in their anxiety, they have  today

issued a public statement in which with moderation and with dignity they protest

against the undemocratic Referendum Bill, whereby they say the people are to  be

barred from expressing their free and frank will on constitutional propositions,

and where they are appealing to us, Members of the Assembly, to allow the people

of  Singapore to express the right to express their views freely and frankly  on

all constitutional issues?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I admire them for having had the courage to do this, since they are

employees  of  newspapers  whose proprietors with a healthy  eye  to  their  own

commercial  prosperity  have bowed their necks to the  yoke  of  Government  propaganda.  And  these men who have issued this appeal know that their  Committee

members  would  henceforth be pinpointed and singled  out  for  attack  by  this

Government,  and that they will thereby be deemed by their employers  to  be  an

embarrassment and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



may - probably  will - find  them in a position where their public-spirited  courage

will mean personal sacrifice and discrimination in their careers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister must bear with us. This is perhaps the occasion when we must refer to the basic concepts of democracy which

are  in  essence  the  basic concepts of decent relations between  man  and  his

fellowman. I think he will agree with me that apart from these issues,  we  have

not  been  unfair  in  our attitude towards the Government when  we  make  these

charges,  and  they come from various facets of the Opposition; they  come  even

from  a  Member  who  was loyal to her Party until the day before  yesterday.  I

really  cannot understand the insistence on this clause. The Minister  has  said

that  it will help the police. He knows very well that it can do no such thing.

It  is not giving the police the right to arrest somebody whom they suspect;  it

is  giving them the right to arrest anybody whom they want to. Can the  Minister

seriously  tell me that on polling day he will not go to three different  places

in  the  same  polling district? Can he really say that? Can any Member  on  the

Government  Benches tell me - tell this House - that on polling day he will  not  be

seen in more than two places in the same polling district? Does not every Member

on  the Government Benches recognise that there are thousands of people whom  he

respects  who  are  close to him, who are honest, decent  people,  who  will  on

polling day be going to more than two, places in the same polling district? Does

he  not recognise that those people are subject to immediate arrest? That is the

point at issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He would have us believe that society consists of only a few

innocent  people!  Mr Mammen, it is true that people do go shopping.  If  I  go

shopping  to three different places on polling day, it does riot follow  that  I

will be arrested. What I say to the Barisan is that if they are found organising

canvassing  in a big way, it is this section of the law which will enable  their

activities to be detected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



and  which will enable some meaning to be given to the prohibition of canvassing

on  referendum  day.  That  is  the purpose of this  section.  To  a  lawyer  of

distinction,  that  is clearly known and clearly apparent, but  the  Member  for

Anson  chose  to  pull  the wool over everybody's eyes and  make  all  sorts  of

emotional  appeals for his own glorification and in order to mislead Members  of

this House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As the Minister for Health and Law has clearly indicated,

the  whole design of this clause is aimed at the Barisan Sosialis boys.  Are  we

not human beings? Today, if there are people who can be worse than human beings,

they  are the Ministers opposite. The whole of Singapore condemn them. Can  they

deny  that?  Can they convince the people? If the Minister for Education  should

ever  go  back  to  Geylang West, I can assure him he  will  lose  his  deposit.[Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.  I hope this debate is not getting out of hand. If the Member for Queenstown will just address the Chair and ignore the interjections, he will not be so

furious.  I  hope  the Member for Queenstown will come to the amendment  we  are

debating  now.  So if there is any interjection, please look at  the  Chair  and

address the Chair; he will be more happy and comfortable.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I wish I could look at you all the time, Sir. But obviously

those  words from the Minister for Health and Law were meant to irritate all  of

us on this side of the House. Why should they put in a law for looking after the

Barisan Sosialis boys? Just because of the Barisan Sosialis boys, there  is  now

going  to  be a curfew and nobody can go to more than two places in any  polling

district, otherwise that person is presumed to have committed an offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had occasion to say that justice must not only be done but also

must be manifestly seen to be done. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Lee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is no justice in this Bill. All civic organisations

and  all respectable bodies in Singapore have come up openly against this  Bill.

But  that does not prevent the P.A.P. from steam-rollering this Bill through  in

spite of their being a minority Government now. I ask the Ministers on the Front

Benches to go back and search their conscience - if they ever had any. Possibly we

might he spared a further catastrophe.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said just flow, if the Barisan

Sosialis' and the Member for Anson arc really sincere in wanting to prohibit canvassing  completely  on  polling day, I would have expected  some  concrete  suggestions  to be put forward to see that this total prohibition could be enforced

effectively,   but   instead   there  is  not  only   no   concrete   suggestion-

[Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member

for  Anson has any point of elucidation or point of information, I am  sure  the

Minister for Home Affairs will give way. Mr Ong Pang Boon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Not only is

there no concrete suggestion forthcoming from the Member for Queenstown and  the

Member for Anson, but what the Government propose is asked to be deleted. How do

they expect this total prohibition of canvassing on polling day to be enforced?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Mammen, Sir, we have now spent about two hours discussing this  clause  and

the  time spent is worth our while - at least the Ministers opposite have exposed

the  purpose and design of this clause. Mr Mammen, as a responsible  Opposition

Party, we cannot tolerate the Government because of its design to deal with  its

political opponents and to try to deprive the rights of the people of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) left the Chair of the Committee

and took the  Chair, of the  Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee resumed.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 43- (contd)



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 43 - amendment (v)- Mr Ong Chang Sam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, just now before the break I was saying that  we  have  spent

about two hours debating the amendment of the Minister for Home Affairs and  the

facts  have  shown that the time we have spent is not wasted. The  Minister  for

Health and Law eventually confessed that the purpose of this new provision is to

deal  with  the  Barisan  Sosilias  boys. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  responsible

Opposition Party, we cannot allow the Government to make use of legal  machinery

to deal with its opponents in an unfair way because we will have to face all the

people of Singapore. The object of any government legislation should be for  the

interest of all the people of Singapore, but the Minister for Health and Law has

clearly said that the purpose of this provision is specifically to deal with the

Barisan Sosialis boys. We cannot allow the Government to abuse the provisions of

the law to protect their own interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister said that we

were  undemocratic. He said that if a thief is arrested, we cannot say  that  democracy is at fault. Now, what he meant was that the Barisan Sosialis is  an  undemocratic  Party  because  we are supposed to know  the  fact  very  well.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, this is common logic. Nobody denies that if a thief is arrested he

should  be tried by law. According to the law, if he is proved to have committed

an offence, then he should be legally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



punished.  But if you just shout saying that certain people are thieves  without

any concrete evidence, then you cannot be right. The P.A.P. Government have been

shouting that we are not democratic; that is not right. Now, what is the  actual

fact?  The fact is that the P.A.P. are the thieves because they want to  deprive

the  people  of their basic democratic rights in broad daylight. The  Government

want to resort to legislation and to all sorts of legal provisions to carry  out

their  undemocratic act under cover of democracy. In doing this, they are acting

contrary to the basic democratic rights of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister said that the purpose of this additional sub-clause is to enable all good law-abiding citizens to be

protected to express their free choice and views. Mr Speaker, Sir, according to

paragraphs  (a)  and (b) of sub-clause (1) of clause 43, we  can  see  that  all

citizens on polling day will not be able to carry out canvassing. When there  is

such  a specific provision, how can there be any fear that canvassing will  take

place on polling day? Now, the logic of the Parliamentary Secretary is only  the

logic  of  the P.A.P., and it is not the kind of logic acceptable to the  common

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are most concerned that under this new provision, anybody

can  at any time be arrested by any police officer. The Minister for Health  and

Law  has  also  very clearly disclosed that the purpose of this  additional  provision is to deal with the Barisan Sosialis boys, and now we can see clearly the

true  purpose of this new provision of the Government, which is to suppress  the

people  and political Parties which are working in the interests of the  people.

The  Member for Anson and the United People's Party' representatives  here  have

also  expressed their views against this undemocratic provision.  I  am  of  the

opinion  that if the Government want to forge through the passage  of  this  provision; it will only go to show that they are making a mockery of democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 43, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 52-

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker. I beg to move the amendment* standing in my name.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment, which is also stood in the name of Mr Marshall, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A24, lines 16 to 24, to leave out the whole of sub-clause (5).

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is a new clause and is not found in the Elections Ordinance.

You will probably have heard what the Minister for Health and Law said about the

previous  amendment. He said it was entirely meant for the Barisan Sosialis.  In

other  words,  Sir, if anyone should petition to a Judge and if  there  is  some

secret information against him placed at the disposal of the Referendum Judge by

the  Special Branch, or whatever branch the Ministers can think of, then he  can

say, "Oh! this man is a Communist. You do not have to have a referendum petition

any more." Is that the meaning of this clause?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You are scared, are you not?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Again, Sir, if for any reason the referendum result should

not  be  as  expected by the P.A.P. then the P.A.P. can put in  anything  for  a

petition. Our fear is this. If any written or other report is presented  to  the

Referendum  Judge  and  treated as secret, and therefore not  available  to  the

defendant  or to the petitioner, then he will not be in a position to rebut  the

charge  made  against him. We want to stress once again, Sir, that justice  must

not  only be done but must be seen to be done. There is no reason, as far as  we

can see, why this clause should be put in.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, let us read out this clause which we seek to

delete:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When determining upon a referendum petition the Referendum Judge shall take

into  account  any  written or other report, information, document  or  evidence

which  may  be the direction of the State Advocate-General be placed before  the

Referendum Judge:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that no such written or other report, information, document or

evidence or any part thereof which is specified as secret shall be disclosed  to

any person other than the Referendum Judge.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if you will notice clause 54 (a) for a moment a referendum petition may be presented, inter alia, on the ground that the voters were confused

or  misled into recording their votes on any question by - general intimidation or

other misconduct.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Which clause?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> 54 (a).



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> 54? It is the end of (a)?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is right. I am just referring to the material part. I do

not wish to take up unduly the time of the House. Mr Speaker, you will remember

that originally this Government in presenting this Bill made no provision at all

for  a referendum petition. They knew that they were going to extract a 100  per

cent  return  through their own tortuous way and they wanted no referendum  petition. When this extraordinary lacuna was drawn to their attention and they recognised  that  it was indefensible, they brought in provisions, loaded ones,  Sir.

Now,  Sir, I know of no similar provisions it the democratic world whereby  the

State Advocate-General must, according to the Minister for Law, hand over to the

Referendum Judge any memoranda he receives from the police or from Ministers or,

no  doubt, from P.A.P. organisations. And those passages that are marked  secret

will  not  be disclosed to the petitioner, will not be disclosed to the  public,

and  the  Judge  is  required to take them into consideration.  Sir,  first  and

foremost,  let us ask ourselves whether it is fair to the Judge, with his  sense

of  integrity, to compel him by law to act in this dishonest fashion. For it  is

dishonest  to  take  into consideration a statement not  on  oath,  prepared  in

secret, compiled from sources unknown, not subjected to cross-examination and in

respect of which the persons accused cannot make a defence because they  do  not

even know the accusation. I say to you, Sir, that this is grossly unfair to  our

Judges, to seek of them P.A.P. conduct. You know, Mr Speaker, that if you  make

a law that a defendant shall not know what the plaintiff says, he shall not know

what  the  plaintiff  claims,  he  may not cross-examine  the  plaintiff,  every

plaintiff would necessarily win his case because it is only the power to  cross-examine

him, the power to give contrary evidence which helps to bring out the truth  and

often to rebut a claim which, on the face of it, may seem legitimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if there was a law, as this law, whereby I could go to court and say you borrowed $1,000 from me







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



but  you  are not allowed to hear what I said, the Judge is not allowed to  tell

you what I said to him, and I said to him, "This is your signature agreeing that

you  borrowed $1,000 from me" and you are not allowed to cross-examine  me;  you

are  not even allowed to know what I said. What can the Judge do but give  me  a

judgment  against you for $1,000? You will appreciate that the Referendum  Judge

has the power to send to prison and to disfranchise citizens and Assemblymen.  I

ask  you,  Sir,  in what possible circumstances can there be the  need  for  the

secrecy reminiscent of the Star Chamber?



<br><br>6.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would enquire, are there other countries in the world where there are Communists? I would enquire, are there democracies honestly seeking to

meet  the  forces of subversion and seeking a healthy development of  the  human

personality  and  human society? And I would ask in the  context  of  the  reply

whether  this  Government knows of any country in the  world  with  a  provision

similar to this, if they want a loaded verdict, put in the clause in respect  of

every referendum petition, the Referendum Judge shall make such findings as  the

Minister  for Home Affairs directs. Can he not recognise, Mr Speaker, that  one

day,  maybe, given the opportunity, the Barisan would seek to play  on  him  the

same foul tricks that he is playing on the people of Singapore? I know they  are

making  certain  that these provisions will not apply to them.  Because  of  the

extent of filth which is beginning to seep through the consciousness of all  the

people  of Singapore, the Government recognises that it cannot cannot keep  this

Bill  on  the  statute  book for its own health. But I  ask,  wherein  lies  the

necessity  for this additional perfidy? What is it conceived for?  What  set  of

circumstances  would require our Judges to be made the tools  of  darkness,  the

instruments  of  P.A.P. dishonesty,  who are  compelled  to  give  judgment  in

accordance  with  the  reports received from the Special  Branch  and  from  the

Minister for Home Affairs? Even if those reports are honestly compiled, does the

Minister not recognise the possible

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>

dubious  character of the sources from which such reports are compiled? He  will

tell  you,  Sir, it is in the discretion of the Judge to reject the  memorandum.

What  discretion has the poor Judge when he cannot even ask whether this is true

of the petitioner, because that which is marked "Secret" may not be communicated

to anybody else? What discretion is there? He may not hear the defendant. He may

not  tell  the  defendant what the accusation is, but you say that  there  is  a

discretion whether he accepts the plaintiff's case or no. On what basis?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a long list of classic perfidious provisions, let us add one more

example  of  a  government that has not the slightest clue or  understanding  of

democracy  or  respect for the people; a government that would  have  been  more

appropriate in the time of Hitler and in his country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

said  before  that there is very little coordination between the  brain  of  the

Member for Anson and his tongue -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Cannot you say something new?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> - but today I found that there is no proper co-ordination between

his  eyes  and his mouth, Sir. He has not looked at these clauses very carefully

as  we have done. I see nothing objectionable in the sub-clause. The Member  for

Anson  has said that this sub-clause is objectionable because it will allow  the

plaintiff's case to be put without the defendant knowing what it is,  and  being

given an opportunity to cross-examine and the court therefore can be bamboozled.

That is what he said before the Select Committee, Sir. What is the purpose of  a

referendum  petition? It invites a judicial determination  whether  or  not  the

whole  of the referendum or part of it held in any electoral division or polling

district should be held to be void because of general bribery, general treating,

general  intimidation and other forms of misconduct which may have prevented  or

misled  or confused a voter in recording his vote at the referendum; or  because

of non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill where it can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



shown  that such non-compliance materially affected the result of the  whole  of

the returns or the return of any electoral division or polling district. That is

the purpose of a referendum petition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 52 (5), to which he has taken objection, would be necessary and useful

to  inform the Referendum Judge of what has taken place. This information  would

reach  the  Referendum Judge through the State Advocate-General, and  only  such

information as is classified to be secret cannot be disclosed. The  rest  of  it

can  be disclosed. This protection of secrecy is obviously in the protection  of

witnesses.  This  sub-clause itself provides that the Judge can  only  use  this

information when determining upon a referendum petition. It is so stated in sub-clause (5).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the petitioners in a referendum petition can only be the Superintendent

or  a  person  who  has voted or has the right to vote at the referendum.  In  a

referendum petition there are no accused persons and there is no danger of  this

secret information, which is made available to the Judge, being used to the  prejudice of any individual person in the way the Member for Anson has suggested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to making a determination on the merits of the referendum

petition itself when such secret information can be seen by the Judge, the Judge

can  also  at the conclusion of the trial of the referendum petition report  the

names  of  all  those  who have been concerned in illegal and corrupt  practices.

Referendum  proceedings are not secret judicial proceedings and  clause  52  (6)

provides  that  the  Referendum  Judge shall be  attended  at  the  trial  of  a

referendum  petition in the same manner as if he were a Judge of the High  Court

sitting  at  the Assizes. But before the Judge can report those  who  have  been

guilty  of corrupt or illegal practices, he is required under clause 57  (2)  to

give  such  persons  an  opportunity of being heard and of  giving  and  calling

witnesses  to  show  why  they should not be so reported.  The  proceedings  for

calling upon persons to show cause why they should not be separated are separate

from the proceedings of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



referendum  petition itself, and in such proceedings this Bill does  not  permit

secret  information available to the Judge on the referendum petition itself  to

be  used against them. Where then is the injustice of which the Member for Anson

complains?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to involve you in a legal argument,

but  bear  with  me for a moment. The Minister says there is no  accused  person

before  the  Referendum Judge. In truth and in fact, Sir, under clause  57  sub-clause (3):-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When a Referendum Judge reports that a corrupt or illegal practice has been

committed  by  any person, that person shall be subject to the same incapacities

as if at the date of the said report he had been convicted of that practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will see, Sir, he will be subject to the incapacities of standing for

election or voting, and, if he is an Assemblyman, he shall forthwith vacate  his

seat according to the law if passed. Sir, it is said that before that can happen

he  must be given an opportunity to reply. But do not forget that already it has

been proved in his absence that he is guilty. He is merely given the opportunity

to  rebut.  To rebut what, Sir? [Interjection] The Minister is making noises  of

protest. Let me read it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Before any person, not being a party to a referendum petition...'.



<br><br>which  does not include the petitioner. Supposing I am a petitioner in  a  referendum  petition; I am not allowed to see those secret documents. I  can  be  condemned,  Sir, without any further ado. I can be condemned under sub-clause  (3).

But  supposing there are other persons who have never been in court;  the  Judge

shall  call them before he makes that report naming them. And he shall ask  them

to  give evidence to show cause why they should not be found guilty. You follow,

Sir, the presumption is one of guilt, the finding is there, and they are given a

chance to rebut. Rebut what, Sir? Will the secret documents be read out to them?

Oh,  no, Sir. Have the secret documents had an effect on the Judge? Sir, if they

were  not supposed to have an effect, they would not be supplied with them.  So,

where am I being misleading in saying to this Assembly that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



in  truth and in fact a person can be deprived of his citizenship rights by  the

Referendum  Judge  guided by secret documents of which the  poor  citizen  knows

nothing, not even their existence. Is that fair enough? Not only that, Sir,  but

insofar  as the petitioner himself is concerned, he has no right even  of  being

heard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these penalties - let us look at the general issue. I bring a petition to say that through dishonest manoeuvering the P.A.P. has misled the people

into  thinking  that the Penang and Malacca type of merger means  depriving  our

citizens  of  their citizenship and, therefore, many of them have  been  misled.

Right.  I  go  and  present my evidence. The Minister for Home Affairs  and  the

Minister  for  Law submit memoranda to the State Advocate-General. According  to

the  Minister for Law, it will be the duty of the State Advocate-General to send

those memoranda on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am glad he agrees, because I could quote chapter and verse.

Some  people  study  the Bible. I have the unhappiness of combing  these  tragic

proceedings from their inception last March.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is the duty of the State Advocate-General to submit the memoranda, and

in  the  memoranda,  Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs  will  collect  all  the

scandal

- as  being reliable information - and you know, Sir, that does happen - you know the

Special  Branch,  with a straight face, again and again and again  produces  so-called  reports from reliable sources which are of pure invention.  But  whether

invention or not, the point is that I, who am honestly, openly and publicly  presenting a petition in the public interest, have met with a blank wall. I do  not

even know that documents have been produced, marked secret.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, you will say, "Yes, but it will not be marked secret unless it was

serious."  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I can assure you I know of an instance  where  the

Ministry  of  Home  Affairs chopped, as secret documents for  the  P.P.S.O.  Committee, newspapers which have been selling in Singapore at 10 cents a copy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



Those  were chopped as secret to the horror of the Judges who saw them. But  the

minions   of  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs - they  no  doubt  have  their   instructions - 'when  in doubt mark it secret.' So they mark everything  secret.  In

that way they could not get into trouble with their bosses. So the petitioner is

met with a blank wall, and the poor Judge is in the acutely unhappy position  of

not  being able to tell him what is in the memoranda before him. Not being  able

to  ask him whether he could answer or refute because he cannot tell him what it

is  he is to answer and refute since he may disclose no part of those memoranda.

P.A.P. justice? I remember once, Sir, on the Privileges Bill.  I  said  that  I

would  rather be judged by a peon or the lowest constable than by a Minister  of

the P.A.P.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How right I have been proved. P.A.P. justice! If they get a referendum petition they do not like, the Judge is coerced and manoeuvered into the horrible

position  of  having  to  take  a decision on so-called  responsible  Ministers'

memoranda of which he cannot give an inkling to the petitioner and to  which  he

himself cannot have access. That is the answer to the Minister for Law. I do not

see.  My eye does not co-ordinate with my tongue. I wish the Minister could  see

the image that he presents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the motive of this provision is to make use of the name of the

Judge  to cover up the P.A.P.'s crime. The Member for Anson has clearly  pointed

out that this provision is unreasonable and is contrary to the procedure of law.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law has just said that the Referendum  Judge

has  obtained the secret information from reports, but in those reports he  will

point  out  the  names  of those persons who are committed for  corruption.  The

Minister  for Law is seeking to explain and prove to the House that  the  secret

report  of  the Government is democratic. But in fact the Referendum  Judge  can

indicate  in  his  memorandum the list of those persons who  are  committed  for

bribery and corruption. Mr Speaker, we cannot accept







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



his  explanation. His explanation is grossly contrary to common sense. When  you

say  that a person is guilty, first of all, he has the right to ask what  he  is

guilty  of. But under this provision this person has not the right to find  out

what  crime  he has committed and against what provision in the law.  Concerning

the  secrecy of the report and information, we realise that the so-called secret

report  is  a report of the Special Branch. But is this secret report  reliable?

And  will  the Referendum Judge he influenced and misled by this secret  report?

Mr  Speaker,  I  can say categorically that the Judge will be  misled  by  this

secret  information  and pass a wrong judgment. I can give  you  a  very  simple

example which the Government cannot deny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few months ago the Singapore Chinese Secondary IV Examination created a

crisis. The Minister for Education, during a session of this House, submitted  a

report  to  the  House halfway during the sitting, saying that there  were  some

Communist elements exciting and propagating this examination boycott, that these

elements participated in this boycott, and that Tommy Koh was one of them.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang is going too much into details. The

other objection is that the subject is the subject of a Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Let  me  prove  to you that the information from the Special Branch  is  not  reliable. On that day Tommy Koh was in Kuala Lumpur but the Minister for Education-



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point at issue is whether or not that information should be

disclosed or made use of in the manner suggested in the clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my argument is this:

just  as  you  have  directed this House, all information should  be  disclosed,

otherwise the person accused or judged will not be able to know what kind of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>

crime he has committed. For instance, the incident of Tommy Koh. If the Minister

for  Education did not disclose that information in the Assembly, then Tommy Koh

would have been reported wrongly by the Special Branch that he had taken part in

the  agitation of the students' boycott. Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see from  the

incident  of  Tommy  Koh  that the information of  the  Special  Branch  is  not

reliable. Therefore, unreliable secret information should be disclosed to enable

the  accused to understand the source of this information and to enable  him  to

have a chance to prove to the Judge that he has not committed any crime of which

he has been accused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs can present his secret report

to the State Advocate-General for submission to the Judge. The Minister for Home

Affairs,  in addition to getting information from the Special Branch, can  also

get other information from his

P.A.P.     Branches. And he can also present such information to the  Judge.  If

this  secret information or report is not disclosed, then what about the  Government's  accusation that unionists, workers and cultural workers are engaging  in

subversive  activities, sabotaging Malaysia and merger? The  Minister  for  Home

Affairs and the Government may make use of unreliable and groundless information

to  prosecute  them. If this information is presented to the  Judge,  then  such

people  will be wronged and will have no chance to clear themselves.  Therefore,

under  such circumstances, the P.A.P. would be able to make use of the Judge  to

deal with their opponents and to escape the blame for their crime. Therefore, we

cannot accept this provision. The argument of the Member for Anson is in keeping

with  the  basic demands and reasoning of the common people. It is important  to

let  the  accused  person know what he is accused of and the  grounds  for  such

accusation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 52 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 54-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move the amendment* standing in my name.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A24, line 40, to page A25, line 4, to leave out the whole paragraph (a).

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words which have caused us uneasiness have already been referred to in the

previous amendment. The words which I would like to draw your attention  to  are

on  page A25 in the third line "confused or misled". We are not very happy  with

these  words and we would be most grateful to the Government if they could  give

us an adequate explanation as to why these words are necessary.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do I understand the

Member for Queenstown then that he has not really moved the amendment,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



which  is to leave out the whole of paragraph (a), but wishes to leave out  only

"confused or misled"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir, the whole paragraph is linked up with those two

words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Queenstown does not

understand  what this clause means, then I fail to understand why he  is  moving

for its deletion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is taken from the Singapore Legislative

Assembly  Elections Ordinance. Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody will ever complain  that

it  does  not  do justice. There must be these provisions if you  want  to  keep

elections clean, and if you want to bring to book those who commit such offences

as  general intimidation of voters, general bribery, general treating,  so  that

you  could get an election or a referendum declared void when those offences are

committed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  just now our Party Chairman has pointed  out  that  we  are

objecting  to  this particular provision because in it there are such  words  as

"confused"  and  "misled". "confused" and "misled" cannot have a very  objective

definition. For example, during the by-election in Hong Lim, the people did  not

support  the P.A.P. Government, but the Government said that the people in  Hong

Lim  had  been misled. Then when the result of the Anson by-election was against

the Government, they, looking from their own point of view, said that the people

in  Anson had been misled. So if you have this provision in the Bill, and should

the  White  Paper be objected to and rejected by the people, the Government  can

turn  round and say, "Oh, the people have been misled again." So we want to  ask

whether it is the intention of this provision to declare the referendum null and

void. We do not agree to this provision if it is so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have the question of confusion. All along we have been advocating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



that if there is only one simple question to allow the people an opportunity to

say 'yes' or 'no', then there should not he any opportunity for any confusion to

arise.  If  the  manner in which the electorate vote and the ballot  papers  and

symbols  connected  therewith  are different from  those  used  in  the  general

elections,  therefore, some of the electors, because of these  changes,  may  be

confused.  This confusion arises out of ballot papers, and so if the  Government

allow  the  various Parties in Singapore to reproduce some documents similar  to

the  ballot  papers  to  explain to the people,  then  this  confusion  will  be

considerably  reduced. But now it is not possible to do so and so we  feel  that

should  there  be any confusion at all, this confusion is brought about  by  the

Government itself and because of this we propose that this provision should  not

be incorporated in this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, could I ask the Minister for Law to indicate the

provision  he  states  that  is copied from the Singapore  Legislative  Assembly

Elections Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while the Minister for Law is looking up

the  Elections Ordinance, I just want to reply to one point raised by the Member

for  Upper  Serangoon. He has mentioned that a replica of the  ballot  paper  is

prohibited  during  the  referendum period. I  thought  I  had  just  moved  an

amendment  to  allow for the printing and the use of replicas of ballot  papers.

Evidently, the Member for Upper Serangoon is still sleeping.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> May I refer the Member for Anson to section 78 (a) of the Singapore

legislative Assembly Elections. Ordinance where there can be a reference to  an

election Judge if it is shown-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'that by reason of general bribery, general

treating  or  general intimidation, or other misconduct, or other circumstances,

whether similar to those before enumerated or not, the majority of electors were

or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred;'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



Now,  there  is no question of electing candidates in a referendum,  Sir.  They

could be misled by lies about the issues. This is the origin of this clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I thought that was the clause, and I am a little astonished. My

capacity for astonishment and for expectation of decent conduct on the  part  of

the  Government  seems unlimited. And I am astonished, Sir,  that  the  Minister

should have said that this is taken word for word from the Singapore Legislative

Assembly  Elections  Ordinance and should have made  us  assume  that  this  was

correct.  I  checked  on it, Sir, and you will notice that there  is  a  radical

difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 78 (a) of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance

speaks of persons being prevented from voting - 'from electing the candidate" - that  is to say, from voting. Here, we have it in the first part "or may  have

been  prevented from voting". From there, one can say, although it is  not  word

for word, that it is in fact the identical provision mutatis mutandis. But the

phrase  "or  confused  or  misled" which is complained  of  by  the  Member  for

Queenstown  is, in fact, something totally new, both in spirit and in  word.  To

transform  section  78  (a)  of  the Singapore  Legislative  Assembly  Elections

Ordinance into clause 54 (a) of the Bill mutatis mutatis, one should stop  at

line 3 of the Bill after the word "voting":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from electing the

candidate whom they preferred.'-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the majority of electors in any electoral division or polling district were

or may have been prevented from voting.'



<br><br>Sir,  I  am not, in this instance, going to say that it is right or it is wrong,

but  I  am  drawing  attention  to  a radical  distinction  and  a  new  element

introduced.

It is not taken from the Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance word for word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is rather obvious, Sir, that the Singapore Legislative Assembly

Elections  Ordinance provision was used as a precedent for this  clause.  It  is

quite obvious to the Member for Anson.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move the amendment because these words

are not found in the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, and  it

is  because of this that we want the Minister to explain the definition of these

words  at  the same time. We did not move this amendment for the fun of  it.  We

have  checked  through the Elections Ordinance. It is because  the  P.A.P. have

departed from the Elections Ordinance that we moved the amendment. And you  see,

Sir,  they  have special reasons for doing it; but we will hear the  explanation

first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs in his reply failed to give any

explanation  to our query regarding the use of the words "confused  or  misled".

The  Minister  should tell us that if, under this unreasonable and  undemocratic

provision,  the  White Paper is rejected by the people whether the  people  have

been misled.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Chair is quite puzzled. I did ask from the very beginning

whether the attack was only on the words "or confused or misled" or on the whole

of the paragraph. I do not know at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is linked up with those words, Sir. The explanation

given by the Member for Upper Serangoon has already given an indication, through

you,  of our thinking. I thought I wanted to reserve that until they gave  their

reply, but we will see what they have to say now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, if I try to understand what goes on in the mind of the

Member for Queenstown, I will

be  confused, but if I believe everything that the Member for Anson has said  to

me, I will be misled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we asked the Government to explain clearly the

meaning  of the words "confused" and "misled". If the Government is not  sincere

and will not give a clarification, then we have every reason to believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



that there is something wrong with this provision and doubt the intention there

in.   Although  the  Government allow people to carry out house-to-house  visits

with regard to the referendum, then according to this particular provision, they

can  well  claim  that such persons are going out to visit people  in  order  to

intimidate, mislead and confuse the electors or voters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister will he setting two questions in the referendum. Let us examine the whole position. At the time of the referendum, the

Opposition  Parties  Can  go Out to the electorate  to  explain  to  them  their

political  stand  on merger. At the present moment, the Opposition  Parties  are

against  the  White  Paper. Now, if we should, in our canvassing,  persuade  the

people to vote against the White Paper, then the Government can make use of this

provision  to  say  that  we are trying to confuse and  mislead  the  people  by

intimidation.  So  I hope the Government can give an explanation  for  these  to

words,  otherwise  their so-called permission for canvassing work  by  political

Parties is all eyewash.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move, "That the clause be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is the

accepted principle in any institution that only the majority can truly represent

the  view  of  that  particular institution. That majority  especially  when  it

concerns  a national matter is fifty-one per cent. Without this provision,  Sir,

there will be a danger of the minority imposing its will on the majority and, as

we  all know, Sir, if a minority imposes its will on the majority, then it is  a

dictatorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am strengthened in my belief, Sir, by a chance remark of the Minister for

Finance  when  he said, if the majority is slim and the results close,  then  it

would  be  very  courageous for any Government to claim  that  a  referendum  is

carried.  It is a very important principle, Sir, and I am glad that the Minister

for Finance, on that particular occasion,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



expressed  his views so clearly, because we believe that the minority view  must

not be covered up and dressed up and presented as a majority view. It is because

of  this  majority  principle on national matters that you  have  safeguards  in

general  elections  every few years. Sir, we realise that with  the  passing  of

clause  29 the Government can easily turn a minority into a majority. I  do  not

think  we  need  go  over  old ground, but I would nevertheless  urge  that  the

Ministers at least listen to reason and logic on this occasion before they carry

all  of  Singapore  along with them in their plunge to the depths  of  doom  and

perdition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also strengthened in my contention by the words of the Minister for

Finance on another occasion when he said that on any referendum the will of  the

majority  must  be  demonstrated beyond all doubt,  because,  according  to  the

Minister  for  Finance, no proposition can be said to have the  support  of  the

people unless it is supported by the majority of the people beyond all doubt. To

push  through  a  national issue without obtaining the genuine  support  of  the

majority of the people of Singapore will not only be a mockery of democracy, but

will,  in fact, kill democracy in Singapore. I may even say this, Sir,  that  on

many national issues of less importance, governments have resigned and gone back

to the people for a new mandate, but it looks as if the P.A.P.

Ministers  are  so desperate and want to cling to power so very much  that  they

think  only  of  themselves  and  not of the people  of  Singapore.  Merger,  as

everybody  knows,  is  a major national issue; it concerns  everyone  of  us  in

Singapore  and future generations to come. The P.A.P. have always  boasted  from

the  very  first  day, when they started on their merger negotiations  with  the

Federation Government, that their White Paper merger proposals have the  support

of  the  people. I do not see any reason why they should fear to put it  to  the

test  and make sure that their merger proposals have the support of the majority

of the people of Singapore, at least fifty-one per cent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was greatly amused, Sir, seeing the way the Government Ministers have been

going  about,  how the Minister for Education not so very long  ago,  after  his

interview  with a school boy in a ward of the General Hospital, gave a statement

to  the Press - I have not got the newspaper with me, Sir, but I can refer you  to

the  Straits Times of the 23rd of May, page 18, column 3, these are  the  words

which I have copied down:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister for Education said, "Democracy will only work where the views of

the  majority are accepted by the people and where the views of the minority are

not pushed

down the throats of others.".'



<br><br>I  heartily  agree with him, Sir, and I only hope that the other Ministers  will

share  the  same  views as the Minister for Education. Unless  they  accept  our

amendment, it looks as if they will be pushing down the throats of others  their

merger  proposals. The Minister for Education further stated that only  Fascists

and  Communists in the minority would like to force their views on the majority.

Sir,  these  are noble sentiments and nobody could disagree with him,  but  look

what  has happened today. The Government already intends to turn a minority into

a majority through their clause 29.

Another short sentence of the Minister

for Education - he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is necessary for everyone to maintain democracy in Singapore-'

<br><br>We all agree -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'and to stand up for their rights and not be cowed by threats and

intimidation.'



<br><br>Noble  words, Sir, and now we in the Opposition are standing for the  rights  of

democracy.  Let  us hope the Ministers of the Government will not  make  use  of

their  police and their Special Branch to coerce us by threats and intimidation.

Sir,  may I refer you to the transcript of the 16th of March? It was the  Second

Reading  of the Singapore National Referendum Bill and the Prime Minister  said,

in page 31, third paragraph [Vol. 17, No. 3, col. 284]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A referendum is a process - these are carefully chosen words for the benefit

of  the  Member for Queenstown - [Well, I have listened, and I am quoting  him  to

remind him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



of  the  words he told me, Sir] by which we ascertain the wishes of the majority

of the people.'



<br><br>And then further down he said it again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am reasonably confident that this accords with the wishes of the majority

of the people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But if it so happens that the majority of the people want a different mode

and manner .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again "the majority", Sir. These are very important words and the Prime

Minister stressed the meaning of a referendum for my special benefit. "Those are

the  carefully chosen words for the benefit of the Member for Queenstown".  Now,

may  I  refer you again, Sir, to the 18th of April when the Prime Minister spoke

on a motion by the Member for Anson. It is on page 34, the third paragraph [Vol.

17, No. 9, col. 894]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is the duty of the Government to ascertain the will of the majority.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The will of the majority". "It is the duty of the Government to ascertain the

will of the majority." I hope the Prime Minister will not go back on those words

because,  according to the Minister for Finance, these are all solemn words  not

lightly  spoken  and  "these are words that resulted from perfect  co-ordination

between the brain and the tongue", according to the Minister for Health and Law.

And of course only the Prime Minister could do a thing like that - nobody else!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, may I refer you to what the Minister for Health and Law himself

said.  I refer to column 209, of 11th May, Sir. He told us about the Statesman's

Year-Book  for  1958, issued by MacMillan & Co. Ltd. There is  this  report,  he

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Two referenda were held. In the first referendum (June 1948) the three forms

of government submitted to the people were:

commission  of  government or 5 years [At that time I think Newfoundland  was  a

Crown  Colony],  confederation  with Canada and  responsible  government  as  it

existed in 1933."



<br><br>Then further down he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"No one form of government received a clear majority of the votes polled," '-

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a quotation from a Report?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It should be made clear that the Minister was reading a quotation

from a Report.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is a quotation by the Minister for Health and Law*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* From the Official Report of the Select Committee on the Singapore National

Referendum Bill, No. 4 dated 11th May, 1962.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"No one form of government received a clear majority of the votes polled, and

commission of government, receiving the fewest votes, was eliminated."



<br><br>And then he further explained:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As a result of that, Mr Speaker, Sir, they had to hold a second referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"In the second referendum (July 1948) confederation with Canada received

78,408 and responsible government 71,464 votes."'



<br><br>After this, he said these very important words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So it appears, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in the first referendum in June 1948,

three  questions were posed to the electorate and each elector  had  to  make  a

choice of one. As there was not a clear majority [these are very important words

"As there was not a clear majority"]

in that first referendum for any one of the

three issues, a second referendum was held.'

<br><br>In  other words, Sir, in the case of Newfoundland they had two referenda. In the

first  one that was held, there was no clear majority. And because there was  no

clear  majority, a second one had to be held to make sure that there was a clear

majority  on any one of the propositions put to the people. Then in column  210,

the Member for Anson said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Arising out of that, it reinforces the argument. You see, Sir, it is a fair

inference  to  say that that referendum must be in pursuance of  the  law  which

required a clear majority of votes east in respect of one of the issues and, not

having got that, they had to have a second referendum.'.



<br><br>This should be clearly understood by the Minister for Health and Law. And he  is

such  an  expert  that he had to be quoted as a reference by  the  Minister  for

Finance!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I just want to know whether the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



Queenstown  would  count in the total number of votes cast the  blank  votes  as

well.  Or  would he say that the only votes to be considered would be the  valid

votes - positive votes; either yes or no - for any one of the alternatives?



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, in the case of Canada and Newfoundland, they

never  forced  them  to  choose some unacceptable alternative.  They  gave  them

alternatives which they thought were acceptable and if the people did not accept

them, they could say no. In our particular case in Singapore, the

P.A.P.   Government do not want to give

us, and instead want to deny us, the right to say no.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose the Minister could make a speech later on. It would be

rather interesting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I want to quote the words of these illustrious Ministers

just to show that they have been eating their own words. They say one thing  but

they mean another thing. All the time they say that this is a general Referendum

Bill  but  now  they  officially admit that this  is  going  to  be  a  specific

Referendum Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I had better acquaint the Minister for Finance of

the  relevant Standing Order on the question of elucidation. I think  he  really

did  not  rise  on  a  point of elucidation on the speech  being  made.  He  was

anticipating probably what he himself was going to say. Standing Order 47 reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No Member shall interrupt another Member except -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) by rising on a point of order . . . or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to elucidate some matter raised by that Member in the course of his

speech, provided that the Member speaking is willing to give way and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



resumes his seat and that the Member wishing to interrupt is called by

the Speaker or Chairman.'



<br><br>It should really be an elucidation. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I then carry

on, Sir? In col. 211 of the same day, 11th May.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He has not

answered my question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for

Health and Law who always shows perfect co-ordination between his tongue and

brain, says, "in the case of amendments to the Constitution of Australia, these

amendments are put to the electorate and they must be supported by a majority of

the electorate..." - these are words quoted by the Minister for Health and

Law - "as well as by a

majority of the States." This is a most interesting bit of information which, of

course, I need not pursue. In the same column, the Member for Anson - 2 paragraphs

down - said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is interesting to notice that in Australia, Sir, where there is an

amendment to the constitution, it is the majority of votes cast, not a majority

of valid votes."



<br><br>I think that answers the question which the Minister for Finance earlier on

asked.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That speech - was it from Hansard, or was that an addition?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> He has just quoted the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, they did not have a P.A.P. Government there

and they never provided a clause for blank votes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Nor a Barisan either.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the next paragraph is very interesting, because it

comes from you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Me?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Chairman

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is another interesting method adopted in South Australia. I do not know

whether  the Minister has had a chance of looking at it. This is the case  where

the  resolutions  submitted  are - this is  again  about  closing  hours  of  bar-rooms - that the hours should be (a) 6 p.m., (b) 7 p.m., (c) 8 p.m., (d)  9  p.m.,

(e) 10  p.m., and (f) 11 p.m. [This is the most interesting part, Sir.] The  curious

method adopted was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the votes recorded in favour of resolution (a) constitute a majority of

the  votes  recorded  at the referendum, resolution (a)  shall  be  regarded  as

carried; if the votes recorded in favour of resolution (a) do not constitute  a

majority  of  the  votes recorded, those recorded in favour of  resolution  (a),

shall be added to those recorded in favour of resolution (b) . . .". and so on.'



<br><br>Until  they get a clear majority of 51 per cent. Then, Sir, may I refer  you  to

col. 230?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member should make it quite clear, that

the  Chairman then was just reading from a report and in that report there  was

nothing said about 51 per cent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But, Sir, it is a clear majority. Any clear majority

means at least 51 per cent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I refer you again, Sir, to col. 230, on the same day,

when the Minister for Health and Law said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The precedent most appropriate for our purposes would be the referendum held

in  Newfoundland. There it was quite clear that three questions  and  later  two

questions  were  posed  and  the  voter  was  asked  to  state  what   sort   of

constitutional arrangements he would like to have...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need read further, Sir, I have earlier on quoted the same

incident of the Newfoundland referendum, and there two referenda had to be  held

because  the  first one did not give a clear-cut majority. Only the  second  one

gave a clear-cut majority, where one had 78,000 votes and the other one had

71,000 votes. It is a pity the Minister for Finance has run away.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Why does the

Member for Queenstown use expressions which might be offensive? The Minister for

Finance  has not run away. He has walked out of this Chamber. He is entitled  to

do that, just as the Member for Queenstown is entitled to do that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is a pity that he has walked away, because I intend to

quote him this time. He should be here to listen to it. It is in col. 300 of the

15th  of  May  [Official  Report  of  Select  Committee  on  Singapore  National

Referendum  Bill  No. 5 dated 15th May, 1962]. And it is this paragraph  that  I

referred  to  as having strengthened my conviction that he possibly would  admit

the  logic  and common sense of our argument and maybe accede to our  amendment.

The Minister for Finance says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I should imagine, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if the result of the referendum were

so  close  as to show a difference of, say, 300 votes one way or the  other,  it

would  be  a very audacious government to say one way or the other, because  the

population has, for practical purposes, been split into half. I think  the  best

way  and the reasonable thing for the government to do, under the circumstances,

is either to hold another referendum or just leave matters at the status quo.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if there is no clear-cut majority. Sir, it would be a most

audacious  government to claim that the referendum has been carried one  way  or

the  other.  And  300  votes is not good enough for the  Minister  for  Finance.

Therefore, I propose, and he will admit, that at least 51 per cent would be  the

minimum  for  a clear-cut majority. I may also mention here from the "Plebeian",

8th of June, on page 3, an article by the Member for Anson. He was quoting

- it  is  only a short paragraph - a few lines. It is in col. 2. The Member  for

Anson  said,  "I  found in Hitler's law, on the 14th of July 1933,  under  which

three referendums were held in 1933, 1934 and 1938 -



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is in section 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The majority of the votes for or against in a particular issue decides the

result of the plebiscite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even Hitler had the gall to be openly dishonest, at least in this matter,

as the P.A.P. Government. The P.A.P. can take credit for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



out-Hitlering Hitler in one aspect of public dishonesty.'



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I take it then that the Member for Anson is not taking part

in  this  debate, as the Member is now quoting the Member for Anson,  who  is  a

Member  of  this Assembly. Unless the Member can say the same words in  his  own

words, I do not think it is right for the Member to read the opinion of a Member

of this Assembly verbatim.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I merely quote,

Sir,  to  show  you the quotation of Hitler's law of 1933. Therefore,  all  this

shows  that  the Prime Minister, the Ministers for Home Affairs, for Health  and

Law,  and  for  Finance all recognise the logic of this 51 per cent  principle.

Because  the  essence  of  democracy  is  that  the  Government  must  be  truly

representative of the majority will of the people. I have explained to you that,

because any government should represent the majority will of the people, we have

this  system  of  periodic  elections. Under  any  circumstances,  the  simplest

majority is fifty-one per cent. Therefore, if the Government are fair and  just,

they  have  no reason not to accept our amendment. Our claims are not excessive.

They are perfectly reasonable, especially when our contentions are reinforced by

these  words  of the Minister for Finance when he said that if the majority  was

slim,  and  the  result was close, then the Government would be very  courageous

indeed  if  they ever claimed that the referendum was carried. The  P.A.P. have

repeatedly  said that they will follow the will of the people. So  there  is  no

need  to fear this fifty-one per cent provision, and they need not baulk at  and

reject  it.  Let them make certain and demonstrate that they really  accept  the

will of the majority of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper which they will be posing as one of the questions to the

people  has been much publicised. Day in and day out they say what a good  thing

it  is over Radio P.A.P. and Rediffusion. Now is the time to put it to the  test

and to show the people that their merger proposals really have the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



support  of the people. May I also reinforce my argument by reminding the  House

that any constitutional change will need at least a two-thirds majority? And may

I  refer  you,  Sir,  to  section 105 of the Singapore (Constitution)  Order  in

Council:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Assembly may, by law enacted under this Order, amend, add to, replace or

revoke  any of the provisions of this Order set out in the first column  of  the

Third  Schedule  to this Order to the extent specified in the second  column  of

that Schedule:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that no Bill for that purpose shall be deemed to be passed unless at

the final vote thereon it has received the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of all the Members of the Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular case, Sir, it is not just the case of Members voting, but

of  the  total  number of Members in the Assembly and it is laid down  that  it

should  be  two-thirds and not just 51 per cent. Sir, what I ask for  -

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Something extra.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think, Sir, I can quote precedents in many places of the

world,  in  Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, France, Jamaica,  Newfoundland.

But I would like to say, Sir, that this 51 per cent principle is also intimately

related  to what we said a few days ago when we were debating clause 5,  namely,

that  this 51 per cent is related to Chyuen Min Fu Chyueh because Chyuen  Mm  Fu

Chyueh says that if any law or Bill has been passed in the Assembly, it must  be

taken to the people for their endorsement, and endorsement means at least 51 per

cent  support  from  the people of Singapore. In the case of Switzerland,  Bills

cannot become laws unless they have the majority support of 51 per cent. In  the

case of Jamaica, may I refer you, Sir, to column 480 at the top. I was referring

to  the  Referendum  Federation Law, 1960, section 3, subsection  (3),  and  the

quotation is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the purpose of determining under this section the opinion of the people

of  Jamaica  regard shall be had of the opinion expressed by a majority  of  the

electors voting at the referendum



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the electors voting - majority, that is, of course, 51 per cent minimum.

Then, further down, Sir, I also quoted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



from  the Statesman's Year-Book of 1958 which again tells you that it is a  case

of  the  majority of all electors voting. Then, at the bottom of the same column

480, it specifically explains how in South Australia a majority is constituted:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the purposes of ascertaining the result a majority shall be deemed to

mean any number which is more than half the total number of votes recorded:'.



<br><br>This  is a clear indication that in any majority it must be 51 per cent.  May  I

quote  the  last referendum held in Australia in 1949. I do not have the  actual

quotation,  Sir, but the referendum held on that particular occasion  was  about

the  sale of liquor in hotel bars and the majority there was again stated to  be

at least more than half. I do not think I want to take the time of the House any

further-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - except to remind the Ministers sitting opposite that our

merger  issue  is  a  national issue. We cannot allow only a  tiny  minority  of

people,  say ten per cent, to impose their will and decide the fate of the  vast

majority - 90  per  cent - of the people. If they want to impose  the  will  of  the

minority  on the majority, then it is clear dictatorship and not democracy.  Let

us  play  the  game  according to the rules - Queensberry Rules,  not  Siamese

boxing-



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Queenstown rules!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But it looks as if the P.A.P. only use Siamese boxing. When

we  proposed  this 51 per cent provision, the Government tried to  use  this  to

justify  their blank paper clause. They tried to draw a red herring  across  the

path  by  saying  that  since we want to claim blank votes  as  negative  votes,

therefore, they have every justification to claim blank votes as positive votes.

I  thought I gave the explanation the other night and I did not talk of positive

or negative votes. The blanks to us simply mean non-supporting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Also not opposing.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> To make sure that they do not try to draw more red herrings

across  the path, let us remind the Minister for Finance that their blank  paper

clause  was introduced before the Second Reading, whereas our 51 per cent clause

was  introduced only after Select Committee and again today. I do not know, Sir,

but  today  we  find the Government using all sorts of methods to  impose  their

minority will on the majority of the people. Opposition from all walks of  life,

all  sections of the people, all strata of society, has been voiced against  the

undemocratic  and  dishonest  provisions in this  Bill.  The  political  Parties

outside together with the Workers'

Party  and the Barisan Sosialis inside this Assembly have formed the Council  of

Joint Action.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we are now going round in circles. Let us now

concentrate on this 51 per cent and let us get on with it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I realise the gravity of the situation facing us, but I

have  just  received news that the Government have banned the People's  National

Convention that the Council of Joint Action intend to hold tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> On

a point of order. What has that got to do with the new clause we are now talking

about?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The answer is that it has nothing at all to do with this new

clause before us. Let us concentrate on this 51 per cent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Nothing at all, Sir, true-



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member for Queenstown wishes to mention that, I

suppose  he  can  slip it in when we are dealing with the Third Reading  of  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir, I just want to wind up with one sentence, namely;

that  in  spite of majority opposition both inside and outside this  House,  the

Government still insist on imposing their tiny minority will on the majority  of

the people of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not want to waste the time of the House on this

completely  futile  amendment. However, I hope to spend  the  next  few  minutes

trying  to  teach the Member for Queenstown simple arithmetic, which  he  should

have learned in his primary school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Queenstown imagines or believes that a simple majority

means  fifty-one  per  cent. How a professional person of his  standing  with  a

University education can make such stupid mistakes is beyond my comprehension!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You do not understand anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen):

Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am trying to give him a simple lesson to show that a

simple  majority does not mean 51 per cent. I made attempts in Select  Committee

but I failed. So I will make another attempt to give the Member for Queenstown a

very  simple  lesson in arithmetic. Possibly, I may not succeed.  You  see,  Mr

Mammen,  Sir, there are uncivilised tribes in the world who cannot count  beyond

the  number 2. 'They count one, there is a word for 'two', and for three onwards

they  have just the word "many". It seems to me that so far as counting  numbers

is  concerned, the  Member for Queenstown is not on the level  of  intellectual

comprehension of numbers. He is not much better than those primitive tribes  who

cannot count beyond the number 2.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You said the

same thing in Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Say something new.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This is very rich, Mr Mammen, Sir, coming from this person

who has been repeating his

arguments  day  in and day out, either in the Assembly, in Select Committee,  in

radio forums and in mass meetings.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You do not like our mass meetings.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nobody attends

your mass meetings.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It would be better for the Minister for Finance to ignore

these interjections and concentrate on this new clause.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Well, Sir, you see in the techniques of teaching one

way to deliver a lecture - or hoping that

the  point  the teacher wants to make will be understood by those who are  being

taught, but the skull of the Member for Queenstown is so thick-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - that I think that method of teaching will not work. In

Select  Committee he already admitted his skull was so thick that he  could  not

understand   the  simplest  propositions  we  were  trying  to   put   to   him.

[lnterruption]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Mr Mammen, Sir, I shall treat him for what he really

is,  that  is,  I  shall  assume - and I think,  in  this  instance,  with  every

justification - that the level of his intellectual understanding is equivalent  to

that  of  a child of eight. Therefore, in trying to convince him that  a  simple

majority  does  not mean 51 per cent, I intend, with your kind  permission,  Mr

Mammen, Sir, to ask him a few questions-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> 25 versus 26?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - and by the process of -

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have

already indicated that this debate is getting a little out of hand. May I remind

Members of Standing Order No. 47 (a), that while a Member is speaking, all other

Members shall be silent and shall not make interruptions except as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



permitted under the provisions of Standing Order No. 47, that is, interruptions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this is

simple  arithmetic. Let me get on with it. Supposing there are ten people.  Six

vote  "Yes",  four  vote "No". Where is the majority? Is  it  not,  yes  or  no?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minister is inviting debate on this. The

Minister  for Finance is not supposed to put questions straight, across  to  the

Member  on the opposite side. Whatever he thinks he wants to put across, he  can

put  it to the Chairman. If lie is going to ask yes or no, I think we shall  not

be able to end this debate at all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Mammen, but as I have said-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ask the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Certainly, as I

have  said,  I  am  faced with this extremely difficult  problem  of  trying  to

convince  a  man  who  has  got  the brains of a child  of  eight  of  a  simple

proposition in arithmetic. However, since you have ruled that I cannot  ask  him

directly,  I shall ask him indirectly. Now, let us take a case where ten  people

are voting. Six say "Yes", four say "No".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We cannot say



"No" here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There is a simple

majority of one



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Of 60 per cent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> All right, a simple majority of - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - 60 per cent of the votes cast. Let us go in stages from

10,  say,  to 100 and at great risk of taxing the intellectual capacity  of  the

Member for Queenstown, I will say if 100 people vote and if 51 people vote "Yes"

and  49 people vote "No", then there is a majority of "Yes". I see the light  of

comprehension dawning on his face, Mr Mammen, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there are 100 people voting, 51, say, vote "Yes", 49 vote "No", then 51



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



per  cent of the votes cast are "Yes". So up to 100 votes the Member for Queenstown is quite right. A simple majority means 51 votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, supposing we go through this exercise just one more stage, and I do beg

of the Member for Queenstown to concentrate very carefully on this argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing 1,000 people vote, and supposing 501 vote "Yes"; is that a simple

majority or is that not a simple majority?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You want me to say something?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, please.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Mammen,

Sir, just because he has gone to the

London School of Economics, the

Minister for Finance thinks he is very

smart.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hope the Minister for Finance will not invite this kind

of debate with the Opposition side. Please concentrate on the new clause.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Indeed I am concentrating. I am trying to say that a simple

majority is not 51 per cent. I am having considerable difficulty from the Member

for  Queenstown  to understand this proposition which I thought would  be  self-evident to anyone who has passed Primary Five, but he has clearly not understood

it.  Democracy demands that all issues should be made quite clear. So with  your

permission,  Mr  Mammen.  Sir, I shall continue  with  this  lesson  in  simple

arithmetic to convince the Member for Queenstown beyond all doubt that a  simple

majority  does  not  mean 51 per cent. If I have made this point  clear  to  the

Member  for  Queenstown, then I think Mr Mammen, Sir, a great  blow  has  been

struck for democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, so far we have gone up to 100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 1,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We have not

finished with the argument of 1,000. 501 persons vote "Yes", 499 vote "No". Now,

is  that  a  simple majority or is that not a simple majority? I  have  asked  a

simple question, Mr Mammen, Sir, which admits of a "yes" or "no" answer

- the sort of question the Member for Queenstown likes. Now, I say if he wants to

challenge me, I am prepared to sit down and listen to his other point  of  view.

If  you  have 1,000 voters, 501 vote "Yes", 499 vote "No", I say that there  has

been  a simple majority, but there has been less than 51 per cent. The light  of

comprehension dawns on his mind, Mr Speaker, Sir. So, if that is the case, need

we  go  to 10,000, need we go to 100,000, need we go to 600,000? I think  it  is

completely  unnecessary, Mr Mammen, Sir. Obviously, the Member  for  Queenstown

now  concedes that a simple majority does not mean 51 per cent. He has taken  45

minutes  of  the  time of this House on this completely erroneous,  this  simple

fallacy which a schoolboy in the fourth standard would be ashamed to make. So we

have  cleared this point, Mr Mammen, Sir, that a simple majority does not  mean

51  per  cent.  And  I  say a signal victory has been struck  in  the  cause  of

democracy,  because the Member for Queenstown acknowledges this fact. Throughout

the  debate in Select Committee, everyone was trying to convince him  that  that

was not so; and when it came to the vote, he was the only one in support of this

proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other point I want to make is blank votes. You will recall, Mr

Mammen,  Sir, that we asked him if he preferred a simple majority of  all  votes

cast or a simple majority of the effective votes cast. As usual, we got a lot of

waffle from the Member for Queenstown from which I drew the inference

- and  you  can  correct me if I am wrong - that he meant all votes cast,  whether "Yes"  or "No", whether "a" or "b" or "c" or blank votes. He is admitting  -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Admit what?

Say something.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minister for Finance should set an example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Mr Marshall walked out and tripped over some wiring.]

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Mammen, Sir, but I saw the Member

for  Anson in such distress that I thought I should not continue speaking  until

he is seen safely through this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is obvious from what the Member for Queenstown says that he wants

blank  votes  to  count as anti-merger votes. That is the  simple,  logical  and

inescapable  inference from what he says. He says blank votes mean "no  support"

votes. Will he not agree also that blank votes mean "no oppose" votes - if  I  can

use the sort of grammar which he is now accustomed to use grammar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b>Barisan grammar.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Barisan grammar. Blank votes, no support; blank votes also

mean  no  oppose. It is a simple proposition. I am glad to hear from the  Member

for  Queenstown two things. First, he acknowledges that a simple  majority  does

not  mean 51 per cent; second, blank votes do not mean that the votes are  anti-merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, the Minister for Finance is so good at

arithmetic that he does not even know when he has lost one Member. He  does  not

know  that  26  has  become  25. Obviously, that is too  difficult  for  him  to

comprehend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he gave us some rigmarole about simple majority and things like that. I

wish  he  had  listened to what I said when I started, and I  said  that  I  was

strengthened in my belief by what the Minister for Finance himself had  said.  I

refer you again, Sir, to col. 300 of the Official Report of the Select Committee

of  15th  May,  1962.  I have already indicated to you and  enumerated  so  many

instances of a clear-cut majority. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



is what the Minister for Finance said in col. 300:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I should imagine, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if the result of the referendum were

so  close  as to show a difference of, say, 300 votes one way or the  other,  it

would  be  a very audacious government to say one way or the other, because  the

population has, for practical purposes, been split into half. I think  the  best

way  and the reasonable thing for the government to do, under the circumstances,

is either to hold another referendum or just leave matters at the status quo.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these words clearly show that the Minister for Finance admits that if it

is  a  case of just one or two or three or four majority out of a large  number,

then  it  is not considered a majority even 300, according to the Minister  for

Finance,  is  not considered to be a majority of any consequence. He  has

recommended  that  under  those circumstances, we either hold another  referendum  or

leave  matters  just  at  the status quo. This is a  clear  admission  from  the

Minister  for Finance himself, and it is a pity that he never heard  me  when  I

first began, otherwise he would not have queried and quoted all those small

piddling figures. What we want is a clear-cut majority. If it is the

Minister's contention  that  he  does  not like the figure 51 per cent,  can  he  give  me  an

assurance  that he will not consider the referendum carried unless  there  is  a

majority? Can he give us that assurance? I would like an answer before  I  carry

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Would the Minister care to give an explanation? I would not

mind sitting down again, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister will give a reply at the appropriate time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - because this is a very interesting question. All I want

is  a majority. If he thinks 51 per cent is a wrong figure, let him amend it  to

any  majority. Surely he does not want to carry through a national matter  on  a

minority  view.  Is he trying to say that it is correct to impose  the  minority

will on the majority of the people? Let him give us a categorical answer. If  he

does not like 51 per cent, he can amend it





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



and  make it 52 per cent. If he does not like 52, he can make it 60, 70, or  80,

or  just  say  any  majority with a plus one. Say something. I  am  prepared  to

accept. Let him give us that assurance, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I said that he was trying to draw a red herring across the path by saying

that  blank votes are negative votes. I have no wish to repeat what I  said  the

other  night,  but  he  is asking me to do so again. This  explanation  or  this

supposition of the Minister for Finance is just an excuse to justify the  P.A.P.

for  their  pinching  blank votes as votes for the Government.  I  have  already

explained  to you, Sir, that this 51 per cent principle has nothing to  do  with

blank votes. Any important national matter must have at least 51 per cent  or  a

clear  majority -  if  he  does  not like the  words  "51  per  cent",  "a  clear

majority" - to  indicate that that issue has the support of the  majority  of  the

people of Singapore. It is a very simple proposition, it has nothing to do  with

blank votes one way or the other. However, just to take him on his argument that

blank votes are supposed to be anti-government votes. According to the questions

that are going to be posed to the people - one is the P.A.P. merger and one is the

so-called complete merger - both of them are on merger. I am telling the  Minister

that  blank votes do not mean anti-a or anti-b. If the Minister wants  to  claim

that they are anti-P.A.P. merger votes, similarly they can be anti-b, c, d, e, f

and  g proposition votes. Therefore, supporters of the other propositions b,  c,

d,  e,  f  and g, can similarly claim that they are anti- b, c, d, e,  f  and  g

votes.  Can  they not see their own illogical argument? That has nothing  to  do

with the 51 per cent principle, the majority principle.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Mammen,

Sir, I would like to remind the Member for Queenstown of what his colleague  in

the  Opposition said last night. I am referring, of course, to the  Member  for

Hong  Lim,  who understands this matter much more clearly than the  Member  for

Queenstown. He said the result of this referendum was a foregone conclusion  90

per cent-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, because of

the rigging.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - 90 per cent, in his estimation, not mine -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You told me 95

per cent.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member for Queenstown wants to stand on a point of

elucidation  or  information, the Minister for Finance will probably  give  way.

This  is not the way to get information from the Minister for Finance. Dr  Lee,

on a point of information?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir. Just to remind the Minister

for Finance, he himself told me when I asked him what chances the P.A.P. had  in

this  referendum that they were going to win by 95 per cent. Now that  you  know

what  the  "blank" clause means, surely you can expect even 100 per cent - not  95

per cent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am quite glad that the Member for Queenstown knows his goose is cooked!

He  is  in  a  zugzwang - there is no way whatsoever for  him  and  his  Party  to

frustrate merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is what you

think.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Certainly, Mr Mammen, Sir. Now, to deal with the quotation

of my remarks. I said that

- and I meant it - if it is a matter of 200 to 300 votes either way in a referendum

in  which some 600,000 votes are cast, then obviously no clear-cut decision  has

been  reached.  But this is a matter of judgment and a matter of policy  of  the

Government.  It  is  not a matter of legislation. If the Member  for  Queenstown

makes  it  a  matter of legislation, and instead of 51 per cent, let  us  say  a

majority of the votes, then I think we would have been spared all these  tedious

arguments  on  what a clear majority means. But it is obvious that somewhere  in

the  process of his education, he has got his understanding of simple arithmetic

mixed up, and therefore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



we are subjected to an hour of completely unnecessary argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards blank votes, Mr Mammen, Sir, he does not understand why we ask him

whether  he  wants  to  pinch blank votes. He thinks it  is  just  a  rhetorical

question  or  that  we are arranging it in order to provide an  excuse  for  our

clauses 28 and 29. But every time they speak about blank votes, i.e. blank votes

should  count  as anti-merger votes, it provides further proof that  it  is  the

intention of the Barisan Sosialis to induce people to cast blank votes  in  this

referendum.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Is that something new?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nothing new. Mr Mammen, Sir, when this clause on blank

votes was -

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the

Minister  for Finance is going back. We are now discussing this new clause,  and

if  the Minister for Finance wants to bring in these clauses 28 and 29, I say it

would  be  proper for him to bring them up on the Third Reading of the Bill.  So

perhaps  it will be better for the Minister for Finance to leave out that  point

and  come back to this new clause. Otherwise he is inviting more debate  on  the

blank votes which has already been disposed of.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am mentioning this not to justify our stand on the blank

votes, because, as you say, Mr Mammen, Sir, that has already been gone into  in

the  debate on clauses 28 and 29. But I am making a new point here following  on

what  the Member for Queenstown said. He said quite a lot of words on what blank

votes  mean.  All  I am saying is that every time the Barisan  Sosialis  make  a

statement  on blank votes, it all goes to prove their evil intention to  confuse

people  into casting blank votes. And that was the point that was not understood

when  we  put  our  new clause on blank votes. That was not  understood  by  the

general public, and I am very glad-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What about the majority principle? Come on!

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> And we have been inviting their opinion on blank votes. On

the  majority principle, Mr Mammen, Sir, surely it is obvious that if he  wants

an  assurance, I will give him an assurance. But as I said, his own colleague in

the  Opposition said that a thumping majority is not a matter of 50.001 per cent

or  51 per cent but in the region of 90 per cent. And he says "95" all right, we

will settle for 85 per cent if he wants.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Give two sides of the point.



<br><br>8.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Mammen,  Sir,  in  moving the introduction of this new  clause,  our  Party

Chairman  has  clearly said that the Government should get the  consent  of  the

majority of the people. Our Prime Minister, Mr Lee, is a legal expert.  Perhaps

that is why he wants to juggle, and our economist, the Minister for Finance, has

also indulged in this juggling of -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. From what I have heard through the interpretation, the

Member  for Upper Serangoon mentioned "Mr Lee, a legal expert." May I  ask  him

whether he is referring to any Member of this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b>

The Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In that case, he must refer to that Member as "the Prime

Minister".



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I  find it necessary to point out to the Minister for Finance a little while ago

about  the  examples quoted by him - when 10 per cent of the  people  cast  their

votes,  or  when 100 per cent cast, or when 100,000 people cast their  votes  or

when  10,000 or 100,000 people cast their votes. He gave these examples to  show

that  51  per  cent is, in fact, not 51 per cent, but there is one  common

characteristic  in our argument, which is that the people casting

affirmative  votes

should be more than half of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



those  casting  votes, and the Minister for Finance will not be able  to

refute

this  argument.  The  common  characteristic is  that  the  votes  cast  in

the

affirmative  should be over half. That is why we have mentioned 51 per  cent

to

provide  for  that fact. That is a very logical argument and is in keeping

with

common  sense.  That  also is our principle in relation to this  amendment.

Our

contention  is  that as the matter is in relation to our constitutional

arrangements,  it  should get the support and consent of more than half of

the  electorate

before it can be put into effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Party Chairman has just now quoted the Singapore (Constitution) Order in

Council  to  show that f you want to amend certain sections of the Constitution,

it  needs a two-thirds majority of votes in the Assembly before an amendment can

be  carried, in the Federation there are also examples. Recently the  Government

of  the Federation also introduced certain amendments to their Constitution. But

there are also provisions saying that although a two-thirds majority will not be

required in future, the affirmative votes should be more than half of the  total

number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question facing us is more serious than the other questions. That is why

our  request  for  51  per  cent of the votes cast in the  affirmative  is  very

reasonable  and  very  logical.  I would like  here  to  remind  politicians  in

Singapore  and  the  Federation of Malaya that if  the  Federation  /  Singapore

constitutional arrangements cannot get the positive affirmative support of  more

than half of the people, then the consequences will be bad. I give an example. I

mention  the  United  Arab Republic as an example to show how  the  United  Arab

Republic was later on divided again. That is a lesson from history.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I have already pointed out in the Select Committee

proceedings  that  in a by-election or in a general election in  a  constituency

where  the  votes are split even, an additional vote is given  by  lot  and  the

candidate  who  is lucky enough to get this additional vote is returned  as  the

candidate for that particular constituency.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so laid down in section 47 (8) of the Singapore Legislative Assembly

Elections  Ordinance. Furthermore, in a constituency, if there are,  say,  three

candidates,  it is also possible for the votes to be split almost  even  amongst

these three candidates. The one who gets the highest number of votes is returned

for that particular constituency. But in the case of a referendum, anything that

is  more than half - that is what the Minister for Finance has said just now - would

be  considered to be a simple majority. We cannot work on percentages like 51 or

52 or 53.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am surprised at the examples given by the Minister for

Health  and Law. He brought up that example in the Select Committee and  it  was

rebutted. The comparison is no comparison at all. He is bringing up the  example

of  a  by-election concerning the individual, and he wants to compare it with  a

national matter that concerns 1.7 million people in the whole of Singapore. What

sort of a comparison is that? But in spite of that, until now they have not even

answered  our questions. If they do not like the words "51 per cent",  are  they

willing  to accept the principle that it must be a clear-cut majority?  If  they

are  willing to accept, let them say so. Let them say so categorically  in  this

Chamber.  If 51 per cent is not acceptable, we can come to certain arrangements.

We  will let them make the amendment. As long as it is a clear majority - if it is

60  per  cent - good. Whatever it is. But it must be the majority  because  only

then  can you say that you have the majority support of the people. In no  other

way  can you say that you have the majority support of the people. I have quoted

the  sayings of all the Ministers: the Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance,

the  Minister  for Home Affairs, the Minister for Health and Law, and  even  the

Minister for Education. I quoted all of them, Sir, a little while back. Are they

going to live up to  their words or are they going to eat their words again? Let

them give us a categorical answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Just to remind the Member that the Minister for Finance has already

told him that this is a sort of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



provision that cannot be written into the Bill itself. He said just now in this

Assembly that there might be 620,000 people voting. If the difference was about

300, it would have to be left to the good sense of the Government in matters

like this. But he anticipated that there would be a return which is very much

more than, say, 50 per cent.



<br><br>8.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I quoted precedents for him, from

Australia, from South Australia, from Newfoundland, from Jamaica. Or did he not

hear them? Does he want me to repeat all that again? What does he mean by

matters of judgment for the Government - "cannot be written into the law"? Is it

just to allow the P.A.P. flexibility for dishonest maneuver, according to the

words of the Member for Cairnhill; flexibility for dishonest manoeuvre? Why

cannot they stand up like men and say, "Yes, a majority."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up, and read the First time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the clause be read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, throughout the early part of the debate on this Bill,

Opposition Members have criticised the bill for being a general Bill. They were of the

opinion  that  this National Referendum Bill should be a specific  Bill  dealing

with the current merger issue. Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said a few days ago

that  since it is the wish of the Opposition that this Bill should be a specific

one, I now move this present amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Now, this is an endless round of ramming falsehoods down the

throats that never seem to go parched



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



for  more  falsehoods. We did not criticise the Bill because it  was  a  general

Bill.  We  pointed  out the falsehoods from the Front Bench - which  I  shall  not

repeat  at  this stage because I shall be coming to them - where first  the  Prime

Minister  and the Deputy Prime Minister in the Second Reading and then in  April

told  us  that it is a specific Bill, and then the Minster for Law, the Minister

for  Home Affairs and the Minister for Finance told us that it is a general Bill

and  shut  us  off a proper discussion on the proper principle of  the  Bill  in

Select Committee. And back into this Assembly, Sir, for the first two days, they

attempted  to  shut us off again. We did not say we wanted this  Bill  to  be  a

specific Bill. We said - , again, Sir, in order not to tire you, I shall  not  be

repeating  myself because I shall be coming to it at the Third  Reading - that  we

wanted  a  specific  Bill on proper constitutional principles  to  deal  with  a

specific issue. Can the Minister tell us what this inelegant clause means?  What

does merger mean to him? Is it a deer or a horse?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I thought the new clause is so simple that the meaning is obvious to everybody.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Confused.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The Bill merely says that this Ordinance shall cease to

have  effect  on  the merger of Singapore with the Federation  of  Malaya.  When

merger between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya has taken place, this Bill

ceases to have any effect.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, this Bill is an abortion fathered by dishonesty out

of  ineptitude. I should like to adopt the words of a group of organisations  of

our  intellectual youth - 39 of them, Sir, headed by the Nanyang University  Graduates  Guild,  the Singapore University Socialist Club, the Singapore Polytechnic

Political  Society,  the  Nanyang  University Students  Union  and  the  Nanyang

University Political Science Society - when they say in their memorandum:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We wish to point out that the proposed Referendum Bill by its very nature

will  pave  the way for an oppressive and tyrannical system which will  dig  the

grave of parliamentary democracy.'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Mr Speaker, marks the beginning of the end of that parliamentary

democracy and this is a rearguard action that we are fighting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move to leave out from "That" to

the end of the Question and to add instead thereof-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'this Assembly, conscious that this Bill was introduced for the purpose of

holding  a Referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people in relation  to  the

issue  of  reunification of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, declines  to

give  it  a  third  reading  on  the  ground that  the  provisions  therein  are

inappropriate and inadequate for that purpose.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you may recognise that my amendment follows closely the wording of a motion approved by this Assembly at the instance of the Deputy Prime

Minister  on the 18th of April to be found at page 48 of the revised  transcript

of that date [Vol. 17, No. 9, col. 914].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



It was passed by 23 Government votes to 16 Opposition. The operative words

of that motion are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'welcomes the Government's introduction of the Singapore National Referendum

Bill  in  order  to  hold  a  referendum to  ascertain  [I  emphasise  the  word

"ascertain"]  the wishes of the people on the mode and manner of the  inevitable

reunification of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a Government amendment which negated my motion and it was they who

passed it. It became a motion of this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first deal with the manner in which the Government has played ducks

and  drakes with this House to prevent this House from producing a coherent  law

on the basis of a coherent policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, on Second Reading, was treated by the Government and understood by the

House as a specific Bill for the purpose of a referendum on proposals for closer

constitutional relations with the Federation, call it 'merger' or by  any  other

name.  In  this  context, Sir, I would refer you - I trust you will  find  my  references mercifully brief - first to the Prime Minister's statement on the  Second

Reading  on the 16th of March, to be found in the revised transcript at page  29

[Vol. 17, No. 3, col. 280]. He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This Referendum Bill has been brought in to determine the wish of the

majority of the people on the mode and manner of the inevitable reunification of

these two territories.'



<br><br>And  on the same day, Sir, a little earlier, the Minister for Finance at page  2

[Vol. 17, No. 3, col. 241] said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Everybody knows that this referendum will be on merger,'

<br><br>And  even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs  had  his

little  contribution, on the same day, Sir, at page 24 [Vol.  17,  No.  3,  col.

273]. He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This ought to be a simple and meaningful Bill. Its purpose is to reunite

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.'

<br><br>Surely, Sir, nothing could be clearer and there was no dissentient voice on  the

Government benches as to the fact that this was a specific Bill exclusively  for

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They emphasised it, Sir, when one month later I moved a motion seeking a

referendum in respect of the White Paper proposals, and on that day the Deputy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister moved an amendment, to which I referred earlier, and  in  moving

that  amendment, Sir, he said, on the 17th of April, at page 8  of  the  revised

transcript [Vol. 17, No. 8, col. 774]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, as I have already explained, the Minister for Home Affairs last year,

during  the debate on merger, introduced the Singapore National Referendum  Bill

with  one prospect, and that was to enable the people of Singapore in their  own

interest  to  go to a referendum to state specifically how the reunification  of

Singapore and the Federation should be brought about.'

<br><br>In  the original Bill itself, Sir - and I would like to draw your attention to  it

as  a  matter of curiosity - you will find at page 23 under "Expenditure of Public

Money",  this Explanatory Statement at the end of the Bill: "This Bill  will  involve the Government in an estimated expenditure of $400,000." We have been

told by the Minister for Finance that it costs $400,000 to hold one referendum.

If  any further confirmation was required, there is a confirmation that the Bill

was

intended at that juncture for one referendum - the only referendum anybody  inside

or outside this House had in mind. On that basis, the Bill was committed to

Select Committee. On that basis the opposition filed its amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Mr Speaker, the heavy weather we had in Select Committee

when the Government through its three Ministers - the Minister for Home Affairs in

charge  of  the  Bill,  the  Minister for Law  and  the  Minister  for  Finance - repeatedly stated that they could not accept the Opposition's amendments because

the  Bill was a general Bill for all referenda, including possible referenda  on

toddy  shops,  smoking  and the Malay language. I draw attention  to  this,  Mr

Speaker, not merely to rub salt in the wound - the wound is ours, Mr Speaker, the

people's.  I  draw attention to this devious and dishonest conduct in  order  to

explain how by these dishonest tactics in Select Committee the Ministers  sought

a  facade  of  logic for the rejection of legitimate Opposition  amendments  and

forced the Select Committee into a discussion of the Bill on false premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer, for example, Sir, to the very first day, when the Member for

Cairnhill in utter exasperation said, at column 108 [Official Report of Select



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



Committee on Singapore National Referendum Bill No. 3 dated 8th May, 1962]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In regard to the point raised by the Minister for Finance that this is a

general  law,  we  all know that this Bill is introduced to  meet  the  proposed

referendum on merger.'



<br><br>He went on, and you, Sir, as Chairman, pulled him up:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Order. I must pull the Member back to the idea that this, in fact, is a

general Bill, and as the Minister for Finance has indicated...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a manoeuvre of the Government to treat the Bill as a general Bill in

the  semblance  of logic to some of the objections they raised  to  Opposition's

amendments both in Select Committee and in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is pertinent to see how they sought to destroy the logic of our amendments by this dishonest manoeuvre that we were dealing with a general Referendum

Bill  for  toddy shops, smoking and the Malay Language. Let us take only  a  few

examples:  I am not here, Mr Speaker, to filibuster, nor can I hope to  achieve

more than to register a constitutional protest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take clause 5, Sir, In the debate in Select Committee, the Minister for

Law  stated, on the issue whether the Assembly should frame the question - I refer

you to column 110, the very first day:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My point here, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that this is a general referendum Bill.

If  there  was  before  the Committee a Bill dealing with a specific  referendum

issue,  there  is nothing to prevent the Legislative Assembly from deciding  the

questions to be put to a Referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a specific Referendum Bill, but no questions framed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At column 118 of the same day, still on the same clause, the same Minister for

Law said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, this is a general referendum Bill. There might be various matters. One

is  the  matter  of smoking - whether the public should be allowed to  smoke.  The

Member  for  Anion does not like smoking. One day we might hold a referendum  on

this. That is one matter. Merger is another matter.'



<br><br>You  see? Sir, merger is as if of no more importance than smoking. These matters

involve all sorts of questions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, at column 138 on the 8th of May:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Member for Anson has moved an amendment that there shall be only one

question on one issue. Mr Chairman, I have pointed out repeatedly that this  is

a  general Referendum Bill and there is a procedure in the Bill for the  putting

of  questions. But the difficulty is to put the questions. Quite apart from  the

precedents that I have brought to the notice of this Committee, when we met  the

respective  associations that came here, it was pointed  out  that  difficulties

could   arise  in  the  putting  of  questions.  For  instance,  there  may   be

circumstances where it is not possible to put a single question - the Member  for

Anson admitted that just now. Take the case of toddy shops . . . [and then]  the

Malay language.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law has the assistance of the Minister for Finance in this dishonest manoeuvre to confuse the Select Committee. I refer to the Minister for

Finance's  statement still on this clause. At col. 131 - still on the  very  first

day, this is very interesting:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is an advantage, in principle, in

restricting a referendum to posing one question.'



<br><br>I  wonder  how he will try to dodge that when we come to the issue of  the  questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is an advantage, in principle, in restricting a referendum to posing

one  question.  But  whether that should apply to all  referenda  which  may  be

carried out in future I am not so certain.'



<br><br>And he went on to refer to the Malay language and whether it should be official

in three, seven or ten years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, at column 134, the Minister for Finance stated:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the practice in other countries, I think it is unduly restrictive

in  the  general  referendum  law - such as we are considering  now - to  limit  the

questions of the type which require only a yes or no answer.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it fair to state that by inference he would have been prepared in a

specific referendum law to permit a question which requires a yes or a no?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, on the question of forms. You know that in Australia and in other

legislation  which we have examined, there are always Schedules of the  form  of

ballot paper and of the form of the Superintendent's returns. In fact, Sir,  our

own Elections Ordinance has seventeen forms in the Schedule including a form  of

ballot paper and a form or returns.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Minister for Home Affairs to say on the amendment of the

Member for Queenstown to introduce

a Schedule to provide for a ballot paper?

I refer to column 228 [Official Report of

Select Committee on Singapore National

Referendum Bill No. 4 dated 11th May,

1962]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a difference between the Jamaican Referendum

Ordinance and this Bill. This is a general referendum Bill. The Jamaica one is a

specific  one;  and  therefore  the  ballot paper  could  be  suitably  designed

beforehand  for that particular referendum. The Schedule proposed  will  not  be

suitable  or  appropriate  to the nature of this Bill which  covers  all  future

referenda and not one particular referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, we now have one particular referendum, and the Minister had before

him the model of Jamaica. He did admit that where there is a specific referendum

in mind, one can draft an appropriate paper. Has he done it? This attitude, Sir,

in  rejecting  the  ballot  paper  which the Member  for  Queenstown  sought  to

introduce was supported by the Minister for Law. At column 233, if I might  read

only  excerpts instead of reading a long column - Mr Speaker, you  can  check  my

accuracy:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister for Home Affairs has quite rightly pointed out that this is a

general  referendum Bill and we cannot possibly frame Schedules on the forms  of

questions in such a Bill.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, according to the Minister for Law

on a specific Bill, a little later he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We have shown good reasons why we cannot frame Schedules on the forms of

questions in a general referendum Bill. It is not possible.'



<br><br>And again, a little down - the way they obstruct us; the way they are unashamedly,

calculatedly dishonest:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are so many different matters on which referenda can be held and so

many  different questions can be posed in each referendum. So it is not possible

to do that.'



<br><br>That is on the ballot paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot have questions, because it is a general Bill. We cannot have a yes

or no, because it is a general Bill. We cannot have a ballot paper because it is

a general Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to the returns of the Superintendent where, again in answer to the

Member for Queenstown's efforts to clarify the Bill and to make it conform to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



constitutional principles - he has introduced a Schedule incorporating a form  of

return  by the Superintendent - this is what the Minister for Home Affairs had  to

say  on  16th  of  May,  at column 388 [Official Report of Select  Committee  on

Singapore National Referendum Bill No.

6]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Finally, one common form of statement prescribed in the Bill, which is a

general  referendum Bill, may not be suitable for use on all  occasions  when  a

referendum  is  held.  The  declaration  of  the  result  of  the  poll  is   an

administrative matter and it is for the Superintendent to compile the  statement

in  the form best suited for a particular referendum. It is a general referendum

Bill. We should not have a Schedule which will be only suitable for a particular

type of referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, according to him, this is now for a particular type of a referendum. Has

he introduced the Schedule? No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only a little more. In the next column 389, you will find the same Minister, the Minister for Home Affairs:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this Bill is a general referendum Bill and

we  should not have in it a definite form of Schedule which cannot be applicable

for all occasions.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, on the same day, Sir, at column 392:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In fact, I consulted my officials on this matter and they advised against it,

because  no one can anticipate what type of referendum or what type of  question

will  be  posed  in  future, and it is difficult to design a  set  Form  in  the

Schedule to this Bill.'

<br><br>Well,  Sir, have these officers also advised him now that he cannot draft a  set

Form for a specific Referendum Bill? Why not?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us hear what the Minister for Finance had to say, Sir, In the same column,

that is column 392:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This is a general referendum Bill. We are trying to straitjacket everything

into  a  set pattern to "as near as may be". We must allow a certain  amount  of

flexibility.'



<br><br>"Flexibility for dishonest manoeuvre", as the Member for Cairnhill puts it. I am

not  going  to weary you with more, Sir. The purpose is merely to highlight  the

way  this  House has been kicked about in a most shameful exhibition  within  my

experience in the last seven years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have made my point that this Bill, which was dealt with by the

Government on the Second Reading as a specific Referendum Bill for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



specific purpose of the merger, was, in Select Committee, treated as a  general

Bill  and had the Government Members been honest or at least consistent, if  not

honest, then there would have been no arguments in Select Committee against  the

inclusion  of  provisions for the Assembly to frame the questions, inclusion  of

provisions for an answer of 'yes' or 'no', inclusion of provisions for a  ballot

paper  where the answer was 'yes' Or 'no', inclusion of provisions for a  return

by  the  Superintendent of the polling results. The attempts to introduce  those

legitimate  provisions  and  specific  law  were  shut  out  by  this  dishonest

manoeuvre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we come to this House, I would like to remind you of the time

chronologically.  The Second Reading when the Government had made  up  its  mind

that  this  was a specific Bill was 16th and 17th March. The Ministers,  in  the

absence abroad of the Prime Minister, decided in Select Committee to treat  this

Bill  as a general Bill. This was between the 8th of May and, I think, the  16th

or 17th of May. Recommittal of the Bill started on the 27th of June. Between the

Second  Reading  and  the  Committee Stage two  months  had  passed. Between

Committee stage and recommittal here in public, we had a little over a month. On

the first two days, Sir, the 27th and 28th of June, last Wednesday and Thursday.

the  Government sought to keep up this dishonest suggestion that it is a general

Referendum Bill. The Deputy Prime Minister at page 91 of the transcript  of  the

27th of June [Vol. 18, No. 1, col. 127] said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I think the great difficulty in our discussions in this

Committee  is to come back to the point - to the amendments which are being  moved

in the National Referendum Bill.'



<br><br>That  was his great difficulty, Sir, to bring us to the point, and what  is  the

point?  The  main contention of the Opposition is that the Bill  should  contain

provisions for only one question to be asked. I pointed out during the debate on

the  motion moved by the Member for.Anson on the 17th of April, 1962,  that  the

National Referendum Bill was a general Referendum Bill. He did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



not point that out; on the contrary, he made exactly the opposite statement.  He

said  on the 17th that this Bill was for one prospect only, the merger prospect.

Fortunately, Sir, we have Hansard. Some comfort, some comfort! Then, Sir,  if  I

might  skip the middle part because I do not wish to weary you, and  go  to  the

latter  half,  "I  put  to you a very simple question" still  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister,  "If it is agreed that the National Referendum Bill is a general  Bill

for  referenda that may be held in the future, it is pretty obvious that  it  is

not  possible  to pre-determine, the nature of the question that may  be  asked.

Therefore,  allowance  must  be  given to the  fact  that  the  question  to  be

formulated in future years will vary according to the problem that is put before

the people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this shameless specious humbug, he sought to field the legitimate request,

the  legitimate amendment moved. And in that very statement, Sir, it is  clearly

implied that if the Bill were a specific Bill for referendum on merger, then not

only  could  the  questions but the questions should be formulated  in  the  law

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, Sir, only Thursday last, the 28th of June, the Minister for

Finance at page 42, second paragraph [Vol. 18, No. 2, col. 205]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let me get down to the gist of the matter. These people (that is us, Sir)

want  the referendum to contain only one question, which will admit only a "yes"

or "no" answer. We have stated quite correctly that in a general Referendum Bill

such a limitation is unnecessarily restrictive.'



<br><br>Right now, this is a specific Referendum Bill; obviously it is not unnecessarily

restrictive. Do we have such a provision? No. It was still a general  Referendum

Bill to Thursday, the 28th of June. On the next day, Sir, the 29th of June,  the

Minister for Law supported his colleagues on the same ground that, as this is  a

general Referendum Bill, there could not be a provision that there should be one

question  and  that the answer should be a 'yes' or 'no'. This is a particularly

edifying passage and I crave your indulgence if I read it out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>

full.  I  refer to page 14 of the transcript of Friday, the 29th of June  [Vol.

18, No. 3, col. 303]. The Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, we on the Government side have all along maintained that

this Bill is a general Referendum Bill...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust I have said enough to prove how

false that statement is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. . . and that it would be improper to incorporate in it a provision like the

amendment  proposed which would have the effect of limiting  the  scope  of  the

Bill.  The Member for Anson argued that if it was clearly the intention  of  the

Government  to use this Bill for the purpose of holding a referendum on  merger,

would  the  Government not have acted more appropriately and  fairly  if  it  introduced a specific Referendum Bill to hold a referendum on merger? He said that

this was done in all countries where referenda were held. Is there any merit  in

this argument?'



<br><br>And,  Sir,  the curious thing is, the Minister for Finance on the  previous  day

charged  me  for  not  asking for a specific Bill. But on  the  29th  June,  the

Minister  for  Law  found  no merit in the suggestion that  there  should  be  a

specific Referendum Bill. But let us read on:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. . . All Bills which deal with referenda matters, whether they are called

general  Referendum  Bills  or  specific  Referendum  Bills,  must  provide  the

machinery whereby questions can be put to the electorate, and whereby the choice

of the electorate can be ascertained through the usual electoral procedures.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, notice this. The only

difference between a Bill to hold a



referendum on a specific issue and a

general Referendum Bill is that in the

former the questions are framed as a



clause in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now it is admitted that this is a specific Referendum Bill. Is there a

clause incorporating the question? No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I refer you to the Minister for Finance who on the 28th June

said specifically that some of our amendments were unacceptable because they are

inappropriate to a general Referendum Bill. And, by necessary inference, implied

that if this were a specific Referendum Bill, of course, the Government, would

accept them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is at page 41 of the transcript of the 28th June [Vol. 18, No. 2, col.

205]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some proposed amendments are unacceptable,' he said, 'because they are

inappropriate to a general Referendum Bill, and others are because the Bill will

be used to carry out a referendum on merger.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice the next day the

Minister  for Law said there was no merit in any suggestion for a specific  law,

but  notice what the Minister for Finance said on the 28th June on page 42 [Vol.

18, No. 2, col. 205]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The hon. Member even offered the utterly preposterous suggestion that in

addition  to this general Referendum Bill, we should have a specific  Referendum

Bill  on  merger. Sir, I can see some point, in logic, if he maintains  that  we

should scrap this general Referendum Bill and in its place have one specifically

for the referendum on merger. I can see some point in this.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, on the very first day in Select Committee, I asked the Government for

a  specific Referendum Bill. I refer to column 135. [Official Report  of  Select

Committee on Singapore National Referendum Bill No. 3 dated 8th May, 1962]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would the Government consider introducing legislation on the basis of the

Jamaican Referendum Federation Law, 1960, specifically dealing with a change  of

constitutional status, .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Sir, we went on and at column

136 you pulled me up, and you said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. . .the Member for Anson has a method:

he can move a motion for leave to bring in a Bill.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had that in mind, Sir, and as you

are aware, after the conclusion of the Select Committee on this Bill, I did send

you on the 14th June a motion reading:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for a referendum to be held

to  ascertain  the  wishes of the adult citizens of Singapore  on  the  proposed

closer relations with the Federation of Malaya in Paper Command 33 of 1961.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had, in fact, drafted a simple Bill. I believe an adequate Bill based on the

Jamaican  Ordinance,  and you no doubt will remember, Sir,  that  on  the  19th,

through  the Clerk of the Assembly, you informed me that my motion  was  out  of

order. May I, Sir, read just one paragraph - paragraph 6 - thereof? This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



paragraph 6 of the letter of the Clerk of the decision:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The proposed motion of the Member for Anson therefore in effect ignores the

vote  of  the Assembly agreeing to the Second Reading of the Singapore  National

Referendum Bill, paragraph 2 above, and the vote of the Assembly as embodied  in

the  resolution of the 18th April, 1962, paragraph 5 above. These votes indicate

that the Assembly has agreed in principle that the Singapore National Referendum

Bill will be the vehicle whereby a referendum on the merger issue will be taken.

The  proposed motion of the Member for Anson is therefore a reflection on  these

votes, and on this ground the notice thereof cannot be allowed.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only the Government that could

introduce a Bill for a specific referendum or could have modified this Bill even

at this late stage into an appropriate Bill for a referendum on merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, we have reached now the

second  day  of  debate here - the 28th June and part of the  29th  June - and  then

suddenly,  Sir, on the 29th June, a little on in the afternoon,  I  was  drawing

attention to the curious conduct of the Deputy Prime Minister in these words. At

page 31 [Vol. 18, No. 3, col.

330], Sir, I said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We now go back to the curious somersault of the Deputy Prime Minister. I am

told  that was unfortunate. It came about unfortunately because he did not  hear

the  expos� earlier on of how I indicated that they had all said that it  was  a

specific provision for a specific purpose. I think he said "one prospect  only",

Sir;  I take it whichever way you read P.A.P. English, "one prospect only" means

one purpose only.'



<br><br>That  was  with  reference to his speech in April. And  here  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister interjected across the Floor, and said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All right, let us make it one purpose.'



<br><br>And an hour or so later we had the Minister for Home Affairs, very sheepishly at

the  end  of  a  speech  to the point where I had heard  him  indistinctly,  but

obviously it was heard by the Official Reporter. He said this, Sir, at  page  50

[Vol. 18, No. 3, col. 360]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, I take it that it is the wish of the Opposition that this Bill

should not be a general Bill and that it should apply only to the referendum  on

merger.  Now that being the case, the Government are prepared to scrap the  Bill

on merger with the Federation.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker, he tried that again today, although it was pointed out to him that

what  was  objected to was not its general character, but its odious  provisions

and  the  fact that it did not follow constitutional precepts in the framing  of

legislative provisions for a specific referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that we had the amendment which you heard since dinner time, this

inelegant Part VI:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This Ordinance shall cease to have effect on the merger of Singapore with the

Federation of Malaya.'.



<br><br>So,  we  have come full cycle after having kicked this Assembly round and  round

from specific on the Second Reading in March, to general in Select Committee  in

May and the first two days of this sitting in June, to specific this week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore, Mr Speaker, before us today I think incontrovertibly in

any  language, except P.A.P. language, a Bill that is truthfully an abortion  in

that  it is drafted neither on the principles of a general nor on the principles

of  a  specific Bill for a referendum. Now that we recognise it is a  Bill,  not

merely  intended,  but  by law, required to be used, only for  ascertaining  the

wishes of the people on the proposed closer relations with the Federation, I say

it  is inappropriate in that in a specific Bill for that specific purpose, there

should  be,  according to the Minister for Law himself, in  the  Bill  itself  a

clause incorporating the questions to be asked of the people. I have read to you

that  passage  where he said he had examined all laws and the  only  distinction

between  general referendum Bills and specific referendum Bills is that specific

referendum Bills have a clause incorporating the questions. This was at page 14,

if you remember, on the 29th of June [Vol. 18, No. 3, col. 303]. Furthermore, in

a  specific  Referendum Bill, according to the statement  of  the  Minister  for

Finance on the 28th of June, page 42 [Vol. 18, No. 2, col. 205], it would not be

appropriate to have a provision whereby the answer should be yes or no. I would

like to quote him exactly. Page 42:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These people want the referendum to contain only one question, which will

admit only a "yes" or "no" answer. We have stated quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>

correctly  that in a general Referendum Bill such a limitation is  unnecessarily

restrictive.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, you will recognise that in the Singapore Legislative Assembly

Elections  Ordinance,  as  in all other Ordinances dealing  with  elections  and

referenda, there are, as I pointed out, some 17 Forms, and if this was  a  specific  Referendum Bill, then there should be at least the Form of a ballot  paper.

You  will  remember, Sir, that the Member for Queenstown moved a Form in  Select

Committee  which  is the one at page 146 of our Supplement No. 17,  whereby  the

ballot  paper is given and the answer is required to be a yes or a no. When  the

Minister for Home Affairs on the 11th of May at col. 228 of the Official 'Report

of  the  Select Committee said, "This is a general Referendum Bill. The  Jamaica

one is a specific one; and therefore the ballot paper could be suitably designed

beforehand  for that particular referendum," - I do not want to repeat it,  Sir - on

his own showing that since this is a specific one, we could copy Jamaica; and he

recognizes that there should be a Form of a ballot paper and that there would be

no  objection  to the Form indicated by the Member for Queenstown.  We  have  no

Form.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of returns of the Superintendent, it is another Form that is

missing. I have drawn your attention to the statement of the Minister for Home

Affairs who ended up by telling you pathetically that he had consulted his

officials and that they were against a Form of returns because no one can

anticipate what type of referendum or what kind of questions will be posed in

future and it is difficult to design a set Form. His entire approach, Sir, to be

seen from col. 388 [Official Report, Select Committee on Singapore National

Referendum Bill No. 6 dated 16th May, 1962] - and the approach of the Government - was that because this is a general Referendum Bill, we should not have

any Forms: Now, this is a specific 'Referendum Bill, still should not have

any forms. Mr Speaker, I sought to prove to you - and I trust you have noticed

this - by the words of the Government Ministers, not the words of the Opposition,

that this Bill is inadequate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



in  that it lacks essential elements which the Government Ministers (not  Government  Back benchers or the Opposition) indicate would have been most appropriate

in  a  specific Bill. Now, it is a specific Bill and we still do not have  them.

And  what  are  those elements? They are four in number, Sir, according  to  the

Government:  (i)  a  clause  incorporating  the  questions  to  be  asked;  (ii)

provisions for an answer - yes or no; (iii) a schedule giving the Form  of  ballot

paper which would include provisions for the answer to be yes or no; and (iv)  a

schedule giving Forms of the Superintendent's returns. Why are they lacking, Mr

Speaker?  They  are lacking because the Government have set out  consciously  to

seek legal cover for dishonest manoeuvre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constitutionally, as the Minister for Law states correctly, a law can provide

that  a  man shall be deemed a woman. The law can provide that what is dishonest

is  honest, that what is false is deemed true. Yes, constitutionally the law can

so provide. But there have so far not been found any human beings

or  any government which so lack human decency and human shame and have so  much

contempt  for  the  people, to exercise that power, until the P.A.P. came  into

existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have shown you that it is inadequate. Now I want to show you why it is

inappropriate. You will remember, Sir, that the purpose, according to the motion

of  the  18th of April, is "to ascertain the wishes ..." - that is the  operative

phrase.  Now, how is this Bill going to work? Let us start off with  clause  21,

Sir. Under this clause, every citizen must vote. If he refuses to vote or if  he

does  not vote his name is struck off the electoral register and he cannot  vote

or stand for election for

several  years until that register is revised and until he has paid  a  fine  or

given  a  satisfactory explanation. But the point is, Sir, that if he  does  not

vote  at  this referendum, he will be deprived of voting at next year's  general

election,  or  for  standing for election himself. But that is immaterial;  that

affects only a few. I will not say "immaterial", but that affects a few. But the

important







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



point  is that the names of those who do not vote at the referendum, because  it

goes  against their conscience to vote for what is before them, will  be  struck

off  the electoral register and they will not vote at the next general election,

and  the  P.A.P. would be only too happy if that happens to all those  who  hate

this  Bill because with those remaining, they can fight for them with the S.P.A.

and stand the possible chance of getting a few into the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, our voter is compelled to go to the polling booth. In the polling

booth, he will be presented with a ballot paper. On that ballot paper, according

to the motion of the Prime Minister who by the grace of the S.P.A. can have what

he will of this country, there will be two questions. One will be on the

P.A.P. merger proposals - Cmd. Paper

33  of  1961. Now, Sir, that is a perfectly fair and proper alternative to  put,

not  merely because there are many people who honestly think it is good, and who

want it, and I can assure you, Sir, many of my friends honestly believe that  it

is  good and sincerely want it, but also it has been fully discussed in this  Assembly;  because it has some precision, although the draft constitution  is  not

before  us, nevertheless there is a Command Paper which has spelt it out.  So  I

say  that one is a fair proposition. Now, if the voter does not want it, he will

have  another one, Sir, and the other one is a complete and unconditional merger

as  a  State on an equal basis with the other 11 States in accordance  with  the

Constitutional  Documents of the Federation of Malaya. On the  face  of  it,  it

looks  fair, because we all understood exactly what this meant before the P.A.P.

started distorting it or rather we understood what -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is a Standing Order which says that an hon. Member

cannot anticipate a motion which will come before the House. He can just mention

it  in passing, but he cannot comment in detail as to whether the proposal is  a

good proposal or a bad proposal. He can just say proposals A and B and pass  his

comments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am only seeking coherence to my explanation

of how this Referendum Bill will work. You will forgive me if I show you briefly

why  it is unacceptable, or why it could be unacceptable to a fairly substantial

section of our people. I will try and be very brief, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think all the hon. Member need say is, "Take proposition

B," which is, in fact, unacceptable, and argue on that premise.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have received a notice of a motion which is specifically for

merger which will be posed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot agree. It is

only  a  notice of a motion. The hon. Member cannot anticipate that  the  motion

will be carried in that form.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No. So I would suggest to the hon. Member that he can suggest

merger proposal A and merger proposal B, one of which is possibly acceptable and

the other one is not.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Let us say that the merger proposal A is Cmd. Paper 33 of 1961,

which  I  say  is perfectly fair and proper and the alternative B  is  a  merger

proposal  like  Penang  and  Malacca with our citizens  having  to  reapply  for

citizenship in the Federation and more than half of them being unable to  obtain

citizenship. Now, proposal B is not acceptable to anybody. I know nobody who has

ever  said  he wanted that kind of merger, however much the Government  may  say

that  it  is  wanted. I understand that the last known remark made  was  by  the

gentleman who is the Prime Minister's Political Secretary and he said that it is

the Communists who want it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> And the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Now, Sir, the Government knows that nobody wants alternative B.

They  know  it.  In fact, that is why they put it. In order to provide  for  the

ascertainment of the wishes of the people, therefore, you have got to  give  the

people a chance to say yes or no to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



A, then you will know, if 100 people go

to vote, 40 vote yes and 60 vote no, or 60 vote yes and 40 vote no, exactly what

the  wishes  of  the people are. But, no, Sir. Those repeated  attempts  of  the

Opposition  to  give our people a chance to say yes or no have  been  repeatedly

defeated by the Government and their friends and allies across the Floor on  the

Front benches of the Opposition. No, Sir. The people are going to be told,  "You

have a choice. Your choice is to strike out the one you do not want, or to put a

cross  against the one you want". But if you do not want Cmd. Paper 33,  and  if

you do not want the alternative, what are you to do? You cannot say "no" to both

because  if  you  put  "no" to both, that will be deemed to  be  ambiguous  and,

according to clause 29, it will be a P.A.P. vote for Cmd. Paper 33 although  you

specifically  say "no". You cannot leave it blank, Sir - better at least  than  it

counting  as a Government vote - because if you leave it blank you are a Communist

confused stooge and are deemed to vote for the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the perfidy of clause 29 which

has shaken even the Member for Bras Basah, who was able until now to stomach  so

much that was dishonest in this Government. And not only has she been disgusted,

Mr  Speaker - I tell you quite frankly that I move in circles where daily I  meet

far more people who want Cmd. Paper 33 than those who do not, but never mind the

argument about it, Sir, they feel it is good and they say we should have  it - but

even they, these people, Sir, are shocked and really disgusted at the suggestion

that  if a man votes "no", the law says it is "yes". Those are the people,  Sir,

who for months and months have been defending the P.A.P. to me, and at last they

are  stunned  into silence - not that it gives me pleasure, Sir,  because  amongst

them  are those who are very close to me, amongst them are those who are my very

good friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no way to say "no". If you cast a blank vote, it is a Government

vote. You try defacing the paper - Mr Speaker, Sir, if you deface the paper, you know you will go to gaol



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



and  you know also that for several years you will have no right to vote  or  to

stand  for  election. The Prime Minister has a brainwave.  He  says,  "Tell  the

people  to  mark  their  preference, and to  sign  their  names  and  put  their

addresses.  Then  it  will count at least as a blank." How  good  of  the  Prime

Minister! Sir, the Prime Minister knows, first and foremost, that there are many

who  are unfortunately still illiterate in Singapore. That is why we provide our

ballot  papers  with  symbols, the way we do. But there is something  much  more

important  than  the  fact that the illiterate will not be  able  to  vote.  The

serious  objection is that those who seek at least to salve their conscience  by

casting  a  blank vote are required to violate the basic principle of democratic

voting,  and  that is the secrecy of the vote. The Prime Minister, in  order  to

enable  a  man to cast a blank or void vote, requires him to transgress  and  to

destroy, or he himself destroys, the principle of the secret vote. It seems that

the man, who at least does not want to say "yes" to either proposition, must, in

order  to  salve his conscience, deprive himself of the right to a secret  vote.

That  is  P.A.P. democracy. He must give his name and address to the P.A.P. and

lay himself open to what may well follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final act of perfidy - though "final" is the wrong term in the context

of  the P.A.P., there will only be a final act of perfidy when they are well and

truly  buried  politically (this corpse that stinks still stands up) - they  ask,

Sir, that the number of those votes which have been cast blank shall be added to

the  Government votes. The people know that these will count for the  Government

because they do not know how to put in a "no", and they do not know how at least

to  put in a blank or a void paper, and so cast a blank one. And not only  that,

Sir,  but  that  these shall be surreptitiously added to the  Government  votes.

Those  who vote "yes" for Command Paper 33 and those who do not want Command  Paper  33 are to be added up together. And the P.A.P. Government will publish  in

the  newspapers,  and  the Straits Times will come out  with  banner  headlines,

"P.A.P. Victory. 100 per cent for







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



Merger". For, Sir, they have shamelessly, and with the assistance of the S.P.A.,

rejected  the  provision which would have enabled at least an identification  of

the  number of blank votes. Even if legally you want to deem them to  be  "yes",

and even if legally you want to give a value to zero, let us know the number  of

zeros.

Even that, we are not to have the solace, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may seem a minor point to you but it is such a breach of the rule of

law that though it may not seem serious to others, to me it is important, and  I

ask your indulgence if I refer to

it.  If a man brings a referendum petition, the Judge will be required by law to

read secret memoranda prepared by

the  Government  and  its  police  and Special Branch  personnel  of  which  the

petitioner is not to be allowed to know anything at all. And the Judge will have

to read memoranda if submitted by Ministers and by their henchmen. And the Judge

will  have  to take them into consideration without letting the petitioner  know

what  is  in  them or enabling him to rebut them; because the law  prevents  the

Judge  from  exercising  a  judicial discretion  which,  in  justice,  he  would

otherwise do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill marks the turning point in the history of the attempts that we

have  made  to  introduce the parliamentary democratic system in Singapore.  For

seven  years I have been railed at, I have been abused, and I have at times  wondered  why  I was submitting to the tortures which only masochists would  enjoy.

Sir, whether it is believed or not.

I tell you it is my firm conviction that

our people, who it is true have never had any traditions of democracy, could  be

imbued  with an understanding and a respect for what is patently the  healthiest

form  of  government evolved by the mind of man. Our people are young; they  are

vital.  They  are  different from others, Sir, I do  say  with  respect  and  no

arrogance  here,  that if you go to other countries and travel round,  when  you

come  back  to  Singapore you will feel reinvigorated once you meet  the  people

here. There is a vitality about them. There is a burning decency about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



them.  There is an intense urge to seek human justice, Sir, others  are  in  the

struggle  for democracy. I have had but a small part myself. I say to  you,  not

with any exaggeration, that we were succeeding, I do believe we were succeeding,

in  our efforts. Tonight marks the turn of the tide, and a very low tide it  was

at that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Seven years too



long!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Seven years is not a long time to win over a people to a new

tradition and a new way of life. And I would have been glad to continue for  yet

another  seven  years. Who was the gentleman in the Bible, Sir, who  worked  for

seven years for his potential father-in-law in order to marry a lady, and on his

wedding  night  was cheated with her sister? And so he worked for still  another

seven years until he got the lady he wanted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It cannot be done here.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I tell you, I am prepared to work for still another seven

years-

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> - if we could win, win fully and sincerely, our people to the

democratic  way,  not only because of ourselves but because this  is  a  crucial

point  for the world and not only for Asia. Singapore is a crucial pivot  culturally, not merely militarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the lesson that the P.A.P. has taught of the potential for dictatorship - and so perfidious a dictatorship at that - of the democratic process is one

which  you  can be sure there will be power-lusting men in the future  who  will

seek to imitate. And I ask the

P.A.P. if ever they are in the Opposition, or the S.P.A. or the U.M.N.O. who are

supporting them in this Bill, how can they in future ever criticise a government

for dishonesty, when they themselves are initiating a Bill, with the

S.P.A. and U.M.N.O. supporting it, that

is  patently  dishonest? How can our people, Sir, the people  of  Singapore,  be

expected to respect the democratic process, to seek to adopt and adapt it when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



the Government is proving that through this democratic process it can act in the

spirit of the most barbarous and violent dictators?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is intended to conceal the wishes of the people of Singapore in relation to the issue of the reunification of Singapore and the Federation of

Malaya. What is sought is a legalistic smokescreen to cover dishonest manoeuvres

whereby  the Government can pretend to a 100 per cent support for its proposals,

proposals  which in themselves may well be acceptable but which  the  Government

has not the courage to put the test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Sir, I shall vote against giving it a Third Reading because this Bill,

in  fact  and in truth, seeks to conceal the wishes of the people with reference

to the constitutional proposals that may be posed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, very soon, under the provisions of the

National  Referendum Bill, each of the 624,000 voters in the electoral  list  of

Singapore  will  receive a card and be asked to go and  cast  the  vote  on  the

constitutional  future for ourselves and our children and of future  generations

to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[MR DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair].</b></div>



<br><br>11.02 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the Member for Anson has said, the vote is compulsory and everybody must go and cast his or her vote to decide his or her

future.  But  under the present Bill as it stands, the voters of Singapore  have

very little choice to decide what is to be the political future of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have debated for many days the undemocratic provisions of the Bill, and in

particular  clause  5 and clause 29. We will receive a card very  soon,  perhaps

towards the end of the month or just the beginning of next month. We will go  to

the polling station and we will receive a ballot paper with two symbols, perhaps

hardly  understood by the voter because the Opposition Parties  will  have  only

less than seven days to explain to the voter what those symbols



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



mean.  I am afraid that during the seven days, with all the restrictions imposed

on  the Opposition Parties, we can hardly convene a few referendum mass meetings

in order to explain the issues at stake and what each symbol will represent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the voter will face a ballot paper and he knows

that  proposal No. A, which is the White Paper constitutional proposals  of  the

P.A.P.  Government, through all these months of discussion, is  unacceptable  to

him. In the next column there will be a second proposal which, on the face of it - and  this  has been mentioned in the Prime Minister's proposed  motion  to  be

brought  up  in  the  next  few  days - after  its  exposure,  will  also   appear

unacceptable, or even more unacceptable than the first proposal,  which  is  the

White Paper proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have only 14 days between the date of the

announcement of the referendum and polling day; 14 days is hardly sufficient  to

explain  what  the  two proposals mean. Then we will only  have  seven  days  to

explain to the voters what the symbols mean. Sir, the voter will go to the  polling  booth and in front of him will be a ballot paper. What is he going to  do?

He  does not want to vote for the White Paper. Neither does he want to vote  for

the second proposal. And there will be four choices open to him. Firstly, he can

abstain  from going to vote; and the Member for Anson has said just now that  he

will  be fined $5 and he will lose the right to vote in coming elections. If  he

does  not  abstain from going to the polling booth, he can write  his  name  and

address and the vote will be considered a void vote. Or else he can tear off the

ballot paper, or he can cast a blank vote. There are three alternatives open  to

him  - write his name and address; tear off the ballot paper or cast a blank

vote. Let us analyse the consequences of each way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he writes his name and address;

those who can write their names and addresses would be afraid of being called up

by the Government and have to take all the consequences. But what I am afraid is

that many people who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



illiterate or semi-illiterate would not be able to write even their names and addresses. Some who could would be so scared to write.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second alternative is to tear up the ballot paper, and he will face a long

gaol sentence.



If  he  chooses the third alternative of casting a blank vote, it will be considered as a Government vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to repeat here all the arguments which have been used earlier.

Even  if  we repeat them here, what we are afraid is that it will not  get  very

much  space  in tomorrow's newspapers, because we have noticed in the  last  few

days  that the space allotted to the opposition Parties is less than 20 per cent

or 15 per cent of all the political speeches made in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we want a fair and honest referendum which will decide whether the White

Paper  proposals  are  acceptable to the people. This referendum  should  be  an

honest  one which will reflect the real and true wishes of the people; in  other

words,  to ascertain the wishes of the majority of the people. We do not want  a

dishonest  and  a sham referendum. But under the present Bill as it  stands,  we

will  not  have  an  honest referendum. The result, as I said  yesterday,  is  a

foregone conclusion. We can expect that in the coming referendum, the Government

will  win  perhaps  with a 99 per cent landslide victory for their  White  Paper

proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, in these circumstances, is it really necessary for the Government to

put  forward this facade of democracy? The Government has not only been  content

to muzzle the views of the people in the Referendum Bill -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, on a point of information.



<br><br><!--Mr Mammen(Deputy Speaker)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen)</b>: If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If, as the Member has alleged, the Government is anxious

to muzzle the views and the voice of the people, would the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



Hong Lim explain why he did not turn up at a radio forum to which he was invited

on Wednesday? Nobody wants to muzzle him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already written to Radio

Singapore to put forward our stand on the radio forum. We have not got a  reply.

That is the reason why we did not go to the radio forum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no need for the Government to put up this

sham  democracy,  this  sham facade of democracy. Under the  provisions  of  the

Referendum  Bill, not only will there be a sham referendum, but  the  Opposition

Parties  will  not  be  allowed  even freedom to  expose  the  sham  referendum.

Political  propaganda  during  the referendum period  against  the  White  Paper

proposals  will be restricted. Referendum mass meetings will be subject  to  all

forms  of  restrictions. The number of blank votes cast during  the  coming  referendum against the Government's White Paper proposals will not be known.  Never

have  we  heard  in  the  history of the world of  such  a  sham  and  dishonest

referendum being held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will become famous overnight after polling day for having held such

a  perfidious and dishonest referendum in the history of referenda in the world.

The  name of the P.A.P. Government will always be remembered for a long time  to

come, even after they have left the political scene. The 1962 referendum held in

Singapore  will be the subject of much research in subsequent history,  so  that

students  of  history,  political science and the art of political  manipulation

will  have  much  to  learn from the 1962 referendum held in  Singapore.  It  is

indeed. Sir, a great contribution to the present Government, one more chapter in

the history of restriction of freedom and democracy.



<br><br>11.15 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am speaking

on  behalf of the majority of the people in Singapore to show my dissatisfaction

with  this Bill and I am now speaking with deep sorrow of what I think  of  this

Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this Bill originally aimed at

giving  the  people the chance to say whether they accept or reject  the  merger

plan  of  the P.A.P. Those who have said so include the Chairman of the  P.A.P.,

its  Prime  Minister, and others. The Chairman of the P.A.P. said  sometime  in

September  last year, in reply to queries from three leaders of the  Opposition,

namely,  the  Chairman  of the Barisan Sosialis, those of  the  U.P.P. and  the

Workers'  Party,  that  arrangements between the Singapore  and  the  Federation

Governments  had  been made and that they wanted to find  out  from  the  people

whether  these were acceptable or not. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, even  the  Prime

Minister himself said - and he said this on the 25th of September last year  over

Radio Singapore in a Press conference - something to this effect:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the National Referendum there will be about 650,000 of the electorate -'

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member is quoting from any document he will have

to give the name and the type of document he is quoting from.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister  said  this over Radio Singapore. It was on the 25th of  September.  At

that  time he said that if the people wanted merger, they could mark a cross  in

the  square  for yes; and if they did not, then they could put a  cross  in  the

square  for  no.  The Prime Minister even said at the Teachers' Day  celebration

that  the  merger plan would be given to the people for a decision.  There  were

many  others  who said so, and I do not wish to take up too much  time  of  this

Assembly to make quotations. However, as sincere leaders in the Government, they

should carry out what they have promised. They should not deviate from what they

have  promised.  But unfortunately, the P.A.P. leaders before  us  have  already

forgotten entirely the promises they made in the past. In fact, they are  trying

to  pay  a  very  unfair game in order to change their promises. Now  they  have

turned  round to say that they will find out from the people what type of merger

they want. The mode and manner of merger is actually Cmd.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



Paper  33  of this Assembly. The people of Singapore know full well the contents

of  this White Paper. They also know that the White Paper on merger is going  to

be  detrimental  to  the future of the people. It is not going  to  provide  any

safeguard  for the rights of the people in Singapore. According to the intention

of  the  Government, it seems that another type of merger will  be  put  to  the

people  for  a decision. What is the content of this other type of merger?  What

will  be its provisions? Not only do the people of Singapore not know, but  even

the  people in this House do not know what type of merger is to be put. We  have

not  received  any report on the other type of merger. If after the  passage  of

this   National  Referendum  Bill,  the  Government  should  hold  a  referendum

immediately,  then  the Government can pose two questions.  The  first  question

could  be  the White Paper on merger. The second question could be the  type  of

merger whose contents the people of Singapore do not know. So when this question

should  be  put  before the people, how are they going to make a choice?  So  in

their  rage the people have no alternative but to put in blank votes or to  draw

tortoises, birds and other signs on the ballot papers. According to clause 29 of

this  Bill,  blank votes and votes that contain indecent signs and  other  marks

will  be  taken as votes in support of the Government. So on a matter  that  concerns  the  entire interests of the people, the Government is trying to  mislead

the  people  by this National Referendum Bill and to ignore the true wishes  and

will of the people. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill has been drafted with  unconstitutional principles on a very illegal basis. The true spirit of this  Bill

is  to  indulge in illegitimate means, and if we should allow this Bill to pass,

then that will mean that it is against the principle of the basic constitutional

spirit  and  it  will  be  criticised by the world. As a representative  of  the

people, it is my duty to see that democracy is safeguarded to show that the true

spirit of democracy is not damaged by the pseudo democrats. Not only do we  want

to show the pseudo democrats for what they are, but we also want to see that the

basic rights of the people are secured



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



in  order that every man in Singapore will be able to express his own will in a

constitutional  matter. But before us today, there appear some  P.A.P. leaders

who  attempt  to  undermine democracy and the rights of the people.  This  they

want  to do by the National Referendum Bill. When this Bill came up for  Second

Reading,  the  Minister for Home Affairs tried to make amendments  thereto  and

tried  to  include certain undemocratic clauses. So when this Bill was  up  for

Second  Reading,  almost  every  Member in the Opposition,  together  with  the

people,  showed their dissatisfaction with all these clauses. They exposed  the

fact  that  the P.A.P. was trying to have a dishonest victory in the referendum

on  merger.  They would not allow the people to have a chance to say  'no'.  In

the  course of the heated debate, it was suggested that the Bill should be  committed  to  a  Select Committee. Representations and memoranda  came  from  the

people's  organisations,  such  as  the organisation  of  hawkers  -

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think

the  Member for Pasir Panjang is going straight back to all the arguments  which

were  put  in  Select  Committee as well as when the Bill  was  committed  to  a

Committee of the whole Assembly. For the convenience of Members, may I quote the

Standing Order regarding Third Reading, Standing Order 78 (1) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the third reading of a Bill amendments may be proposed to the question

"That  the Bill be now read a third time" similar to those which may be proposed

on second reading:

but  the  debate shall be confined to the contents of the Bill and any  reasoned

amendment which raises matters not included in the Bill shall be out of order.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the Member for Pasir Panjang is going to repeat all the memoranda and

representations received in Select Committee and the same arguments  which  have

been  dealt  with for the past many days in this Assembly, he will be completely

out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to

mention all this because the Government does not want to accept the views of the

people. That is why I have to remind this House of what has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



submitted  in  order to oppose the Third Reading of this Bill. In Select  Committee, the Government maintained its obstinacy and refused to respect the views of

the  people.  The  Government did not even consider the  amendments  which  were

reasonable and which were moved by the Barisan Sosialis. We spent a lot of  time

in Select Committee discussing this Bill, and that was the treatment we got.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before the Third Reading of this Bill is passed and

the  Bill  thereby becoming law, we will then have the responsibility to  oppose

its  Third  Reading, because it is the basic intention of this Bill to  encroach

upon the basic rights of the people.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>11.31 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere in the world can we find such provisions as those contained in this

Bill put forward by the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 5 of the Bill

says that the Government can pose two questions to the people for a decision and

that the people must choose one of these two questions; the people will have  no

right  to say no. This provision is trying to force the people to accept one  of

two  questions  which are equally unacceptable; that is to  say,  the  provision

wants to force the people to do things which are detrimental to their future. So

Mr Speaker, Sir, this compulsory provision in this Bill has encroached upon the

basic rights of the people to make a choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 29 regarding blank votes provides that blank votes

will  be  taken  as  votes in support of the Government. Why should  the  P.A.P.

Government  provide that blank votes should be deemed to be votes in support  of

the  Government? This is because of the provision in clause 5 which  will  allow

the  Government  to pose two unacceptable questions to the people  and,  on  the

other hand, disallow them to say no.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do hope that the Member is not going back to that debate

as to whether or not there should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



be two questions and all other provisions of clause 29.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, talking on principles, we can see that the  leaders  of  the

PA.P. have  openly admitted - and even the Minister for Finance has admitted - that

this  Bill is not in keeping with legal principles or constitutional principles.

He  said so in Select Committee. So the Minister for Finance has admitted openly

that this Bill is not based on constitutional principles. That means that he  is

trying to make something illegitimate into something which is legal.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now debating an amendment which asks the House to

decline  to give a Third Reading to this Bill "on the ground that the provisions

therein  are  inappropriate and inadequate for that purpose", that is,  for  the

purpose  of  holding a referendum. That is all that the debate must be  confined

to. The debate should be confined to the contents of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, when we were debating this Bill on its Second Reading, Members

of the Opposition, especially those of the S.P.A., were opposed to this Bill.

But  after some time, these Members have somersaulted and they now support  this

Bill.  All of a sudden, they have now become supporters of the Bill. So  we  can

see that the S.P.A. has joined forces with the P.A.P. and we know-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot see how the fact that the S.P.A. has supported

the  Bill makes the Bill inappropriate or inadequate for a referendum, which  is

what  we  are debating. The hon. Member must try and show how the provisions  of

this Bill - or some of the provisions

- are  inappropriate and inadequate for the purpose of holding  a  referendum  on

merger. That is all we are debating.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, if this Bill should be allowed to pass, we the representatives

of  the  people will be condemned by all democratic countries in the  world.  We

will be condemned for insulting democracy and for undermining democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  as  a  responsible representative, I suggest  two  courses  in  the

interests  of democracy. First, do we want to be condemned as traitors  to  democracy?  Second,  in order to safeguard the spirit of democracy  and  to  act  in

accordance  with the law and legal principles, we must oppose the Third  Reading

of this Bill.



<br><br>11.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this

Referendum Bill is full of unreasonable and undemocratic provisions. At the same

time, the P.A.P. Government is making use of these ambiguous provisions to cheat

and  intimidate the people. As representatives of the people, if  we  are  faced

with the dictatorship of the P.A.P. under cover of democracy, we have a duty  to

expose their plots.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I might remind the Member for Jalan Kayu that he is

addressing  the Speaker, and the Speaker is not sitting in the Back  benches  of

the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, after this Bill has gone through two Committees,  the  P.A.P.

Government  are  going to pose two questions to the people.  They  have  already

stated  categorically that they will pose two questions for the  choice  of  the

people.  Mr Speaker, Sir, in the circumstances described - I do not  have  to

elaborate  on these - how are the people going to make a choice between these  two

questions? This act of depriving the right of the people will anger them.  There

are  provisions which provide some restrictions. For example, the people  cannot

cast blank votes because they will be taken as Government votes. The explanation

given  by  the  Government is that it is necessary because  the  Communists  are

trying to sabotage and wreck the referendum by working up the people. Is this  a

justifiable explanation?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not interested in that at the moment. We have

already  debated  clause 29, and we have already debated the allegation  of  the

Government. The fact remains that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



clause  29  is in the Bill, and all that the Member can say now is  that  it  is

probably  inappropriate for this referendum on merger. I do not want the  merits

of the clause to be debated again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, there are some important points in the provision. What I have said

just now is most important. This provision is very ambiguous, and the Government

may  make  use of it to cheat the people. Therefore, I am here to reiterate  the

point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will realise that blank votes mean that the people give

up  their rights. It means the people who abstain. If we look around the  world,

whatever the government may be, whether it is a party or any organisation, blank

votes mean abstention. They can never be considered as votes in support of-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is now arguing against clause 29.

He cannot do that. We have finished

arguing against clause 29. We are on the Third Reading. We are not in Committee.

He  must accept the fact that clause 29 is part of the Bill. All he can  say  is

that  clause 29 is not an appropriate clause for the purpose of a referendum  on

merger between Singapore and the Federation. There are several arguments he  can

advance. I could suggest them, but I will let him do it himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I am explaining the point that this Bill is undemocratic and  that

it cannot be passed for the Third Reading because it cannot ascertain the wishes

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already pointed out that the Bill cheats. It is also

full  of  ridiculous provisions and intimidation. The intimidating provision  is

barbarious  and  it is regulated by the Government. When this  Bill  becomes  an

Ordinance,  the people have no choice at all. If they do not want to vote,  then

there is Provision in the Bill to intimidate the people, saying that there  will

be a fine imposed on them and they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



will  be  deprived of their citizenship. If the people are confronted with  this

restriction,  they may get so angry that they may deface, tear  or  destroy  the

ballot  paper. Then according to this Bill they will have committed an  offence.

When  the  people  deface their own ballot papers, it is just  like  the  people

tearing  their  own  money. Yet there is provision in the Bill  to  deprive  the

people of their own rights. They will be subject to imprisonment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. He must accept

that  it  is  now part of the Bill. The hon. Member must learn to  accept  these

things.  Now  we  are debating whether or not these clauses are  appropriate  or

adequate for the purpose of this referendum. That is all we are arguing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the

Bill is to launch a merger between

Singapore and the Federation of

Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member has been repeating his words. I wonder whether he is trying to

filibuster and waste the time of the Assembly. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I should imagine the Member for Queenstown ought to be

able  to  behave himself. I have not noticed that the Member for Jalan Kayu  has

been  repeating himself too much. He has been repeating himself, but he has  not

become tedious.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

This  Bill is merely for the purpose of merger. Let me explain the word "merger"

to  show  that  the  Bill is for the purpose of cheating.  Mr  Speaker,  merger

actually means -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is

completely  out of order. The Member is completely irrelevant. I have  indicated

the trend of the debate. I think the hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



Member  must  accept, as I say, what has been written into the Bill,  and  he

must  now  show  by specific reference to certain clauses of  the  Bill  that

those  clauses, in fact, are inappropriate or inadequate for the  purpose  of

holding  a  referendum on merger or the reunification between  Singapore  and

the Federation of Malaya. I do not think a definition of merger will help.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the provisions of this Bill contain much that is undemocratic and the Opposition Parties have to attack

them. Our criticisms and attacks have been suppressed by the Government.

As regards the space in the Press for

their publication -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The space in the

Press  has nothing to do with the Third Reading of this Bill. As I  say,  the

hon.  Member must accept that clauses have been written into this  Bill.  Now

he  must  show  that  these  clauses or certain  of  these  clauses  are  not

appropriate  or  adequate for the purpose of a referendum on  merger  between

Singapore and the Federation. That is all the issue.

I  do  not  want  to hear anything more about the freedom  of  the  Press  or

blocking of Opposition Members in that direction, unless the hon. Member  can

make a specific reference to a clause, and there are clauses to which he  can

make specific reference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

in  that  case,  I  will  not speak any more. When the appropriate  questions

arise, I will make further speeches.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I support the amendment of the Member for Anson



that we decline to give this Bill -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point



of order. Sir, as this is the last major speech on the Third Reading, I think

we will be quite happy to sit through until the Member for Queenstown has

finished in order that we will have more time tomorrow to discuss many  other

matters.  We have given them up to Thursday for the Second Reading. Obviously

everything has been thoroughly canvassed, but if they want to finish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



the Third Reading tonight, I will recommend that we do so. We are quite prepared

to oblige them and they will have an extra day tomorrow for many other things.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The answer I think is

no! Dr Lee, please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am surprised that the Prime Minister wants to sell out the

rights of Singapore so quickly on time, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We are giving

you more time! [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is his whole idea of guillotining our speeches and

debate, Sir. He just wants to serve foreign interests on time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime

Minister got up on quite a legitimate point of order. He made an offer and I

answered for the Opposition, and that is the end of it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this Bill has

been the object of severe condemnation amongst all classes of people in Singapore, all strata of society, the workers, farmers-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Doctors!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - professional men, yes, doctors, dentists-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Grave diggers!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind

the hon. Member for Queenstown that I likened him to an orchestra leader last

night when, instead of addressing the Chair, he addressed Members on the

Government Benches directly. Of course, this invites interjections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is midnight.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That this Assembly do now adjourn."-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].
