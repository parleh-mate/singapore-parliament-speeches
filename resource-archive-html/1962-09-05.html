<div align="center"><b>DEATH OF MEMBER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I wish to take this, the first

opportunity which has presented itself of referring to

the death of Inche Ahmad bin Ibrahim, the Minister for

Labour and Member for Sembawang, which occurred on the

21st of August, 1962.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 22nd of August, 1962, on behalf of this

Assembly,  I  addressed a letter to his widow  in  the

following terms:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I desire, on behalf of the Legislative Assembly, to

express to you and members of your family, with  great

regret and with very deep sympathy, our expression  of

the  sense of loss the Assembly has sustained  at  the

sad passing of your husband.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the law, I duly acquainted His

Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of the resultant

vacancy in this Assembly.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Tributes  by  Leader  of  the  House  and  Opposition Leaders</b></div>



<br><br><!--Dr Toh Chin Chye(Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the House)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Deputy  Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>  Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is my sad duty to formally inform the

House  that the Minister for Labour, Inche  Ahmad  bin

Ibrahim,  Member for Sembawang, passed  away  on  21st

August, 1962, barely two weeks ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Prime Minister, has already paid a

tribute  to him on behalf of the people and Government

of  Singapore. I find it an equally difficult task, as

Leader  of the House, on behalf of this House, to  pay

our  tribute to an honourable and brave colleague. The

people will never know how indebted we are to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our moment of rejoicing after the verdict of the

referendum  was  known, our hearts  were  filled  with

sorrow  by the thought of how much the results of  the

referendum would have cheered him. Had he been  alive,

he  would have known that he had not lived and  fought

to  live  in vain. He was in great pain and suffering.

Had  he  asked  for sedation, which the doctors  would

have been fully justified in giving him, he would have

shortened his life. But he wanted to live on in  order

that he could see this referendum through with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure all Members of this House will wish these

proceedings to be placed in the records of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful, Mr Speaker, for your message of

sympathy which you sent on behalf of the House to  his

widow  and children. They will shortly return to their

kampong in Penang.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my sad privilege, Sir, to pay this tribute

to  a man, by nature humble and unassuming, a  man

who  made  friends easily, who was unselfish,  and

who  I  believe was liked by all who knew  him  in

this House since 1955.



<br><br>1.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Sir, may I on behalf of

the   Barisan  Sosialis,  say  that  we  associate

ourselves with the sentiments expressed by you and

by the Leader of the House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have known Inche Ahmad to be a sincere friend

in spite of our political differences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take this opportunity to express our deepest

concern over his unfortunate death.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  associate my Party with  the  sentiments

expressed  by you and by the Leader of  the  House

in  regard  to  the  sad loss sustained  by  this

Assembly and by the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saying is indeed true, Sir, "Those whom the

gods  love  die young." The late Inche  Ahmad  bin

Ibrahim was indeed a very good man. I knew him for

many,  many years, even before he became a  Member

of  this  Assembly. He was a man  sincere  in  his

desire  to  work for the people of Singapore,  and

when  his  Party came to power and he was  made  a

Minister, he did his best, in spite of his failing

health,  to  discharge his  duties  in  the  best

interests of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we feel a great loss in the death of our

very good friend and worker.



<br><br>1.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to

express our sense of great loss to Inche Ahmad bin

Ibrahim widow and to his children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our friend has gone to where he will never come

back.  His passing away is indeed a great loss  to

the  State  of Singapore. He was a man who  served

Singapore in all earnestness, and nothing was  too

much trouble for him. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



known him as a person with a wonderful I character

not only as a friend but as a political opponent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great pity indeed that he is not here

to  know of the result of our joint effort for the

welfare of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of my Party and my colleagues, I wish

to thank you, Mr Speaker, for having expressed on

behalf of this House our sympathy to his widow and

children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on

behalf  of  the Member for Punggol and  myself,  I

wish  to  express  our  deepest  sympathy  on  the

passing  away  of  Inche Ahmad  bin  Ibrahim,  the

former Minister for Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a humble man and he earned the respect of

the  Members of all Parties in this House whatever

political differences we might have had.  He  will

be a loss to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Member for Punggol and myself,

I  wish to take this opportunity of expressing our

sympathy  to his widow and his children  who  have

suffered much by his loss.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim was the only Member of the

Cabinet for whom I had affection and regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known him for seven years as a political

opponent, and I say truthfully he was a good  man,

sincere and genuinely humble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grieved to learn of the long period of

physical  agony that he suffered with  such  quiet

dignity,  and I would like to express a  sense  of

personal  loss  and  sincere  condolence  to   his

bereaved family.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As a mark of respect to the late

Member,  I  propose to suspend. I shall  take  the

Chair again at 1.15 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>"GUILLOTINE" MOTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, as the House is

aware,   the  results  of  the  poll  taken  on   the

referendum  have  already been made  known.  However,

under  the law the Assembly must decide on the  blank

votes and on the uncertain votes that have been cast.

It  is necessary that a final decision should be made

on  the  uncertain and blank ballot papers so that  a

formal  result  of the poll can be  conveyed  to  the

Government  of the Federation of Malaya,  the  United

Kingdom  Government, and the United  Nations  Special

Committee on Colonialism. It is for this reason  that

I have requested you, Mr Speaker, to summon this one-day  sitting of the Assembly so that the House  can

decide  on the fate of the uncertain and blank ballot

papers.  It is my hope, Mr Speaker, that a  decision

will be quickly arrived at by this House. I therefore

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on item 2 of the Order Paper

for this day shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.00 p.m. today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, we are

summoned to an emergency sitting of this Assembly  to

enact yet another scene of the tragedy of destruction

of   respect  and  goodwill  for  democracy  and  the

democratic  process. This Assembly has now  become  a

public   plaything  of  the  P.A.P.  Even  the   time

allocated  for  consideration  of  vital  matters  of

public  importance, as alleged by the Leader  of  the

House, is  now to be limited to meet the convenience

of the social activities of our Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is need for an emergency session of this

Assembly,  why limit it to five hours? Is it  because

the  Prime Minister has a party at 6.30 this evening?

Is it because he has decided to leave late tonight on

another  of  his  many trips, and  cannot  trust  his

colleagues to carry on without him? Is this  Assembly

then  the  Prime Minister's toy, like a yo-yo  to  be

twisted on his finger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



as  and when he pleases? Was it not anticipated  last

week  by the Leader of the House that there would  be

published  a  Referendum Report by the Superintendent

of  the  Referendum? Why could he not have used  some

intelligent anticipation and given notice to suit the

Prime   Minister's   convenience   and   his   social

activities  for  the holding of this special  sitting

last Monday, Sir? We could then have had a full day's

hearing  at  least,  or  yesterday  when  the   Prime

Minister  would have been there to guide his  cohorts

in  the  methods of dishonesty now so  eminently  and

publicly  known as the principal instrument of  P.A.P

policy.  Why was this notice not given last week  for

the  convening of this Assembly earlier if we had  to

suit   the  Prime  Minister's  convenience?  Was   it

because,  Mr  Speaker,  had  the  results   of   the

referendum been other than they are, there would have

been  no  sitting of this Assembly? That they  waited

to  make quite sure that there would be no question

about  the  blank  votes and they could  publish  the

blank  votes before they could have the  courage  to

give  notice  of the convening of this Assembly?  The

notice  of  sitting was given last Monday  after  the

referendum results were known.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leader of the House must have been fully conscious that there must be a sitting of this Assembly whatever the results of the referendum. Why did he not give his notice earlier?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion standing in the Prime Minister's name is

a  motion of shameless dishonesty as well as one,  in

my  submission, that is illegal. It is my  intention,

subject to your ruling, Mr Speaker, Sir, to rise  on

a  point of order when it is called in order to  draw

attention  to  its illegality and  its  being  ultra

vires the provisions of the Referendum Ordinance, and

an  attempt by the Government to pass on the dirt  of

its  own section 29 to the Opposition which has  been

consistently fighting it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be, Mr Speaker, you will over-rule me, in

which event it will be my desire to draw attention to

the   perfidy  of  the  main  motion  in  the   Prime

Minister's  name,  to  quote  from  Select  Committee

proceedings and Assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



debates  to show that it is the Government,  not  the

Opposition, that is responsible for section  29.  The

Opposition  consistently  resisted  it.  It  is   the

Government  that  must  take  the  decision  of   the

Assembly, not-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is not all this relevant to the

second  item and not to the first item on  the  Order

Paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, I will

draw  attention  to  the various aspects  which  need

time,  and I promise you I shall merely briefly  pass

through  them  so that the Assembly  can  assess  the

amount  of  time  necessary for the consideration  of

some of the salient issues raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the Government that forced through

section 29, and it is my intention to show this,  and

it  is  hoped that others will also seek  to  discuss

this theme. Though the Government can pass a Bill  to

make a man into a woman, it cannot say the Opposition

says  that a man is a woman when the Opposition votes

against it. But above all, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my

intention to draw the attention of the Government  to

the fact that it has the opportunity to be honest and

yet  have  its cake, have what it wants. And whatever

its  tradition of dishonesty, whatever its  corkscrew

incapacity to go straight, here is one chance  to  be

honest,  here  is  one chance to act constitutionally

like  other civilised human beings, and here  is  one

chance  where, without costing them anything, we  can

so   gracefully   avoid   utilising   the   dishonest

provisions which they prepared. We should  allow  the

people of Singapore to go into this merger which they

want with clean hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt, Mr Speaker, that every Member of

the Opposition - certainly many of them - would wish  to

develop some of these themes. I can see no reason why

this  Assembly  should be treated  in  such  arrogant

fashion  to suit the social engagements of the  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have a three-day case in Malacca. I cancelled it in order to be here. The Prime Minister

can cancel his social engagement at 6.30 p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



and  allow  us adequate time for debate. I will  vote

against the motion limiting the time to 6.00 p.m.  We

are not a P.A.P. plaything.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this so-called

urgent  Assembly  sitting was made  known  to  us  on

Monday   afternoon.  We  were  informed  late  Monday

afternoon  that there was going to be  a  sitting  on

Wednesday  to discuss a matter of very urgent  public

importance. And this is what it is about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if this matter, which is to be debated later,

is of such urgent public importance as the Government

has  deemed it, then it should not limit the time  of

the  House  to its discussion. How could a matter  of

urgent public importance be debated and thrashed  out

fully within as short a time as 4½ hours?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if this "guillotine" motion is

being  forced  through by Government's  majority,  it

would  convey  the  impression  to  the  public  that

today's  Assembly  sitting has  been  called  not  to

discuss a matter of urgent public importance  but  to

put  forward  nothing  but just  plain,  pure  P.A.P.

propaganda.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we realise that

opposing this guillotine motion will not get us  very

far  because  the Government, by virtue of  the  fact

that it has a majority in this House, is in

position  to  carry  it through. We  merely  wish  to

register   our   strongest   protest   against   this

guillotine motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have abstained from voting in this Chamber

on  guillotine motions in the past. It appears to  us

that guillotine motions have become the order of  the

day  for the P.A.P. We register our strongest protest

and   we  hope  that  at  least  in  the  future  the

Government  will  try  to refrain  from  abusing  its

powers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it was not my intention to speak on this motion

in  reply to the hon. Members about the time for  the

main  debate.  However, the Member for Anson  in  his

usual  manner  has launched into a tirade  which  has

brought in my social engagements and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



other  activities, and I feel that in fairness,  I

should say: yes, the matter was anticipated and it

was duly discussed by us in Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, the Leader of the House consulted

the  officials of the Assembly about the  relevant

provisions  and  we did this as a  calculated  and

deliberate move, and we believe it is the  correct

move.  The campaign was going on right to its  end

on Saturday, and we did not want to throw anything

into  the scales that would have just been another

straw  which  might have disturbed the  course  of

events.  That being so, we had to wait  until  the

votes had been registered. Saturday was a holiday;

Sunday  was a holiday; and we required  one  clear

day's  notice. Notice had either to  be  given  on

Friday,   which   would  have  been   before   the

referendum  results,  or  immediately  after   the

referendum results, which was on Monday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in so calculating, I anticipated

that  it  would interfere with certain engagements

to   which  I  have  committed  myself,  such   as

attending  a conference of Commonwealth  socialist

leaders in London, many of whom will perhaps  have

fond  memories of the Member for Anson. I  do  not

intend to break this engagement as I think  it  is

useful  to  the country. The people  should  know

that the Communist line of a reactionary, corrupt,

effete  and decadent Government should be debunked

and utterly exploded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided on the time - a full five hours

without  a  tea-break. It was carefully calculated

to  give  a full day's sitting. One p.m. to  6.00

p.m. is equivalent to 2.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. minus

half  an hour tea-break. It is as simple as  that

arithmetically. Having decided that it would be at 6.00 p.m. and discovering that I had some time  to

spare,  I  decided this evening to thank  publicly

the many social and civic organisations which took

a stand and helped to break the Communist myth of

the  masses  supporting whatever balderdash,  the

tirades   of  abuse  that  they  heaped  on   this

Assembly.  I make no apologies for this either  to

Members  of this House or to the public.  What  we

have done is in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



the  best  interests of the country. And what  we,

intend  to  do  is  in the best interests  of  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson makes the mistake of

confusing  his propaganda line. He accuses  me  of

another  joy  jaunt,  it is a  mistake  which  Mr

Woodhull and other Members of the Barisan Sosialis

bitterly  paid for when they appeared  before  the

United Nations Committee of Seventeen. The P.A.P.,

of which I am proud to have been a member all this

time,  does not change its colours and its habits.

We  move in a deliberate and calculated manner  in

the  interests of the people, regardless of  abuse

and   regardless  of  tirades.   They   leave   us

completely  unmoved, and I am  glad  to  say  they

leave the people completely unmoved too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, it is utterly

dishonest  of  the  Opposition to say  that  they  did

not  have  time to decide on the future of  the  blank

votes  when  the  whole of Singapore  know  that  they

have  been  campaigning  for blank  votes  ever  since

April  1962.  Surely  when they campaigned  for  blank

votes,  they  knew what was the purpose of  the  blank

votes.  Do  they mean to say that now they  want  more

time  to  consider  the future of these  blank  votes?

Do  they  mean  to say that they never knew  what  the

blank  votes,  which they asked the  voters  to  cast,

were   meant   for?   That  is  a   piece   of   utter

dishonesty  and  insincerity which is  very  obviously

shown  here  by  the  Opposition.  We  have  called  a

full  day's  sitting of this House so that  the  House

can  utilise  five hours to decide on  the  future  of

these  blank  votes.  In particular,  Members  of  the

U.P.P.,   the   Barisan  Sosialis  and  the   Workers'

Party  should  have  decided long ago  why  they  ever

called  for  blank  votes to be  cast.  Having  called

for  blank  votes  for the past few months,  they  now

have  the  audacity  to come to  this  House  and  say

that  they  want  more time to debate on  these  blank

votes.

<div align="center"><b>UNCERTAIN AND UNMARKED BALLOT PAPERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving this

motion,  we are formally bringing to an end a decisive

phase of our history. I hope I did the right thing  in

doing  this  House  the  courtesy  of  staying  behind

personally  to  move  this motion. The  constitutional

struggle for merger and Malaysia is over. The struggle

began with a special sitting of this Assembly on  22nd

of  July last year, when the lines were drawn between

the  sides for and against merger and the issues  were

joined. It went on for a full, grim and relentless  14

months.  On  the constitutional plane, the Communists,

fighting through their united front organisations like

the  Barisan Sosialis, the Communist-led trade unions,

the  Old  Boys' Associations, the Rural  Dwellers  and

Country  People's Associations, have all lost. Whether

they  will  start an unconstitutional  struggle  is  a

matter for them. Suffice it to say that they embark on

unconstitutional actions at their own peril.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party colleagues, who have experience of the ways

of  the  Malayan  Communist Party and  its  subsidiary

organisations-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Would  it be appropriate at this juncture to take  the

point of order that the motion which I understand  the

Prime Minister will be moving is ultra vires?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would be convenient, I think, if we

hear  the  Prime Minister. He will probably  touch  on

that  aspect in his speech. I do not know. But it  may

be  more convenient for the Prime Minister to complete

his  speech and then I will allow the Member to  raise

his point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> My Party colleagues, who have

experience of the ways of the Malayan Communist  Party

and  its subsidiary organisations, tell me that  there

will  be  a great deal of criticism and self-criticism

amongst  leaders of every rank of the underground  and

open-front  Communist organisations.  Errors  will  be

analysed   and   the  perpetrators  of  these   errors

chastised,  general rectification instituted  and  the

scapegoats quietly found and sacrificed in the hope of

some  eventual victory. This is the moment  of  bitter

truth  for them and many aspiring young, up and coming

Marxist  theoreticians have blotted  their  copy-books

and  prejudiced their place of honour in the Communist

hierarchy.  Something  has gone  wrong  somewhere  and

socialist   realism  was  brought  home  with   bitter

unpleasantness  in  the early  hours  of  Sunday,  2nd

September. Of course, the revolution will go  on,  and

they  will  try to whip things up again.  But  we  are

prepared to meet them on any issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not really require erudition in Marxism-Leninism to see why and where they went wrong, and

where they invited disaster. The simple lesson of the

last  14  months  is  that, however ruthless,  however

clever,  and however organised the steel framework  of

Communist-trained  cadres can be, the  attack  on  the

enemy  will  fail if the basic analysis is wrong.  The

most  fundamental analysis is to define  who  are  the

people,  and  who are the enemies of  the  people.  To

fight  nationalist groups even if they are decried  in

Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



dogma as bourgeois democratic elements,  at  a

time when the common enemy is in Communist theory also

still   Colonial   Imperialism  and  its   reactionary

supporters,   is  to  invite  disaster.  The   obvious

objective  for  any socialist party,  whether  of  the

Communist  or non-Communist variety, is the solidarity

of  the nation through merger, and the achievement  of

freedom.  The  right thing was co-operation  with  all

patriotic  nationalist groups,  however  bourgeois  or

wavering social democrats they may be. But to  choose,

as  the Communists and their front organisations  did,

to fight against the national solidarity of the races,

against  merger,  and against freedom consequent  with

merger  was a fatal error. Worse still, to  choose  to

fight patriotic nationalists and to seek as allies  in

a   united   front,   opportunists, adventurers   and

reactionary   Right-wing  elements   was   to   invite

humiliation and inevitable disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Socialist realism demands the accurate appraisal of

persons  and  groups and to name them accurately.  All

their skilful tactics of abuse and vilification cannot

turn  a nationalist Party into a pro-colonialist,  and

having failed, to turn it into a neo-colonialist,  and

that  having failed, to make it into a Fascist  Party.

This is a practice of futile self-deception, trying to

mould   facts   into   their  preconceived   theories,

believing that the Government of the P.A.P. has become

effete  and decadent, turned pro-colonialist and  then

turned neo-colonialist and then fascist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calling for blank votes those Members of the

Opposition  called for votes against  merger,  against

the  national unity of our people, and against freedom

through merger. Had they had the courage to go through

with their line of complete merger, they might have at

least saved themselves this final humiliation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



and  they might at least have  been  defeated

doing  the honourable thing. But they were caught  by

their  own  dishonest propaganda lines. Publicly  they

called for complete merger. Privately they said merger

was  a  sell-out  of the Chinese in Singapore  to  the

Malays  in  the Federation. So the more  complete  the

merger, the more the sell-out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the "B" votes been more than the "A" votes, as

a result of the blank ballots that they called for, it

would have been the duty of this House to take note of

the  majority of "B" votes. However, over 71 per  cent

voted  "A". In these circumstances, under section  29

of   the  Referendum  Ordinance,  I - move  that   those

Opposition Members who did not support the - White Paper

and  called  for blank votes should now  be  asked  to

declare publicly whether they wish the blank votes  to

be  allocated to Alternative A or B or C. This is the

constitutional process. The unconditional rejoinder,

of  course, is to take direct action outside. That  is

a, matter for them to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly takes note of the Report of the Superintendent of the

Singapore National Referendum as contained in Paper Cmd.18 of 1962 and

in accordance with section 29 of the Singapore National Referendum Ordinance, 1962, that

the House decides-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that 2,370 uncertain ballot papers should be deemed to be votes for Alternatives A

as indicated in the ballot paper; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that 144,077 unmarked ballot papers should be decided in accordance with the

wishes of those Opposition Assemblymen who opposed the amended White Paper merger proposals

and calls upon them to decide to which of the Alternatives A, B and C the blank votes should be allocated.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I propose the Question, the

Member for Anson has, indicated that he wishes to rise

on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The point of order is a very simple

one, Sir. That the second part of this motion is ultra

vires,  and I will be very brief. What I refer  to  is

one which   is  curious  in  any  other  country   but

anticipated  from  the  corkscrew  P.A.P.,. that  the

144,077  unmarked ballot papers, should be decided  in

accordance   with,  the  wishes  of  those  Opposition

Assemblymen who opposed the amended White Paper merger

proposals and who are called upon to decide to  which

of  the Alternatives A, B and C the blank votes should

be allocated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I draw your attention to

the provisions of section 29:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person whose ballot paper-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is unmarked; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) is uncertain



<br><br>shall  be deemed to be a person who accepts or  is

willing  to accept the decision of the Legislative

Assembly   on   the   matter  referred   for   the

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it must be clear that the authority

given by this statute is to the Assembly - abide  by

"the  decision of the Assembly". I  say  that  the

second  part  is ultra vires in that it  does  not

seek  the decision of the Assembly, but seeks from

the  Opposition a decision by the request  of  the

Assembly.  I  am sure, Mr Speaker,  that  we  are

fortunate  here  that  you  yourself  are  legally

trained, that you appreciate the existence of  the

legal   maxim  known  as  "delegatus  non   potest

delegate."  The agent cannot delegate his  powers.

This  applies to the Assembly as well  as  to  any

other  both which has statutory authority.  I  say

that  this  Assembly cannot delegate the authority

given  by section 29 to take a decision itself  on

the  provisions of section 29 as to what is to  be

done  with  the blank votes. Above all, it  cannot

seek to pass it on to any group whether within  or

without   the  Assembly,  quite  apart  from   the

dishonesty and the absurdity of asking people, who

say they do not want section 29, to say, "Now, you

work  it,"  which I can see from the grin  on  the

face of the Minister for Education just suits  his

corkscrew temperament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I ask for a ruling that that part of the motion of the Prime Minister which calls

upon  the  Assembly to request the  Opposition  to

make a decision, is ultra vires the powers of this

Assembly,   is   illegal  and  contrary   to   the

provisions of section 29.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would the Prime Minister like to

assist the Chair?



<br><br>1.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, if I may, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I  had  anticipated  quite  wrongly,   Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   the   learned   treatises    and

dissertations  on  constitutional  procedures  and

processes.  All I heard is one tag of  dog  Latin - delegatus non potest delegare. Well, we are  doing

nothing of the sort. We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



not  saying delegatus delegare. What we are saying

is  that  we  in this Assembly have the  right  to

decide,  and we are deciding that we shall abstain

and allow the Opposition to decide. Whether it  is

constitutional  or  unconstitutional  to   abstain

depends upon the rules of this Assembly. There are

Assemblies  and  Legislative  Chambers  where  the

right  to  abstain does not exist; where when  you

are  present at the time a division is called, you

will  vote. If we had an Assembly of that  nature,

perhaps  the Member for Anson might be  on  firmer

ground.  But  I am sorry that he has  not  devoted

more  time and care before taking up this question

of  the propriety of the motion. I think he should

at  least  credit us with having investigated  the

constitutional  niceties of  the  point,  and  the

constitutional nicety in this case is simply this:

Is  it proper or improper for those who voted  for

the  White  Paper  to  abstain  from  deciding  on

unmarked and uncertain votes?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is not a question of

abstaining.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

the  Member  for Anson is a little bit  slow  this

morning.  If he will forgive me, I will  take  him

through the processes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Afternoon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Afternoon - sorry, I beg his

pardon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of daylight saving and all that, we

started in the morning - never mind. I would like to

take  the  Member  for Anson through  the  simple

mental  process - I mean he could  picture.  He  is

very   good   at  vivid  pictures - lurid,   sombre,

horrifying  colours in his pictures. But  this  is

quite  simple. According to section 29 (1) of  the

Ordinance - "the   decision   of   the   Legislative

Assembly    on    the    matter    referred    for

referendum" - the matter referred for the referendum

was  the  motion  that was moved  in  this  House.

Therefore, the blank votes have to be decided now,

in  accordance  with section 29. In  other  words,

this  whole  Assembly will vote.  I  will  give  a

simple  illustration. Had there been more B  votes

than A votes, then it would have been open-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We never had an honest

referendum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, he is very fortunate,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  having  us  campaign   so

vigorously for A. But supposing we had let  it  go

by default - and even C was considered attractive by

no  less than 7,000 people - then it would have been

quite  open for all of us, and indeed I  think  it

would  be  deemed our duty to follow  the  express

wish of the majority and vote for B. However, that

did  not take place and the decisive vote was  for

A.  In this particular case, it does not matter in

the end result whether the blank votes will go  to

A,  B or C. We therefore deem it our pleasure  and

privilege   that,  on  deciding  this   particular

question when the votes are counted and a division

is  called  for,  we  should vote  for  the  White

Paper - I  understand the Leader of the  House  has

settled  this  with Members of the Opposition  who

agreed un the White Paper - but we shall abstain and

give  the privilege of deciding on the blank votes

to  those  who  called for it.  There  is  nothing

unconstitutional.  There is propriety  within  the

four corners of the law. It is absolutely pristine

in  its purity as a constitutional nicety. I think

the Member for Anson's objection is spurious.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must thank the Member for Anson

for giving me some hint that he was going to raise

this  point.  I  have looked at  the  matter  very

carefully  and  it seems to me that  there  is  an

argument  as  to  what  is the  interpretation  of

section 29. The motion itself requests this  House

to  make  certain  decisions  in  accordance  with

section  29 and, therefore, it is not  for  me  to

decide  whether the resolutions sought in (1)  and

(2)  or  both would be in accordance with  section

29. In other words, it is not for me to decide  as

to  what  interpretation this Assembly chooses  to

put  on section 29. Some Members may consider that

they are being asked to make a resolution which is

ultra  vires the section. They are at  liberty  to

say  so and, for that reason, to vote against  the

resolution. Therefore I over-rule the objection of

the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the motion asks that the House decides that

the  uncertain  votes be deemed to  be  votes  for

Alternative A and that the unmarked ballot  papers

be   left   to  the  decision  of  the  opposition

Assemblymen  who  opposed the White  Paper  merger

proposals.   But  let  me  say   from   the   very

beginning - and   as  the  Member  for   Anson   has

partially pointed out   to  you  this motion is as

farcical  as the counting of the ballot papers  in

the   Badminton  Hall  and  the  whole  referendum

itself. I do not intend to go into details  as  to

what  happened during the counting of  the  ballot

papers  in  the Badminton Hall. But I might  just

say  a  few  words in passing, that  although  the

counting  was supposed to have been done  division

by division, we as counting agents had no means of

checking  whether the counting was, in fact,  done

division  by division. All we could see  was  that

the  boxes  were apparently haphazardly placed  on

the   steps  of  the  Badminton  Hall - I  am   sure

according to a certain pre-arranged plan - and then,

apparently haphazardly again, dumped all over the

tables. There were 51 tables in the Badminton Hall

used  for  the counting of ballot papers,  with  a

couple of extra tables that were not used. All the

boxes, according to the information given to us by

the  Superintendent  of the  National  Referendum,

were placed as they came in. But we could see that

all of them had tags on them that had code numbers

which were known only to the Government. And  when

these boxes were taken for counting to the tables,

they were taken not to the tables nearest to where

the boxes were originally placed, but in some pre-arranged  pattern - some here and  some  there - known

only  to the Government. We tried our best to find

out which boxes came from which division and which

boxes  went  to which table, but I regret  to  say

that  we were not able to find out. We managed  to

find   out  to  a  certain  extent  about  certain

divisions-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - but we were not able to find

out all. Therefore, there was no actual indication

given  to  us counting agents as to which division

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



counted and when or where. Even the pouring out of

the  ballot  papers was done in a  very  irregular

manner.  If you remember, Sir, according  to  law,

all the ballot boxes are supposed to be assembled,

inspected,  emptied of contents at the  same  time

and  the  ballot  papers  mixed  together,  before

counting.  But this was never done.  Some  of  the

ballot papers were poured out from boxes on to the

table and while counting was done halfway, further

boxes  were  added and emptied. In addition,  with

all these boxes placed so close to one another, we

counting  agents had no opportunity whatsoever  of

finding out whether or not there was a mistake  or

a mixing up of the boxes. There was no possibility

whatsoever  of finding out as far as the  counting

agents were concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was more reprehensible was that when

counting was done and when instructions were given

to  the  counting clerks by the person who sat  at

the  head  of  the table I suppose  the  Presiding

Officers - they  were  all done surreptitiously  and

secretively;  all in whispers. Nobody  could  hear

anything. Only the person who went round - I suppose

the group leader - handing out instructions from the

Superintendent  to the Presiding Officers  telling

them what and how to do things. Mind you, although

in  normal practice nobody is supposed to have any

pencil  or  pen on the person, yet these Presiding

Officers,  as  far  as we could see,  were  making

surreptitious  marks  on secret  pieces  of  paper

which  they  handed over to the group  leader  who

went  round, I suppose, on the orders of the Prime

Minister-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not quite certain

whether  the  Member for Queenstown  is  alleging

that  there  were illegalities in the counting  of

these  votes.  If he is alleging that  there  were

illegalities, then, of course, his  remedy  is  by

way  of a referendum petition. I do not think  the

time  of this House should be taken up with  those

matters.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I am only trying to tell

you what actually happened. I have no intention of

going  into details on the matter since  the  time

allotted to us is for a debate on the motion.  But

these are a few things - I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



want  to  go any further - which the general  public

of Singapore should know something about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 29 of the Referendum Ordinance lays

down  that  the  persons whose ballot  papers  are

uncertain or unmarked are deemed to be persons who

accept  or  are willing to accept the decision  of

the  Legislative  Assembly on the matter  referred

for  the referendum. I say, Sir, that the decision

of the Legislative Assembly on the matter referred

for  the referendum - that is, as has been so  often

referred  to  by the Prime Minister  and  all  the

P.A.P.  Ministers,  on  the  mode  and  manner  of

merger - is the White Paper, Cmd. Paper 33 of  1961.

The Legislative Assembly decision in November 1961,

was  33  for  the White Paper with 17  Assemblymen

walking  out. The P.A.P. never forgot  to  mention

this  over  their propaganda network,  the  P.A.P.

Radio  and Rediffusion, and all the time they  had

tried  to boost support for the White Paper merger

proposals  in  this  manner  by  saying  that   33

supported-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And none against.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, and none against. Over

the radio, Rediffusion and in speeches, the P.A.P.

kept  hammering this point home, that their merger

proposals had the support of the majority  in  the

Assembly,  and  that  because  of  this   majority

support in the Legislative Assembly, they had  the

legal  and  constitutional right to  push  through

their    merger   proposals.   Therefore,    their

propaganda says that this referendum was something

which  the Government was now giving as a  special

privilege and favour to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I remind the House that all through the

debate  on  the  Referendum Bill, both  in  Select

Committee  and  in  the  Legislative  Assembly  on

recommittal, the P.A.P. had taken the  stand  that

the  blank votes should become votes for the White

Paper  of  the Government, that is for Alternative

A,  as  put  forward  in the referendum?  All  the

P.A.P. arguments were based on this line and  they

rejected  all  our arguments and contentions  that

the  blank votes meant non-support of any  of  the

questions posed in the referendum. They still  did

this not so very long ago,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



only   in   July,  when  the  questions  for   the

referendum  were  debated. They  still  maintained

that  stand  then.  But now the  P.A.P. say  that

uncertain and unmarked votes are votes not for the

P.A.P. but for the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, we realise that the letter of the

law  says  "the  decision of  the  Assembly".  But

everybody   knows  that  the  "decision   of   the

Assembly" on any important matter is the  decision

of   the  Government.  And  the  decision  of  the

Government is the decision of the P.A.P.  So  what

are  they grumbling about? Why are they trying  to

tell  the  people  all this nonsense  about  blank

votes  meaning B? Why did they want to start  this

scare propaganda?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

What are you grumbling about?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In the debate on clause 29 of

the  Referendum Bill, we had all along  maintained

that  blank  and  uncertain  votes  did  not  mean

support for any of the alternatives to be posed to

the  people  in the referendum. As I have  already

indicated, the P.A.P. kept on insisting that those

who  cast  blank  and  uncertain  votes  meant  an

indecision in their minds on the matter, and  that

therefore  they  would  be  ready  to  accept  the

decision of the Assembly on the matter. The P.A.P.

brought  in their so-called trump card  of  common

Malaysian citizenship just before the announcement

of  the date of the referendum. But even this  did

not  improve matters very much for them. Not until

the  P.A.P. initiated their final move, the  scare

propaganda which as many have confirmed turned out

to  be  the  genuine trump card of the P.A.P.  The

P.A.P. trump  card was not the  so-called  common

Malaysian  citizenship. The  trump  card  was  the

scare  propaganda initiated by the Prime  Minister

and his cronies all over Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of order. Is

it  in  order  for  the hon. Member  to  refer  to

Members of this Assembly as cronies? I think there

is a derogatory connotation to the word "crony".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have no idea whether or not the

Member  for  Queenstown intended to include  other

Members of this Assembly under the term "cronies".

He might have excluded Members of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, there are so many cronies

in  the  P.A.P. that I am sure the  Minister  for

Finance realises that he himself must be one.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In that case, since objection

has  been  taken to the word "cronies", that  word

must  be  withdrawn  if it has  any  reference  to

Members of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no intention of

applying that word to any Member of this Assembly,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, the scare propaganda initiated

by  the  P.A.P. spread with  the  rapidity  of  a

prairie fire. In no time, the talk of the town was

(1)  that  if you cast blank votes, you will  lose

your citizenship; (2) that if you cast blank votes

you  will be found out, because there is a  number

on  the  back of the ballot paper and  the  P.A.P.

will  then  deal with you; (3) that  if  you  cast

blank  votes  and if, as mentioned  by  the  Prime

Minister,  there should be more  B  votes  than  A

votes,  then the blank votes might become B votes,

and  therefore  that  would  entail  the  loss  of

citizenship for half the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these rumours were started by the P.A.P.

and,  as  I  have  already indicated,  were  given

official  impetus  by the Prime  Minister  in  his

speech  in  Fullerton  Square  on  Thursday,  23rd

August,  1962.  This speech of the Prime  Minister

which  said that blank votes might be turned  into

votes for B was, of course, specially aimed at the

340,000  non-local  born Singapore  citizens.  The

speech  was  viewed  with such importance  by  the

P.A.P. that  they  had Radio  P.A.P. record  the

speech  and  had  it broadcast and rebroadcast.  I

think  the  speech of the Prime Minister  on  that

particular  occasion was broadcast four  times.  I

cannot remember the exact number, but I definitely

know  that it was broadcast twice and there was  a

last  time which makes it definitely three  times.

It might have been more, I do not know; unless



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



you  keep listening in, you will not know. So  day

in  and  day  out, they harped on  this  so-called

danger   of  casting  blank  votes.  This  blatant

falsehood was drummed into the ears and  minds  of

the  people  through Radio P.A.P. and Rediffusion.

Not  only that, Sir, In addition, they had  cinema

slides  which told of the danger of casting  blank

votes  and  that if you did cast blank  votes  you

would  lose all your rights. They also had special

police  jeeps  going around from  place  to  place

telling the people of the danger of casting  blank

votes,   namely,  that  they  might   lose   their

citizenship, and that they must cast  their  votes

for   A.   I  had  occasion  to  protest  to   the

Commissioner of Police, and he said,  "That  is  a

surprising  thing." I quoted the time,  place  and

the occasion, and he said, "I have no evidence." I

do  not  know  what sort of police  work  they  do

nowadays. Police jeeps are not used to look  after

the welfare of the people but instead to boost the

P.A.P. propaganda machine!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not think I want to read

lengthy  details to you, Sir, although I have  the

newspapers  here.  I will just  read  to  you  the

headlines that they splashed in the newspapers. On

the  25th of August: "LEE: 400,000 Citizens  would

be affected - Danger of blank votes". Of course,  I

do  not need to read further on. Then "Lee" again - all  the  time  you  see Lee Kuan  Yew's  pictures

everywhere.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I thought "Lee" meant "Lee Siew

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Then "Blank can be turned into

B - Loss  of  Citizenship". And again in  headlines:

"Blank votes warning by Lee Kuan Yew". These  were

only  meant  for  the English-speaking.  But  more

important, Sir, were those headlines meant for the

Chinese-speaking. They were worse. The evil genius

of  the  P.A.P. had grasped the most vital  point,

the  weakest  point, the Achilles  heel  of  those

Chinese  who  were non-locally born.  The  Chinese

Press had a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



special  section  given to  the  Prime  Minister's

speech about the danger of blank votes. Prominence

all  over  the place. I think this can be referred

to   as   the  pride  of  the  P.A.P.  Then  again

headlines:  "If  you cast blank  votes,  you  lose

citizenship."  Worse headlines, Sir.  Sir,  I  got

them  from  the Nanyang Siang Pau of 26th  August,

page 5. And then again in the Nanyang Siang Pau of

28th  August,  page  5, again about  the  loss  of

citizenship. And on the 29th at page 14, this time

it  says  Lee  Khoon Choy telling  the  people  of

Singapore:  "Unless you vote for A you  will  lose

your  citizenship rights." All in headlines,  Sir.

And then on 31st August, the Prime Minister in his

analysis said, "If you cast blank votes, you  will

lose  your  citizenship rights." All this  in  big

headlines, Sir, and all done with special emphasis

and  directed  towards only  one  section  of  the

population  of  Singapore, namely,  the  non-local

born Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty,

anxiety and suspense was created deliberately over

the whole of Singapore by these blatant falsehoods

which came from the evil propaganda machine of the

P.A.P.  And  the P.A.P. kept up the atmosphere  of

fear   and   uncertainty  by  making  no   mention

whatsoever  of  the secrecy of the vote  in  their

radio broadcasts. You see, Sir, the people were so

scared  about the number on the back of the ballot

paper.  They  were all afraid that  if  they  were

found  out, they would lose their jobs, they would

lose  facilities for their school  children,  they

would lose welfare aid, they would lose facilities

for  application for Housing Board flats - all sorts

of  things. This rumour started by the P.A.P. went

round all over Singapore. As I said, this fear was

heightened  by  the fact that the P.A.P. made  no

mention  of the fact that the vote was  secret  in

their radio broadcasts.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Why

did you not mention it at the forum?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On election day, it is

customary  for the Superintendent of Elections  to

say  that the vote is compulsory; but what is more

important, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



also  says  that the vote is secret. But  on  this

occasion,  Sir  (I have not got the actual  words,

but  it can be confirmed, and they can deny it  if

they  like),  the  Superintendent made  broadcasts

saying that voting was compulsory, but not a  word

was  said by him about the secrecy of the  vote - in

other  words, adding to this fear that was already

in the hearts of a lot of people. Even today. Sir,

a  lot  of  people  are  still  asking,  "Was  the

referendum voting really secret?" I wish the Prime

Minister - if  he  is  not here, let  somebody  tell

him - would  reassure the people,  especially  those

who  cast blank votes, because a lot of people are

still worried that their jobs might be taken  away

from  them,  that their flats might be taken  away

from  them, that social welfare aid might be taken

away  from them, and that their citizenship  might

be taken away from them. Let the Prime Minister in

his reply give an assurance on this point, and let

it  be  categorical, in order to remove  the  fear

which  was instilled into the hearts of the people

by  the  P.A.P. themselves. All those  threatening

and  intimidatory speeches of the  Prime  Minister

and of the Minister for Culture were broadcast and

rebroadcast - all telling the people of the  danger

of  blank votes. Of course, the Prime Minister now

says  that he never said that the blank votes were

votes for the Government. He said that - I saw it in

the  papers  the other day - and according  to  his

interpretation, the Legislative Assembly had to be

reconvened  to decide what the blank votes  should

stand  for. And he has even passed the buck on  to

the Opposition Assemblymen. I would say this. Sir.

It might have been that the Prime Minister did not

say that the blank votes were Government votes.  I

have  not  the time to look through all the  files

and speeches made by the Prime Minister or what he

said on the Second Reading or the Third Reading of

the  Bill. Anyway, the Prime Minister did not take

much  part  in the debate on the Referendum  Bill,

and he could not be expected to know very much  of

what  was  said  in the debate on  the  Referendum

Bill. He never took part in the detailed clause by

clause debate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



on  the  Referendum Bill, both in Select Committee

and in the Legislative Assembly on recommittal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance was the P.A.P.'s chief spokesman. This is what he said in the Select Committee on the 15th of May, 1962. May I refer you, Sir, to the Official Report No. 5 of the

Select  Committee on the National Referendum  Bill

of  15th May, 1962? Column 308, at the bottom. The

Minister for Finance said that all those who  cast

blank  votes are those who [fourth line  from  the

bottom, Sir]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...are prepared to accept the decision which

their elected representatives in the Assembly  had

already made on the main merger issue.'



<br><br>May  I  draw  your  attention to  the  words  "had

already  made"?  What was the  decision  that  the

Assembly  had  already made  on  the  main  merger

issue?  It  is the White Paper passed in  November

1961 - Command Paper 33 - and exactly as  put  to  the

people  now  as  question A in the referendum.  So

what  is  all  this nonsense about a new  decision

having   to  be  made  again  by  the  Legislative

Assembly? Is that not proof enough that the P.A.P.

have  already said that the blank votes are P.A.P.

votes?  Then, Sir, in the petition from the  Prime

Minister  to the United Nations, in reply  to  the

petition  from  the 19 Opposition Assemblymen  and

from  the  Council  of  Joint  Action,  the  Prime

Minister  did  not  deny the facts  as  stated  in

paragraph  14 of our petition. This  is  from  the

petition from Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister  of

Singapore, concerning Singapore, dated 26th  July,

1962, from the United Nations. It is only  a  few

lines.  Paragraph  14, from the memorandum  by  19

Singapore  Opposition Legislative Assemblymen.  It

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The voters of Singapore will be required to put

a   mark  against  one  of  the  two  alternatives

offered, and in the referendum law which has  been

passed, if a blank vote is cast or if the vote  is

ambiguous  by having both alternatives struck  out

or  both alternatives marked, then all such  votes

will  be  deemed to be votes in support of Command

Paper  33  of  1961  and such votes  will  not  be

declared separately but will be added to the votes

in  favour  of  Command  Paper  33  of  1961  when

declared.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a statement from the petition of

the  19 Assemblymen to the United Nations, and  in

the  reply of the Prime Minister, there is  not  a

single  denial of the fact which is  stated  here.

Not  a  single denial!  In other words, they  have

accepted that this is a position of fact. So  what

is  all this about a decision to be made again  by

the  Assembly? The only answer the Prime  Minister

gave was a weak defence of why the P.A.P. resorted

to  the notorious and obnoxious section 29. Again,

Sir,   in  the  United  Nations,  when  the  Prime

Minister  obviously did not feel competent  enough

to speak on the Referendum Ordinance, the Minister

for  Finance  said this. May I quote the  verbatim

report  of the 87th meeting in the United Nations?

It is on page 67. The heading is listed "Dr Goh".

Dr  Goh  said this - he was referring to the  blank

votes. It is just a few lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In these circumstances, the Government of

Singapore make no apology for the provision in the

Referendum  Ordinance  whereby  blank  votes   are

considered  to indicate a state of uncertainty  on

the part of the electorate, and therefore, in such

circumstances,  the  vote must  be  considered  as

acceptance of what the elected representatives  in

the Assembly have decided on the issue of merger.'



<br><br>May I draw your attention again, Sir, to the words

"have decided on the issue of merger." ". . . what

the  elected representatives in the Assembly  have

decided . . ." The only issue that the Legislative

Assemblymen  have decided on is the  White  Paper,

Command  Paper  33  of 1961. All  these  are  very

solemn  words,  made  on solemn  occasions,  words

carefully  weighed according to the  Minister  for

Finance himself, uttered with proper co-ordination

between the brain and the tongue, according to the

Minister  for Health. Has all this been forgotten?

This  is  clear  proof, Sir, that they  themselves

have admitted that the decision of the Assembly on

the  matter  referred for the  referendum  is  the

White  Paper - now,  of  course,  amended  with  the

addition of their so-called Malaysian citizenship.

So  what  is  all  this  farce  about  asking  the

Assembly  for a decision on the blank votes,  when

the  decision  has  already been  made?  Sir,  the

reason,  of  course, is not far  to  seek.  It  is

simply this. The Prime Minister has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



brought  forward  this  motion  with  two  obvious

reasons.  One is to cover the falsehood which  the

Prime  Minister  himself has uttered,  that  blank

votes  might  mean support for Alternative  B.  Of

course, now they say, bring it to the Assembly and

let  the  Assembly decide. Second, what I  suppose

would  be more important to the propaganda machine

of  the  P.A.P., is that the P.A.P. want to create

the  illusion that the decision of the Legislative

Assembly   may   not  be  the  decision   of   the

Government, and therefore, of the P.A.P.,  because

now they say, "We abstain. You decide." Therefore,

under  those  circumstances, on important  matters

the  decision of the Assembly may not  necessarily

be  the  decision of the governing Party. That  is

the  impression and the illusion which the  P.A.P.

have to create in the minds of the people. If that

impression  and illusion should be  created,  then

the Prime Minister can go back and say, "There you

are.  I  have  spoken the truth. I have  told  you

exactly what was the true position." But in actual

fact,   the   Prime  Minister  has  been   telling

falsehoods  right from the word go - all  the  time.

They  have  given  out  this  falsehood  with  the

deliberate  intention to frighten  and  intimidate

people into supporting A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, just as the referendum is merely

to  provide a facade of democracy and a facade for

so-called  consultation  with  the  people,   this

motion  is  a cover for the falsehoods  that  were

uttered  by the P.A.P., and the Prime Minister  in

particular,   during   this   present   referendum

campaign. If the P.A.P. had any real intention  of

letting  the  blank  votes to be  decided  by  the

Opposition Assemblymen, the P.A.P. should have  so

stated  from the very beginning. They should  have

said  so  in the beginning that if you cast  blank

votes,  the  blank votes would be decided  by  the

Opposition Assemblymen. Why did they not  say  so?

Again,  Sir,  if  there was  such  intention,  the

P.A.P. need not have debated so hotly against  us

and  contested every amendment we made  concerning

section  29. If you will remember, Sir, we debated

very hotly clause 29, both in the Select Committee

and  on  recommittal in the Assembly. And when  we

moved that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



the   whole  clause  29  be  deleted,  the  P.A.P.

rejected our amendment. Thus clause 29 was  all  a

P.A.P. show.  Again if they had  really  intended

that  the  blank votes be left to the decision  of

the  Opposition Assemblymen, then the P.A.P. need

not have been so secretive and so surreptitious in

the  way they counted those blank votes. There was

no  decision to count those blank votes separately

until,  I think, round about 4.00 a.m. Of  course,

the  P.A.P. chaps had earlier been  going  around

recording  the  number of votes  for  the  various

categories  and  going back  to  tell  the  P.A.P.

bosses.  But there was no indication  of  how  the

counting  was  to  be  done until  the  very  last

minute.   And  the  Prime  Minister  himself   was

directing  operations at every stage of the  show.

The  Superintendent was merely his  page  boy.  He

handed  my letter over to the Prime Minister.  The

Superintendent never made the decisions. The Prime

Minister  made  the decisions and  directed  every

stage of the operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since this motion now centres on section

29,  it  is  necessary for me  to  mention  a  few

relevant  facts in order to place this  motion  in

its   proper   perspective.  As  I  have   already

indicated,  Sir, in the first place,  it  was  the

P.A.P. who put in clause 29 - now section 29. It was

the  P.A.P. that railroaded, pushed through  this

section  29  to make it law, in spite of  all  the

protests  from not only Assemblymen here but  also

civic   organisations,  professional  bodies   and

everybody in Singapore. Everybody knows that it is

the  P.A.P. that  is completely  responsible  for

section  29. We have repeatedly stated  that  this

sham referendum held under such a sham, ridiculous

and  undemocratic way would not reflect  the  true

will and desire of the people of Singapore. It  is

because  of  this, Sir, that we also  brought  the

matter  up  to  the  Committee  of  Seventeen   on

Colonialism  in the United Nations.  All  we  have

asked  for  is a fair, honest and just referendum.

But  what  we  have just witnessed  was  something

which  had already been rigged to give a sure  win

to  the  P.A.P. heads the P.A.P. win,  tails  the

people lose. A sure win referendum for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P.  If it had been an honest  referendum,

with  the people having the right of dissent, with

the  people having the right to say "no", and with

absolutely  no fear whatsoever that the dissenting

votes  would  be  construed to  mean  support  for

Alternative A or Alternative B as put  up  by  the

P.A.P.,  we  would  have  willingly  accepted  the

result  as  truly  reflecting the  free  will  and

desire  of  the people. But such is not the  case.

Even if the result had shown a majority of only 51

per  cent, we would still have accepted it and  we

would  have done our best to help work it, however

we  may feel against the whole result. But when we

know   only  too  well  that  the  referendum   is

dishonest  right  to the core,  to  recognise  the

result  of  such a dishonest referendum  would  be

tantamount  to condoning dishonesty and,  what  is

worse, to encouraging a future repetition of  such

dishonesty. Sir, we fully recognise and accept the

fact  that amongst those who voted for Alternative

A in the referendum, there were many who did so in

the sincere belief that Alternative A was to their

interests. To these people, we say that we respect

their  belief and their choice, and  if  they  had

comprised  the  majority in an  honest  referendum

carried  out  without section 29 intimidating  the

people,  we  would have willingly  abided  by  the

decision.  But it must be admitted  that  in  this

sham  referendum there were those  who  voted  for

Alternative   A,   not  because   they   supported

Alternative A, but because they feared Alternative

B   and   because  they  feared  their   loss   of

citizenship,  loss of their means  of  livelihood,

loss  of  welfare  aid and housing  accommodation.

This  fear  of  Alternative B, together  with  the

other  fear of loss of citizenship with consequent

loss  of livelihood, was entirely due to the scare

propaganda initiated by the P.A.P. helped  by  the

existence   of   section  29  in  the   Referendum

Ordinance.  Section 29, though originally  created

by  the  P.A.P. as an ultimate weapon  to  ensure

definite  victory  for  the  White  Paper   merger

proposals, should the White Paper merger proposals

fail to get popular support, has now turned out to

be  even more useful to the P.A.P. as a weapon  in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



referendum  campaign  to  coerce  non-local   born

citizens into supporting Alternative A because  of

their fear of Alternative B winning, according  to

the words of the Prime Minister, "by default".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to add a few words more, Sir,

about  the  rumours  which the  P.A.P. have  been

spreading around and it is this - the Prime Minister

himself   can  check.  To  frighten  people   into

supporting "A", the Prime Minister said that there

were  a lot of Malays in Singapore who were  going

to vote for Alternative B. This put more fear into

the  hearts of those non-local born Chinese.  They

could  not possibly allow such a thing to  happen.

Sir,  it  is very important that we remember  this

fear  of loss of citizenship. The Chinese in  this

country, those who were not born here, have fought

many  years for this right, and any fear that such

citizenship rights might be taken away from  them,

will  make them fight and do anything possible  to

retain that citizenship. I here condemn the  Prime

Minister  for initiating such a communal  argument

in   the   propaganda  campaign  for  support   of

Alternative A. This is a most dangerous line.  The

P.A.P. had  all  along been  trying  to  frighten

certain  sections  of  the people  with  arguments

which  are  completely communal. I hope  that  the

P.A.P. will realise that such arguments  are  not

conducive  to  the  welfare  of  the  people  and,

therefore, they should immediately take  steps  to

refrain   from   further  use  of  such   communal

arguments in their propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is still another fear which I might

add, and it is this; a lot of people in Singapore,

although unwilling to support Alternative  A,  but

because of the fact that there are numbers on  the

back  of the ballot papers, nevertheless fear that

if  they  should cast votes for Alternative  B  or

Alternative  C or blank, i.e. against  Alternative

A,  then  they might be found out; and  they  know

that  whether they cast blank votes or  votes  for

Alternative A, all these votes would still  become

Government votes and the P.A.P. would still be the

Government.  Everybody fears the P.A.P. nowadays.

Everybody knows how ruthless the P.A.P. can be. We

feel that is why some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



people  have put discretion as the better part  of

valour.  They  say, "Well, let it be  this  time,"

just  to  avoid  possible retaliatory  action  and

possible  vengeance  that  can  be  initiated   by

ruthless P.A.P. Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that the P.A.P. have made full use of

section  29  to achieve their aims, they  want  to

appear  as innocent angels and hope to wash  their

hands  of  something of their  own  creation.  The

motion  now  asks  the Opposition  Assemblymen  to

decide  on the fate of the unmarked ballot papers.

We   in   the  Barisan  Sosialis  have  all  along

maintained  that all those who cast  uncertain  or

blank  ballot papers are those who do not  support

any one of the alternatives posed to the people in

the  referendum. In fact, all those who have  cast

blank votes have cast them in protest-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Anti-merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- against the undemocratic

P.A.P.,  against the dishonest referendum  and  as

non-recognition and total rejection of the  result

of the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deference to, and in accordance with, the

wishes  of all those who cast blank votes  in  the

recent referendum, I accordingly move an amendment

to the motion moved by the Prime Minister. I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 6, to leave out from "decides" to the end

and add:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that the unmarked ballot papers be recognised as

protest  votes and all the unmarked and  uncertain

ballot papers be not counted as supporting any  of

the Alternatives A. B or C".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have the amendment in writing

please?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order. Please

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Government has asked

that the Opposition Assemblymen decide. I have

moved an amendment and we have decided. If the

Government really mean what they say, let them

accept my amendment and let us proceed, otherwise

the mask-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Masses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -will be removed and they

will again be exposed as they have all along

been exposed. [Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jackals laughing! Let them make sure that

the  wishes  of the Opposition be  respected  as

stated in the motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly takes note of the Report of

the  Superintendent  of the  Singapore  National

Referendum as contained in Paper Cmd. 18 of 1962

and   in  accordance  with  section  29  of  the

Singapore  National Referendum Ordinance,  1962,

that the House decides-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that 2,370 uncertain ballot papers should

be  deemed  to  be votes for Alternative  A  as

indicated in the ballot paper; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that 144,077 unmarked ballot papers should

be  decided  in accordance with the  wishes  of

those  Opposition Assemblymen who  opposed  the

amended White Paper merger proposals and  calls

upon   them   to   decide  to  which   of   the

Alternatives A. B and C the blank votes  should

be  allocated."



<br><br>Since which an  amendment  has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 6, to leave out from "decides" to the

end and add:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that the unmarked ballot papers be recognised

as  protest  votes  and  all  the  unmarked  and

uncertain  ballot  papers  be  not  counted   as

supporting any of the Alternatives A, B or C".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is. "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might draw the attention of hon. Members to

Standing Order 39, paragraph (4), which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the Speaker or Chairman, before putting a

question   to  leave  out  certain  words,   is

informed  that  a  Member  wishes  to  move  an

amendment to leave out part only of those words

and  if  he  is  of opinion that  the  proposed

amendment  of  which  he  is  so  informed   is

substantially  a new amendment,  he  shall,  if

possible, put the question to leave out only so

much of the original amendment as is unaffected

by  the  second amendment; but if that question

is  agreed to, the whole of the words  proposed

in  the original amendment to be left out shall

be deemed to have been ordered to be left out.'



<br><br>Paragraph (5) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When two or more amendments are proposed to be

moved  to  the  same  motion,  the  Speaker  or

Chairman  shall  call upon the  movers  in  the

order  in which their amendments relate to  the

text  of  the motion, or in cases of  doubt  in

such  order as the Chair shall decide; provided

that no amendment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



may  be moved which relates to any words  which

the Assembly or Committee has decided shall not

be left out of the motion.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position now, of course, is the Question

before  the Assembly which is, "That  the  words

proposed to be left out, be left out,"  that  is

to  say,  all the words contained in  paragraphs

(1)  and  (2)  of  the motion. If  the  Assembly

decides  against that amendment, then all  those

words  remain, and there is no opportunity  then

of amending them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if a Member wishes to leave out only a

certain  part  of those words,  then  he  should

inform me, so that those parts can be saved  for

another amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today the

P.A.P. have the opportunity to act decently,  to

be clean and to wash itself of some of the filth

it  has  perpetrated in the past few months.  We

have  learnt that if you put a pig in  a  marble

palace,  he will be uncomfortable until  he  can

wallow in the dirt he creates. Instead of taking

advantage of the miraculous changes, the  P.A.P.

have  brought in yet another disgraceful motion,

so typical of their tortuous mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recognise, Mr Speaker, Sir, that as a

result of the conference in London not more than

a   month  ago,  we  now  have  genuine   merger

proposals with automatic citizenship - that spring

chicken  which the Prime Minister said  was  not

available on the menu, and which the P.A.P. pooh-poohed and derided when it was asked for by  the

Opposition.  Even though the proposals  as  they

now  stand are not completely fair to Singapore,

nevertheless,  Mr Speaker, they  do  constitute

genuine merger and a workable proposition.  This

was  a  miracle  in  itself. You  remember,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, how hard we fought for  automatic

citizenship  and for how long, and how  we  were

sneered at by the Front Bench and called  "anti-national",   "pro-Communist"  and  "anti-merger"

because we asked for automatic citizenship which

they said they would not even negotiate with the

Federation   since   it  was   impossible!   The

Opposition   asked  for  the   impossible!   The

Opposition  was anti-national because  we  asked

for automatic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



citizenship! The Opposition was pro-Communist because

we  asked  for automatic citizenship! The  Opposition

was  anti-merger  and was asking for  the  impossible

because  we asked for automatic citizenship!  Now  we

have automatic citizenship. And, Sir, we have genuine

merger surely  a miracle which should  be  recognised

and  respected  to the extent that the P.A.P. should

take advantage of it to produce a clean motion before

this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only was there one miracle, Mr Speaker, but we

had a second miracle, the miracle that the people  of

Singapore  swallowed the filthy, immoral  referendum,

and the majority of them despite their recognition of

its  disgraceful  character, despite  their  disgust,

nevertheless  voted  in  favour  of  Alternative   A.

397,626  citizens  cast  their  votes  in  favour  of

Alternative  A out of a total electorate of  624,000.

Even  assuming  every one of the 624,000  voters  was

alive on Referendum Day, and even assuming that  they

were  all in Singapore, which is absurd, nevertheless

that  makes a total in favour of Alternative A  of  a

clear 64 per cent of the entire electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded in this context, Mr Speaker, to draw

attention  to another aspect in view of the amendment

moved by the Member for Queenstown on the recommittal

of  the Bill to this House on 5th July, which appears

at  page 41 of the unrevised transcript [Vol. 18, No.

7, col. 851]. He moved a new clause:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The result of the referendum shall not be valid

unless  a proposition is supported in the affirmative

by  not  less  than fifty-one per cent of  the  total

votes cast.'



<br><br>Not  "of the total electorate". Mr Speaker, but  "of

the  total votes cast". Now if you take the total  of

the votes cast, that is 561,559, there is, in fact, a

clear majority of 71 per cent in favour; 20 per  cent

more than the Member for Queenstown asked for on  the

5th of July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two miracles have made it unnecessary for the

perpetuation   of  the  dishonesty  for   which   the

foundation  was  laid  by  this  Government  in   the

Referendum Ordinance. Why do we pursue those tactics,

Mr Speaker? Why can we not go cleanly and peacefully

into this merger? Why must we follow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



this   tortuous  P.A.P. path?  We  know   that   the

Government  expected that the majority of the  people

would vote against the merger proposals, and that  is

why  we  have this farcical Referendum Ordinance  and

the  farcical  referendum whereby only Alternative  A

had  any  meaning.  Alternative B,  according  to  an

opinion,  Mr  Speaker, which I  would  be  happy  to

table, obtained from Mr Dingle Foot, Queen's Counsel

and  Member  of Parliament, a constitutional  lawyer,

was meaningless as regards citizenship. Alternative C

was  admitted  by the Prime Minister  himself  to  be

ambiguous.  Let me read it to you. I  read  from  the

transcript  of  the  United Nations  meeting  of  the

Special Committee of 17 Nations on Colonialism in New

York  on  26th  July, 1962, at 3.00  p.m.  The  Prime

Minister of Singapore was speaking then:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I admit that the third Alternative - "on terms no

less  favourable  than Borneo" - is vague  because  the

Borneo  terms,  although  part  of  them  have   been

discussed publicly, have not been crystallized in the

White Paper in proper form, as has Alternative A, hut

they  will be. I would have thought that my political

opponents would at least have given me the credit  of

possessing some generosity [I am glad he did not  say

integrity]  and  some good sense in not  putting  the

referendum  questions until Alternative  C  has  been

published and clarified.'



<br><br>Have we had a White Paper, Mr Speaker? No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then finally, Sir, this provision in the Ordinance,

that  blank votes are to be added to the total  votes

for  A without being separately declared. I think  it

is  important  to recognise this dishonesty  and  the

lack   of  their  utilisation  at  present.  I   draw

attention  to  page  32 of the  proceedings  of  this

Assembly  on  4th July, 1962, [Vol. 18, No.  6,  col.

712] in which I moved an amendment to clause 29:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`So that the sub-clause will now read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number of such ballot papers shall be counted

and    shall   be   separately   included   by    the

Superintendent in his declaration of  the  result  of

the referendum."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I then urged that we should publish the number of blank ballot papers separately so that

the people should know what the voting was like. This

was strongly resisted and the Government, assisted by

the Front



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



Bench  of the Opposition, negatived it by 24 votes

to 17 Opposition votes. They refused to permit the

separate publication of the number of blank votes.

Let  us remember that. And it was made clear  that

these  would not be published unless the votes  in

favour  of  Alternative A well exceeded the  blank

votes, which has happened fortunately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of the voting of the people,

all  this dishonesty is now unnecessary. The  vote

is  clear. The acceptance of the merger proposals,

as amended, is unequivocal by 71 per cent majority

of  the  votes cast, 64 per cent majority  of  the

total  number  of citizens on the electoral  roll.

The  Barisan  Sosialis,  through  the  Member  for

Queenstown, suggest - and suggest, Sir, not without

reason - that  there has been dishonest  conduct  on

the  part  of  the  Prime Minister  and  dishonest

intimidation  by the Prime Minister through  false

statements - I make this knowingly. Sir,  and  I  am

prepared  to support it - to the Chamber of Commerce

and Radio Singapore-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

should  first hear what is being said. He was  not

here when certain allegations were being made. Mr

Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> - and it is plain that these false

statements   may  have  materially  affected   the

voting.  It is also claimed - although I  could  not

quite follow it - that there were various rumours of

an intimidatory character spread by the P.A.P. Mr

Speaker, I think the position in this Assembly  is

very  simple,  and it is this. I  am  particularly

delighted, in the context of the allegations  made

by  the Member for Queenstown, to remember that it

was I who was responsible for drawing attention to

the  lacuna  in  the Referendum Ordinance  of  any

provision  for the Referendum Judge. We  now  have

provisions  for the Referendum Judge. And  if,  in

fact,  the  Barisan  Sosialis are  satisfied  that

there  have  been  not  dishonest  statements  and

intimidation   which  I  accept - but   that   those

statements and intimidation have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



materially  affected the result of the  referendum

which,  frankly, Sir, I doubt, then I say that  it

is  their  duty  to put these matters  before  the

Referendum Judge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And until the decision of the

Referendum Judge nullifying the returns  is  made,

the returns must be accepted without question.  It

must be accepted, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unhappy to hear a "Hear, hear!" from the

Prime  Minister. I always wonder how  wrong  I  am

when he agrees with me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, let us go back to the

fundamental  issue that in a democracy  we  accept

the will of the majority. The will of the majority

has   been  indicated  in  a  clear  vote  in  the

referendum.  There  is  an  allegation  that  this

referendum   result   was   brought    about    by

intimidation.  As  you  yourself  have   indicated

earlier,  the proper place for that allegation  is

before  the  Referendum Court and  the  Referendum

Judge, and until the Referendum Judge accepts that

contention  and  nullifies  the  returns,  we   as

democrats should not say, as I was rather  unhappy

to  hear the Member for Queenstown say, "We do not

accept the returns because they were the result of

intimidation." We accept the returns as we  accept

the judgment of the Court of first instance, until

you have appealed it and only after the appeal has

been  upheld. Here I have not heard of any  appeal

to  the  Referendum Judge and I have not heard  of

any  suggestion  of  an appeal to  the  Referendum

Judge. In the circumstances, I would suggest to my

friend,  the  Member  for  Queenstown,  that   the

statement  he has made is wholly inappropriate  in

the  context  of  his  stand  in  support  of  the

democratic  principle of the majority  will  being

respected.  I recognise that that does  not  mean,

though we accept the majority will, that, in fact,

the  majority are necessarily happy with  some  of

the  injustices which the White Paper perpetrates,

albeit of an incidental character. I for one would

certainly  do  what I can within my competence  to

seek amelioration of those conditions, either  now

or after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



their   incorporation   in  the   Constitution   of

Malaysia,  in  order  to obtain  full  justice  and

equality for the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. today, I repeat, have the opportunity

to  act honestly yet to obtain what it seeks. There

was  no  need  to invoke the rubbish, the  dirt  of

section 29, it affects nothing at all. No one  will

look  at  it. Certainly least of all the Federation

Prime  Minister  who  is concerned.  I  think,  Mr

Speaker,  it  is  most unfair to suggest  that  the

144,000  votes which were blank were, in the  words

of  the  Prime Minister, "anti-merger".  The  Prime

Minister knows full well that my Party and  I  made

it  plain  after  the announcement of  the  changed

citizenship  proposals that we accepted  the  White

Paper as amended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Public statement! [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Are all these interjections

really  necessary? They seem to me  to  be  out  of

context. Mr David Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We made it plain in public

announcements, in the Press, over the radio, in  so

far  as  we  were  permitted  space  by  the  Prime

Minister. We made it equally plain that we  advised

the people to cast blank votes as a protest against

the  referendum provisions, not against  the  White

Paper.  That is why I am particularly happy to  see

that my friend, the Member for Queenstown, has  not

suggested  in his amendment that the 144,000  blank

votes should be deemed to reject proposals A, B  or

C,  but  that they should be deemed to be  cast  in

protest, as protest votes, because, Sir, I for  one

tell you frankly, I cast a blank vote not because I

am  against A. I support A fully. But because I was

against  that disgraceful referendum and I  refused

to participate in it more than the law compelled me

to. The law compelled me to go to the voting booth.

It  compelled  me  to take that ballot  paper.  But

nowhere in the law was I required to put a mark  on

it,  and I would not participate more than I could.

But  let us recognise, Mr Speaker, that had  there

been  an  honest  referendum, I am  satisfied  that

there would have been a greater number of votes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



cast  for A than in fact there were. It is  totally

unfair  to  speak  of the 144,000 votes  that  were

blank as being anti-merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I say that I am sincerely

sorry  if I had misunderstood the Member for  Anson

previously,   and   I  unreservedly   withdraw   my

contention  that  the  l44,000  blank  votes   were

against  merger. As I understand it, a  percentage,

which  is  claimed  by the Workers'  Party  of  the

144,000, did it only under protest against the mode

and  manner of the referendum, not against the mode

and  manner  of merger as such. I willingly  accept

the   explanation.  I  tender  my  most   heartfelt

apologies.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister has got away on a

point of order which is not a point of order. But I

am  sure the Member for Anson is agreeable to  that

elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Prime Minister would have had

his  opportunity to do things decently, but he will

not  and cannot. Nevertheless, I thank him for that

assurance. It is not a question of pride  with  us.

But  I  think  it  is  a question  of  legitimately

recognising   that   there  were   a   lot - I   know

personally, Sir, not merely myself, but I  know  of

others with whom I have spoken and from whom I have

heard-quite a number (I will not seek to assess the

number  even  in  percentage)  but  an  appreciable

number  did honestly cast blank votes because  they

were  against the manner of the referendum and  not

against the White Paper proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we come to the motion, the first

part  of  which  asks that 2,370  uncertain  ballot

papers should be deemed to be votes for Alternative

A  as  indicated in the ballot paper. Mr  Speaker,

they  have  397,000 and they go begging  for  2,300

votes  that in every civilised country in the world

are  recognised  as null and void, recognised  even

the original clause 28, if I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



might  remind  you,  of  the  Bill  published   in

September.  You will remember, Sir,  the  original

Bill  (No.  156) published last year. May  I  draw

your attention to clause 28? Clause 28, sub-clause (1) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Superintendent shall reject as invalid the

following  papers only, namely, any  ballot  paper

[look at (c) and (d) ] which is unmarked, which  is

void or uncertain.'



<br><br>They  recognised  it.  That  is  the  position  in

civilised  countries; in fact, in  all  countries,

civilised or uncivilised.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

probably going back to the debate we did  have  on

clauses  28 and 29. He should just mention  it  in

passing  and  should not now  debate  as  to  what

clause  29  should have been or clause  28  should

have been.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. That is

what  I  am  doing.  I am pointing  out  that  the

Government  did  recognise  that  that   was   the

procedure in every country in which there had been

any voting at all, whether for a referendum or for

an  election.  In fact, Sir, we  have  it  in  our

Elections  Ordinance which is still in  force,  in

section  41(d) and (e) . Unfortunately, we had  the

story  then  in  Select Committee that  there  was

going to be a Communist-mounted campaign, and as a

result,  they  wanted  to  have  the  right   that

unmarked and blank ballot papers should also count

with  A, as was read out to you by the Member  for

Queenstown.  That was approved  by  5  to  4,  Mr

Speaker - 5        Government       against        4

Opposition - including, at that time, the Member for

Cairnhill.  On  recommittal  to  this  House,  the

Member  for  Queenstown  moved  an  amendment  to

clause  28,  which  would  have  made  blank   and

uncertain ballot papers void and invalid,  and  in

that  I fully supported him. It is material,  when

they  seek to throw on us the onus of deciding  on

working  section 29, to see that  it  was  we  who

consistently  rejected section 29.  Finally,  Sir,

let us look at section 29. You will remember, Sir,

that it took three days of debate in the Assembly,

apart  from  the  lengthy  debate  in  the  Select

Committee,  in  which  the Barisan  Sosialis,  the

U.P.P. and   the  Workers'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



Party   consistently

maintained that blank and uncertain ballot  papers

should not count. That amendment of the Member for

Queenstown, which I supported, was negatived by 25

votes to 18. Government votes, Sir, In respect  of

section 29, I moved an amendment, trying to do the

best  we could of a bad job, that an unmarked  and

uncertain ballot paper shall be deemed to be of  a

person  who  is  not  in  favour  of  any  of  the

proposals  posed  by  the referendum  or  has  not

understood  the  question or the instructions  for

voting. Again this was negatived by the Government

and  the Front Bench Opposition by a total  of  25

votes to 18.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Something wrong with your

arithmetic!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, had the referendum

been  the other way, had there been 144,000  votes

for  A and 397,000 blank, we would have been  told

that the Assembly having already decided in favour

of  the White Paper proposals, Command Paper 33 of

1961,  we should not know, and the totals must  be

added  together, and there were  95  per  cent  in

favour.  As the Member for Queenstown has  already

indicated from the statements made by the Minister

for  Finance, it was intended that the blank votes

should  be  added to A. In fact, this was  clearly

indicated to us by the Government and accepted  by

the  Government as the true position when  it  was

submitted  to the United Nations. Now,  Sir,  they

are in the happy position of being able to publish

the  number  of the blank votes. They are  in  the

happy position of being able to point to the  fact

that,  despite  the  dishonesty  which  they   had

prepared  in anticipation of losing the referendum

for making dishonest returns, there was no need to

make   dishonest  returns.  Then,  Sir,  why  this

disgraceful  provision  about  wanting  the  2,000

votes,  going a begging for 2,000 votes  that  are

uncertain,   which  in  civilised  countries   are

naturally accepted as void? And why this provision

about  calling upon the Opposition Members to  put

it  to A, B or C? Why should we take the orders of

the Government as to what we are to do?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I know you have overruled my objection, and I shall not refer to it from the

legal point of view. But I think I am entitled  to

refer to it from the point of view of plain common

sense  and  decency.  How can  this  Assembly,  by

virtue  of  the majority which the Government  has

working with the Opposition Front Bench, call upon

the Opposition to do anything which the Opposition

does not want to do? By what right?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You do not have to do!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I notice that the Member for

Queenstown,  instead of merely voting  against  it

and  letting  them vote in favour, says,  "Let  us

forget this dirty Government." I would like to get

them  to  make me put a value to a blank vote  and

say a blank vote means A, B or C. I would like  to

see   the   Government  try   it.   All   of   it.

Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately,  because  I

do  respect  the  constructive  character  of  the

amendment  made  by the Member for Queenstown,  he

says, "Let us forget this dirty Government."  Here

we  have got - at least he has not said it,  but  I

take  it  that  is  the way his  mind  works  - the

Opposition has got a chance to clean up the  filth

that  the Government has left in the marble palace

of democracy. We will clean it up. We will declare

that  blank and uncertain votes are null and void,

and with that sentiment I wholly concur. But I  do

say,  Sir, that it is unfortunate and tragic  that

the  Government,  which has the opportunity  as  a

result of the generosity of the people to be clean

and  honest  at no expense to itself, should  seek

yet  another  filthy way of perpetrating  its  own

tortuous   brand   of   politics   and   political

propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be happy, Mr Speaker, to support in the

context  the  amendment moved by  the  Member  for

Queenstown  on  the  clear understanding  that  by

"protest votes" I do not mean votes that reject or

protest  against  the  White  Paper  proposals  as

amended.  But by protest votes, I understand  they

protest against the manner in which the referendum

was conducted. I think it is only right and proper

and common



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



sense and common decency that these votes, whether

ambiguous  or blank, should count for nothing  and

let those who have no respect for decency abstain.



<br><br>3.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, not only the

referendum is a sham referendum, but the  counting

procedure on Referendum Day, to say the  least  of

it,  is strange and unique. Today we have in front

of this House the amusing spectacle of reading the

Report  of  the  Superintendent of  the  Singapore

National  Referendum which gives us  two  separate

sets  of  figures in two separate counts, Annex  A

and  Annex  B.  Sir, this is one of  the  greatest

jokes  of  all time. How can the people trust  the

result of the counting? How can the people believe

in the referendum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we look at the Report of

the  Superintendent, we will notice that there are

two  counts. In the first count, the total  number

of  ballot  papers found in boxes was 561,467;  in

the second count the total number of ballot papers

found in boxes was 561,559. Two different sets  of

figures!  Where did they discover, may I  ask  the

Government, the extra ballot papers in the  second

count?  The people will wonder whether  there  are

any more ballot papers in the boxes!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Some more!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The U.P.P. was only allowed

two  counting agents for 51 counting  tables.  How

can two counting agents supervise or even look  at

the  counting and the adjudication of the doubtful

votes?  Sir, the counting procedure was a  serious

departure  from the normal counting  procedure  in

previous pollings. It was physically impossible to

check  the  seals  and look into the  1057  ballot

boxes  to see whether any more ballot papers  were

still  in  the boxes, a practice allowed in  every

election. We were invited by the Government to  go

to   the  Badminton  Hall  not  to  supervise  the

counting,  but to give a pretence of democracy  to

the  whole  referendum  procedure.  Two  times  of

counting gave two different sets of figures.  What

will happen if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



there   are  three  times  counting,  four   times

counting, five times counting? Sir, as far  as  my

memory can stretch, I have never heard at any time

in  the  history of polling in Singapore that  two

sets  of  figures  were yielded  in  two  separate

counts.  But  from  the  mystery  surrounding  the

counting, from the denial to Opposition Members to

have   sufficient  counting  agents,   these   two

separate  lists of results yielded in two separate

counts,  come  as  no surprise to  us.  It  is  no

surprise  to  the people. Anyhow, the people  have

considered the whole matter, not only as a  farce,

but as a joke.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I have noticed in this Report is

the absence of the total number of votes cast. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the total number of votes  cast  is

not  published in this Report. Why is  the  figure

not  published in this Report? Why is  the  figure

missing? Was there a difference-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, in the first one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - between the total number of

votes  cast and the total number of ballot  papers

found  in  the ballot boxes? You see, Mr Speaker,

in  the usual polling, the Superintendent gives us

the figure of the total number of votes cast which

he obtains from the butts of the ballot papers. He

gives  us the figure of the total number of ballot

papers found in the boxes. It is vital for  us  to

know the total number of votes cast. If we did not

know  the  total number of votes cast  and  if  we

could  not  compare it with the  total  number  of

ballot  papers  which were found at the  Badminton

Hall, how could we ensure that no ballot paper had

flown away, possibly had landed itself in Venus-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I ask the same question of

the  hon.  Member  as I asked of  the  Member  for

Queenstown,  that is, whether or  not  he  is  now

alleging  that  there  were  illegalities  in  the

referendum  counting?  If he  alleges  that  there

were,  in  fact, illegalities, then  I  think  his

remedy  is  by  way of a referendum petition.  The

time  of  the Assembly should not be taken  up  in

this manner.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I deal with

it  because  the Assembly has been asked  to  take

note  of  this  Report, and as  I  see  there  are

inconsistencies in the figures, I think it  is  my

duty  as an Assemblyman to go into the results  of

the  referendum  in respect of  the  two  separate

counts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even long before polling day, I said in

this  Assembly that the result of this  referendum

was  a  foregone conclusion. I predicted a 98  per

cent  or a 99 per cent victory for the Government,

because the Government had said during the  debate

on clause 29 that it would include all blank votes

as   White  Paper  votes  and  this  is  what  has

happened. Anyhow, to us, this referendum is only a

victory in name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer to the Assembly debate on the 10th

of  July, 1962, page 52? During the debate on  the

Referendum Bill, I made very briefly my assessment

of the position, and what I said in those days had

come  true.  It is at page 52, about the  14th  or

15th line from the top [Vol. 19, No. 2, col. 214]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing arising from this debate could alter

the Government's basic tactical position, which is

to put proposals or alternatives more unacceptable

than  the White Paper proposals. And you  have  no

better  proof than from the horse's mouth  of  the

Minister  for  Finance.  Any  genuine  alternative

could   not   be   accepted  by  the   Government.

Therefore,  Sir, by putting in more  alternatives,

more  proposals or amendments which are acceptable

to  the Government, they would only be serving  to

confuse the issue at stake. The issue is that  the

people  should  be asked to accept or  reject  the

White  Paper. If that is the question to be posed,

there would be no doubt about the outcome. But  as

things are, the Government would push through this

sham  referendum and steam-roller its White  Paper

proposal through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the people do in the circumstances?

If  the  voter does not go and vote, he loses  his

vote in future elections. If he tears his vote  or

defaces  it, he will go to gaol. If he writes  his

name   and   address,  he  is  afraid   of   being

intimidated. Sir, if he throws in a blank vote  it

would  be  considered a pro-Government  vote.  But

faced  with these possible courses of action,  our

stand  is  that the people should throw  in  blank

votes,  which  is the least of the evils.  If  the

blank  votes are more than the votes for the White

Paper,  then the Government would keep quiet.  But

if  the votes for the White Paper exceed the blank

votes,  not for any reason but merely because  the

voter is faced with impossible alternatives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



and  in desperation throws his vote for the  White

Paper  proposals, then we may be giving Government

the  opportunity to announce separately the number

of  votes  supporting the White Paper and  thereby

mount  a propaganda campaign to convince the world

that  the  majority  of  Singapore  citizens  have

supported the White Paper and have done so without

counting the blank votes.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is exactly what has

happened  today.  This is the reason  why  we  are

having  an  emergency sitting today, so  that  the

P.A.P.  Government can go and blast it off in  the

United Nations to people who do not know the  true

situation    here.    With   these    unacceptable

alternatives put in the referendum ballot  papers,

and    with    section   29,   with   undemocratic

restrictions  placed on Opposition Parties  during

the  referendum campaign, and to culminate it all,

the  last-minute  intimidation and  trick  by  the

Government,  propagated  through  the  radio   and

Rediffusion,  conveying to voters  the  impression

that  they  will  lose their citizenship,  thereby

resulting  in  the  loss of  other  benefits  like

schooling, medical aid, housing and social welfare

and  so  on, it is heartening to us to  note  that

there are so many people who are prepared to  face

all  these dire consequences, and cast blank votes

in  protest against the White Paper. In our  view,

these  were mostly the people who had, during  the

short  campaign fixed by the Government,  attended

the   rallies  and  the  street  meetings  of  the

Opposition  Parties where the bluff of the  P.A.P.

Government could be effectively exposed. But, Sir,

due  to  all sorts of restrictions imposed by  the

Government, the Opposition was unable to  organise

more  effectively  during  the  few  days  of  the

campaign,  to  counter the Government's  intensive

propaganda and intimidatory tricks over the  radio

and  Rediffusion, that if the citizens cast  blank

votes  they  would  lose  their  citizenship   and

consequently other benefits would be lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take this opportunity to

describe  to you the importance of the  radio  and

Rediffusion  in  this short campaign?  The  object

lesson   we   have  learnt  from  this  referendum

campaign  is the influence of these two  means  of

propaganda, namely, the radio and Rediffusion, and

the extent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



to which the Government is prepared to make use of

these means of propaganda in order to achieve  its

nefarious  ends.  I have in front  of  me  today's

Straits Times. There is a column on the front page

which says:<br><br><div align="center">"TV QUAKE ALARM A `CRUEL HOAX'"</div>



<br>This happened in Teheran, Persia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Radio forum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Because the Government's radio

forum was not conducted in a fair manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The transmission over the local U.S. armed

forces radio-television network was seen and heard

here  last  night and set off a wave of  confusion

and panic among 2,000,000 inhabitants, who spilled

into the streets and open spaces.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You had an earthquake.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - just a short announcement

over  the  radio  is capable of driving  2,000,000

people  from Teheran into the streets, not to  say

the  flashes  we  had every few minutes  over  the

radio  in Singapore in all the languages,  in  all

the  dialects.  When I heard it, it  gave  me  the

impression  that if we cast blank  votes  we  were

likely  to  lose our citizenship and thereby  lose

all rights of citizenship. We would not be able to

send  our  children to school; there would  be  no

medical  aid, no housing flats, no social  welfare

and other such things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the influence of the radio, I

remember having read that on a certain day in  the

United  States,  where most  of  the  people  have

attended secondary schools, the radio put  over  a

mock  programme announcing a Martian  invasion  of

the world.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> A Marshall invasion!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> There was panic immediately

among  the  people.  Millions  rushed  from  their

houses  to  safety. And this is what  happened  in

Singapore  during  the  last  few  days   of   the

referendum  campaign. Every few minutes  over  the

radio, the Government impressed on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



the  people  that  if they cast blank  votes  they

would  lose their citizenship. And there was panic

among  the  people. And because of  all  sorts  of

restrictions imposed on the Opposition Parties, we

could  not  paste posters announcing our  rallies.

Section   42  of  the  Referendum  Ordinance   was

interpreted in such a way that we could not  paste

posters  announcing our rallies. So, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the  Government's  radio  campaign  was   so

effective  that it created a panic.  And  we,  the

Opposition  Parties, who have  no  access  to  the

radio, were not given an opportunity to expose the

bluff,  within  so short a time of as  during  the

last three to four days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is therefore our contention that the

results published in the Report do not reflect the

true  wishes of the people. In a letter dated 12th

October,   1961,  the  Prime  Minister  gave   the

following assurance to the Opposition Parties:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is the intention of the Government, when all

the  details  have been worked out, to  publish  a

Paper and table it in the Legislative Assembly for

debate.  Then  the  people can  accept  or  reject

them.'



<br><br>Subsequently, the Government broke its promise and

changed  its mind over putting the White Paper  to

the  people  in a yes or no referendum because  it

started  realising  that  the  White  Paper  would

receive  an  overwhelming defeat. A  way  out  was

thought  of and worse alternatives than the  White

Paper  were found and placed on the ballot  paper.

If   the   people  wanted  to  protest  in   those

circumstances, they could only put in blank votes,

and  the  putting in of blank votes was  something

new to the electorate of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, we were given only two

short weeks. During those two short weeks, it  was

not  possible  for us to explain  to  the  600,000

voters  of  Singapore  how to  cast  blank  votes.

Moreover,  the  P.A.P.  Government  countered  the

blank  vote campaign in two ways. Firstly, by  the

notorious  section 29 of the Referendum Ordinance.

And  this  is important: rightly or wrongly,  many

voters  thought that if they threw in blank votes,

their citizenship would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



taken  away.  The  voter felt  that  there  was  a

possibility of the Government knowing his identity

as  there  was a number on the back of the  ballot

paper.  In  a  democratic system,  the  number  is

actually  meant  to protect the interests  of  the

Opposition,   to   minimise  the  possibility   of

Government-rigging, but certain misinformed though

perhaps well-intentioned people campaigned in  the

beginning  against the number on the back  of  the

ballot  paper. Although the campaign was withdrawn

towards  the  later stages when  the  mistake  was

realised, the impression of a number on  the  back

of  the  ballot paper stuck in the  minds  of  the

voters.  Therefore, many voters were  afraid  that

through  the  numbers they could be identified  by

the  Government and therefore be deprived of their

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the second cunning stroke of the

P.A.P. Government - and due credit must be given  to

our  famous Minister for Culture - was to compel all

voters  on  polling  day to go  into  the  polling

booths  even  if they wanted to cast  blank  votes

Many  voters  who wanted to cast  blank  votes  by

walking  straight  up  to the  ballot  boxes  were

caught by surprise when they were compelled by the

polling clerks - on orders from the Government, I am

sure - to  go into the polling booths. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  many  of the voters had the impression  that

they  had  to put a cross against any one  of  the

three  Alternatives  A, B or C.  And  having  gone

through an intensive propaganda campaign which was

carried  out by the Government over the radio  and

Rediffusion,   they  knew  that   of   the   three

alternatives, A was the least evil and  therefore,

consciously or unconsciously, they voted for A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the effect of the radio and

Rediffusion could be seen most clearly during  the

counting  of the votes. It was apparent  from  the

counting  that  in  places like the  rural  areas,

where there is no Rediffusion or radio because  of

a  lack  of  electricity supply, there  were  more

blank  votes  than  in areas  in  Chinatown  where

almost  every household has either a  radio  or  a

Rediffusion set.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What does that prove?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They have get transistor

sets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion

is   brought   up  today  because  the  Government

considers that it has won a so-called victory.  It

is  nothing but just a means of gaining  publicity

and  to  mount a propaganda campaign to show  that

the  majority  of the people are not  against  the

White Paper proposals. We feel that the purpose of

this  motion before the House is to wash the dirty

hands  of the Government of the notorious  section

29   by   pushing   on  to  the   Opposition   the

responsibility  of deciding how  the  blank  votes

should  be allocated. During the debate on  clause

29,  I  remember that many Government  Assemblymen

said  that blank votes would be considered as pro-White  Paper  votes. But today, as on  many  other

previous occasions, they have changed their stand.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today, the

Government   want  to  appear  to  be   fair   and

reasonable. They have convened this sitting to ask

the  Opposition to decide what should be done with

the  unmarked  and uncertain votes. They  want  to

give  the impression that they are fair, that they

do not want to take the decision, although the law

allows  them  to  do so, but that  they  want  the

Opposition to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is strange that the Government, which in

the  past  have consistently ignored consultations

and  disregarded the views of the Opposition,  now

come  to  this House and ask us to decide what  we

want to do with the blank votes. Incidentally, Mr

Speaker,  even  when the counting started  in  the

Badminton Stadium, until the very last moment, the

decision  to count the blank votes was not  taken.

The  decision  to count the blank votes  was  only

taken  at  the last moment after experts like  the

Minister for Finance had made a careful assessment

and  knew  beyond doubt that if they  counted  the

blank votes the number would not exceed the number

of A votes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, they come here - having declared the

results  showing 71 per cent in favour of A - asking

us  to  decide  what we should do with  the  blank

votes.  I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  if  the

declared results had been 71 per cent blank votes,

the  Government would not have come here and asked

us  to  decide what we should do with these  blank

votes.  In  the first place, they would  not  have

counted  the blank votes separately under  section

29  of the Ordinance. They would have counted  the

blank  votes together with the votes  for  A,  and

declared only the results in respect of A.  B,  C,

and the rejected votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis is grateful

that  the  Government have convened  this  sitting

because whatever is the outcome of this sitting it

will  afford  the  Opposition the  opportunity  of

recording our views officially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have said in the past, long before the

1st  of  September, long before the voting on  the

referendum  took  place,  that  we  regarded   the

referendum  as  a  sham  referendum.  It  will  be

remembered, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of the

debate  on  the  Referendum Bill that  practically

every  speaker  from the Barisan Sosialis  in  the

Assembly   spoke  against  the  Referendum   Bill.

Practically  every speaker said that a  referendum

held  under the provisions of that Bill would  not

enable  the Government to ascertain correctly  the

views of the people. We said in the past that  the

referendum  was  a  sham.  We  say  now  that  the

referendum  was  a  sham. A  dishonest  Referendum

Ordinance  deliberately  tailored  to   give   the

Government  a favourable result cannot produce  an

honest  and  decent referendum. We said  that  the

Referendum Ordinance was a sham; we said that  the

referendum  itself was a sham.  We  say  that  the

result produced as a result of this referendum was

equally a sham.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we notice that the Prime Minister has been

very  careful in pointing out that the  result  of

the referendum does not mean a Party victory. But,

Sir, lest there be in the future the temptation to

regard this 71 per cent as votes for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



the   Government.  I  wish  to  say  that  if  the

Government  want to regard this as a  victory  for

them,  I say it is a victory for intimidation.  It

is a victory for deceit and dishonesty. In that we

concede that we in the Barisan Sosialis have  been

defeated. Unlike the P.A.P., we do not attempt  to

deceive  the  people  for  temporary  gains.   Our

struggle  is  a  long-term  struggle.  We  do  not

believe that the use of the police and the  radio,

the  use  of  the  Press  and  other  intimidating

tactics purely for the purpose of making temporary

gains  will  make any difference in  the  ultimate

struggle of all socialists for a better tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of the result has already been

pointed  out  by  the Member for  Queenstown.  The

political  situation arising  from  this,  to  our

minds,  appears to be unchanged as it  was  before

the 1st of September. A vote recorded in favour of

Alternative  A  cannot be said to  be  a  vote  in

favour of the P.A.P., the S.P.A. or any other Party.

The  voting was not on the basis of pro one  Party

or anti another Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are asked to decide on the blank votes.

We  say that blank votes are blank votes; unmarked

votes are unmarked votes; and they cannot be taken

to be in support of any of the three alternatives.

We  said during the session on the Referendum Bill

that  we  were opposed to counting blank votes  as

votes  for  any of the propositions. Our  position

remains the same. I am a bit puzzled at the things

that  the  Member for Anson has said. On  the  one

hand,  he  says  that the referendum  was  a  sham

referendum.  He says it was an unfair  referendum.

Therefore, a blank vote is a blank vote in protest

against the referendum. On the other hand, he says

he  accepts the result of the referendum. Sir, our

contention, as I have said, is very simple. If  we

are  satisfied that the referendum held under  the

provisions of the Referendum Ordinance is  a  sham

referendum,  it cannot produce a result  which  is

reflective of the views of the people. It  is  not

necessary for me, Mr Speaker, Sir, to go into the

details of the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



tactics at the counting of the referendum, because

this  has  been  dealt  with  by  the  Member  for

Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say in conclusion that the Government

can  interpret the result in one of two  ways.  It

could   say  that  this  is  a  victory  for   the

Government,  for  the deceit, for the  dishonesty,

for  the intimidation and all that went with them.

In  that case. Mr Speaker, Sir, they will  become

bolder  in the future. They will become bolder  so

that  they are firmer in their repression  of  the

expression of the people. The Prime Minister ended

up  by  saying that whether we want to continue  a

constitutional or an unconstitutional  fight  will

depend  on  us. We wish to say, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that we have no intention whatsoever to indulge in

anything  that  is unconstitutional.  Whether  the

Government are going to be more repressive or  not

will depend on them. But if they wrongly interpret

the  result to mean support for their undemocratic

acts in the past, then no doubt they are bound  to

take  a bolder and more repressive attitude.  Sir,

yesterday one of the prominent P.A.P. leaders said

that  they will land us two blows to one. We  tell

them that we will give them three blows to two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other manner in which the result can be

interpreted by the Government is to say  that  the

Government   have   scored  a   victory   in   the

constitutional fight. And we tell them, Sir,  that

we  welcome that interpretation. If the Government

honestly and sincerely feel that they have  scored

a  victory, then it is a victory for parliamentary

democracy,   then   it  is  a  victory   for   the

constitutional  fight  of  the  various  political

forces, and we say we are prepared to take them on

at any time in the future. But the Government must

make up their minds. They cannot, on the one hand,

advocate   constitutional   means   of   political

struggle   and  at  the  same  time   indulge   in

repression  and make sure that the  Opposition  is

not given the opportunity of expressing its views.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, not so long

ago,  there  was  an election in  the  Philippines

where  a certain former President - Mr Garcia - lost

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



election.  He,  having lost the election,  decided

the  whole  thing  was  a phoney.  But  with  this

difference. Garcia, believing that it  was  phoney

and the whole thing was dishonest, had the courage

to  take legal proceedings to declare the election

null  and void. But here we have today the leaders

of the Barisan Sosialis, the U.P.P.-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not say

now  that  this is a sham referendum. We  said  it

long ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Queenstown went

into  some  details, enough to draw your attention

to  the  fact that he was implying that there  was

something  irregular about the  whole  referendum,

including the counting. If they are not trying  to

cheat  the  people once more, let them believe  in

what  they  say. At least be sincere in what  they

are  saying. If they really believe that there was

some  monkey  business  on Saturday,  bring  up  a

petition  and take it to the Referendum Judge  and

let  him  decide. But if they are only  finding  a

pretext, a save-face for men who always talk about

the  masses behind them - they have been talking for

years   that  we  are  frightened  to   face   the

people - today they have been exposed, as our  Party

says, dwarfs with feet of clay. And of the 25  per

cent who cast blank votes, as far as I can gather,

there  is argument. How should the 25 per cent  be

shared  out?  After all, who are  the  people  who

campaigned for blank votes? There is the Party led

by  the  Member  for  Hong Lim,  the  U.P.P., the

Barisan  Sosialis, the Workers' Party, the Liberal

Socialists. They should have their share of the 25

per cent. I understand the Member for Hong Lim did

say  that  half the blank votes should go  to  him

because  he  thinks  that he  wields  the  biggest

influence-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I ask the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister has not

given way, the Member for Hong Lim is out of order

if  he  speaks. I am sure the Minister  will  give

way. Now, Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask the

Minister to produce the quote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I have heard that the Member for

Hong  Lim  did suggest that half the  blank  votes

should  go  to him. But maybe he is a very  modest

man.  Maybe it was not 50 per cent. It was only  5

per  cent.  I  am quite sure some of us  who  were

there  that day when the votes were being  counted

suddenly did not find the Member for Hong Lim very

ebullient.   When   the  Barisan   Sosialis   were

persuading  him  to join in declaring  the  result

constituency by constituency, we all noticed  that

the  Member  for Hong Lim was not very anxious  to

declare  the  voting constituency by  constituency

because  he had one of the biggest shocks  of  his

life.  Therefore. Sir, it may be that he  did  not

say  50  per cent. If that is the case, the rumour

was  false.  Maybe it was a much lower figure.  It

may be 30 per cent. But whatever it is, let us  be

quite clear, Sir -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know what the

Minister  for  "Kultur"  was  talking  about   our

persuading the Member for Hong Lim-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Did the hon. Member for

Queenstown  say "the Minister for Kultur"?  If  he

did,  I  do  not think there is such an animal  in

this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We have had two weeks of

vigorous  campaigning when we went round  speaking

everywhere,  every  night  and  every   day,   and

sometimes our enunciation of words can be a little

off.  The Minister for Culture was saying that  we

persuaded  the Member for Hong Lim to  come  along

and  join  us in asking for a division by division

counting. We never did it. I think the Minister-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That probably is the

elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a lot of things

have  been  said  about how they  feel,  that  the

referendum   was  dishonest,  or,  at   least   by

implication, that something fishy had  been  going

on.  Let  me  say that round about 6 o'clock,  the

Members  of  the Barisan Sosialis were  peacefully

asleep,  confident that the counting  was  honest,

that  it  was  proceeding nicely,  and  they  were

satisfied.  Not  only the representatives  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  but Mr Lim  Ching  Siong  and

their  legal advisers. One of their legal advisers

was  always in a state of tension. He was  jumping

around  from place to place. Apart from him,  they

were peacefully asleep. That is not the conduct of

men -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we were just fed up with

what   was  going  on.  He  has  not  denied   the

irregularities that we have mentioned, and on  top

of that all our complaints were ignored. Until-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member has said

enough  in  elucidation. He  was  not  asleep  Mr

Rajaratnam. And I ask the Minister perhaps to come

straightaway to the amendment, which is  what  was

are  debating, and to remind him that there  is  a

guillotine  motion  which  was  proposed  by   the

Government side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had to stress

this point because a lot of play has been made  of

the fact that this referendum was dishonest or the

word "dishonest" had been interpreted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



to  mean  something else. The whole procedure  was

something that was not quite above-board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the amendment to the motion. The

contention  by the Barisan Sosialis  is  that  the

hundred  thousand  odd votes were  protest  votes.

They were protest votes of varying degrees. In the

case  of  the Member for Anson, as far  as  he  is

concerned,  it  was  a protest  vote  against  the

manner  in  which  the referendum  was  conducted.

Though  he  says  he  is very satisfied  that  the

merger proposals are genuine, his Party comes  out

and  says  they are phoney. He says  he  is  quite

satisfied with the results of the referendum.  His

Party comes forward and says the whole thing is  a

phoney  and it does not accept the result  of  the

referendum. Therefore, it is very difficult for us

to  understand  whether it is a case  of  the  dog

wagging the tail or the tail wagging the dog. Sir,

I  am  inclined to half agree with the Member  for

Anson   as  the  Member  for  Anson,  and  totally

disagree with the Member for Anson in so far as he

is  a  member of the Workers' Party. I think  that

more   or   less  defines  the  quality   of   our

relationship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come to the question of the blank votes.

I did say, I think in this Assembly, that the pro-Communists  in the Barisan Sosialis  have  made  a

blunder,  one  of  the biggest  blunders  for  the

second  time, in pinning their hopes on the  blank

votes  to  indicate the measure of  the  Communist

influence in Singapore. That is what they did.  By

asking  people to come out and put blank votes  as

protest votes, they were doing something which the

Communists  have always avoided. They have  always

fought elections never on their own strength,  but

as  part  of  a united front. If the united  front

wins, they say it is due to "our strength". If  it

loses, then they blame the weaklings, the waverers

and other people who are part of the united front.

That has now been endorsed in the latest issue  of

the  Malaya,: Monitor, which is the mouthpiece  of

the  Communist International, in so  far  as  they

give  directives to the Communists here. They have

come out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



because of those who blundered by asking for  the

blank  votes now. As in the case of Stalin,  when

he  made  a blunder, his bones were removed  from

the  Kremlin  and buried elsewhere. I  am  afraid

that  a  lot of the sergeant majors who conducted

this  campaign for the Communist Party are  going

to  have their bones disinterred from within  the

Kremlin  walls and buried outside.  The  Malayan

Monitor  has come out and branded them  as  shaky

and confused elements who did the wrong thing  by

campaigning  for  blank  votes  and,   therefore,

putting  the M.C.P. in the predicament  of  being

exposed  as  a  Party which has  not  the  masses

behind  it. Today we know that the united  front,

not  only with the Barisan or the Communist Party

Ra'ayat,  but  even with the Liberal  Socialists,

the U.D.P., the U.P.P., the Workers' Party, could

only summon 25 per cent. To that extent, the myth

that  the Communists have the masses behind  them

has   been   exposed.  The   latest   issue,   in

anticipating this, brands these people  as  shaky

and  confused elements who should not  have  done

this. In fact, it goes on to say in so many words

that  all  these  people are campaigning  because

they  say, "Well, we want to preserve citizenship

and  electoral rights." The Malayan Monitor says,

do  not  worry  about electoral  rights.  If  the

people must lose their citizenship, let it be so;

do  not  pay  heed  to what they  call  "colonial

legality".  So the indications are that  if  they

lose  the  constitutional struggle, after  having

discovered their electoral stand is not all  that

big,    they    might   have   to    resort    to

unconstitutional methods, and we know that during

the  campaign hints about this have been  thrown.

Lim  Ching Siong said so; top men have to  resort

to  other means. There have been threats  by  Mr

Lim Ching Siong against certain Chinese community

leaders  who  came  out  openly  in  support   of

Alternative  A. He said the Chinese  people  will

know  how to deal with such leaders. In  fact,  I

heard the same people say, "Here is a Party which

is   not   yet   in  power  already  talking   of

liquidating and murdering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



people  even before they are in power. What  will

happen if ever they are in power?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons we can tell them why 71 per

cent of the people came and voted is not because,

as  they  have said, the people were deluded  and

frightened.  The Member for Queenstown  has  said

that  we swooped ballot papers with crosses which

were  shaky. The people were not shaky,  Sir, It

was the Barisan Sosialis who were shaky that day.

These  same  people  told me once  upon  a  time,

before  this  exposure on the 1st  of  September,

"The  people's eyes are crystal clear;  you  must

trust the people." Today they are telling us that

the  people  are half-blind. The same people  who

say,  "Trust  the people. Their eyes are  clear,"

now  say  71  per  cent of the people  have  been

deluded  and  frightened by radio propaganda,  by

intimidation.  I  can tell why the  crosses  were

shaky.  Some  of the people were very  old.  They

were  holding  the  pencil and trembling  in  any

case.  Not because of our propaganda, but because

they  were old. As you know, Sir, for people  who

are  frightened, they say we are using the radio.

If  they  really  believe that we were  spreading

falsehoods and misleading the people, we  offered

them  time  over the radio. Come and  expose  us.

When  the P.A.P. says this and that, it is all  a

lie.  We asked them to come. The Member for  Hong

Lim,  after  the  first forum, turned  round  and

said, "I am fed up. It is a waste of time.  I  am

not  coming."  The second forum, the  Member  for

Queenstown  said,  "No, I am  not  coming."  The

third  one - I must say the Member for  Anson  came

for  two of them, and one special interview where

I  thought  he  was the most reasonable  man.  In

fact,   our  relationship  was  almost   cordial,

friendly.  Now he sees me, he looks  through  me.

But I will say this much for him. At least he  is

prepared  to argue. Sometimes he says  the  wrong

things  at  lunchtime  rallies,  but  that  is  a

different   proposition.  But  the   Member   for

Queenstown?  Here  they  keep  on  saying   Radio

P.A.P.,  suppression of the voice of the  people.

We  say,  "All  right, please come along.  Expose

us." One



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



of  the  points which I think should be  made  is

that  they are afraid of the open encounter.  One

of the reasons why they have lost heavily is that

far  from suppressing them, we have allowed  them

to  have  their say. Every time they  open  their

mouths   in  public,  their  falsehoods  can   be

challenged, and they lose out. That is  why  they

do not want to. As you know, they cut Rediffusion

wires. Why? People who believe in free speech  go

around  cutting  Rediffusion  wires.  People  who

believe  in  free  speech put on loudspeakers  to

disturb other people's meetings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Shame, shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We have made it quite clear,

Sir. This is not a P.A.P. victory. The first time

we  want  to  be  proved between  the  democratic

elements,   the  Malayan  elements,   the   loyal

elements  and the party of people who  have  been

exposed  as  a negligible force. If  we  were  to

decide on the 25 per cent, I would say give  half

to  the Member for Anson, the Member for Hong Lim

and  to  Mrs Leon-Soh. The other half are people

whom  you  have misled. Of the remaining  12  per

cent,  I would say 5 per cent are the hard  core.

Whether  the Member for Queenstown and  everybody

likes it or not, obviously a new directive is  to

come - tough  methods.  If  the  leaders   of   the

revolution  want to fight it in a  tough  way,  I

hope the Member for Queenstown - I am told he is a

good  rugby player, a good chess player and I  am

also told he is a good gambler, but one thing  we

know, he is a bad loser. Whatever it is, to be  a

good revolutionary in the new phase, in 1947  and

1948  when the Communist Party took arms, it  was

an  anti-colonial struggle. Now, if you  take  up

arms,  you are definitely going to meet  with  71

per  cent of the people, and I am quite sure  the

25  per  cent who voted blank votes  - that  is  a

different thing - but they are not going  to  vote

for   violent   revolution.  If   the   Communist

directive  comes  for  the  Barisan  Sosialis  to

resort  to direct action, the Prime Minister  has

already  warned that there will be direct  action

on the part of the Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



not  because  we are the Government, but  because

the  71  per cent of the people have given  us  a

mandate  to  see  merger through.  If the  Barisan

Sosialis or their fellow travellers stand in  the

way  under the directive of gentlemen who are not

going to come back to the Assembly - it is all very

well  for  Lim  Hong Bee to give  directives  for

direct  action; he is not going to have his  head

broken; but he will obviously give a directive to

lots  of gentlemen who do not know what they  are

up to - let us give this warning, that we are ready

for  them.  If they really want to  play  it  the

constitutional way, then let them,  at  least  in

their  own  minds, whatever they might say  here,

accept  the fact that this is the verdict of  the

people, not of the P.A.P., not of the S.P.A., not

of  U.M.N.O.  The verdict of 71 per cent  of  the

electorate,  who were not deluded or  cheated  or

anything. They are intelligent people.  They  are

not  all  that  foolish. As the Barisan  Sosialis

have  said, the people's eyes are crystal  clear.

Let them remember that. The people knew what they

were  doing  and  they voted  for  Alternative  A

because they believed that was the best. In fact,

I  think during the last few months the behaviour

of  the  Barisan Sosialis made it quite clear  to

the ordinary people who were fed up with its half-dead revolutionaries, sergeant majors who did not

know what they were up to. These people were  not

interested  in  giving  constructive  leadership.

They  were out to destroy. In one year they  have

shown  they know nothing but only to destroy  and

create trouble. The ordinary man is not all  that

foolish. He walks around Raffles Place.  He  sees

these  gentlemen  going  around  putting  burning

cigarettes on the backs of people's necks.  These

are  things which people are not blind to. People

who  want to leave the Party pinch every  bit  of

furniture - cups, broken kettles. These people  are

not  the people who can be trusted with power and

therefore-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is the reason. Let them be

quite  clear. They may fool themselves,  Sir.  We

cannot  stop  that.  But  people  are  not  being

fooled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They will not be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is why they voted

overwhelmingly for merger, Alternative A, because

they believed that is good for them and good  for

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final point is that - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In fact, the note refers to the

Member   for  Anson.  I  am  very  glad  of   the

interjection, as it has helped me to get my notes

much quicker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also remind the gentlemen who do not know

what it is all about and who tag along on to  the

tail  of  a  dog,  that so long  as  they  remain

appendages of a dog, they can never hope to wag a

dog.   Let  us  make  it  quite  simple, it   is

physically impossible by all the laws of physics.

I am told that sometimes it is better to snip the

tail off. Thereby hangs another "tail".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson - though I disagree with him,

yet  I have some regard for him as I know in some

respects  he is not altogether without  political

intelligence - will I hope please take  my  advice:

that his Workers' Party gentlemen are leading him

up  the garden path, that they are up to no good,

and that they are doing him a great deal-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

We are on a motion with a time limit. For ones  I

am  not  interested in the advice of the Minister

for Culture. But much more important, as a Member

of  this Assembly, I take strong exception to the

waste  of  time  of  this  Assembly  by  complete

irrelevancy of a personal character.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have always allowed exordiums and

perorations which more often than not  have  been

completely irrelevant. My impression is that  the

Minister for Culture is on a peroration.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> There is nothing-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson must

accept the ruling of the Chair, and keep quiet.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Since the Member for Anson does

not  wish to be helped. Sir, may I therefore  say

that I did my best to give him good advice? If he

does  not want to pay heed to it, it is  his  own

business. But may I tell the Barisan Sosialis and

their  Communist friends that the verdict of  the

people  is  here - not in favour of the  P.A.P. or

anybody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is a sham.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They participated in a sham,

right up to 8 o'clock. When the votes were sorted

out,  and  when they saw that the number  of  the

blank votes was getting smaller and smaller, they

thought  out new reasons. They got hold of  legal

advisers  to  lodge  this and that  protest.  The

Member  for  Queenstown was as pale as  the  dawn

that was coming across Badminton Hall. So if they

really   believed  that  it  was  a  sham,   they

participated in the sham from Saturday evening at

8  o'clock to Sunday morning. There was no  sham.

The  sham  came when they got the shock of  their

lives when the people gave their verdict. It  was

the Barisan Sosialis which fled and ran away from

the people.



<br><br>4.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped

that  when the Assembly finished its sitting last

July,  we would have some peace of mind and  that

we  would not have to come to the Assembly for  a

long,   long  time  to  hear  political  comrades

tearing one another to pieces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far all the speeches made this

afternoon,  apart  from the Member  for  Anson's,

were  speeches made by Members belonging  to  one

political Party sitting on one side of the  House

when   they  were  returned  to  power.  At  that

particular  time  all  the  activities  that  the

P.A.P. indulged in, such as the P.A.P. radio, the

P.A.P. newspaper,  suppression  of  newspapers.

intimidation of the people, all those  activities

were  indulged in by everyone of them.  In  fact,

when  all of them were there, they said, "We  are

good,  clean and honest," when everyone  of  them

was  dishonest it seems funny that for the  whole

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



this afternoon Party comrades are now calling  one

another dishonest. Sir, from their claim of  being

clean,   honest   and  good,  they   have   become

dishonest, unclean and very bad. So much  so  that

each side is trying to destroy the other. In fact,

the  word "sham" has been used many times by  both

sides  of the P.A.P - I still call them "both  sides

of the P.A.P."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it a sham fight between both sides of

the  P.A.P. to get out of their responsibility for

the  mess  that they have left to the  country?  I

hope  not. But if it is a fight between democratic

forces  and  Communist forces in the camp  of  the

P.A.P.,  let  it  be  a fight  that  will  give  a

decisive  answer.  Sir, we do  not  like  to  hear

Ministers,  in  particular  the  Prime   Minister,

saying, as just now the Minister for Culture stood

up and said, "Ah, we now have 71 per cent. Barisan

Sosialis,  you  watch out! If you  want  to  fight

constitutionally,    we     will     fight     you

constitutionally.   If   you   want    to    fight

unconstitutionally,    we    will    fight     you

unconstitutionally." That is not the way to  utter

that  kind of warning. If the Government  honestly

believes  that the Barisan Sosialis are controlled

by  the  Communists, then the Government  has  one

duty  to  perform.  There  is  no  need  for   the

Government  to stand here and utter a warning,  so

much  so  that  it  makes me feel  that  all  this

warning  from either side of the House is becoming

a  sham. Let there be action. 71 per cent  of  the

people  have  given  their verdict  in  regard  to

merger; 71 per cent of those who voted are for  A.

And it is the duty, not only of the Government but

also of this Assembly, to see that the decision of

the  electorate is carried out despite any attempt

that the Communists and their stooges may wish  to

employ.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems that this party warfare between ex-comrades is to continue for some more months to

come. It may carry on right up to the next general

elections.  During the referendum, when referendum

meetings  were  held  by the P.A.P.,  the  Barisan

Sosialis, and the U.P.P., what they did  was  not

to tell



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



the  people  or to explain to them  the  forms  of

merger  that were open to them, or to advise  them

to  choose what they felt was the better  form  of

merger for the people of Singapore. No. They  made

use  of  the referendum meetings just to carry  on

their  political  fight.  There  was  the  Barisan

Sosialis calling the P.A.P. cheats, and all  sorts

of  things.  And there was the P.A.P. calling  the

Barisan Sosialis Communists. That was not the  way

to get the people to come to a proper appreciation

of  the  forms  of merger that were posed  in  the

referendum. The people have voted. A decision  has

been reached. It should not therefore be necessary

for  this party warfare to continue again in  this

House  this  afternoon. By the very terms  of  the

motion, it would seem that the P.A.P. want to have

one  at the Barisan Sosialis, and by the amendment

proposed  by the Barisan Sosialis, it  seems  that

they  want to have one at the P.A.P. What  is  all

this about?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why cannot uncertain votes remain uncertain? Why

cannot blank votes remain blank? Why must it again

be the focal point of warfare between comrades who

have fallen out? Let uncertain votes be uncertain.

Let  blank  votes be blank, because they  have  no

effect whatsoever on those known votes of A, B, or

C.  If  they have an effect on the result  of  the

voting, whether it should be A, B or C, then  this

Assembly  should be called upon to decide  in  the

most  honest  manner what those blank  votes  were

meant to mean. But now there is no need for us  to

give it an interpretation and say blank votes were

the  Communists  who were trying their  best  and,

therefore,  those  were  the  25  per   cent   the

Communists could muster. We should not try to give

an  interpretation in that way, because out of the

25  per  cent  who put in blank votes,  there  was

still  a large number of people who would  at  any

price  vote out the P.A.P., out of hatred and  out

of  anger, and not because they were misled by the

Communists.  Of course, there are some  there  who

were  misled by the Communists. I do not know  how

many  per cent. Let us not give an interpretation.

Let  the  Barisan Sosialis not try to  claim  that

these were protest votes.

the debate?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I only hope that the

Member for Queenstown could just walk to the other

side and face me. I do not quite like sniping from

the back. If he would just walk over there and  go

back and shake hands, perhaps there could be peace

in  this Assembly. There need not be a sham fight,

one  side  calling the other Communists,  and  the

other  side  calling  the  other  side  dishonest,

whereas both of them are dishonest. If there  were

Communists,  then both of them had  been  sleeping

with  the Communists for three years. Sir,  it  is

true,  as  has been brought out by the Member  for

Queenstown, wild rumours were going on, and a  lot

of  people  were misled into believing that  those

who  cast blank votes would have their citizenship

papers  taken away. The Member for Queenstown,  of

course, wanted the Government to give an assurance

that  such things should not happen. But  we  know

quite  well  that that cannot happen.  But  if  it

would  make  the  Member for  Queenstown  happier,

since  obviously he had put in a blank  vote,  the

Prime  Minister  or a Minister of  the  Government

could  assure him that, in spite of the fact  that

he had put in a blank vote, without even having to

go   through  the  number  on  the  back  of   the

counterfoil  of the ballot paper, his  citizenship

would  not  be taken away, unless, of  course,  he

tries  to  be funny and plays the unconstitutional

line in this political arena.

Member  for Queenstown to say that the trump  card

of  the  P.A.P. was this, the trump  card  of  the

P.A.P. was that. We all know, Sir, that  in  this

battle  for merger, both of them - I mean the P.A.P.

and  the  Barisan - having graduated from the  same

school  of distortion, were doing their  best.  In

fact,  if  credit is to be given  to  one  or  the

other.  I  would rather say that the  P.A.P. have

learnt very, very well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



from   their  Communist  mentors  and  they   have

outplayed the Communists at their own game.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 1st

September, 1962, will surely go down as a historic

day,  for  on  that  day we saw the  final  battle

taking place between the Communists, their stooges

in   the  Barisan  Sosialis  and  the  open  front

organisations against merger and against Malaysia.

The fight did not begin when the Superintendent of

the  National  Referendum  announced  polling  day

sometime  in  August. The fight  started  some  14

months ago. Since then, the anti-nationalist  Left

threw  everything  they had  into  the  battle  to

frustrate merger and Malaysia. We know that on the

1st  of  September,  they  suffered  a  disastrous

trouncing.  As  one newspaper had  it,  they  were

whipped.  They  were hit for six  on  the  1st  of

September.  With  all their propaganda  apparatus,

through  their mass organisations which  they  had

disciplined and in command, they could not  muster

more  than  a  quarter  of  the  support  of   the

electorate. Even of the 144,000 persons whom  they

had  persuaded to cast blank votes, only a portion

were   real   supporters.  We,   who   have   been

campaigning  on  the ground, came across  numerous

instances  where  people welcomed  us  into  their

homes  and  said,  "Yes, we are going  to  support

Alternative A. We are going to cast blank  votes."

So  we asked them, "Who told you that?" They said,

"Well, the Barisan Sosialis says the P.A.P. is  a

good Party. If you want to support the Government,

you   cast  a  blank  vote."  Therefore,  on   1st

September, the real strength they could muster  in

the   constitutional  fight  was  revealed.  Their

pretensions to being an invincible political force

were  shattered once and for all. As my colleague,

the  Minister for Culture, has pointed out, it has

always  been  their slogan that the  eyes  of  the

people are crystal clear - clear and bright as snow.

Now  faced with this clear verdict of the  people,

how  did these half-baked revolutionaries  of  the

anti-nationalist  Left  behave?  Was   there   any

dignity in their acceptance of the verdict of  the

people? Did they search



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



their  hearts  as to where they went  wrong?  No,

Sir.   Their  behaviour  reminded  me  of   little

schoolboys.  You will remember, Sir, perhaps  when

we  were very young, perhaps in Standard I, II  or

III, we came across the spoiled child who, when he

got  the worst of any encounter, would scream out,

"Teacher, he beat me." Or, "Sir, unfair." This  is

the  way these people who claim to be adults,  who

claim  to  be leaders of the people, who claim  to

represent the electorate in this Assembly, behave.

When  they  get  the worse of the encounter,  they

behave  just  like little schoolboys, like  spoilt

children.  When we say that the law requires  that

the  Assembly  decides how the  blank  votes  were

cast, they are not satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you, as Chairman of the Select Committee,

will  remember that on several occasions they said

that  the  Government intended to hijack - "hijack"

in  the  words  of the Member for  Queenstown - the

blank votes. Now we say, "You choose." If we  were

to choose, they say, "Well, there you are. It just

proves what we said."



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What did you say?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> So we say, you choose what

the blank votes mean.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You should have the guts to

say.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Guts to say what?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister must not talk

across the Table. Perhaps I could take that as  an

application for elucidation. Perhaps Dr Lee would

like elucidation. I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If they had wanted to talk

about  the  blank  votes not being  taken  by  the

Government, they should have said so in the debate

and accepted our amendment. Why did they insist on

railroading clause 29?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> They are difficult to please.

When  they said they did not like the White  Paper

merger proposals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



because there was no automatic citizenship, we got

automatic citizenship. Were they satisfied? No.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Spring chicken.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> A spring chicken? I thought

he said spring chicken with arsenic sauce. Now the

arsenic sauce has been taken away, and still he is

not satisfied. Now, we say, please decide. So they

say they protest. What is the meaning of all this,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir?  I say I  do  not  place  much

importance on what the Member for Queenstown says.

He  is  a  very  minor operator in the  scheme  of

things.  These are not only minor but  ineffective

open  front  operators and bring disgrace  to  the

cause.  But may I say the real meaning of this  is

that, for the first time, the Communists and their

open  front organisations have been outmanoeuvred,

outwitted, trapped and massacred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what happened in 1955 and 1958. In

1955, the first Chief Minister was there. Much  to

his  surprise, he won the elections and  within  a

few  months  they opened fire on him  and  he  ran

around  like  a half-witted chicken,  not  knowing

whether  he  was standing on his feet  or  on  his

heels  or  on  his  head. Now,  the  second  Chief

Minister  was made of sterner stuff. That  I  give

him credit for. He tried to put up a fight, but it

was an unequal struggle, between a green belt judo

man  and  a rookie. The rookie came along and  was

thrown  down,  in the end, dazed and prostrate  on

the  floor. The green belt judo man takes  us  on,

but  we  have  been schooled in this revolutionary

struggle  and we have good men who know  the  real

meaning,  who  can read the signs. So  this  green

belt judo man meets a black belt judo man and,  on

the  1st  of September, he was there, groaning  in

agony.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No belt.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What is the use of pretending

that  the referendum is a sham, that, in fact,  it

was  not  a defeat, that, in fact, the people  did

not  want merger and Malaysia? What is the use  of

making  all  this pretence? Who in  heaven's  name

will  believe  all the nonsense  that  they  are

trying to put out?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



The  plain  fact is that the people have  decided.

The  plain  fact is that for the first  time  they

have  met their equals and more than their equals.

They   were  beaten  to  a  frazzle  on  the   1st

September.  I say this is just the beginning.  Let

no  one  believe  that this  is  the  end  of  the

struggle. This is the beginning. I say we have the

measure of them and we will continue in the  weeks

and months to come to turn the heat on them.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I speak on the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, first, there is the

dubious legality of the amendment. If there is any

question  of legality and propriety, I think  here

is one which really calls into question the wisdom

of  allowing the amendment to stand on  the  Order

Paper  at  all  or be recorded in the proceedings.

The amendment as I understand it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that the unmarked ballot papers be recognised

as   protest  votes  and  all  the  unmarked   and

uncertain   ballot  papers  be  not   counted   as

supporting any of the Alternatives A, B or C".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ordinance which was passed by this

Assembly  specifically says unmarked and uncertain

votes  shall be deemed "accepts or is  willing  to

accept the decision of the Legislative Assembly on

the  matter referred for the referendum." He  must

accept  or  be deemed to accept. If you will  read

the words of the section, Mr Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`shall be deemed to be a person who accepts or

is   willing  to  accept  the  decision   of   the

Legislative  Assembly on the matter  referred  for

the referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the decision of the Legislative Assembly is

that  unmarked  ballot  papers  be  recognised  as

protest  votes  and  that  all  the  unmarked  and

uncertain  votes be not counted as supporting  any

of  the Alternatives A, B and C, then the Assembly

would  be contradicting the motion that is passed,

that the people be called upon to decide upon  the

Alternatives  A,  B and C. Where  is  the  blatant

contradiction?  The  law  says  any  uncertain  or

unmarked  vote  shall be that of a person  who  is

deemed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



accept or is willing to accept the decision of the

Assembly,  and  the decision of the  Assembly  was

that  it  shall either be A, B or C, not  that  it

shall be nothing at all. That was the decision  of

the  Assembly.  I therefore say, as a  preliminary

submission  ex  abundante cautela, nothing  to  do

with  delegatus  non  potest  delegare  that  this

amendment is contrary to the provisions of section

29,  read  in conjunction with the motion  of  the

Assembly  which  said  that the  people  shall  be

called upon to decide whether it is A or B  or  C.

However, since you have allowed the debate  to  go

on  to this stage, I shall not press my point, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think the more interesting aspect of

this  debate  was the very fortuitous intervention

of the Member for Anson. I am grateful to him from

time  to time. He is not quite sure, when the line

was drawn, which side of the line he was on. It is

like   Schleswig-Holstein,  sometimes  this  side,

Denmark,  sometimes the other side. From  time  to

time he battles forth. Or like Stalingrad, an even

more  vivid  example of how the battle  line  went

backwards  and  forwards. In the end,  of  course,

Stalingrad was reduced to rubble. But the Russians

were made of sterner stuff and they rebuilt it.  I

hope  with  the help of all the modern methods  of

psychotherapy a new person can be rebuilt  out  of

all this tremendous battle for minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson decided

sometime  in  the  course of this  debate  at  the

University  of Singapore forum that he would  play

the line of the reasonable man, just willing to be

fair,  willing  to see the other side;  and  in  a

moment  of  fervour in the argument,  he  went  on

without  the  permission of his Central  Executive

Committee to say that 15 representatives was fair,

acceptable-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker.

The   point   of   order   is   misrepresentation.

Misrepresentation  in  that  anything  I  said  in

connection  with the acceptance of the 15  members

was  not  with  the  permission  of  my  Executive

Council-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order.

It  is a point of elucidation. I am sure the Prime

Minister  would  have given  way  on  a  point  of

elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is a false statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, now we

have  got  it on record from the Chairman  of  the

Workers' Party that his Party agree that 15 was  a

fair representation in the Federation Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You see the distortion. I did not

use the word "fair". I said the Party accepted the

15 representatives. Let us not have distortion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am quite sure the people

who  painted those banners saying false merger  as

"phoney  merger" - Chia heh ping - they were  all  in

Chinese. The Member for Anson was not responsible.

Obviously  the  artist who did that had  sabotaged

the  Central  Executive Committee of the  Workers'

Party.  However, what was interesting was he  said

that,  and  suddenly he came to the  side  of  the

reasonable  man.  Then  in  the  course   of   the

denouement  during the last few  weeks,  bits  and

pieces  were falling into place. He found  himself

the victim of his own reasonableness. Logically he

moved step by step into a position where he had to

say  he  supported the White Paper, as amended.  I

say  he  was an honourable man in saying that.  He

went  far to try and honour his word, to  get  his

Committee to agree. Well, the Committee either did

not  agree  or  he  did not try  hard  enough.  An

impasse was reached. He said, "Yes, support it. It

is  fair  and just. However, cast blank  ballots."

Being a lawyer of no mean repute, the whole matter

was  rationalised after the 18th of August. On the

18th of August he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



said  he was going to ask his Committee to support

it.  Revise  this  blank ballot  thing.  The  same

rationalisation Ex post facto - that  is  another

Latin  tag.  It means after the event.  After  the

failure, an explanation is put on. The White Paper

password



is   right,  but  the  referendum  is  not  right.

However,  I accept that. Now I say I was wrong  in

saying that all those who voted against the  White

Paper,  who  cast protest votes,  intended  to  be

against  merger. In fact, we are sure  now,  after

the  very frank and honest admission of the Member

for  Anson,  that there is at least  one  unmarked

ballot  paper  that was in favour of merger.  That

was  the Member for Anson, Mr Speaker, Sir. There

may be more. You will have to use psychotherapy on

the 144,077 - I beg your pardon, we have already

explained  away one; it is 144,076. The others  we

can  go  through  one by one and discover  whether

they were like the Member for Anson, or the Member

for Queenstown, or the Member for Hong Lim. I mean

there  are gradations in all these things.  But  I

thought  he did us the greatest service  today.  I

did  not want to say this in my opening because  I

thought  if it came from the other side,  so  much

the  more effective would it be. All this villainy

that   is   now   heaped   upon   us - of   threats,

intimidation, rigging - we could have answered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a referendum petition provision put in

by  the  Member  for Anson which  provides  for  a

complete  re-scrutiny  of the  whole  process,  of

every  iota  of  evidence  being  put  under   the

microscope.  But having come from me,  they  would

have  said, "Ah, that is what the Government says.

The  Government will fix the witnesses, intimidate

them.  The  police  will threaten  the  Referendum

Judge." All kinds of other allegations will  come.

I thank the Member for Anson. He did the country a

service.  He  shot the ball into the Barisan  goal

when  he  said  that. But if they  believe  it  is

dishonest,  it  is  their  duty  to  bring  up   a

referendum  petition and let  us  go  through  the

whole  of it. Let us find out who intimidate whom.

Let him listen tonight to Radio Singapore and hear

what the Chamber of Commerce said to me, their own

voices  on  the tape, in Hokkien and in  Mandarin;

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



what  the Barisan said in their rallies. They  who

were  genuinely intimidated, ching  suan.  "ching"

means  clear, "suan" means count. That  means  the

settling  of accounts. "We will settle with  you."

That  is  what it means, ching suan. And they  are

men who took it seriously. They came and discussed

the  matter with me this morning. I told them that

as  long as we the Government of Singapore and  as

long  as there is an honest Government here, there

will  be  no ching suan according to the rules  of

the  game. If anybody is in danger of being  ching

suan-ed, well, let them listen to what was said by

the    Chamber    of    Commerce.   [Interruption]

Intimidation?  Let  them  bring  up  a  referendum

petition  and  we will prove it. All the  threats,

all  the  smears, all the vilifications,  all  the

lies.  Let me explain to the Member for Anson  why

we  did not do things the simple direct way. He is

not   an  unintelligent  man.  In  fact,  I   once

remembered  Lord Lennox-Boyd, the former  Colonial

Secretary, paid him a tribute, that he was a  very

intelligent Chief Minister; a great tribute from a

very    intelligent    man.   Lord    Lennox-Boyd,

undoubtedly   a  man  of  tremendous  intellectual

capacity, paid a tribute to the ex-Chief Minister,

that  he  was  an  intelligent man.  Now,  I  say,

exercise a little bit of that intelligence in this

respect.  Why  did we not say honestly,  "Yes,  we

will  count the blank votes"? Why did we not  give

notice  last  week that we were going  to  hold  a

meeting  this  week?  Let us  all  be  simple  and

straightforward.  Sir, I do not usually  think  in

terms  of  pictures because it so happens  that  I

like  to be more precise, if somewhat less  vivid,

in  my  forms  of  thought. But my colleague,  the

Minister  for Finance, once said that  the  Member

for Anson from time to time behaves as if he is  a

vestal  virgin who wanders through a brothel  area

crying out for the brotherhood and freedom of  men

and  women. And I say to him, as a result of  that

foolish exercise in human decency, he wound  up  a

political whore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Mr Speaker, Sir. Mr Woodhull

was  dead  right - 1956,  a famous  occasion.  I  am

grateful to the Member for Anson and I am grateful

to the Member for Cairnhill. They paid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



for  the lessons from which I profited. I say that

without any reservation and with no malice. I  say

if  it  had  been  my misfortune to  become  Chief

Minister  in 1955, I think I would have  perished.

And I say that sincerely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the Member for Anson hold out his hand in

friendship to Mr Lim Ching Siong. Thirteen of  us

went to London and Mr Lim Ching Siong pumped  his

hand vigorously and told him to fight for absolute

independence. The Member was a reasonable man.  He

wanted to fight for absolute independence and give

back  defence  and external affairs under  treaty.

Then  he could still go to the United Nations,  an

ambition now fulfilled. Yet Lord Lennox-Boyd would

get  what he wanted. So both sides were happy.  He

is always trying to be the reasonable broker, find

a  happy  mean  and settle. He did not  understand

that   young  master  Lim  had  no  intention   of

settling.  He  was just egging him on,  and  every

time it looked like reaching a settlement, he  was

pushed  a little hit further; the same tactics  as

used  by the Member for Queenstown. I mean  he  is

surely  not that naive. The Member for Queenstown

says  merger is a complete merger, twelve  States,

all   Singapore  citizens  automatically   Federal

citizens. The Member for Anson says, "Agreed,  all

right.  Move  Alternative  D."  We  rejected  that

because the real Alternative D was what the Member

for  Queenstown meant. After that, if you say  you

are,  to  that, then proportional representation.

The Member for Anson never demanded that. You will

remember  the  forum? When I  said  that  was  not

mentioned   in  Alternative  D,  the  Member   for

Queenstown   said,   no,  no,   no,   proportional

representation   also.  And  if   we   agreed   to

proportional   representation,   then   the   next

condition - dissolve   Singapore   and    Federation

Governments; general elections all round; then see

what turned up. And this young man pumped his hand

so  hard.  The Member for Anson thought it  was  a

test  of  friendship, the grip of friendship.  The

young  man  was  a green belt judo kan.  The  next

thing he found himself on the floor, prostrate-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



fallen. I did not trip him up, Mr Speaker, Sir;

young master Lim did, young master Lim did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I saw the Member for Cairnhill. True he was

made  of sterner stuff. Yes, he was, not now.  He

got  such a pulverizing experience he never quite

recovered  from  it.  It is  like  one  of  those

mincing  machines,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  You  put

something  in and get a shake-up. At the  end  of

it,  you never put the molecules together  again.

He lost all his teeth.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir, Is  this the time for bed-time stories?  We

have got only one hour.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

has  indicated how all this is relevant;  why  he

was  (I  think the expression used was)  "playing

the soft pedal" before the 1st of September.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not at all. I never used

that  expression, Sir. Why we did  not  have  the

simple vestal virgin approaching a brothel  area.

We  knew  we were in a brothel area and  what  we

did.  I  do not know if the Member for Anson  has

read this newspaper. In some parts of an American

town,  it  seems there were lots of  women  being

coshed  very  early at night. So the police  sent

out men dressed as women. The cosher came out, he

got  coshed.  Now, Sir, there were some  pictures

recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to come back to the Member for

Cairnhill, he was a brave man. He came out with a

policeman's  baton  and one bayonet  looking  for

them.  Young master Lim, green belt, waited.  The

next  thing  the  Member for Cairnhill  knew  his

baton  was  parted  from  him,  the  bayonet  was

dropped  from a limp and lifeless hand.  The  man

kicked  in  the  groin, arms twisted;  man  lying

still  on  the floor. Inert for months and  years

afterwards;  and  after recovery  not  quite  the

same.  And  I  say  I  am really  and  genuinely,

without any malice, grateful for that experience.

I saw it and I told him then, when it took place,

that  he was a brave man because he did not  know

what he was tackling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



But  I saw it and I learned from it. And when the

green  belt  rookies  came  out  with  new,  even

greener ones to assist them-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And you hit them below the

belt!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no, we consulted. That

is  true. What the Member for Cairnhill  said  is

absolutely true. But for the dedication  of  some

of  my  Party colleagues who knew the  Communists

and  their  methods,  who  either  corrected   or

confirmed  our judgments, we may well  have  been

like  the Member for Cairnhill, prostrate on  the

ground,  not knowing what has hit us, but knowing

what is going to happen. We took training from  a

black belt judo kan. When the green belts met the

black  belts - not one black  belt,  many  black

belts - that  is where the green belts  made  their

first   error.   They  have  always,   in   their

simplicity   of   propaganda,  personalised   the

defects and the weaknesses of the Government  all

in me. If the Government was as weak or as strong

as   I  am,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  it  would  have

perished.  My  weaknesses  are  made  up  by  the

strength  of my colleagues. Their weaknesses  are

made  up by the strength of others. So we have  a

fairly   tight  strong  front  which  cannot   be

pierced. One fought on until death. I think Inche

Ahmad bin Ibrahim would have had a great deal  of

satisfaction  that night, 2nd of September;  that

morning if only he was alive, he would have found

it   worthwhile  suffering  because  he  believed

absolutely and utterly in what we are  doing  and

he  was  with us. And the green belts found  that

they  were not taking an innocent young  lady  to

the  bushes to do her in and take her purse. They

found  themselves in the police  station  charge-room. That is where they are now, and you have to

have a proper legal defence, employ a good lawyer

and  argue  the case out. It was a fair  cop.  Of

course,  we wanted to count the blank votes  from

the  very beginning. But are we so stupid  as  to

tell them? Why should we tell them? That is  the

tragedy of the Member for Anson. A man comes  out

and  tells you the first time we moved that  Bill

in  January  1962 that there was no provision  to

count blank votes as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



according  to  the decision of the Assembly.  Then

the  fellow tells you that he wants people to tear

ballot papers and you still go on, having received

the  first  wolf call and you know  that  you  are

entering  the  danger area, you gaily  swing  your

hips  and saunter through. That is silly. We  took

the  Bill  back, thought it over,  dressed  it  up

nicely  with  rubber foam and a  couple  of  good,

quick-shooting  ones. And true  enough  they  came

out. They came out like the green belts they were.

That is a fact. It was - and I say this without the

slightest  sense  of  moral embarrassment - we  were

meeting card sharps and we were not going to go in

like  chickens,  whether they are  spring  or  old

ones.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> A crook for a crook.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A blow for a blow - one

intelligent move against another.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Bravo, crooks!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the Member for

Anson  that  he is not at a gathering  perhaps  in

Fullerton Square?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But even there, I prayed

silence  for him. My point is simply this.  Having

been alerted that they were up to no good, we took

it back and put it in another form. They never did

the  calculation. The battle could never be  lost.

If  they did a proper computation and calculation,

they would know that the P.A.P. with everything in

the  last  election got 53 per cent - that was  with

their  complete support - and for them to win,  they

must  capture 51 per cent out of that 53 per cent.

They did not do it. They never could have done  it.

But  we wanted to: cut them down to size, and that

was  what happened - and I said it immediately after

the  break - in a straight fight between  them,  not

against the P.A.P. We have our weaknesses; we have

our  party  problems, part of which  we  inherited

because  we had them in our midst. We admit  that.

We  have learnt the hard way and we do not  intend

ever  to be taken for a ride again, or to be  done

in the way the Member for Cairnhill was done in or

the Member for Anson was done in. We knew



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



exactly  what they were up to, and the green  belt

put  his hand out to twist the hand, of the  black

belt and he found himself prostrate on the ground.

It is as simple as that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to the Member for Anson - and I keep on

saying  this to him, because from time to time  it

is  worth  saying this to him because  he  changes

sides - he thought that when the lines were drawn he

was  in  between; it cut right through  him.  Then

when  he  felt that the other side was better,  he

joined  and dribbled with the other side to  shoot

the ball at our goal. But every now and again,  it

was  our  good  fortune  in  the  course  of  this

referendum, just as the ball was being placed near

their goal post, he shot one. He did a right about

turn  and  shot it into their goal. And  I  say  I

thank  him for this, because if any Member on  our

side had said, "Put up a referendum petition,"  we

would have thought it was a fixed job, but it  was

not. The Member for Anson claims credit for it. He

moved  those  provisions. I  agree - absolutely  and

utterly.  He  discovered a lacuna in the  law  and

said,  "Have a Referendum Judge," and  we  agreed.

Furthermore, we got our S.A.G. to tighten  up  and

elaborate on his provision and he was good  enough

to  pay  us a compliment that that was so. A  good

chap, to see whether it was done according to  the

rules,  and coming from him it must be so.  And  I

say  this: let him at least in the last  stage  of

this  phase  have the gumption to  turn  round  to

these gentlemen whom he knows to be Communists and

pro-Communists,  that they have  no  intention  of

playing  it  the  democratic  way,  they  have  no

intention  of checking the democratic  process  by

democratic methods, as he has suggested, that they

are  really toughies at heart. What Dr  Lim  Hock

Siew   said - he  wrote  a  letter  to  the  Straits

Times - after  the battle was over, he said,  "I  do

not mean that we will resort to other means. I say

that  other  people will have to resort  to  other

means." Very strange, these chaps. If other people

were to resort to other means, why encourage them?

That  is what I want to know. They keep on telling

us, "If you do this, people will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



resort to other means." Mr Lim Ching Siong  said,

"There  are  tough men around who  will  do  nasty

things.  But I am not so tough, so I  want  to  be

gentle  and  correct."  I say,  "Wolf  in  sheep's

clothing and the sheep's clothing got ripped off."

and  I  think  the  Member  for  Anson  should  be

careful, because when the chicken's feathers  are

peeled off, it is very painful.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  amendment  seeks to bring about  a  situation

that  the unmarked ballot papers be recognised  as

protest  votes, and all the unmarked and uncertain

ballot papers be not counted as supporting any  of

the Alternatives A, B, or C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may deal with the amendment under these

two  heads.  First  of all, that  unmarked  ballot

papers  be recognised as protest votes.  Sir,  the

phrase  "protest votes" there could mean a  number

of  things.  The  Member for Anson  has  given  an

indication  that  it  could  mean  protest   votes

against   a   sham   referendum.   That   is   the

interpretation  he  seeks to  give  to  the  words

"protest  votes".  The Barisan Sosialis  not  only

give  that interpretation but they take it further

and  say  that they are protest votes because  the

White  Paper is completely unacceptable  to  them.

Yet  again  the protest votes, from the  point  of

view of the Barisan Sosialis, could mean that  the

questions  posed on the paper which  went  on  the

referendum  were  dishonest  questions - the   third

possibility. The fourth possibility they have also

suggested to the House is that the manner in which

the Government conducted the election campaign was

thoroughly dishonest. The fifth possibility of the

protest votes is that the referendum machinery was

rigged,  the  count was false, the  Superintendent

was not true to the Referendum Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Mr Speaker, Sir, although the Member

for   Anson  supports  the  proposition  that  the

unmarked  ballot papers be recognised  as  protest

votes  for  one reason, and one reason  only,  the

Barisan  Sosialis  have put in that  amendment,  I

suggest, in order that they might go out later  on

and tell the people that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



the  Assembly  admitted that B should  be  protest

votes because of A, B, C, D, E and F. Mr Speaker,

Sir, I cannot subscribe to that view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me deal with the question of

whether  the White Paper is a phoney one. We  have

always  taken the view on this side of  the  House

- the  Front  Bench  of the Opposition - that  the

White  Paper  was  the best possible  thing  that

could   have   been  obtained  in  the   existing

circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It has been improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is a matter of opinion. The

Member  for  Anson has said, "The  result  of  the

change is more than a mere change in nomenclature;

be  satisfied." Well, if he is satisfied, so  much

the  better. So far as I am concerned, the  change

in  nomenclature  has made no  difference  to  the

legal  position of citizenship or  to  the  rights

which   we   will   get  under   the   change   in

nomenclature.  So  far  as  I  am  concerned,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  to  my mind,  there  has  been  no

change. If the Member for Anson has interpreted it

to  mean  something else, I am sure that Singapore

is grateful to him, because no doubt the fact that

he  has  changed  his mind on that  has  helped  a

number  of people to make up their minds  to  vote

for A. I am sure of that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, Sir, that the referendum paper did

not  contain fair alternatives. I do not subscribe

to  that. I subscr1be to the proposition that  the

referendum   paper  contained  all  the   possible

alternatives in the circumstances. Therefore. I do

not agree with the Member for Anson that it was  a

"dirty  paper".  He has all along maintained  that

the  referendum paper was a "dirty paper"  because

it  posed  impossible alternatives.  Now,  I  have

never  understood  the Member for  Anson  on  this

point,  and I would be glad to have an explanation

from  him.  Sir,  as I understood the  Member  for

Anson in this House, he has always maintained that

the referendum was a "dirty paper" because not one

of  the three Alternatives posed on the paper  was

acceptable to him or his Party. On that basis,  he

contended that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



it  was  unfair  to put them to  the  people.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  although I did not say  that  they

were  unfair,  I  could agree with  that  position

taken  up  by the Member for Anson, on  the  basis

that  he  felt  that  the White  Paper - Alternative

A - was  not what he wanted. On that basis, I  could

understand  that the three Alternatives  posed  to

the electorate were unacceptable and therefore  it

was  a "dirty paper". That is correct and logical.

But  after  the amendment which has been  effected

subsequent  to  the return of the  Prime  Minister

from  London,  the Member for Anson conceded  that

the  White Paper was everything he could hope  for

as  a result of that amendment. Now, if the Member

for Anson honestly believed that Alternative A was

acceptable,  how does the referendum  paper  still

continue to be dirty?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The answer is a very simple one.

The  Workers' Party has accepted A as  amended  in

the light of assurances and explanation. There  is

no  question about it. But we say, "It  is  not  a

referendum,  because it does not give  the  people

any opportunity to indicate their choice. All they

can say is yes to A. They cannot say no to A. B is

meaningless; C is meaningless. And where  a  paper

compels  you just to one and no choice to say  yes

or  no,  it is thereby a dishonest and an  immoral

referendum."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point

of elucidation on the point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid not. Mr Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> This is the point I am trying to get

across  to the Member for Anson and to the  House.

The  main  objection to the referendum being  held

was that the referendum paper did not contain fair

questions to the people. Fair questions, mind you.

"fair"  is  not a word on which everybody  agrees.

What is fair to the Member for Anson



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



might   not   be  fair  to  me.  I  consider   the

alternatives  fair. The Member for Anson  did  not

consider   them   fair  because  none   of   those

alternatives  were  acceptable  to  him.  On  that

basis,  I  saw  sense in his contention  that  the

referendum paper was a "dirty paper".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assume, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

citizenship   proposals  which  were  subsequently

altered  had  been there present  when  the  White

Paper  proposals  were  being  discussed  in  this

House.  I  must, therefore, assume that  on  those

conditions   the  Member  for  Anson  would   have

accepted   the   White  Paper,   and   the   first

alternative was Alternative A. He would  then  not

have  objected to the paper on the basis that  not

one of the alternatives was unacceptable either to

him  or  to his Party. At the conclusion  of  that

debate,  it was a fair position he held,  but  two

weeks  before  the  referendum  took  place,   his

position  had  altered and I could  not  therefore

understand the Member for Anson saying, "I  accept

the  White Paper proposal Alternative A - the  right

proposition: it is a fair proposition but  cast  a

blank  vote."  I  have  not yet  understood  that.

Therefore, the Member for Anson's statement  says,

"Because  the  referendum paper is  unfair,  those

votes  must  be  treated as  protest  votes,"  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I do not accept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other points made was that the

Government  in the referendum rallies  was  unfair

and  that  it told a number of lies. A  number  of

things were said about marked ballot papers, about

numbers  being behind ballot papers. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I  am  fairly experienced  at  the  game  of

politics. I have been in at every single  election

that  has  taken place. If I have not participated

in  them personally, I have been interested in the

participants, and I remember the complaints of all

the   defeated  Parties.  The  complaints  of  all

defeated  Parties  are  that  the  other  side  is

unfair.  It  is  a  human  weakness  which  people

exploit  in  their  moments of  defeat.  When  the

Progressive Party was defeated, some of them said,

"Unfair.  The Labour Front was unfair."  When  the

Labour  Front  was  defeated by  the  P.A.P.,  the

Labour Front said, "The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. was  unfair:  the  P.A.P. threatened  the

people; the P.A.P. did this thing and that thing."

It  is curious, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the light  of

what has happened, that the same objections to the

referendum  should be brought up  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis.   The  objections  which   the   Barisan

Sosialis are now bringing up with reference to the

referendum proceedings are exactly the  same  sort

of  objections  that the defeated  Parties  raised

with  reference  to the P.A.P. At that  time,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim was on their

side. The Member for Queenstown was on their side.

Everything  seemed fair to them then. The  numbers

on  the  backs of the ballot papers did  not  then

worry the voters, hut apparently for the last  two

weeks  or  so they have been worrying the  voters.

So, where is the truth in all these allegations? I

do  not  accept  them.  It may  be  that  you  can

frighten a hundred or two hundred people, but  you

cannot  frighten  three hundred thousand  or  four

hundred  thousand people with these  stories,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir. You can intimidate one or two;  you

can  intimidate  a few, but you cannot  intimidate

people in the mass on the basis that there will be

numbers on the back of ballot papers and that  the

Government  will see them and will  come  to  know

that you have voted the wrong way. After this, the

Government  is  going to imprison you,  take  your

citizenship away, send you back to China or  India

or Ceylon, or wherever you came from originally. I

do  not accept that, Mr Speaker. It does not work

out like that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last proposition which the Barisan Sosialis

put  forward,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  was  that  the

counting was all phoney. It is a very unfair thing

to  say  that, Mr Speaker, because  a  number  of

officials were involved in this. I was present  at

the Singapore Badminton Hall from 9 o'clock. I saw

the ballot boxes arrive. Nothing happened to them.

They  were under proper guard. Everything was done

properly.  When  the last ballot  boxes  arrived - I

think   it  was  at  about  half-past  eleven   or

thereabouts -  the  Superintendent  offered   every

single Member there an opportunity of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



inspecting  all  the boxes to see that  the  seals

were  intact, and after all the Members  who  were

entitled to inspect the boxes were satisfied  that

they  were intact, the count then began.  I  think

the  count began soon after twelve, if I  remember

correctly.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am  revealing  no

secret,  but  within half an  hour  of  the  count

starting, one knew the verdict of the people.  One

did  not have to wait for the whole of the  count.

Within  half  an hour of the count, it  was  quite

obvious  which  way the voting was going.  It  was

obvious  that Alternative A was going to  win  and

win  handsomely. There was no question of anything

being  rigged. Let us assume that there  had  been

rigging  in  the  voting.  Rigging  of  how   many

votes - thousands  upon  thousands  upon   thousands

without being known? Impossible! If it had been  a

close  one,  if Alternative A had got 45  and  the

blank  votes  had  got 44, all  these  accusations

might have been relevant. But in the circumstances

when  the  blank papers only had 25 per  cent  and

Alternative A had 71 per cent, the leeway  was  so

wide.  And when the position became quite apparent

after half an hour of the count to anybody who was

present around the 51 tables, I cannot accept  the

accusation  that the count on the  referendum  was

rigged. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, on all  those

counts, I cannot accept the amendment proposed  by

the,  Member for Queenstown. I have sympathy  for

him  in the latter part of the amendment where  it

says, "unmarked and uncertain ballot papers be not

counted as supporting any of the Alternatives A. B

or  C". In the circumstances, Mr Speaker, Sir, it

really  does not matter what, in fact, happens  to

those unmarked ballot papers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original motion as appears in

item  2 on the Order Paper is before the House.  I

wonder if there are any Members who wish to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, Members of the Barisan Sosialis

left the Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I do, Sir. If it please you, Mr

Speaker,  I  can understand the disgust  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis feel. You will forgive me,  Sir,

if  I  do  make a note of the fact that  they  are

walking out of this Chamber for the record. I  can

understand  their disgust, because  not  only  has

decency  now fled, but even logic and sanity  have

fled  by  the action taken by the Government  with

the  Front  Bench of the Opposition. Because  what

has  transpired  is this. The Government  did  not

want  to  clean its dirty stables. We  offered  to

clean  it  for  them. There  was  no  need  to  be

dishonest  about the blank votes. They said,  "Oh,

yes,  now  we  agree there was no  need.  We  were

playing cat and mouse, or pseudo-prostitutes, just

to  draw  out the Barisan." They have  drawn  them

out,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



according to them. But at this juncture, Sir,  why

continue with the farce? We were prepared to clean

up  their mess and bring back some sanity to these

proceedings by declaring these blank votes  to  be

void.  Now  they want to proceed with the  motion.

What  is the sense of the motion? Mr Speaker,  in

all  your  experience,  in  all  the  history   of

democratic   institutions.  I  ask  you   in   all

seriousness,  have  you come  across  a  provision

whereby  the majority seek to compel the  minority

to  vote  in  a  specific  fashion?  It  says  the

Opposition  Assemblymen opposed the amended  White

Paper  merger  proposals and calls  upon  them  to

decide.  And then, where do we go from  there?  We

have  told  them that in our view blank votes  and

uncertain  votes should not be counted, should  be

null  and  void.  We have told  them  that  it  is

immoral  to  give  any value to  blank  votes  and

uncertain votes. They say, "No, you fix a  value."

Where   do   we  go  from  there?  That   is   the

imbecility - if you will forgive the expression -

of   this  extraordinary  conduct.  What  is   the

rationale?  Where  is  the logic?  Let  us  forget

decency,  Sir, because it seems  decency  belongs

only to chickens. We are in a house of black belts

and  green  belts and dirty belts - so dirty  that

they are black with dirt, stinking with filth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the meaning of this present resolution?

I  ask  particularly. Sir, of the Opposition Front

Bench  which did not have to dirty its hands - why?

Why  does  it proceed with the illogical absurdity

of  compelling Opposition Members to vote? How are

they  going  to do it? What is the coercive  power

they have? Supposing they pass it. Sir, they have

called upon us, so what? Is there time for us  to

produce  a motion, Mr Speaker, in answer to  this

absurd  and illogical call of the Assembly!  There

is a horrible phrase in the English language which

could  be applied to the People's Action Party  at

this  juncture and it should be most  appropriate.

But, unfortunately, Mr Speaker, I do not think  I

could  hope  to  have  your  attention  adequately

diverted  for  a  sufficient period  in  order  to

permit me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



to  enunciate  it. But I say, why  did  the  Front

Bench of the Opposition have to put their hands to

this filth? Why?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, so they are going to force us who did

not  agree  with the merger proposals in November,

to  say  whether the 144,000 votes plus the  2,000

votes shall belong anywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Speaker, they will have to pass - and I

remind the Front Bench of the Opposition - the first

part,  that  the  2,370  uncertain  ballot  papers

belong  to  A.  Oh,  surely they are  sufficiently

proud  of the result of A without seeking to sully

and  dirty  that result by this cheap stealing  of

2,000  uncertain votes. Why do they want  to  make

themselves  party  to that disgraceful  act?  And

then   they   are  asking  us,  the  Back-benches,

compelling  us, uniquely in history, Mr  Speaker,

the  tyranny  of the majority - not a  question  of

democracy  any  more - this is what we  have  learnt

from  the  People's Action Party, that  democracy

can, in fact, be a tyranny  - a tyranny in between

elections - a disgraceful Fascist tyranny. And  now,

even Fascists would not consider it appropriate to

say  not merely that they will rule, but to  force

you  to  make  a choice which yon do not  want  to

make,  that  you  think is immoral and  dishonest.

Immoral and dishonest because they are not  asking

us to say what we would do, but they are asking us

to put a value on blank votes. [Laughter] It is  a

curious mentality and it seems that there are many

of  them.  It  is  a  curious mentality,  which  I

confess  at this stage is beyond my understanding,

that  can  permit itself laughter at  this  stage.

which  is  the peak of contempt for the democratic

process.  The  democratic  process  allows    the

majority  to rule; it does not allow the  majority

to bully, to brow-beat and insult those who are in

opposition. We, and I felt the Member -  where  was

it,  Sir,  where the gentleman from the  Singapore

People's Alliance said that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Farrer Park, thank you. The Member

for  Farrer  Park, I thought he said he understood

our  repugnance to giving any value to the 144,000

votes. And yet, I would remind the Front Bench



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Opposition, that is what they are  asking

for. They are asking that those blank votes should

be given a value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the United People's Party is

still here. It has not walked out in disgust.  For

myself  the extraordinary lesson of this afternoon

is  not  the continued dishonesty of the  People's

Action Party - I think it has shown through all its

rationalisations  that it is inherently  dishonest

in heart and in soul. It is in truth and in fact a

corkscrew, but what surprises me is that those  on

the  Front Bench of the Opposition who have a  not

unreasonable  hope  of being the  next  Government

should  be dragged into this P.A.P. well of filth,

should  plunge in merrily and be party to  one  of

the  crudest  and  most shameless and  disgraceful

exhibitions  of  the tyranny of democracy  between

elections  when  the majority has no  respect  for

democratic  traditions,  no  respect  for   public

opinion,  no  respect for decency, no respect  for

logic, no respect even for sanity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Go on!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Well, Sir, we have heard a squeak

out  of the Minister for Education. He has  got  a

voice?  I am glad it hurt that much. I thought  he

was dead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I shall not take long because this is not a filibuster. This is merely a protest in

the  strongest  terms a human  being  can  put  in

constitutional and parliamentary language  against

the  disgraceful conduct of the Government and the

Front Bench of the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is not giving way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I shall give them time to answer

it, but I shall tell you this, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

shall watch with interest the continuation of this

shameless, disgraceful and bullying farce  of  the

Front Bench of the Opposition in harmony with  the

Government. I shall vote against it and then, Sir,

they having won. I shall sit here and see how they

can  make  me, how they can compel me to transform

144,000 votes which are blank into votes with  any

meaning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear! Well done!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Are there any other Members

wishing to speak?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Prime Minister has very

little time to reply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No doubt the Member for Tanglin

will give the Prime Minister time to reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am of the opinion that the battle for blank votes

is  really over and that to attempt to carry  it

beyond  this  point means to create more  trouble

for  the  people  of  Singapore.  The  people  of

Singapore have already given their decision in no

uncertain  terms that they are for Malaysia,  and

the numbers in which they voted are such that  it

does  not  really matter now as to how the  blank

votes  are  to be interpreted. But our stand  has

always  been  that blank votes  are  blank.  They

should  mean nothing. They are not protest votes,

Sir.  We  opposed the amendment just now because

they  asked  for an interpretation so that  blank

votes  could  be regarded as protest votes.  Sir,

that  was wrong. We also do not believe that they

should  be  regarded as yes votes,  although  the

Member  for Anson has so interpreted it  that  he

was for Alternative A and yet he would protest by

casting  a  blank  vote.  Sir,  to  people   like

myself - ordinary folks - we are confused, because if

we  are for Alternative A, we must be voting  for

Alternative  A. The blank vote means nothing  and

it should mean nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our stand is that from the start there

should  not have been this manoeuvre and counter-manoeuvre  between the Barisan Sosialis  and  the

P.A.P. Let the people decide and the people  have

now  decided. Let the blank votes be  counted  as

blank,  as having no value whatsoever;  that  has

been our stand, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that after the people have decided in

no uncertain terms for Malaysia, we should now co-operate to make Malaysia a success. We should not

carry  on this bitter fight over blank votes  for

another  few years, making it an election  issue.

We  have  already said - and Members  of  different

Parties  have said too - that this is not a  party

issue, this is not a political issue and that the

victory would not be a party victory for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



Government or for any other Party. On that basis,

Sir,  the people have expressed their wishes;  we

have  to accept their will and we should  try  to

implement  that will. We have already  heard  the

Prime  Minister.  The Minister for  Culture  says

here  that  they  do not regard it  as  a  P.A.P.

victory. Therefore, the Barisan should not regard

it  as  a Barisan defeat. It is the will  of  the

people.  However, Sir, maybe the  Press  have  an

interest in keeping up the fight for the sake  of

publicity  purposes and they have said again  and

again  that this is a P.A.P. victory and  so  on.

Only  yesterday they had a big headline  "P.A.P. - How  we  won".  That  might  have  irritated  the

Barisan  people,  but  in the  interests  of  the

people  of  Malaya,  Singapore  and  Malaysia  we

believe that we should stop this fight over blank

votes.  Blank  votes mean nothing, neither  "yes"

votes  nor  "no" votes. Well, if they are  blank,

let  them be blank, let them not be counted.  But

the  people have decided by 70 per cent that they

want  Malaysia on the lines of Alternative A  and

that  is  the  most important  thing  for  us  in

Singapore and Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I might indicate what is in my

mind.  We  have only 15 minutes left and  I  will

call the Member for Hong Lim if he will take  not

more than five minutes. Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will not

take long. I accept your decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a law passed which compels all voters

to  vote  in  the referendum for the alternatives

being  posed to them - A, B or C - and if  they  do

not  accept any of these alternatives, they  have

the  liberty to put in a protest vote which is  a

blank  vote. Mr Speaker, Sir, today this law  is

introduced  into this Assembly to be  applied  to

Assemblymen. We have been asked to cast our votes

for Alternatives A, B or C, and I would like your

advice, if we cast blank votes here also today by

abstaining,  which means a protest  vote  against

this  motion,  is  there a  Standing  Order  like

section  29  which  would  make  blank  votes  or

"abstain"  votes  of Assemblymen pro-White  Paper

votes?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know what the Member for

Hong  Lim wants. But if he wants guidance, I think

if  he skims through the Standing Orders, he  will

get all the guidance he needs. Mr Prime Minister,

in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In reply. Sir, I am really

grateful  for this afternoon session  for  another

object  lesson for the Member for Tanglin and  the

Member  for Cairnhill. The Member for Anson - the

former    Member   for   Cairnhill - is   a   really

intelligent  man. I grant him that. He  asked  the

really  pertinent question, "If we carry (2),  the

second  limb,  what  can the  Government  in  this

Assembly do?" Force him to vote A, B or C, when he

refuses  to  do so? He is going to stay  here  and

watch. Mr Speaker, Sir. He reminds me of Sherlock

Holmes and Dr Watson. He is Dr Watson, and I got

a  friend  who is Sherlock Holmes and he told  me,

"Do  this  and  the Barisan will  be  embarrassed:

their  tails  will be twisted and  they  will  run

away," and that is exactly what they did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin says, "What a pity:

everybody  has agreed on merger and Malaysia.  Why

are  we quarrelling about blank votes? Let us  all

be  friends.  Let  us  stop this  for  peace,  for

friendship, for moral rearmament." There are  some

people  who believe in real armaments,  not  moral

rearmament, and they have walked out.  The  simple

rules  work,  Mr Speaker. I do not  have  to  say

this;  this  is not ex post facto rationalization.

This was a properly thought-out plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill knows that the

Government  intends to abstain on the second  limb

of   this   motion,  to  give,  not   to   compel,

voluntarily  those Members of the  Opposition  who

opposed  the White Paper a democratic opportunity,

even  at  this  last  moment, to  save  themselves

altogether  from  blank minds and indecision.  Let

them  make up their minds even at this late  hour,

hold  out the hand of friendship to the Federation

amid  to  Borneo, which, if they were  clever  and

magnanimous people, having lost the battle and  if

they  were honest democrats willing to accept  the

verdict of the people, they would do. This is what

I  would  do  if  I  were in their  position,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, having lost the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



fight. I called for blank votes and I lost. I say.

"Well,  all  right, you said I was against  merger

and Malaysia. I shall show you now. I vote for A."

The  Government intended to abstain right from the

beginning on the second limb.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of information, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, but he is not

asking  us  to  vote for A. He  is  asking  us  to

transform 144,000 people's votes which we have  no

right to misread. That is what he is doing. He  is

not  asking us to vote for A. He is asking  us  to

say  that  we  should twist the  protest  vows  of

144,000  people and that we who are  the  trustees

should be dishonest and transform those votes into

A. How can we?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am grateful to the Member

for  Anson. He is the trustee of a portion of  the

144,077 votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan said that his

Party polled 55 per cent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg your pardon. 55 per

cent belongs to the United People's Party, 45  per

cent  is  to be distributed between 14 Members  of

the Barisan Sosialis and the Member for Anson. But

whatever  it is, he has got one, his own  vote.  I

say  to  him,  all  right, if he feels  really  so

terribly  touched at the thought of  a  breach  of

trust,  having  asked the people to throw  protest

votes  at the mode of the referendum, not  at  the

White  Paper,  not at Alternative A,  but  in  the

manner  of the referendum. But had we offered,  he

says,  spring chicken, yes or no on the  menu,  he

would  have  said, "Yes, spring chicken."  But  we

were   fools,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  Like  faithful

servants,  we  turned out and put spring  chicken,

roast  beef, and lamb cutlet. He said, "Take  them

all  away, I am on a hunger strike; blank  votes."

Where  is the logic of it? I said, "Never mind,  I

will  cut  off  from the menu right  now, at  the

eleventh hour, roast beef and lamb cutlet. We will

leave only spring chicken."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Sold out!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no, no, one vote, one

last spring chicken for the Member for Anson. Hold

out  his  hand  in  friendship to  the  people  of

Borneo.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Again I am grateful, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  From time to time the  Member  for

Anson  wants to be a reasonable man. I must  again

consult my Sherlock Holmes on this - the black  belt

fellow - and  he said this to me, the whole  of  the

Government  and the whole of the Opposition  Front

Bench  abstain on the second limb of (2).  We  are

abstaining; we are not compelling anybody to vote.

We are giving the choice and I say, let the Member

for  Anson  state that he is for A, his  one  vote

alone.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir, I

am much obliged. Would the

Prime  Minister in that case amend 144,000  to  1,

and say Alternative A and

I will accept it. [Applause].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Leader of the House has

been  guilty of disorder by applauding. I ask  him

to set an example.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I agree, Mr, speaker, Sir, I

am  even  prepared  to  make  it  three  to  other

Members. If there are takers I will make-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Good.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I pull the House up to order?

The  House  has already decided these words  shall

remain, there can be no further amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir. Sir, I

must  plead. There are moments for jest, but  this

is  not  the  moment for jest. I say this  in  all

seriousness,  that it does make a difference.  The

Member for Anson says he cast a blank vote because

he  protested  against  the  mode  and  manner  of

merger.  He  is  not prepared, logically,  as  the

trustee  of the portion of the 144,000  who  voted

with him against the mode and manner of merger, to

utilise   in  any  way  their  blank  votes   for

supporting A, but he is prepared to use  his  vote

openly  here  to  support A. I am saying,  in  all

seriousness, at the end of these proceedings,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



this Report   and  the  votes  will  be  read  in   the

Federation and in the Borneo territories. I am not

saying this in jest, Sir, It is not meant to bring

this  House into a disorderly Chamber. May  I  Mr

Speaker, Sir, with your permission, seek leave  of

this House to amend 144,077 to 1 ?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that the only amendment, Mr

Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To change the figure

"144,077" to "1". Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> To decide?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, and to decide for

Alternative A.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you, allocated to Alternative A.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All right allocated to

Alternative A. [Laughter]. No, no, do not laugh.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Speaker must be very

dull,  but  it  seems  to me  that  if  the  Prime

Minister's  amendments  are  to  be  allowed,  the

motion  will read "that one unmarked ballot  paper

should be decided in accordance with the wishes of

those  Opposition  Assemblymen  who  opposed   the

amended  White  Paper merger proposals  and  calls

upon them to allocate that vote to Alternative A."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, indeed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am in the hands of the House, but

it seems to be a farcical suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that I must- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not as yet ruled. The

relevant Standing Order. Standing Order 39 - I  have

read these paragraphs before - paragraph (5) is  the

relevant paragraph, the last part, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`provided that no amendment may be moved which

relates  to  any  words  which  the  Assembly  or

Committee  has decided shall not be left  out  of

the motion.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



That is under that Standing Order, but, as I say, I am

in the hands of the Assembly. Under Standing Order 99:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A question the object or effect of which may be to

suspend  any Standing Order of the Assembly shall  be

proposed  only either after notice given or after  the

expression of the general assent of the Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the way to do that, I suppose, is for the

Prime  Minister to ask for leave - that notwithstanding

Standing Order 39 paragraph (5), he begs leave of  the

House to move his amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I so request in the terms you

have stated.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If it is the pleasure of hon. Members

that the amendment be moved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Could I make a statement?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member against the motion being

moved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, that is all. The amendment cannot

be moved and there can be no debate about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It was a useful intervention, we

thought, at the time the Member for Anson moved.  That

is  a lesson to be learnt. Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

people who do not want it at all costs and will  fight

it.  If  it  were not blank ballots, they would  fight

about  blank  minds. They will fight for the  sake  of

lighting until they establish a Communist State.  That

is what they are after. I say this. This afternoon the

House  has  many moods. It is a serious  session,  Mr

Speaker, Sir. We had a solemn moment when we paid  a

tribute  to our lost friend. We were moved to laughter

and  mirth  and merriment partly because  we  did  not

laugh  or cry at the stupidity and the tinge of lunacy

of  it  all. This is a sparring ring where  there  are

Members inside who do not play according to the rules.

So   we   did  it  in  the  way  we  did -  the  simple

straightforward approach - even at the last  moment  to

allow the Member for Anson one vote to make his stand,

the Member for Hong Lim on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



technical procedural point, not because we can win the

democracy of the Member for Hong Lim in preventing the

Member for Anson at this last-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister is out of

order. He is criticising a Member who has not given

his assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Never mind, but that is what it

really  amounts  to. Sir, this House has  Members  who

have not the slightest intention to fight according to

the constitutional rules of the game, and let us never

forget this. As we go into recess, when we meet  again

in  the next few months, let us gird ourselves for new

struggles ahead. I am sorry to say this to the  Member

for  Tanglin, but his hope of a peaceful future is not

on  the  cards with the absent Members running  around

outside.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it then that it is the

wish of the House that there should be a separate vote

on (1) and a separate vote on (2) ?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well then, I will put the Question on

the first part. The Question is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly takes note of the Report of the

Superintendent of the Singapore National Referendum as

contained  in  Paper Cmd.18 of 1962 and in  accordance

with  section 29 of the Singapore National  Referendum

Ordinance,  1962, that the House decides  that  2,370

uncertain ballot papers should be deemed to  be  votes

for Alternative A as indicated in the ballot paper.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the first part of the motion

accordingly agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question new is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly takes note of the Report of

the   Superintendent  of  the  Singapore  National

Referendum as contained in Paper Cmd. 18  of  1962

and in accordance with section 29 of the Singapore

National  Referendum  Ordinance,  1962,  that  the

House  decides that 144,077 unmarked ballot papers

should be decided in accordance with the wishes of

those  Opposition  Assemblymen  who  opposed   the

amended  White  Paper merger proposals  and  calls

upon  them  to decide to which of the Alternatives

A, B and C the blank votes should be allocated.".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation,



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, certainly, Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As I have said, we intend to

abstain  on this part of the motion. Could  I  ask

you,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, whether  the  Member  for

Anson would by abstaining on this, indicate that

he would have liked his one vote to go to A?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think I could ask the

Member  for Anson to do that, but I think it  will

be  in the Official Report. As many as are of that

opinion, say aye? To the contrary, say no?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir, If there is not a single  voice saying aye,

Sir, the proposition is lost.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Certainly not. I think the Member

for  Anson is wrong there. I have asked, "As  many

as are of that opinion, say aye," and there was no

response. As many as are of that opinion, say no?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the "Noes" have it.





<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Division, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Take a division.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>(At this stage, the Member for Anson rose.)</i></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is the time when no

Member may go out.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>(The Member for Anson took a seat.)</i></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to apologise to the Member

for Anson. The doors have not yet been locked.  He

is entitled to walk out.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you, Sir. Good-night, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again put, "That the House decides that 144,077 unmarked

ballot papers should be decided in accordance with

the  wishes  of those Opposition Assemblymen, who
