<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That the following Address in reply to the speech of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore, express our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara for the speech which he delivered on behalf

of the Government at the opening of the present

session of this Assembly.".'.-(The Deputy Prime Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2583</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the Member for Bras Basah completed

her speech?



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to continue from where I left off

yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Stamford made certain

allegations  in  regard to women's problems.  I  would

like to ask her whether what she said came really from

her  heart.  She should not have made such allegations

because  she  knows  full well that  women's  problems

cannot  be  solved in a very short space of  time  and

that  they are related to the general problems of  our

society.  A division in the Left-wing camp is  not  in

anybody's  interest and it can only be  favourable  to

the British colonial rulers who can then prolong their

colonial rule and influence here, because we know they

are rather cunning and wish to preserve their prestige

and  position here, and they will adopt all  means  to

achieve  this  objective.  Therefore,  we  should   be

careful to see that we are not fooled by them. I  wish

to tell them that if they dare dream of resuming their

good  old  times  here,  we will  unite  together  and

struggle against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also appeal to Members of the Barisan Sosialis not

to  smear  the  P.A.P. and accuse  it  of  working  in

collusion with the British colonialists. If  they  see

any mistakes and defects in us, then

they  should  point them out so as  to  enable  us  to

rectify  them  in  the interest and happiness  of  the

people  of  Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  is  our

hope.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bras Basah says that  the

P.A.P. has  been against colonial rule. But  we  have

found  that the leadership of the P.A.P. are  not  the

type who does such things. Outwardly they want to show

that  they  are anti-colonial fighters but,  in  fact,

they  are closely associated with the colonialists.  I

know this because I was with them for more than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2584</b></font><br><br>



two  years.  From what I saw of them  and  from  their

words and actions, I came to know them well. They only

preach without putting into effect what they say, That

is  why today they are in such a sad position. If  the

leadership want to obtain freedom and rights  for  the

people  of  Singapore from the colonialists,  we  will

support  them  in this struggle. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

wish  to  touch on the many broadcasts that the  Prime

Minister has put over Radio Singapore. It appears that

Radio Singapore has now become a propaganda instrument

of  the  P.A.P. Today the leadership of the P.A.P. do

not dare face the people to explain their policies  on

merger  and  on other aspects. They have to  hide  now

behind  radio forums to tell, their stories.  But  the

people  have  lost faith in them. Whenever  the  Prime

Minister  is  heard over the Radio, the people  switch

off  their  radios  or they tune  in  to  other  radio

stations to listen to other programmes. In his several

broadcasts  over Radio Singapore, the  Prime  Minister

told  the people certain stories, but the people  lost

interest in them. So his broadcasts have had no effect

on  the  people because they found many contradictions

in  them. In his second talk he said that many of  the

Communists   are   from   the  Chinese-educated.   His

intention was to smear the Chinese-educated and to get

the Malay-educated, the English-educated or the Indian-educated  to  be  suspicious of the  Chinese-educated.

This is very irresponsible. Why did the Prime Minister

say in his twelve talks that there are also Communists

in the English-educated -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now debating the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech and the Government's policy as

contained  in  that  speech.  We  are  certainly   not

debating any broadcasts made by the Prime Minister. If

the hon. Member can indicate which part of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's speech has particular  reference  to

these broadcasts, then I will let him continue. If  he

cannot, then, of course, he is completely irrelevant,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2585</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

did touch on the Prime Minister's broadcasts over

Radio Singapore. It is because Radio Singapore is

under the control of the Ministry of Culture. However,

Radio Singapore should serve the purpose of the people

and not the purpose of a political Party. That is why

I feel it necessary to point out that the PAP, has

been using Radio Singapore for its own interests. And

that is why I touched on it just now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Up to that point, the hon. Member

is  perfectly in order. But if he debates the  details

of those broadcasts, then he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

P.A.P.  Government has been saying that it is  a  pro-labour  Government. It has been telling this to people

everywhere.  Let  us see whether it  is  correct.  The

Government  told us that it cancelled the registration

of  four  trade union federations because it  was  the

decision of the Internal Security Council. But  lately

I  have found out that this is not correct because the

decision to cancel the registration of the four  trade

union  federations was not from the Internal  Security

Council  but from the Government itself.  It  is  only

because  the  Government was  afraid  of  the  growing

strength  of  the  workers, and that the  trade  union

movement would be a danger to their political position

and  power that they took such a decision Recently the

Government  resorted  to action against  the  workers.

This  kind  of  act  is not different  from  what  the

colonialists  did  in  the  past.  Let  me  give  some

examples. For instance, the strike at Robinson's. When

it  took  place the Government used the police against

the  workers.  Some  of  the  staff  of  the  People's

Association protested against certain of their members

being  sacked.  They staged a strike.  They  protested

against  the  unreasonable action by  the  authorities

concerned,   and  against  the  People's   Association

engaging new workers. For these two reasons, they went

on  strike. But the P.A.P. Government warned them that

if they were not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2586</b></font><br><br>



loyal  to  the P.A.P. Government, then they  would  be

sacked.  This  is  not correct because  the  People's

Association  has  its own constitution  and  is  main

tained by public funds, and much of these funds comes

from -





<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Point of order. The Member seems to be reading

like a parrot!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member seems to

be  referring to his notes rather too much. But if  he

is  going into the details of the People's Association

strike, then again he is out of order for two reasons.

The  first  is  that that does not cover  the  general

debate on Government policy, and, secondly, I think we

have  had  an assurance that there is going  to  be  a

Commission  of Inquiry into the People's  Association.

It  is  perhaps too premature for the Members to raise

these points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I was only referring to the fact that the

People's  Association was established  by  the  public

through elections by this Assembly. Therefore, it is a

public  organisation. The P.A.P. has no right to  make

use of this organisation for its own purposes. That is

why I mention the strike there. It is necessary for me

to point out the cause of this strike and to show that

though the Government has claimed to be pro-labour, it

is, in fact, not so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. As I have indicated, we are now

on  Government  policy. The hon. Member  is  perfectly

correct  when he mentions the People's Association  in

the  context, as he alleges, that it is being used  by

the  Government. But when he goes into details  as  to

why  there was a strike - or a so-called strike - and  why

the  police  were used, then I think he is  going  far

away  from  the  debate  which is  permitted  on  this

Address. We are only dealing with Government policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Because the Ministers

of  the  P.A.P. have denied that there has  been  any

strike in the People's Association, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2587</b></font><br><br>



is why I have to point out that in the report from the

Ministry  of  Labour  it is clearly  stated  that  the

strike  at  the  People's  Association  has  not  been

resolved.  I will ask the Minister to explain  whether

or  not  there  has  been  a strike  at  the  People's

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the anti-labour policy of the

P.A.P. Government is becoming clearer day by day. This

can  be  seen  from  its actions and  attitude  toward

several   strikes  recently.  The  Public  Daily-Rated

Employees'  Unions  Federation  truly  represents  the

workers  in Government departments. Then why will  the

Government  not  recognise  it  and  claim  that  only

A.U.P.E. can represent these workers? By this, can the

Government  promote  industrial  peace  and  give  any

benefit to the workers? The strike by the Public Daily-Rated    Employees'   Unions   Federation   and    its

consequences, which caused much inconvenience  to  the

people,  should  be  borne  by  the  Government.   The

Government,  on  the one hand, says that  it  is  pro-labour  but, on the other hand, it engages new workers

to  replace the workers on strike and has been helping

the   employers  who  are  doing  such   things.   The

Government also used the police and military personnel

to deal with the strikers, and used the police to beat

up the workers. Are all these things what a pro-labour

Government  can  do? During the strike  we  could  see

military personnel stationed at every street corner as

though they were taking precautions against an enemy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Point of order. Is all this

really relevant to the motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the hon. Member is indicating

that  the  Government policy in using  police  against

strikers  is not a policy to be advocated. He  cannot,

of course, go into details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): And to stop traffic

and  people  from  crossing the roads.  Is  this  the

behaviour of the so-called pro-labour Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government professes

that  it adopts the policy of equal treatment for  all

streams of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2588</b></font><br><br>



education,  but  in  the  past  two  years  have  they

received  the  same equal treatment?  How  many  Malay

schools, Chinese schools, and Indian schools have been

opened by the Government? The Government has not  only

not   promoted  vernacular  education  and  has   also

obstructed its growth. Let me cite one example to show

this.  Recently  in  Pasir Panjang  at  the  4th  m.s.

Labrador  School  was opened by the  Government.  This

school  originally was a Tamil school and the  playing

field also belonged to this Tamil school. But now this

site  is being occupied by an English school.  On  one

side  of  the  road,  the land is being  used  by  an

English  school, and on the other side  the  land  has

been  used for building a hall for an English  school.

Are  these examples of equal treatment for all streams

of  education? In such a small area as Pasir Panjang,

the  Government  has opened five English  Schools  but

there is only one Indian school. Moreover, this Indian

school  was not built by the Government. It was  built

by  the  Indians who live there. It is an aided Indian

School.  There is only one Chinese school there.  This

Chinese School is not a Government Chinese School.  It

is  an  aided  school. There is only one Malay  school

there.  Therefore, from this we can see that  the  so-called  equal  treatment for all streams of  education

means giving aid to English schools only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in May this year, there was

unfortunately  a big fire at Bukit Ho  Swee.  In  this

fire, tens of thousands of people lost their homes and

their  property. At that time the people of  Singapore

demonstrated their co-operative spirit and their  love

of  mankind by giving whatever they had to the victims

in  order  to relieve them. Now after half a year  the

problems  of these fire victims are still not settled.

Who   should  bear  this  responsibility?  I  believe

everyone  will be able to answer that. The  Government

should  be  held  responsible  for  not  solving   the

problems of the fire victims. The Government  has  not

carried out its pledge to help the fire victims.  What

the Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2589</b></font><br><br>



and  the Minister for National Development pledged  to

the victims has not been carried out. Mr Speaker, the

Government has departed from its policy of helping the

fire  victims. In the first P.A.P. pamphlet, on page  6,

the  first  line states it very clearly. Many  of  the

victims of the Kampong Tiong Bahru fire will tell  you

that  they are very eager to have a piece of  land  so

that they can engage in their secondary production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what the P.A.P. has said has all

been  forgotten  by it. It is true  that  it  is  very

difficult to give every fire victim a piece  of  land.

But  has  the Government seriously studied the housing

problem  of  the  fire victims of the  Bukit  Ho  Swee

fire?  The answer is no. Every fire victim will  tell

you that the house rent is very high. The fire victims

cannot afford to pay it. Most of the houses are of the

expensive  type  and the rental is  high.  People  who

belong to the lower income group cannot afford to  pay

this  high rental. When the fire occurred, these  fire

victims were forced by the Government to move into the

new flats. The house rent is as follows - $40 for a one-room flat, and $55 for a two-room flat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member must have

been  here  when we discussed details of  this  nature

during the debate on the Estimates. I do not think  he

should  go  over all these details again to  make  his

point.  But  in making his point, he can  say  that  a

debate on this matter took place during the Estimates,

and that he does not wish to go into details again. We

cannot have repetitions of this nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, for

the  purpose  of  the record, I hope I  can  touch  in

detail on the plight of the fire victims. I would like

to  know whether you, Mr Speaker, Sir, will allow  me

to do so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It will be, I think, completely full of

details when we publish our Hansard. I think the  hon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The request by the

fire victims has not been answered by the Government.

The Government has not taken any clear-cut action in

dealing with this matter. I hope it will give a very

clear-cut answer to all the fire victims' requests,

and take practical measures to help them resolve their

difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the people of Singapore are today facing all kinds of misfortunes. Tens of thousands of people are now in difficulties. For instance, the 25,000

dwellers  in Toa Payoh are facing the threat of  being

evicted.  The authorities concerned have not indicated

what  would  be their compensation and their  fate  in

future.  There  are also a few hundred families  along

the  West  Coast  Road  who have  been  asked  by  the

Government  to remove, because the Government  intends

to  build  a  road there. Also the farmers  living  in

Kampong Kembangan have suffered from flooding and have

incurred  a  great  loss. But the Government  has  not

taken  any  steps  to  deal with  these  matters.  The

Government,  if  it  is  a  responsible  one,   should

negotiate  and  talk  with the  people  concerned.  It

should  discuss  with  their representatives  and  the

organisations  of the people with a  view  to  solving

their problems. But the Government is disregarding all

this  and is leaving the people in the lurch. Yet,  on

the  other  hand,  the  Government  is  talking  about

development,  serving the people, how to benefit  them

and to improve their welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government has promised

to  help  the  fishermen  in various  ways,  such  as

helping  them to buy motor-boats and fishing equipment

and  all  kinds  pf necessities. But I would  ask  the

Government this how many fishermen has it helped?  It

has  also  promised  to help them organised  into  co-operative   societies.  How  many  such   co-operative

societies  have been formed as a result of  help  from

the  Government? Has the livelihood of the  fishermen

living  in  Pasir Panjang, Jurong, Katong  and  Siglap

been  improved or helped in any way by the Government?

Many of them are still semi-unemployed. Why is it that

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2591</b></font><br><br>



are  in  this  present predicament? It is because  the

P.A.P. has increased the tax on petrol so  that  they

have to spend more when buying petrol. Every time they

go out to sea to fish, they will have to spend several

dollars  on petrol, irrespective of whether  they  can

get  any catch or not. In fact, they can hardly  catch

any  fish  at all. The Malay fishermen are  suffering.

Their livelihood is in a predicament. I would ask  the

Government whether it is prepared to help them to  buy

motor-boats.  In  fact,  the  P.A.P.  Government   has

forgotten  about  this.  The  Minister  for   National

Development has also forgotten about this.  They  have

forgotten  what  they  have promised  in  the  P.A.P.

pamphlet  entitled, "The P.A.P. Five-Year Plan."  They

have  entirely  disregarded  and  neglected  the  poor

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

situation the P.A.P. faced in 1959 and before that was

different  from  the situation which  the  P.A.P. now

faces.  Sir,  this  change in the political  scene  is

quick,  but it is expected. Sir, we see the  rise  and

fall  of  the P.A.P. In 1959 and 1960 we saw  how  the

P.A.P. bullied the Opposition Members of the S.P.A. In

1961, Sir, we see how the P.A.P. Government works hand

in  hand  with the S.P.A. members. Why is it that  the

political  scene outside and inside this Assembly  has

changed?  It  is  because the  P.A.P.  Government  has

changed  its political ideology, from Left  to  Right,

and because the P.A.P. Government has no sincerity  in

carrying  out  its promises. Sir, the  P.A.P. leaders

have  swallowed  all  their promises  which  they  put

before the people during the general elections. Sir, I

shall  now  comment  on  certain  departments  of  the

Government  to  show you how the P.A.P. has  swallowed

its  promises. Sir, I come to the questions of  profit

tax and roads. I would like to bring these matters  to

the  attention  of  the Government. They  concern  the

lives of the people living in the rural areas. Some of

the  assessment  rates in the rural  areas  have  been

increased  unreasonably.  Their  Assemblymen,  or  the

persons affected, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2592</b></font><br><br>



lodged their complaints with the department concerned,

but  as  usual  there is no reply. Sir,  how  can  the

relationship between the people and the civil servants

be improved? The promise of the P.A.P. at first was to

serve the poor people, but when they came to form  the

government, they taxed the poor people first.  If  the

Government wants to construct any new kampong  road's,

it  should bear in mind that the constituencies of the

Opposition  Party  Assemblymen also need  new  kampong

roads.  I  would  like  to  remind  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Deputy Prime Minister, who  is  also

the  Chairman of the Urban and Rural Services Advisory

Council,  that  the  Council has  approved  a  sum  of

$65,000  to metal the Koh Seck Lim Road in  the  Bedok

Resettlement area. It was unanimously approved by  the

Council in January this year under the chairmanship of

the  Member for Upper Serangoon. The present Chairman,

the  hon.  Member for Tampines, and I and  some  other

P.A.P. Assemblymen who are on the Opposite side,  were

members  of the Council. Sir, the work of this Council

is  very  important.  Any  project  approved  by  this

Council must be carried out and work on the project is

usually started immediately after the approval of  the

Council. Now it is already one year and the Government

seems  to have no intention to metal the Koh Seck  Lim

Road.  Sir,  the  Bedok Resettlement area  is  densely

populated;  many  vehicles  move  along  the  laterite

roads. The place becomes very dusty and you can see  a

thick layer of dust covering everything, in houses and

shops. The Ministers may not believe it, because  they

have  never seen any laterite roads. Sir, this is  not

the  attitude the Government should take because I  am

on this  side. That is why they refuse to metal  the

road.  Sir,  during the general elections, the  P.A.P.

said - and  I  quote  from  "Speakers'  Notes  on  Trade

Unions":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As the political status of Singapore changes from

that of a Colony to that of a self-governing State, so

must the present colonial economy change to that of  a

national one.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2593</b></font><br><br>



It continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the past 140 years our colonial economy was

based on the export of cheap raw materials to Imperial

England  and the selling of its expensive manufactured

products in the country. This gives employment to  the

people  in  England  and  so  loss  of  capital   from

Singapore and Malaya.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is what the P.A.P. said during the

election.  Sir, the economic status of  Singapore  has

remained  the  same under the P.A.P.'s rule  for  2½

years, and the situation has turned from had to worse.

Today  we  can see not only Imperial England but  also

Imperial Japan and Imperial America.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. also said during the last election - Sir, I am quoting from "Speakers' Notes" printed by

the P.A.P. Propaganda Committee.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I hope there is no confusion in the mind

of  any  Member.  "Speakers' Notes" do  not  mean  the

Speaker's notes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, the title of these Notes says

"Speakers' Notes on Trade Unions" and not your notes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Was that a pamphlet which was published

for the use of the public?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, then, the hon. Member is

completely wrong in quoting from those notes  if  they

are only notes, but he can paraphrase, of course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, these notes were published

for  P.A.P.  Assemblymen to speak during  the  general

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Oh!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Give me a copy!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is probably a very desirable

objective.  But  what I am indicating  is  that  those

notes cannot be quoted verbatim in this Assembly. What

the hon. Member can do is just to paraphrase. Say this

is what the Member was asked to say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2594</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, the P.A.P. said during the

election  that  the right of dismissal should  not  be

absolute.  The employer must give just and  reasonable

grounds before sacking an employee. The P.A.P. has now

become the Government and has also become the employer

of  Government  servants. It sacks the  staff  of  the

People's   Association,  parking  attendants,   school

servants, members of the Work Brigade, without  giving

any  reasons. Sir, is it just and reasonable,  as  the

P.A.P. Government calls it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. also said, "We will strengthen the trade

unions  by  legislating for compulsory recognition  of

unions and cancellation of yellow unions." Sir,  where

is  the legislation? The P.A.P. blamed the S.P.A. and

the  colonial regime for not taking care of our  youth

except  to educate them to respect the colonial power.

It  also said that no effort was made to encourage and

educate youth to take a serious interest in our social

and political problems, for that was the last thing  a

colonial  and reactionary government wanted.  In  2½

years  of  office, has the P.A.P. Government made  any

change?  No. Not the slightest change, Sir. It follows

the colonial and S.P.A. style of work. Does the P.A.P.

Government encourage our youth to take an interest  in

political  problems,  in  that  when  they  apply  for

government   jobs  they  have  to  be  questioned   by

Government  officers  which  political  Parties   they

join?  Is that the way to encourage our youths,  when

they  want to apply for jobs as teachers? Or  if  they

wish  to  be  elected to sit on the school  management

committee  they have to face Government  officers  and

answer  in  what  past  political  events  they   have

participated?  Sir, this is the way  to  suppress  the

thinking of our youth and not to encourage it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government is very fond of accusing

other people of causing trouble, but it is itself  who

is making trouble. The P.A.P. Government cannot fulfil

its  promise  made in the last general elections.  The

P.A.P.  Government  said - and I quote,  Sir,  from  the

notes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> "Speakers' Notes"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated that the

hon.  Member  cannot  quote from those  notes.  He  can

paraphrase them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, the P.A.P. said, as long as

the  Government of the Federation continues  to  ignore

the  existence of Nanyang University, although  60  per

cent  of  its  students are from  the  Federation,  the

Singapore  Government will have to bear  the  financial

burden  of  maintaining  two  Universities,  i.e.,  the

University of Singapore and Nanyang University. This is

what  the P.A.P. promised during the elections and this

promise  can be fulfilled without difficulty,  but  the

P.A.P. Government does not want to do that. Instead  it

asks for unreasonable demands from Nanyang University.

The  Government  attempts, in many ways,  to  interfere

with  the  autonomy of Nan Ta and prevent its progress,

because  it  refuses to give financial aid on  the  one

hand and, on the other hand, it criticises the academic

standard  of Nan Ta without giving any help.  Sir,  the

problems  of  recognising Nan Ta degrees  and  granting

financial aid to Nanyang University have been purposely

delayed and prolonged. The Government must realise that

it  has  contributed  nothing to the  construction  and

expansion   of   Nanyang  University.  Therefore,   the

Government  cannot  cry for unreasonable  demands  from

this University. Equal treatment will also be judged by

the  way  the Government is going to solve the problems

of  Nan  Ta. The Government must open classes for  non-English  school students in the Singapore  Polytechnic.

The  other  languages should also be used as  media  of

instruction. This is part of the equal treatment, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the curriculum in the English secondary schools

has been designed to dovetail with the Cambridge School

Certificate   and   the   Higher   School   Certificate

examinations. These examinations are set by  a  foreign

examination syndicate to suit the educational



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2596</b></font><br><br>



needs  of  children elsewhere. The P.A.P. promised  to

change  it.  Sir, from the Notes the P.A.P. said  that

local examination syndicates will be formed to organise

and  set examinations for both elementary and secondary

schools.  Two  and a half years have gone  by  and  the

promise  of  the  P.A.P. has also gone by.  The  P.A.P.

Government  has no intention to abolish  the  Cambridge

Examination  Syndicate. It is a shame  to  our  country

that  our  examination  papers  have  to  be  set   and

corrected by foreigners living thousands of miles away.

Sir,  we have the men to do the job, and the Government

knows it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In criticising the educational policy of the colonial

regime  the P.A.P. said that thousands who have  failed

to  enter secondary schools are thrown into the  street

without  fitting themselves for any specific employment

owing  to  the general nature of their education.  They

leave  school  because,  firstly,  there  is  an  acute

shortage  of places in secondary schools and, secondly,

because  secondary  education is  not  free.  They  are

unable to continue for financial reasons. This is  what

the  P.A.P. said during the election. But  the  P.A.P.

Government   is   still   implementing   the   colonial

educational policy. It makes no attempt to  change  it.

According to what the P.A.P. said above, the P.A.P. would

give  free education to secondary school students  when

it  came  to  power,  but  the P.A.P. gives  not  free

education -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> On a

point of order. Would the Member for Changi say exactly

in  which  Part it is said that the P.A.P. would  grant

free secondary education?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is hardly a point of order. The

Minister will be able to reply. Mr Teo Hock Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> But the Government does not give

free education for secondary education. Instead it  has

raised the school fees of the secondary schools from $3

to $4.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2597</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, concerning the teaching of Asian languages,

the P.A.P. said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is a falling in the number of hours

devoted  to the teaching of Asian languages  until

it   is  completely  left  out  at  Higher  School

Certificate level. This is ridiculous in an  Asian

country  and  especially  so  when  virtually  all

pupils  are  Asians whose contacts and experiences

are with Asians.'



<br><br>The  P.A.P could say very beautiful words when  it

was  not  in power. It is now in power,  but  what

does  it  do?  The national language, the  Chinese

language and the Tamil language are not compulsory

subjects  in English schools, whereas the  English

language is a compulsory subject in all schools in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1959 All-Party Report on Chinese

Education,  it  recommended the malayanisation  of

text-books   used  in  schools.  In  the   general

election, the P.A.P. accused the former Government

of  not being able to produce a single book  which

was  malayanised. But the P.A.P.  Government  also

cannot  produce a single book in its 2½  years  of

office.  Many  aided  schools  apply  for  capital

grants,  but they still cannot get them.  This  is

because  the  school which applies for  a  capital

grant  has  not got enough money required  by  the

dollar   for  dollar  regulation.  Many   schools,

especially  primary  schools,  have  not  got  the

required   sum   of  money  in  hand   and   their

applications are therefore rejected. As a  result,

schools  cannot be extended. There is no money  to

repair classrooms and they have to be closed down.

Other  minor  repairs and the buying of  equipment

cannot be carried out. I suggest to the Government

that  the  capital  grant  regulations  should  be

amended  so as to lessen the difficulties  of  the

schools when they apply for capital grants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many school teachers have complained that

they are overworked, especially those teaching  in

the secondary schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Including yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> No. I am teaching in a primary

school.  Yes,  they overworked. Only the  teachers

know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2598</b></font><br><br>



that   because  of  overwork,  the   standard   of

education is affected. Due to overwork, the health

of  the teachers, the marking of exercises and the

teaching  of  lessons  are affected.  I  hope  the

Minister for Education will pay attention  to  the

complaints and employ more teachers to settle  the

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. criticises the colonialists by

saying  that in colonial days the Chinese  schools

were left alone to fend for themselves without any

government  aid.  It continues  to  say  that  the

frustration  among the Chinese school students  is

due  to  lack of funds, poor salaries for teachers

and  no  outlet  for students who  pass  out  from

schools.  Yes,  this is right, it was  the  P.A.P.

which  knew the mistakes made by past Governments,

but it is also the P.A.P. Government which follows

the policy of past Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that many schools cannot get capital

grants.  The  allowances  of  teachers  were  cut.

Chinese   school   students   still   cannot   get

Government  jobs  because their  English  is  very

poor,  and  many Nanyang University graduates  are

still  unemployed. The Government  said  that  the

past  colonial educational system would be changed

to  that of a national system which should also be

unified, but to our regret, a paper promise of the

P.A.P. is  always a paper promise. The Government

intends  to  change the Chinese school educational

system  into  a  new system based on  the  English

educational system: that is, from three  years  of

Junior Middle III and three years of Senior Middle

III to four years of Lower Secondary and two years

of  Upper  Secondary education. Without consulting

the  Chinese  educational bodies,  the  Government

implemented  the  policy this  year.  Unacceptable

conditions   were   laid   down   without    prior

consultation.  Sir, the Government only  consulted

them  after so much trouble had been created.  The

Government  now  says that the school  authorities

concerned can choose either the 3:3 or 4:2 system.

It  is  an  act to split our national system.  The

Government must realise that it must seek



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2599</b></font><br><br>



advice from others. If they had done that, there would

not have been so much unrest.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for  Jalan Kayu said in this  House  yesterday

that  the  Government has done nothing and that  there

has  been  no  development in the rural areas.  May  I

remind him, Sir, that he was a member of the Urban and

Rural  Services Advisory Council? He knows  very  well

what the Government has done in the rural areas. Now I

would  just like to detail some of the work which  the

Government has carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 20 miles of kampong roads in the rural

areas  were  constructed  at  an  estimated  cost   of

$400,000 during 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roads completed include Jalan Hwi Yoh, Boh Sua

Tian  Road,  Yew  Teck Village, the kampong  roads  at

Geylang, the Malay Farm, Koh Sek Lim Road, the end  of

Jalan Eunos, Ponggol Road, Kampong Loyang, the road to

the  community centre at Bukit Panjang, Track  11  Lim

Chu Kang Road, and West Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16,320 feet of roadside drains all over the rural

areas  at   an   estimated cost  of  $90,000   were

constructed during this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drains at the following places were lined:

Yio  Chu Kang  Road  10 m.s.,  Sembawang Road 12½  m.s.  (Chong Pang  Village), Jalan Kayu Post Office, Thomson  Road,

Airport Road, Changi Road 6¾ m.s., Tampines Road,  Ama

Keng  Village, Lam San, Woodlands and Jurong  Road,  9

and 10 m.s.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 bus shelters were erected at various places at a

cost of $17,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roadside railings were constructed at the following

roads at an approximate cost of $27,000:

<pre>

          Mandai Road (Sembawang junction)

          Sembawang Road near Jalan Ulu Seletar

          Thomson Road 5-6 m.s.

          Sembawang Road end

          Siglap Road 6¼ m.s.

          Yio Chu Kang Road 5¾ m.s.

          Upper Bukit Timah Road 8 m.s.

          Woodlands Road 15¾ m.s.

          Jurong Road 7¼ m.s.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 16,000 feet of footpaths were

constructed  at a cost of $103,000. The work  includes

the  covering  of open drains at crowded places  i.e.,

the  Paya  Lebar Police Station, the Lim Tua Tow  Road

market and Yio Chu Kang Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Footpaths were also constructed at Jalan Eunos, Paya

Lebar  Road (mosque), Yio Chu Kang Road 10 m.s., Jalan

Kayu,  Sembawang  Road  13½  m.s.,  Hillside  Drive,

Thomson  Road, Jurong Road, West Coast Road,  Clementi

Road and Bukit Timah/Bukit Batok.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that few standpipes and few

footpaths  were  constructed. This is  to  bluff  the

people.  I have listed all these just to show  whether

he is bluffing the people or whether the Government is

bluffing the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87 new standpipes at an estimated cost of $209,500

were installed at various places in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> More than the Mayor

ever did!



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, $209,500 has

been spent on just a "few" standpipes! The Member  for

Jalan  Kayu thinks that these standpipes are  made  of

bamboo!   But   the  stand-pipes  installed   by   the

Government  are made of steel. You have been  lazy  in

your kampong, in your constituency -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Speaker's kampong is Kampong

Whitley. I am quite satisfied with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> I mean that the Member for Jalan

Kayu  is  too  lazy  to  come out  and  see  what  the

Government has done. Instead he comes to this House to

crow.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2601</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of the 87 new standpipes,

including the laying of 4" mains at the following

places, is as follows:





<pre>

                                                          $

         Jalan Puay Poon, Changi Road                  33,750



         Jalan Teban off Tampines Road                  6,500



         Joo Koon School area at Jurong Road 17¾ m.s    7,000

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</pre>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laying of a 9" main at the new link road

from  West  Coast Road to Jurong  Road  has  been

approved. A sum of $35,000 was paid to  the  City

Council  for  the supply of water  by  wagons  to

various  parts of the rural areas during the  dry

spell.  Can  the  Member then say,  "Just  a  few

standpipes!" It would then mean just a few  drops

of water carried by wagons to the rural areas. He

is  a wonderful man, something like a whale which

can carry plenty of water! He is speaking rubbish

in  this  House. I am not telling  lies.  I  have

brought  out  the  facts to prove  whether  I  am

telling the truth or lies.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Parliamentary

Secretary   knows  that  the   word   "lies"   is

unparliamentary,  but since he  has  used  it  of

himself,  I cannot rule it to be unparliamentary.

But  he  must  not use that word in  relation  to

another Member.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he said

untrue  things. I say that they are not lies  but

they are not true.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the laying of a 9" main from West Coast

Road  to  Jurong Road has been approved. This  is

just a correction. I am sorry, Mr Speaker, as  I

overlooked it when I was talking to you. Work  on

the  electrification of various kampongs  in  the

rural  areas  is  well in hand.  The  electricity

supply  at Kampong Chai Chee, Bulim, Lam San  and

Keat   Hong  Villages  is  being  made  available

through  a  subsidy  given  by  Government.   The

Government  is spending a lot of money  on  these

villages,  and yet they said, "Nothing  has  been

done."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2602</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work in other villages such as Andrews Avenue,

Jalan  Kaki  Bukit,. Holy Innocents' Lane,  West

Coast  Road  (7½ m.s. to 8 m.s.).  Gulega  Road,

Florence  Road,  and Lorong Low Koon  is  almost

complete.   327   public  street   lights   were

installed in the rural areas.

The  following streets were lighted  this  year:

Sennett Road, Paya Lebar Crescent, Upper  Changi

Road,  Airport  Road,  Jalan  Alsagoff,  Somapah

Road.  Sembawang  Road,  Woodlands  Road,  Bukit

Timah Road, Bukit Panjang Village, Chua Chu Kang

Road  (Nam  San and Tengah). 372 kampong  street

lights   were   installed  at  various   places,

including Geylang Serai, Jalan Kaki Bukit, Jalan

Batek,  Jalan Tebu, Jalan Penggaga, Jalan Bayam,

Jalan  Ubi, Sembawang New Village at  12½  m.s.,

Sun  Wah  Chee  Drive,  Kampong  Tengah,  Lorong

Marzuki  to  Jalan Sentosa, and Holy  Innocents'

Lane.  In  1961  approval  for  the  supply   of

electricity to kampongs in the rural  areas  was

given to Jalan Sempadan and Kampong Siglap, Hill

view  Avenue, Soon Hock Road (Thomson), Lam  San

Village, Florence Road, and Gulega Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Member for Jalan Kayu mentioned

that during the Lim Yew Hock regime chemicals for

animals were given free to the rural people,  and

now  this  Government withdraws  these  chemicals

from  the  market. I have never  heard  of  these

chemicals  being given free to the  rural  people

ever  since the last Legislative Assembly when  I

was  an  Assemblyman. I do not know where he  got

all  this information. He said they could get the

chemicals  from  the  shops  but  the  Government

withdraws  supplies of these chemicals.  We  have

not done such a thing. He is a farmer, his father

is  a  farmer, and he should know very well  that

during  the Lim Yew Hock Government there were  a

few  inoculators. Those who wanted to have  their

chicks  inoculated just reported to the Fullerton

Building.  At  that time it was under  a  certain

Ministry - Agriculture or something  like  that.  I

once brought a farmer there and asked one of  the

officers to send an inoculator to such and such a

place to inoculate about 1,000 chicks. He said,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2603</b></font><br><br>

all  right, and noted down the name and  address.

And  so the chicks were inoculated. But two weeks

later,  half the chicks died. So I made inquiries

as  to  how  half of them could have  died  after

inoculation.  Instead of saving the chickens,  it

killed  the chickens! I found that most of  these

inoculators were corrupted. They said  they  gave

the  right  amount of chemicals to inoculate  the

chickens.   "And   we  have  an  appointment   to

inoculate 1,000 more chickens at night!"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All these little details

are  perhaps very interesting if the hon.  Member

is debating the Lim Yew Hock Government's policy.

We  are  now  debating  the  P.A.P.  Government's

policy.  He  should  concentrate  on  the  P.A.P.

Government's policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just

want  to compare. If there is no comparison,  how

can  you  prove whether the P.A.P. Government  is

really  doing things for the people? I say  this

because of the blackmarket. They got to cut  half

of  them for the blackmarket and get $25  in  the

night.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have tried to indicate

that  that is completely irrelevant. Let us  come

back to the Government policy as indicated in the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

present P.A.P. Government, we have appointed more

inoculators  to  inoculate  these  birds  in  the

kampongs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In the daytime!

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> In the former days the

farmers  were not too happy about rearing chicks.

At  the most, they only reared about 500 or  600.

They  were frightened that these birds would  get

the disease and die. So the P.A.P. Government now

appointed  more  inoculators to  inoculate  these

birds to save them and help the farmers. So now I

can see in the kampongs that 90 per

cent  of these chicks reach the egg-laying  age,

and  as  a  result  eggs  are  plentiful  in  the

market. During this P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2604</b></font><br><br>

Government,  therefore,  these  farmers  produce

more  eggs and some are exported to neighbouring

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu says that the cost

of  fowl feeding is $15 to $16 a pickul. My  son

is keeping 400 fowls at the back of my house. He

is  making $250 a month, and he feeds the  fowls

for  only  two  hours  a day.  The  Member  also

mentions the sale of eggs by the farmers.  At  7

cents  each the farmer loses at 8 cents each  he

just  about covers his cost. I believe that eggs

were not sold below 8 cents after the war. If an

egg is sold at 8 cents, you can make at least 80

cents  a  month from one hen. So from 400  fowls

you make over $300 a month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not saying that we do not provide

facilities  for the farmers and are not  looking

after  their  interests. We  do.  We  are  still

helping them. Whenever there is a complaint,  we

always  look into it. I remember once the Member

for  Punggol  came to see me about  a  complaint

that  a house was in two feet of water. We  went

to see the proper officials. We are not like the

Member  for Jalan Kayu who just talks but  never

does anything. I mention this just to prove that

he  comes here only to say things which are  not

true,  such as "Well, the P.A.P. does  not  keep

its promises." It is wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentions the structures of chicken

runs,  pig sties, and all sorts of things.  What

does  he  know about them? He is an  Assemblyman

and   he   should  know  the  building   by-laws

governing  these structures. He says, "Oh,  this

Government gives a lot of trouble. It is a  very

difficult to build a chicken run or a pig  sty."

If a farmer does not know where to go, he should

tell him to go to the building surveyor and  get

a  permit.  If the people have any difficulties,

he  should go up to them and help them. Does  he

want  to  say,  "Well, if you want  to  build  a

chicken  run or a pig sty, you can do it without

a  permit."? That land may be Government land or

private land. Mr Speaker, Sir, suppose you  own

a piece and one day you find

that somebody has built a house in your

compound. When you ask him, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2605</b></font><br><br>

says, "Oh, I can put up a house anywhere I like."

That  is  not the policy. Because if it  is,  you

will  find the hawkers building cubicles  in  the

back lanes! Therefore, it cannot be said that  we

are  not  helping the people. We have to  educate

them  to  help them. "This is right and  that  is

wrong."  You  have  to  go  through  the   proper

channels to get things done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say one more thing. If there are no

building  laws, I will advise him to go  and  see

his  brother who is very good at doing things

applying for permits for the people. His  brother

is   doing  these  things  and  yet  he,  as   an

Assemblyman,  does  not know  how  to  get  these

things  done.  I  wonder why. I think  he  should

answer  my question. "It is very hard  to  get  a

permit to put up a house on Government land. Have

to  go  to the Land Office." Well, what  does  he

expect?  The  land  officer,  when  he  gets   an

application, will say, "All right. We will go and

see the place." The applicant should write to the

Land Office or the Commissioner of Lands and say,

"Well, I want to enlarge my house because my  two

sons  are  grown up and I want to have  two  more

rooms." Naturally the Commissioner will say, "All

right.  Now, what sort of building are you  going

to  enlarge?" I have handled these problems. Once

I   was   present   in  the  Land   Office.   The

Commissioner said to the applicant, "Can you give

some reasons why you wish to enlarge your house?"

And  he will approve if the reasons are good.  It

is  not  difficult. Once these people  put  up  a

chicken run on Government land. Then they  got  a

notice to pull it down or be fined. So they  came

up  to me and said, "Why? This is an agricultural

area.   The  Commissioner  of  Lands  says   this

building  was put up without a permit and  should

be pulled down." I am

explaining all these things to Members of

Opposition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to reply to the Member for Changi.

He  mentioned some resolution having been  passed

about  repairing roads, but that after  one  year

nothing had been done. He too was on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2606</b></font><br><br>

the  Advisory  Council. The  Member  for  Upper

Serangoon  was the ex-Chairman. And now  he  is

asking.  Asking for what? They had to  pass  it

and the Chairman

passed it. So many things have to be done. It

is not only Changi Road -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is getting

a  bit  excited. If he addresses the Chair,  he

will probably not get so excited.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

very  excited. I am really annoyed. Members  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis come here  and  say  all

sorts  of  things which are untrue.  I  am  the

oldest  man in this House. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

have   mentioned  this  so  many  times.   Make

constructive  criticism  and  not   destructive

criticism.  They just come here  and  talk  and

instigate  during the Budget  debate.  So  many

Members talk about compensation. Yesterday  the

Member for Jalan Kayu talked about compensation

again.  He said instead of $1 we must  pay  $3.

How many times -

<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> On a point of explanation,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of explanation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> I just want to know why

Koh  Seck Lim Road is not tarred. That is  all.

Do not talk so much.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Changi

must not instruct the Member as to how long  he

can talk, or whether he should talk so much.  I

must  ask him to withdraw that expression,  "Do

not talk so much."

<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> I withdraw, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> You are asking me why I do

not tar the road?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would advise the Hon.

Parliamentary  Secretary not to get  too  angry

because  he  is old. He should always  remember

that  there is a sympathetic Chair.  The  Chair

will have a sympathetic ear for what the Member

has to say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2607</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Thank you, Sir, for your

advice.  Such an old man has to bow  to  you,  so

young  a  Speaker, as Chairman ! I  am  not  very

excited,  as I said just now. These young  people

just  come  here  and  waste  the  time  of   the

Assembly.  They now ask me why I do not  tar  the

road. The engineers will tar the roads. As I have

mentioned  just  now, they have not  only  Changi

Road  to  attend  to. These  things  have  to  be

attended  to in the proper order. Last month  the

road  engineers gave me a full list of what roads

are to be repaired and resurfaced. So we must see

which road needs priority. Do not say, "The roads

in  my constituency should be attended to first."

Mr  Speaker,  I  tell you that  the  Member  for

Changi  is always asking for work to be done  for

his own constituency.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> That is my duty.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> It is your duty, but you are

too greedy.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think there is

much  excuse  for  the  Parliamentary  Secretary,

because  he  was looking at the Speaker  when  he

said,  "You are too greedy." I do net  think  the

Speaker   is   at   all   greedy.   Perhaps   the

Parliamentary  Secretary could now  come  to  his

point and conclude his speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

has left the Party only a few months. Every month

we  have  a meeting. Why do you not say that  the

Government  should attend to my  road  first  and

give  it priority? You just say top priority  and

the  Government will do it. He is a man who  asks

so  much  for his constituency. I have asked  for

some  standpipes  for  my constituency,  and  the

Committee has approved them. He has got the cheek

to  ask me, "These pipes have been passed. Let me

construct my pipes and you stop your pipes."

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must bring the

Parliamentary Secretary back to the debate  which

is  on  Government policy. I think he has touched

sufficiently on details to illustrate the  Govern

ment's policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2608</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Thank you for your advice,

Sir. I  come back again. The Member  for  Jalan

Kayu  mentioned that not enough facilities  have

been  given  to the rural farmers or  the  rural

folks. He talked about some of the people at the

11th  m.s. Yio Chu Kang Road who had been  given

notice  to  quit. There were about 300  families

altogether.  I  have mentioned  compensation  so

many  times during the Budget debate. I say they

know  very  well  that  land  in  Singapore   is

limited.  The  Government has given  them  land.

When Government asks them to quit, it gives them

alternative  accommodation elsewhere.  It  gives

them  compensation, and if they refuse to accept

it, the Government gives them a house and put up

a   proper   road,  water  service   and   other

facilities.   Some  of  them  claim   for   more

compensation.  This is State money  and  we  the

Government are the guardians of public funds. We

must see that they are spent in a proper way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member also mentioned

that  there  is a lot of land in the Federation.

It  is because we in Singapore are short of land

that we seek merger with the Federation. We  are

trying  to  get people to go to the  Federation.

There  is  a lot of land there. They can  get  a

lease  from  the  Government  and  go  there  to

cultivate the land.

<br><br>4.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  if  the  P.A.P.  Government  had

followed the footsteps of the P.A.P. in the City

Council  during their 14 months in office,  they

would  not  have been reduced to a  majority  of

just one today. The captain of the ship has  not

been   piloting  his  vessel  along  the  proper

course. And so it has hit the rocks. Today it is

about to flounder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Government claim to be a

Government of the people, but it appears  to  be

just  self-praise. They have promised to do good

to  the people, but these promises have not been

carried  out. That is why we fought  the  Govern

ment  with  the  weapon  of  the  16  Hong   Lim

resolutions  and  exposed the  mistakes  of  the

Government. We who represent the United People's

Party are consistent and disciplined. We do  not

change



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2609</b></font><br><br>

with  the wind. This Government do not appear  to

show any sympathy for the working class. When the

P.A.P. was  in charge of the City  Council,  the

City  Council  of  its  own  accord  raised   the

workers' pay by 40 cents a day and the salary  of

the  poorly paid staff by $10 a month.  But  have

this  Government done anything like  that  today?

They  have not done so. The Government must treat

women teachers better. But fair treatment has not

been  meted  out to them. Women teachers  do  the

same  work as men teachers, and, therefore,  they

must be given the same terms of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite easy to attack the Government and

say  that  it  is  discredited. It  needs  little

courage  to  attack the Government. But  we  have

always  offered constructive criticisms. We  have

not  criticised  for the sake of criticising.  To

light against a tyrannous government in the early

days,  courage and strength were needed. Tan  Gah

Keng  was  the  first man to  fight  against  the

appointment  of Thomson, Blades and Meadows.  But

he  was  betrayed by the people whom he  trusted,

and   he   suffered  for  the  courage   of   his

convictions. On the day he was arrested,  he  had

only  two  torn  shirts.  The  Government  should

release him unconditionally from prison.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what good have the people

received   from  this  Government?  Very   little

indeed. When the P.A.P. was in charge of the City

Council,  three or four children's  creches  were

constructed. But this Government have built none.

They  have built community centres. But how  many

of them are functioning today? If these community

centres  are  used  as  children's  creches,  the

people will get some benefit from such a change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government want to do some good to the

hawkers, I would suggest that their licence  fees

should  be reduced. A committee should be set  up

to  consider the position. The licence fees today

were  fixed at a time when there were only a  few

hawkers.  But the number of hawkers has increased

many times and, therefore, if a committee is  set

up  to  review the position, it will be  able  to

examine  whether  these  licence  fees   can   be

reduced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2610</b></font><br><br>

Perhaps,  as a result of such a procedure,  the

hawkers  may  have  more  confidence  in   this

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one more point I

wish  to  make. I urge the Government  to  look

into  the  welfare of the poor  trisha  riders.

Many  of  them are old; some of them are  sick;

and if they lose this means of livelihood, they

will  have no other means. The former  Minister

for  Labour,  the present Minister for  Health,

announced  at  one time that he  was  going  to

build a home for the aged, for those who cannot

work.  But  his  promise has  just  remained  a

promise. It has only been a paper plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should also reorganise the

transport   system   of  Singapore.   The   bus

transport system is not up to modern standards.

There  is  a lot of overcrowding in the  buses.

Many places are not served by bus transport. An

improvement  of  the  bus  services  will  also

better the working conditions of bus workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxi drivers are today struggling for a

living.  The  Government promised,  some  years

ago,  that  a  million-dollar scheme  would  be

devised to help the taxi drivers, but this  has

also  remained just a promise. When the  P.A.P.

ran  the City Council, words were always follow

ed  by  action, and the people learnt  to  have

faith in the P.A.P. City Council rather than in

the  current Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, taxi

drivers are now required to pay very high rates

of  fines for any offences they commit. This is

something the Government must now reexamine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say a few words too on the S.I.T.

flats. The Government promised to construct low-cost  housing, but up to now, I have not  heard

of  any  really  low-cost housing  having  been

constructed.

<br><br>4.22 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  since the 16th of  October,  we

have  been debating in this House. We  can  see

clearly  from the Government's policy statement

that it is empty, without any substance in  it.

A  great  part of it is related to the question

of merger, which we have been debating for many

days.  This  year's  policy statement  is  very

different from 1959 or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2611</b></font><br><br>

1960.  In 1959, the Government's policy statement

was  published in a booklet entitled  "Towards  A

More Just Society". In 1960, the policy statement

was published in a pamphlet entitled "The Year of

Construction". But this year, the Government have

not  given  any title to their policy  statement.

The  Government  should point  out  what  is  the

emphasis on this year's policy statement so as to

let  the people know it. They have only said that

the  Government Labour Exchange has secured  jobs

for  1,400 unemployed. It is regrettable that  in

the  year  of  construction the people  who  were

given  jobs numbered only 1,400. The year of  con

struction should actually be discounted,  because

it  has  been proved that it is not the  year  of

construction. What is this year to be? What kind

of  year  is this? I will give it a name.  A  mad

year  or a year of betrayal. A year of the  sell-out.  Just  now  I heard our friend  opposite  us

talking   very   happily.   I   refer   to    the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Deputy   Prime

Minister. He gave the number of drains and  roads

which  the  Government have built over  the  past

year. He seemed to be very satisfied with this so-called "grand" achievement. We can say the Govern

ment  have  made no achievements at  all  besides

this.  The  achievement is a very minor  one.  He

said  that  he was the Chairman of the Urban  and

Rural  Services Advisory Council and that  during

his  term he did certain things. What he can  say

is  only  these minor things which the Government

can  claim  to have achieved. But the suggestions

of  this  Advisory Council have to be put  up  to

another   higher   authority   comprising   three

persons.  But  this  year  the  organisation   is

different.   The  Parliamentary   Secretary   has

mentioned the building of a few bus-waiting sheds

and  he  seems to be very satisfied. We  can  see

clearly  what  the P.A.P. have done by  comparing

what  they have done with what is stated  in  the

P.A.P.'s small pamphlet issued at the time of the

general elections in 1959. Most of the people  of

Singapore are in the working class. So the P.A.P.

Government

want to make use of these people to achieve their

own ends. In May 1959 at the Geylang Serai P.A.P.

mass rally, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, namely,

the present Prime Minister, read out the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2612</b></font><br><br>

P.A.P.'s  policy on labour. It is in  the  small

pamphlet Book 3, in the Chinese version. In  the

third paragraph he says that the P.A.P. has been

a  workers' movement and has always received the

support of the workers. The P.A.P. Government is

a  government on the workers' side. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the P.A.P. Government have been in  office

for about 2½ years. The leadership of the P.A.P.

have forgotten what they promised before. During

the  first few months of its office, the  P.A.P.

Government did help in some ways. They abolished

a  number of yellow unions. This helped, to some

extent,  the development of healthy trade  union

ism  in Singapore. But soon afterwards when  the

P.A.P. Government saw the increasing strength of

the   working   class   who   had   consolidated

themselves, they resorted to other tactics, such

as  cancelling the registration of certain trade

unions and doing some things which were contrary

to  the interests of the workers. Later on, when

there   were   strikes,  the  P.A.P.  Government

resorted  to the same tactics as those  employed

by the Lim Yew Hock Government. They ordered the

police  to  take action against unarmed  workers

who were then prosecuted in court. At that time,

the Government put up signboards and posters  to

say that they were protecting the labourers but,

on  the  other  hand,  they resorted  to  police

action against them. Nowadays, they do not, even

have  these  signboards.  Their  so-called  pro-workers' policy has been exposed. The people can

see  clearly  now that they are trying  to  sell

dog's meat by showing a sheep's head. Their true

colours  are now exposed. They have now  allowed

yellow trade unions to create suspicion and to

disturb  the  friendly relations existing  among

the workers and to smear the right type of trade

union executives as

pro-Communists or Communists. They seem to think

that by allowing all these activities, they  can

preserve  their present political  position  and

power. But

they  should  recall the same events  that  took

place  during  the  term of  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government.  The past Government was  a  failure

and  now the P.A.P. Government are treading  the

same path.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the hon.

Member that he is repeating the same theme  which

has  been  repeated by Barisan  Sosialis  speaker

after  Barisan Sosialis speaker? I  have  already

stated  that  I am going to be very strict  about

repetitions and I ask all Members of the  Barisan

Sosialis  to  get together so that  they  do  not

repeat  what every Member of their Party says  in

this  House. We have had this theme time and time

again. It is becoming tedious. Mr Lin You Eng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  only mention these things and I do not want to

go  into details. From what I have said,  we  can

see  what  the P.A.P. Government have  done.  The

P.A.P. are  acting contrary to  what  they  have

promised  in  their small pamphlets  issued  some

time ago.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is, of course,

entitled  to  say what he wants to  say.  But  if

Member after Member from the same Party says  the

same  thing, then it becomes tedious. The Barisan

Sosialis should have a spokesman to say

one thing which is not repeated by the other  Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The smearing of

trade  union  executives and  officers  will,  of

course,   be   viewed  with  favour  by   foreign

capitalists  and  foreign compradores.  But  this

will not lead the Government to any good end.  In

the  third  book  of the Chinese version  of  the

P.A.P.'s  pamphlets, on page  16,  entitled  "The

Unification  of the Trade Union Movement",  there

is  a  passage which goes like this. The P.A.P.'s

task  is to see that there must be a coherent  or

unified  union  organisation and  that  the  laws

relating  to trade unions and labour  are  to  be

revised.  In  1960, an 1st May (Labour  Day),  at

Jalan Besar, the then Minister for Labour and Law

said  to the workers there - I am quoting from  the

Sin Chew Jit Poh, page 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If there is no true central organisation to

represent  all  the  workers,  the  whole  trade

union  movement will be useless.  This  is  some

thing  that the workers themselves will have  to

pay  attention  to and work with the  Government

in this respect.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2614</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker, Sir, this organisation is the same

as the old one. But we can see from the speeches

of  the Minister that the P.A.P. are only paying

lip  service to the workers when they  say  that

they  want  to protect the workers' interest  by

forming  a  central  trade  union  organisation.

Their  motive is to control all the trade unions

and to make use of them for their own purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Culture  was also the Secretary-General  of  the

T.U.C. and  it was through him that the  P.A.P.

wanted  to control 'the trade union movement  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> On a point of

clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No. It was

through  this person that the P.A.P. wanted  to

control  the trade union movement in  Singapore.

It  was absurd on the part of the Government  to

use  a  person  for  that  purpose.  The  P.A.P.

thought  that  the labour classes  in  Singapore

were   so   foolish  as  to  believe  that   one

particular  person  could control  thousands  of

workers.  The  P.A.P. discarded their  stand  on

anti-colonialism and wanted to make use  of  the

Member  for Kampong Kapor, namely, the Parliamen

tary  Secretary to the Minister for Culture,  to

control the trade union organisations. Those who

had  the workers' interest at heart were opposed

to the Government's tactics of making use of the

T.U.C. to attain their political aims. When  the

ex-Secretary-General of the T.U.C.,  namely  the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Culture, could not attain the aims, he asked the

then  Minister for Labour to dissolve the T.U.C.

This kind of action -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated

that   we  are  debating  the  policy   of   the

Government  in  relation to the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech, and I do not want a debate  on

details.  The hon. Member is going into details.

That is just wasting the time of the Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2615</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I mention this in

passing only as an example. The P.A.P. Government

are  not interested in the welfare of the workers

or in strengthening the trade union movement. But

what  they  are interested in is attaining  their

political aims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the T.U.C. was dissolved, 82 trade union

organisations  held  a conference  and  passed  a

resolution.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated that I do

not  want  any debate on details. What Government

policy is the hon. Member attacking? Let us  have

it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have said just

now  that  the policy of the Government is  empty

and  weak and that it is contrary to the  pledges

they  gave  to  the people before the  elections.

They  talk  of fighting for the interest  of  the

workers, but in this policy statement there is no

mention of any safeguards for the workers. In one

year  the  Government could only  find  jobs  for

1,400 people. This shows the labour policy of the

P.A.P. is only meant to deceive the people. These

82  trade union organisations passed a resolution

to  condemn the Government's act to dissolve  the

Trade Union Congress.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the House is

interested in what resolution was passed. I think

all that the House might be interested in is that

a  trade  union  or  a Trade  Union  Congress  or

whatever  the name was of 82 unions  was  formed,

and the allegation is that the Government refuses

to recognise it. That is all there is to it. That

is  perhaps an attack on the Government policy in

not  recognising this trade union. But we do  not

want  to know how many meetings they had and what

resolutions they passed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In that case, I

am not going to mention this matter to the House.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, we can see  that  the  P.A.P.

Government have lost the faith of the  people  of

Singapore.  How are they going to retrieve  their

position?  Through Mr Devan Nair, the Government

are going to form their puppet trade union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2616</b></font><br><br>

organisation. Now the Government make use of Mr

Devan Nair to sabotage the trade union movement.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose now to suspend

until 5.30 p.m. to enable the hon. Member perhaps

to  revise  his  speech, and to convey  to  other

Members  of the Barisan Sosialis that  I  do  not

want  any  repetition. I do not want any  details

debated.  All I am interested in and,'  I  think,

all  that  the  Assembly is interested  in  is  a

debate on the Government's general policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take this Chair again at 5.30

p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>4.49 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I will try to make my speech short. I  know

we have been debating in this House for about one

month.  Everybody  is tired.  Of  course,  I  pay

respect  to  your office, and all the  people  of

Singapore also respect your office.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I had better make myself

very  clearly  understood. The  Speaker,  as  the

Speaker,  can never get tired. He is not supposed

to get tired. All he has to do is to regulate the

debate in such a way that the Standing Orders are

not disobeyed. We are now debating what is called

a policy speech, and the Standing Order, which is

Standing Order 13, paragraph (2) , states

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Debate [that is on the speech] thereon shall be

confined  to  the  policy of  the  Government  as

outlined in the speech ...'.

<br><br>Therefore, we are debating a policy, that  is,  a

general  policy.  What  I  have  been  trying  to

indicate  to the hon. Member is that he is  going

into  details, and that is not permitted in  this

particular  debate. If he is  interested  in  any

particular issue where he wants to mention  these

details,  he has to give notice of a motion,  and

when that motion is debated, then he can bring up

all those details. That is the first point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2617</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that there is an

other Standing Order, that is Standing Order 54 - I have quoted this Standing

Order many times before - which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Speaker

or the Chairman, after having

drawn  attention to the conduct of a Member,  who

persists  in  irrelevance, or tedious  repetition

either  of  his own arguments or of the arguments

used by other Members in debate,

may direct him to discontinue his speech.'



<br><br>The point I am trying to make is that there has been

repetition, and Members

of the same Party should never repeat arguments

which have been advanced

by their co-members, because if they do

so, the repetition might become tedious and the

Chair might be compelled to act

under  that Standing Order. I might say  that  I,

as Speaker, am very reluctant to do that. That is

why I have been trying

to  indicate to Members that so long as they talk

on  the general policy of the Government in  this

particular debate

and  do not repeat themselves, and do not go into

details,  they will have every sympathy from  the

Chair.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Now I will try to

shorten my speech. When the P.A.P. came to power,

their  message had given hope that the Government

would   bring   some  benefit  to   the   people,

especially since they had suffered

from the oppression of the colonial rulers. The

people were attracted by the

P.A.P.'s promises. The P.A.P. promised to carry

out certain policies. The unification of the

trade union movement was carried out by the

P.A.P. Government in

the form of the establishment of the

Trade  Union  Congress. But this was dissolved  a

few months later. The recent strike by the Public

Daily-Rated  Employees  Unions  Federation  gives

ample

proof that the Government are making

use of one trade union to defeat another trade

union. At every street corner people have been

talking about this. They have been criticising

the Government.

But  the  Government do not pay any attention  to

that.  The Government only delay it. In  the  end

many people were

affected by the strike. From this event,  we  can

see  that the present P.A.P. Government  are  not

concerned with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2618</b></font><br><br>

livelihood  and the safety of the  people.  What

the  P.A.P. Government are interested in  is  to

make  use of the trade disputes to smear certain

trade  unions  in order to strengthen  the  pro-Government trade unions. This we can see clearly

from  the recent trade disputes and strikes.  We

can   see   that  the  P.A.P.  Government   will

undoubtedly resort to using the police to tackle

the  workers,  even  with  the  backing  of  the

military force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 4th of May this year, when the People's

Association was inaugurated - I am quoting from

the  Nanyang Siang Pair of 6th of May - the  Prime

Minister is reported to have said as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The record of the Work Brigade will be of

more  value than any certificate issued  by  any

school.'

<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, after the Prime Minister  had

said  such  things at the inaugural ceremony  of

the  Work Brigade, its members were very  elated

and  hopeful.  Now  the present  wages  for  the

members  are $1.50 a day. Everybody  hoped  that

after working for some time in the Work Brigade,

he  would get a certificate which would help him

to  get  other  employment. But they  have  been

working in the Work Brigade for about two years.

The P.A.P. Government have never fulfilled their

promises.  Yesterday I read  in  the  newspapers

that the Government sent the police to lay siege

to  the Work Brigade camps. The police were used

to  encircle  the camps where the  Work  Brigade

members were stationed. According to Mr Ng, the

Director of the Work Brigade, the paper reported

thus:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'One boy said that he regretted very much that

the Government should resort to using the police

and  military  personnel to take action  against

the strikers of the Work

Brigade and several of them were assaulted.'



<br><br>The Government  sent out the police to encircle  the

Work  Brigade camps and to round up the  members

and assault them. How can the Government explain

away  this kind of act? The incident at the Work

Brigade  camps is true. It can be seen from  the

statement issued by both sides. We can see  that

the  Work Brigade members wanted to form a trade

union.  The P.A.P. Government's signboard  shows

that the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2619</b></font><br><br>



are pro-labour. Why is it that the Government do

not  carry  out  actions in keeping  with  their

professed pro-labour policy? Why is it  that  in

the  end Government resorted to using the police

to  tackle the striking workers? Is this  not  a

kind   of  political  suicide  for  the   P.A.P.

Government?  The P.A.P. Government  should  know

that  suppressing  the  people  and  restricting

their  freedom of speech and assembly  can  only

preserve  their position and .power for  a  very

short  time. But when they face the people again

after  the  current series of actions  taken  by

them,  they  will  have lost the  trust  of  the

people  and  they will collapse. I have  already

mentioned that when they collapse, some of  them

will be just like Mr Chew Swee Kee who went  to

Ipoh -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?

<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. The

Member  for  Moulmein accuses us of  being  like

Chew  Swee Kee. He is smearing us. Is he  making

an  accusation  that we have been dishonest  and

corrupt?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Accusations have been moving from

one side of the House to the other side. I think

the   hon.  Lady  should  think  a  bit  of  the

accusation  which  she herself  levelled  at,  I

think, the Member for Stamford yesterday.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now I did

not  say that the P.A.P. Government were corrupt.

She has distorted what I said. I only said that I

regret  very much to see such a policy  statement

for this year. I want only to show that the title

of  this  policy statement can be a year  of  the

sell-out.



<br><br>5.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, referring to the policy

speech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, I  do  not

wish  to  speak at length except to  put  forward

several points which could not be dealt with when

we  debated the Budget. I am completely surprised

at the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2620</b></font><br><br>

Sosialis who, I feel, should be grateful to  the

P.A.P. who have given them an opportunity to  be

successful, and when they have that opportunity,

they  will be able to use it to bury the  P.A.P.

Far  from  wanting to defend the P.A.P. in  the

interests of the people of Singapore, I wish  to

say  that normally when U.M.N.O. Members  speak,

they  are  charged  with  communalism.  But   it

appears  that  today the P.A.P.  Government,  if

their  attitude is not of a communalist  nature,

should be sympathetic towards people whom it  is

the business of the Minister for Home Affairs to

detain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we should not forget the A.R.T.I.S.

incident.  When the A.R.T.I.S. affair  came  out

into   the  open,  the  Hon, the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Prime Minister sought  the  co-operation of U.M.N.O. to wipe out A.R.T.I.S.  We

did  give our wholehearted support for the  sake

of  the  country.  But now,  Mr  Speaker,  when

accusations are hurled by the Government in this

Assembly that there are Communist groups who are

infiltrating    into   all   organisations    in

Singapore,  I  am puzzled why such elements  are

allowed  to  go  free. Is it the belief  of  the

Government  that such people are not  dangerous,

are   not  a  menace?  I  still  remember   that

yesterday  the  Hon, the Minister for  Education

mentioned  that  a  former  terrorist  Communist

still   took   an  active  part   in   terrorist

activities and he was found to be active in  Kam

pong Kembangan. If it is within the knowledge of

the   Government   that  there   are   terrorist

Communists, why must these people be allowed  to

go  free?  Why must we give them the opportunity

to  create  trouble, the object of which  is  to

topple the P.A.P. Government? So it is

a very important matter. With the State machinery

at our disposal - the Special

Branch, which the Barisan Sosialis fear

most - why must we refrain from taking

action? I am sure this Government will

wait for the time until merger is achieved. So,

Mr Speaker, that is the main

battle-line. Sometimes we get confused

about the terms "pro-Communist" and

"anti-Communist". So I hope the Government will

continue to struggle as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2621</b></font><br><br>



non-Communist Government, and, by using  all  the

State machinery at their disposal, get rid of the

Communists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before I touch on the various

Government  departments which will be  put  under

the  control of the Central Government  in  Kuala

Lumpur, I take this opportunity to offer my heart-felt  congratulations to the police in particular

who  have  rendered special service not  only  in

looking  after the Opposition but also in looking

after  the Members of the Government by providing

security  officers  as bodyguards.  We  will  not

forget their good services, and I trust they will

continue to render excellent services and protect

and  safeguard  Singapore from  this  undesirable

threat, that is the threat of Communism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Police Force, Mr Speaker,

in  view of the fact that time is pressing on,  I

hope  the Minister for Home Affairs will consider

carefully the appeals which we have submitted  in

this Assembly in connection with the interests of

members  of  the Police Force. Let  us  show  our

appreciation of the Police Force before they  are

transferred to the Kuala Lumpur Office. At  least

among  the  gazetted officers, it is proper  that

equal  representations exist  among  the  various

communities  that  live in  Singapore.  Since  an

Assistant  Commissioner of Police retired,  until

today  there  has  been no replacement  from  the

community  which  I represent.  So  I  hope,  Mr

Speaker,   this   matter  will   be   given   due

consideration.   I   further   plead   with   the

Government  on another matter which  perhaps  the

Minister himself knows, and that is the Guard and

Escort   Unit.  We  have  discussed  this  matter

sometime back. But up till today, however,  their

rates  of pay are not commensurate with those  of

the  other, members of the regular Police  Force.

Mr  Speaker, a bullet aimed at a member  of  the

Guard  and Escort Unit cannot prevent that bullet

from piercing his body, so -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I have explained

how  this debate should go, and that is we should

debate on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2622</b></font><br><br>

general  policy  of the Government  and  not  on

details.  I think the hon. Member is  now  going

into  details.  He is pinpointing certain  units

and   complaining   that  their   pay   is   not

sufficient.  This is not the time to  air  those

grievances.  If the Member wishes to  air  those

grievances,  there  are  other  ways,  such   as

seeking  the  right to speak on the adjournment,

or   moving  a  motion.  Now  we  are   on   the

Government's general policy.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

have covered enough ground, I  think.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Ministry of Culture. Because

the Minister for Culture is not in the House,  I

hope  the  Hon. Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for Culture will give consideration  to

my  views  in  this Assembly. Mr Speaker,  this

matter  is  also connected with the Ministry  of

Education  and I hope the Minister for Education

will pay heed too. Mr Speaker, I am directed by

U.M.N.O. to submit to this Assembly a  question

relating  to education and culture.  Why  is  it

that  national  language teachers are  recruited

from  Indonesia  and not from Kuala  Lumpur?  On

Culture  particularly, Mr  Speaker,  could  the

Minister  for  Culture explain - and  perhaps  the

people  of  Singapore  desire  to  know - what  is

happening  to  the  fate  of  the  Aneka  Ragam?

Another  point, Mr Speaker, could the Minister,

in  the interests of national unity, promote the

national  language  in Singapore?  I  think  the

development of the national language,  which  is

in progress now, is far from satisfactory. It is

not  getting  the  support  of  the  people   of

Singapore. I hope the Government will  implement

the  national  language policy by  conducting  a

language  week or a language month in  Singapore

so  that not only will the national language  be

accepted  by  all the people of  Singapore,  but

also  that it will be the sole official language

in Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that we, as Members

of the Assembly, ought not to criticise culture - but  if I wish to poke fun at the Government,  I

will  say  that they love to play golf and  this

also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2623</b></font><br><br>



applies  to the leadership of U.M.N.O. who  also

enjoys playing golf! I hope the Government  will

have a game of golf with the Barisan Sosialis so

that  a  culture can be evolved which can  unite

all the Members of this Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's speech, mention has been made that a big

sum  of money has been spent and that much effort

has  been  put into housing. I wish to convey  to

the  Minister  concerned that  the  houses  being

built  at  present  are meant  for  a  particular

section of the population of Singapore. It should

be  the  policy  of  the Government  to  allocate

building  sites in the Malay settlements.  Up  to

now,  the allocation of these sites has not  been

completed and a decision on this is long overdue.

I  would like to remind the House that I  am  not

asking for an extension of such settlements,  but

that  the  allocation of these  sites  should  be

expedited  for a certain section of the community

who are still waiting for sites. On this subject,

1  ask  that there should be an investigation  to

find out whether it is true that staff members - whether  in the Government or not - who  have  paid

their $25 deposit are unable to get it back  even

though  they  have  not been  allocated  building

sites.  I have received reports from a number  of

applicants who say that they have been cheated -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again I think the hon.

Member  is  deviating from the debate. These  are

grievances  which  he  can  either  pose  to  the

Minister  direct  or  ventilate - if  he  has   not

already  ventilated them in  the  debate  on  the

Estimates - in an adjournment speech. We are now on

general policies.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Finally, I wish to

convey   to  the  Government  and  I  think   the

Government  know the position - that  U.M.N.O. has

complained  many  times  that  the  building   of

community  centres  has  not  been  carried   out

satisfactorily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it has become the policy of the

Government to install lighting facilities and  to

repair  roads in the kampongs of the rural areas;

and in order not to save money, I hope the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2624</b></font><br><br>

Government  will consider a scheme whereby  red

earth should not be used for kampong roads,  as

it is not satisfactory when it rains. This is a

matter  which merits attention. It has been  re

ported  not only to me but also to other  rural

representatives.  Such roads will  not  benefit

the  poor  residents from the health  point  of

view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Government will

consider the points I have submitted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as  the curtain on Act 111 of this  drama

slowly goes up and as the third Session of this

Assembly  unfolds itself, we see the Government

Benchers in a sad and melancholy state. We  can

see  the  absence of Members' on the Government

Benches - even  during the time when  Government

Members made their speeches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech is

nothing  but  a  collection of  empty  promises

which  have been repeated year after year.  The

people  do  not believe in these  promises  any

more. As we read through the speech, it is like

reading  through  the  last  testament   of   a

Government which once commanded a huge majority

in  this Chamber but which has now been reduced

to  such a state that it requires the acrobatic

talents of a circus performer -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I can allow

the hon. Member to continue in that strain.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, their

majority now is so small that we feel sorry for

this  Government. Sir, why has this  Government

failed?  This  Government  has  failed  because

primarily it has ignored the people's interests

which it has sought to protect and defend. This

Government  has failed because it  has  ignored

and   forgotten  its  election  promises.  This

Government  has  failed  because  it  had  been

brought about by the common people, but when it

came into office, it forgot all about them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Government this: have the

workers  of  this  country benefited  from  the

P.A.P. Government? Have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2625</b></font><br><br>

the  taxi-drivers, the trisha-riders and  hawkers

benefited from this Government? Have the  farmers

and    the   shopkeepers   benefited   from   the

Government?  No, Sir. Have the industrialists  or

the  businessmen benefited from this  Government?

No, Sir. The persons who have benefited from this

Government are only a small privileged few who do

not  play a very significant part in building our

society.  I  would say that many of the  Ministers

and  the Parliamentary Secretaries have benefited

from this Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not long after the Government was formed,

we  could  see  quite clearly  the  road  it  was

taking.  We saw it clearly and we fought  against

it.  In  those days, Sir, it was a hard, tortuous

and  lonely battle. Some of those who  fought  in

the  early  days are still exiled from this  coun

try, while others are still languishing in goals.

Sir,  it required real courage and conviction  in

those early days - as early as August 1959 - to fight

this  once  all-powerful Government.  Of  course,

after the Hong Lim by-election, the situation was

quite  different. We fought this Government tooth

and  nail and we never surrendered the principles

in which we believe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after fighting for nearly ten months, we

put up all our points in the Hong Lim resolutions

which  embodied all what the people of  Singapore

wanted. This was vindicated later in the Hong Lim

by-election  and we are here today with  a  fresh

mandate  to  speak on behalf of the people.  Sir,

what  we  have  said  previously  in  the  P.A.P.

itself, in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speeches,

and  in  the Budget debates in this Assembly  has

now all proved to be absolutely true. Events have

proved  what  we  have said in speeches  in  this

Assembly,  in the Party conferences  and  in  the

Hong  Lim byelection to be true, and many  people

who once disagreed with us have now come round to

the same point of view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

contains nothing, because the Government  is  now

not very keen on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2626</b></font><br><br>

carrying  on  an  efficient  administration  and

doing  constructive work for the people.  It  is

just  waiting for so-called merger talks to come

about  and  save  them. Nothing  has  been  done

during   the   past  2½  years  to   solve   the

unemployment problem. What has happened  to  the

common  commodity market talks?  We  have  heard

many     times     about    the     Government's

industrialisation  policy,  and  it   was   only

recently that the Government pushed forward  the

Jurong scheme. The scheme is good. We support it

in  principle.  But, Sir, the Government  should

have   done  much  better.  Unless  the   common

commodity market talks succeed, it will be  very

difficult to have a successful industrialisation

scheme.  What has, the Government done  to  stop

unemployment?  We now know that there  are  many

juvenile  delinquents  and  petty  thieves   and

robbers.  The  Government  was  very  happy   to

announce that the number of kidnapping cases had

been reduced. But, Sir, perhaps this is because

the  big businessmen have bodyguards now, or  it

is  because of the Kidnapping Bill. But, on  the

other hand, we now know for sure that crime  and

juvenile  delinquency are on the increase.  This

is  due to the Government's lack of solution  or

partial solution to the unemployment problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what has the Government done to,

alleviate  the  sufferings of the farmers?  What

has  the  Government done to give  an  offer  of

security  of  tenure to the farmers?  Sir,  some

years   ago  we  prepared  a  scheme  to   bring

electricity to the kampongs. As far as  I  know,

nothing  substantial  has  been  done.  We   had

already  built an adequate number of  standpipes

for  the  kampong folks. We were going to  carry

through  with the electricity scheme. But,  Sir,

unfortunately  we could not do  it  because  the

City   Council  was  taken  back  by  the  Prime

Minister. What has the Government done to  build

agricultural roads? The Government has said that

it  has  completed  21 new roads.  Sir,  21  new

agricultural roads is a very small  figure  when

compared  the  number of roads required  in  the

kampongs of Singapore. If proper leadership  had

been given to those who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2627</b></font><br><br>

were  prepared to build roads among  the  kampong

people;  if  the  special  squad  had  not   been

disbanded and had been allowed to carry  out  its

work,  today we would have had not only 21 roads,

Sir,  but I can guarantee that we would have  had

at  least  ten  times more - 210  new  agricultural

roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Government was

formed,  we wanted to carry on the P.A.P.'s  work

which  was started in the City Council. In  June,

July  and  August  1959, within less  than  three

months  of the new Government coming into office,

we  succeeded in mobilising tens of thousands  of

volunteers  to  help in the construction  of  the

State. We filled almost all available empty lands

in   the   country  with  parks  and   children's

playgrounds. We built a few hundred standpipes in

the course of one or two months. Needless to say,

there  were  numerous  other construction  works.

But,  Sir,  when the Prime Minister saw  that  we

were delivering the goods to the people, that  we

were  meeting the demands of the people,  he  was

anxious  that  we must not carry  on.  Therefore,

around September, he decided that a stop must  be

put  to  all these. In October he took  back  the

City  Council and other departments. Since  then,

Sir, what has the Government constructed? Not one

new  clinic,  except  the conversion  of  an  old

community   centre  into  a   clinic,   and   the

completion of a clinic in the Yio Chu  Kang  area

started by the former Government. This Government

has  not constructed one new clinic. This  Govern

ment  has not started one creche. This Government

did  not start any new school until we fought for

it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> No, Mr Speaker, I just

want  to ask the Member for Hong Lim this.  Just

now  he has mentioned that we worked during  the

time  of  the City Council. Is he including  the

P.A.P. members as well? I was one of  the  City

Councillors at that time. So he cannot say  that

only   the   Member  for  Hong  Lim  built   the

standpipes and bus stands and all that. I  think

it  is  nonsense when he said that  he  did  all

those things.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I say

that, I mean the P.A.P. in the City Council, who

included the present Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister for Home Affairs who  worked  very

hard  those  days for the people.  And  when  we

worked,  we really worked sincerely and honestly

for  the people without any conditions.  We  did

not  build a small little dispensary and  put  a

bronze  plaque  on top of it, saying  "This  dis

pensary was opened by Mr, so-and-so, Member  for

such and such a place."

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of elucidation. Could

was built?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1958 we

had  plans  to build three clinics in  the  City

Council.  In  1959 the City Council built  three

clinics,  and  one of the three clinics  was  in

Dunearn  Road which was planned by  Inche  Mohd.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, is it not true that the

Member  for  Hong Lim, who was then in  the  City

Council,  built this clinic for Inche Shariff  in

order  to curry favour with him in a critical  moment  when  crucial  votes  were  needed  in  the

Council?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir. That

was not the case because -

the case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> That is not true because,

him, Sir. [Interruption].

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot have these further

interruptions. Please continue with the debate on

the Government's policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I am much obliged, Sir. We

believe  in  action, deeds, and not words,  vague

empty promises. Control of the Press, control  of

the radio and television, could not help a govern

ment  which  does not build its roots  among  the

people.  Sir,  we  see  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's speech a plan for television. I have  no

doubt  this is going to be another organ of propa

ganda  for the P.A.P. Government. But is it going

to  help the P.A.P. to save itself? Sir, I do not

think  so.  The  Prime  Minister  can  have   120

television speeches but still that will not  save

the  Government. The Minister for Labour can come

to  this House and say, "The Member for Hong  Lim

told some members of the Government last week  to

expose  all the Communists and manoeuvrers."  Mr

Speaker, Sir, this was said during my absence.  I

joined  the P.A.P. since its inception. We fought

and  we  struggled, and every time we  fought  on

principles. Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2630</b></font><br><br>

believe in exposing comrades or ex-comrades.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

knows  that the Chair is very, very  strict  on

that word.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In a discreet undertone,

Sir. If he thinks it is out of order, then,  in

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I will not have all this

withdraw it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, I withdraw

that word and apologise to the House.

Government  policy.  I  do  not  think  we  are

debating the policy of the P.AP. Let us  debate

Government policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

coming  to  that. Despite the fresh mandate  we

have obtained and despite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2631</b></font><br><br>

our  past  record, we are not content  with  just

resting  on  our laurels. The fight goes  on.  We

shall build slowly but steadily a political  base

on   which  we  shall  lay  the  foundation,  and

henceforth we shall continue with the work  which

was  started in the City Council, but  which  has

since been discontinued by the present Government - an act of betrayal.



<br><br>6.27 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I wish to deal with two points arising  out

of  His Excellency's speech in this Assembly. The

first  is the water supply to Singapore  and  its

implications,  and the second,  is  the  position

with  regard to labour relationships in Singapore

and  the  role  it plays in industrial  peace  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech (it

is in col. 15), His Excellency said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Furthermore, an agreement to extract water

from  the  Scudai  River in Johore  was  recently

signed   and  the  construction  of  the   Scudai

Waterworks will commence at the end of this year.

The project is expected to take approximately two

years  to complete. The first phase of the Scudai

Scheme will produce a

further 15 million gallons per day.'

<br><br>The Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister, when he moved

the motion on the

Address of Thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,

again touched upon this

particular aspect of the speech and repeated in

almost the same words that the Government was

going to the Scudai

River and that it was hoped that they would bring

in water sometime within

the  next  two  years. Sir, I have mentioned  the

Scudai  River in this House - I think it was during

the  Budget debate - and I would like to take  this

opportunity

again, Mr Speaker, Sir, to repeat to the

Government that the Scudai River

Scheme is a great mistake. It is a mistake which

will cost the taxpayers of

Singapore  $20  million,  which  money  could  be

utilised  to  better purpose in other  fields  of

Government expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the City Council has framed a scheme which

will  be  a permanent scheme in so far  as  water

supplies to

Singapore are concerned. That permanent scheme,

Sir, is the Johore River



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2632</b></font><br><br>

Scheme. The only reason why the City Council did

not  go to the Johore River was that when it did

want  to  go  there, the terrorist situation  in

that region was such that the military would not

let  the City Council enter that area. So it was

that  the City Council went to the Tebrau  River

to  provide Singapore with a temporary supply of

water until such time as the terrorist situation

improved  and the Council was allowed  to  enter

Johore  River to carry out its scheme.  Sir,  it

was always accepted by the City Council that the

Tebrau  River scheme was a temporary scheme  and

that  the whole of the scheme and the waterworks

at  Tehbrau  would be abandoned when the  Johore

River  scheme was put into operation. Therefore,

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  I  was  aghast  when   the

Government  suggested, in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech,  that they are  going  to  the

Scudai River which is an even smaller river than

the  Tebrau  River, and which, like  the  Tebrau

River,  is subject to a wet weather flow  and  a

dry weather flow. To ensure an adequate sure and

safe supply of water for Singapore, Mr Speaker,

one  does  not - I repeat, one does not - take  into

consideration the wet weather flow of  a  river.

One  always  takes  into consideration  the  dry

weather  flow.  If any Authority  that  provides

water  to a city were to go to a river for water

then the primary consideration would be how much

water  that  river would yield  during  the  dry

weather.  On  that dry weather  flow,  the  safe

capacity is determined. Now, we in Singapore got

into  trouble  during the  last  three  or  four

months  during  the  dry  weather.  One  of  the

reasons  why  we got into trouble was  that  the

Tebrau  River  is  a river,  subject  to  a  wet

weather flow and a dry weather flow. Because  of

that,  water from the Tebrau River was in  short

supply  during the dry weather and there had  to

be  a  water  shortage. If we go to Scudai,  the

same  thing is going to happen. When Tebrau runs

dry,  Scudai will run dry. There is no point  in

having  three or four or five or six rivers  all

subject   to  a  dry  weather  flow.  The   same

situation will arise again. Therefore, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2633</b></font><br><br>

do  urge upon the Government to reconsider  this

whole  scheme of going to the Scudai  River  and

ask them to go straight

to the Johore River. The Johore River will ensure

Singapore a safe supply of good water. If  we  do

go to the Johore

River,  then within the next two to three  years,

the Johore River will be able to supply Singapore

with all the water it requires. That river is  of

such capacity

even during dry weather that the water supply to

Singapore will be ensured for

the next 20 or 30 or 40 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, which I wish to

touch  upon  is  in  column 22,  as  reported  in

Hansard,  Vol. 15, No. 1, with regard to  labour.

Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Industrial Relations Ordinance, which came

into operation on 15th September, 1960, and under

which  the Industrial Arbitration Court  was  set

up,  has introduced some measure of law and order

in the sphere of industrial relations...'.

<br><br>May  I  repeat that phrase again - 'has introduced

some  measure of law and order in the  sphere  of

industrial relations'. Then it goes on  to  state

what   the   Industrial  Court  did.   The   last

paragraph,

Mr Speaker, Sir, which appears in column 23, in

reference to the Industrial

Arbitration Court, read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Industrial Arbitration Court will continue to

play an important part in fulfilling its role

that there should be industrial peace

with justice.'



<br><br>May I repeat the last phrase again - 'that there

should be industrial peace

with justice'. The important words are,

'industrial peace with justice'. The Minister for

Labour and Law, as he then was, moved the Second

Reading of the

Industrial   Relations  Bill  on  the   10th   of

February.  He  said this - in Vol.  12, No.  3  of

Hansard of 10th of February, 1960,

in col. 155:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Bill has received the very careful con

sideration of myself and all my colleagues. We

have had the benefit of advice and experience in

the planning and in the drafting stage from

Australia, where industrial arbitration has been

in operation for over sixty years. But [said the

Minister], we do not claim that the Bill is

perfect and we do not believe that the Ordinance

will operate for any great length of time without

amendments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2634</b></font><br><br>



We  will,  of  course, watch its operation  most

carefully  and  I  draw the  attention  of  this

Assembly to clause 87 . . .' etc, etc.





<br><br>The  point I wish to make is this. The  Minister

when  he  introduced  this Bill  did  not  claim

perfection for the Bill. He said he realised its

limitations. He said that after the operation of

the  Bill  for a sufficient period of  time,  he

would  introduce in this Assembly the  necessary

legislation in order to make it, if  I  may  use

the  phrase,  more perfect than it was  when  he

originally moved the Bill. Mr Speaker,  in  the

Industrial  Relations  Ordinance,  there  is   a

provision  in the Ordinance, which is  mandatory

in  my view, which states that the President  of

the  Court  shall submit to the  Assembly  every

year  a  report of the working of the Court  and

its  impact upon the State and labour relations.

Sir,  I  myself have not sighted this report.  I

thought I might have overlooked it, and  I  rang

up  the Clerk to the Legislative Assembly and he

told  me  that,  as  far  as  the  Assembly  was

concerned,  no  such report had  been  received.

Whether the President is guilty of an affront to

this  Assembly  in  not obeying  the  provisions

contained in the Ordinance is a matter which you

yourself  will have to decide, and which  I  ask

you  to decide at the proper time. But all  that

the Assembly now knows is that the President  of

the   Court  has  not  fulfilled  his  statutory

obligation and has not reported to the Assembly.

I  had  hoped that such a report would be  avail

able, because the first report of the Court is a

very  important document. A lot  of  people  are

waiting   to   see  this  report,  because   the

prosperity of this island, I venture to suggest,

depends on the working of this Court and on  the

impact  it  has upon employer/employee  relation

ship.  The  Minister said he wished to introduce

the rule of law where the rule of the jungle was

prevailing.  I agreed with him on that.  So  you

will  therefore appreciate how anxiously we were

waiting for this report from the President which

he  has not sent us. As the Government says that

the  Industrial Arbitration Court will  continue

to play an important part in fulfilling its role

of  ensuring  that  there should  be  industrial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2635</b></font><br><br>

justice,  I  think  it  is pertinent  to  inquire

whether this Court is, in fact, playing its  part

in  such a way that industrial peace with justice

will obtain in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am going to suggest to the

Minister  for  Labour, under whose portfolio  the

Court  comes,  that  very  serious  consideration

should  be  given to the set-up of the Industrial

Arbitration  Court  and  the  manner   in   which

industrial  disputes  are enabled  to  reach  the

Court  so that a position is reached in Singapore

where  this  Court  will  be  looked  upon   with

confidence and respect in the same way  that  our

Courts of Law are being looked upon in Singapore.

Mr  Speaker, in my view, the setup of the  Court

is wrong. Quite frankly, I must tell the Minister

for  Labour that the set-up of the Court is  such

that  it  cannot inspire confidence, and its  per

formances  during the last 15 or  16  months  are

such that it cannot inspire confidence. The first

point  I  wish  to  draw  the  attention  of  the

Minister  for  Labour to is this.  There  is  the

President of the Court who is appointed under the

Ordinance  with  the powers and privileges  of  a

Supreme Court Judge conferred upon Supreme  Court

Judges  by the Constitution. But I understand - and

here   I   am  subject  to  correction - that   the

President  is  in  fact on a contract  for  three

years.  If  I  am correct in that statement,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I ask the Minister for Labour  how

it is that this officer, who has the status of  a

High  Court  Judge, who has all  the  powers  and

privileges  of  a  High  Court  Judge  under  our

Constitution -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Farrer Park

might  agree with me when I say that he is  going

into too much detail. As I have indicated, we are

dealing with the general policy of the Government

in  these matters. These details, if he wishes to

press  the  point, can be raised  in  some  other

manner, by a notice of a motion or by a speech on

the  Adjournment.  We  are  now  on  the  general

policy.  If  he  can convince  me  that  that  is

general policy, I will allow him to continue. But

I think he is going into too much detail.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2636</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg to submit that in so far as

His Excellency's speech is concerned, he has pin-pointed the fact that the Industrial Arbitration

Court will continue to play an important part in

fulfilling its role of ensuring industrial peace

with  justice. Mr Speaker, Sir, the  Government

is  committed to industrial peace with  justice.

The  instrument by which industrial  peace  with

justice  in Singapore is to be achieved  is  the

Industrial  Arbitration  Court.  Therefore,  the

Industrial Arbitration Court is a very important

adjunct  of  the  Government.  I  think  it   is

necessary  for  the House to understand  whether

the composition of the Court is of such a nature

that  it could bring about industrial peace with

justice. What I, wish to show to the House,  Mr

Speaker, is that, although the House as a  whole

has  agreed that this is the: best way to do it,

the  set-up of the Court at the moment  is  such

that if Government entrusts industrial peace  to

this Court, it must fail.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

made  his  point.  The  general  policy  of  the

Government   is   to  establish  an   Industrial

Arbitration  Court  so  that  there  should   be

industrial  peace with justice.  With  that  the

hon.  Member is in perfect agreement. It is only

with the details, how the Arbitration Court  has

been  set  up, that the Member for  Farrer  Park

disagrees.  That is certainly a detail  which  I

think  the  Member could pursue  on  some  other

occasion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not a detail

in  the  sense that I am trying to illustrate  a

point.  Unless these details are brought to  the

notice  of  the  Minister, it  will  just  be  a

statement  of opinion by me. If I say the  Court

is  not performing the function for which it was

instituted,  it  is merely an expression  of  my

opinion.  But  to  back up  that  expression  of

opinion, I thought if I gave a few instances  of

why  the Court cannot be the instrument by which

industrial  peace with justice can  be  achieved

under  the present set-up. I would have made  my

point. That is all I wish to do Mr Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought the Member was

going  a  little further than that. He is  going

into details of what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2637</b></font><br><br>

Ordinance  itself says. I think  he  started  off

with the President, and I suppose he could go  on

with  other  details  as to  how  the  Court  now

functions. All he need say, I think, is  that  in

his opinion the Court as now set up will not,  to

use the words of the speech, fulfil its role that

there  should be industrial peace with  justice',

because under its present constitution it is  not

made  for  it. But if the hon. Member  goes  into

greater detail, then I think I will have to over-rule him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I do not wish to pursue the

President any more, but I wish to touch upon  the

Court.  The  Court consists of the President  and

two members, one appointed by the employees' side

and  the other appointed by the employers'  side.

There  are  two panels. Under the Ordinance,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it is a statutory obligation  that

the  Minister  must consult the  Singapore  Trade

Union  Congress on the appointment of  the  panel

for  the  employees'  side. When  this  Bill  was

debated  before  the House, there  was  only  one

Singapore Trade Union Congress to which all trade

unions were affiliated. Since the passing of that

Ordinance, there are now two general trade unions

competing   for  affiliation  of  trade   unions.

Therefore,   Mr   Speaker,  if  the   Government

persists  in this Ordinance without amending  it,

so far as the

employees  themselves  are  concerned,  they  are

going to be dissatisfied because, as I understand

it,  there  is  another trade  union  asking  for

registration - the  S.A.T.U.  If  the   provisions

relating to the composition of the Court is  that

only  the  Singapore  Trade Union  Congress  gets

representation, then, so far as the employees who

seek  affiliation with the other trade union  are

concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir, they are  not  going

to  have much respect for the Court. That is  the

point I am trying to make to the Government, that

these things will have to be looked into again by

the  Government  if  they  want  this  Court   to

function  in a way which will give confidence  to

all the

workers in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I wish

to  touch  upon  is this, that there  is  in  the

Ordinance a provision which says



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2638</b></font><br><br>

that   the  Court  will  administer  industrial

justice   according   to   equity   and    good

conscience.   Mr  Speaker,   in   a   business

community such as ours, where the rule  of  law

prevails and where the business community  must

know well in advance what is going to happen to

them  and  their business, it is important  for

them  to know that in their relationships  with

their employees some sort of stability will  be

provided  for them by the law of the land.  One

of   the   difficulties  which  the   Singapore

business  community is now  experiencing  as  a

result of this Industrial Arbitration Court  is

this;  that  the  Court  could  interpret  that

particular provision in the Ordinance  to  mean

that  the  Court can over-ride the general  provisions of the law prevailing in Singapore. For

instance, Sir, employers must know what are the

results of a dismissal, what are the results of

a  termination of service, what should  be  the

relationship   between  an  employer   and   an

employee  in these matters. All these  are  matters  governed  by  the law and  employers  and

employees regulate their relationship according

to  the law. What I want to ask the Minister is

this.  Does he think the Industrial Arbitration

Court  should  give decisions contrary  to  the

general law of the land? For instance,  I  wish

to  cite two cases. There was the Kerala  Bandu

case.  The point that went up to the Industrial

Arbitration Court was whether the dismissal  of

a  particular employee was justified. The Court

held  it  was justified, but ordered  that  the

employer  should pay the employee  $2,000.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, neither in equity nor in law have

I  heard  a  court  say that  a  dismissal  was

justified and then go on to order compensation.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think perhaps the Member

for  Farrer  Park is now going very,  very  far

away  from the ambit of this debate. That is  a

point  he  can  make if and when he  takes  the

matter  further and urges amending legislation.

But  we are now on general policies and  if  he

goes  into details like that, he is going  into

the detailed workings of this particular Court,

which  I  do  not  think  is  correct  in  this

particular debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2639</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Very well, Sir, so be it. Sir, the

Minister himself has promised some amendments  to

the  Industrial Relations Ordinance, and when the

time  comes  there will be a number of amendments

to this Ordinance from the Opposition. But what I

wish  to urge upon the Government, Sir, is  this.

In  the matter of industrial relationships, it is

important for the Minister to send immediately to

the  Industrial Arbitration Court  those  matters

which  affect the general public at large. We  do

not  wish  strikes in institutions  of  a  public

character,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. I am  not  talking

about institutions which are merely private,  but

about  institutions which have a public character

and  which, if not allowed to function  properly,

will  affect the national economy. In  all  those

cases,  I  beg of the Minister to use his  powers

under the Industrial Relations Ordinance and send

them up immediately to the Arbitration Court;  we

have  had one or two such instances and  we  have

had  complaints  that the trade and  commerce  of

this place was adversely affected because it  was

not possible to get proper banking facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly I wish to touch upon the question of the

Singapore River. The Minister for Finance has had

second  thoughts on the Singapore  River  Scheme.

Sir,  when  I  was in the City Council,  a  Joint

Singapore River Working Committee was set  up  on

which   there  were  a  number  of  City  Council

officials. The City Council itself was interested

in the Singapore River not as an artery of trade,

but  as  a  river  suffering pollution  from  the

surrounding areas. It was from that point of view

that  the  Singapore City Council was interested.

So that the cost of the scheme amounting to $2 or

$3  millions, is partly for a commercial purpose,

and  partly for a sanitary purpose. So I  beg  of

the  Minister,  whatever second thoughts  he  may

have on the industrial or commercial use to which

the,  river  is being put and if he  thinks  that

there  is  no need to spend money on  the  scheme

from that point of view, I still do urge upon him

to  consider the sanitary aspect of the Singapore

River and get on with that side of the project as

quickly as possible, because the Singapore  River

flows  through probably the densest part  of  the

city.

<br><br>6.53 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, today we are debating the policy statement

of  the  Government read by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara on the 31st of October this year. In the

first  place, I must express my view and regret

that  the  present  policy  statement  of   the

Government  as  read  by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  is not as good as it was last year,  as

it  was stated in last year's speech that  that

was a year of construction. In the meantime, we

cannot  see  anywhere in this policy  statement

how much the Government has done in respect  of

construction and achievements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker; Order. I would suggest that the

hon. Member continue his speech and do not have

any   concern   with  the  interpreters.   Just

continue  his speech as though he is  making  a

speech.  I  understand  the  Member  has   some

concern with the interpretation, but I  do  not

think he ought to worry about that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the P.A.P.'s so-called Five-Year

Plan and Four-Year Plan are very attractive and

impressive. They are great promises made by the

Government  to the people. But from the  speech

of  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, we can see that

up  to now all they have said has gone with the

wind. Mr Speaker, Sir, we can clearly see that

in  the  past few years there have  been  rapid

changes in the political field in Singapore and

we  can  also see the change in the sitting  of

this  House. It is seen clearly that the P.A.P.

of  today is no longer welcomed by the  people.

It is only a P.A.P. controlled by a few leaders

of  the  Party. But our clever Prime  Minister,

for  the  sake of saving their political  lives

has  done all he can and employed all means  to

bring  about a phoney merger in order  to  save

themselves   from  political  bankruptcy.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in 1959, when  the  P.A.P. was

contesting the general election, it  made  many

promises  to the people of Singapore,  but  all

these promises have now been forgotten. Because

of  that,  we have the Barisan Sosialis  today.

Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2641</b></font><br><br>

Speaker,  Sir,  the people of  Singapore  demand

constitutional expansion and progress. They want

to  have  more democratic rights. They  want  to

have a complete and true merger, but -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated that we

cannot debate merger at all. Now the hon. Member

is touching on merger. He must not do that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am just touching on it in passing.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the hon. Member can

touch  on it even in passing. I think I  stopped

the  Deputy  Prime Minister from even mentioning

it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I would like to supplement what my colleague

the  Member  for  Moulmein  has  said  about  the

Government  resorting to the police and  military

forces  to suppress the workers in Singapore.  In

the  last  two days we can see how the Government

has  made  use  of  the police and  the  military

forces   to   deal  with  the  Work  Brigade   in

Singapore.  I  have  heard  in  this  House   the

Minister  for Finance saying that the  Government

is  dealing with the Work Brigade, this being the

fourth round against the Barisan Sosialis. Now  I

want to bring up some facts and evidence to prove

that  those who are playing politics in the  Work

Brigade  are  not  the Barisan  members  but  the

P.A.P. themselves. Now the 1,000-odd Members  of

the Work Brigade live just like the inmates of  a

concentration camp. Every move of the members and

every  word'  uttered by them has to  be  watched

carefully.  Some  P.A.P. members  in  the   Work

Brigade  try  to  bully the other  members.  They

leave  the camps at any time they like.  They  do

not  care  for discipline and they do  what  they

like in the camps. They have every opportunity to

move about freely. But the Superintendent and the

Director of the Work Brigade have done nothing to

stop  this.  We  have  heard  recently  from  the

Minister  for National Development that  some  of

the   members   are  to  be  sent   for   special

disciplinary  training. Now I want  to  bring  up

some facts to prove that -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2642</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid the hon. Member

is going into details once again. He must not do

that.  We  are  now on general policies.  If  he

feels strongly about the Work Brigade, I suggest

he  file  a  notice of a motion  and  all  these

details can then be discussed. There is  no  Commission  of  Inquiry  on the  Work  Brigade,  is

there?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: No.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am just trying to bring up some notes for

the Commission of Inquiry on Political Nepotism.

I  have  now  a letter containing  a  few  words

written by the Member for Jalan Besar who is now

the Parliamentary Secretary to the leader of the

Paya Lebar Camp.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member

must  understand me. I have indicated that  this

is   a  debate  on  general  Government  policy.

Details of the nature the hon. Member wishes  to

bring  to the notice of the Assembly can  always

be  brought to the notice of the Assembly in the

proper  way - that  is  by a motion.  All  we  are

dealing  with  now  is  the  general  policy  of

Government. He can attack the general policy  of

Government  in relation to the Work Brigade.  By

all  means, do so. But all these details  cannot

be ventilated now. Mr Wong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  like to have your permission  to

read just two lines.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that a matter of detail in

connection with the Work Brigade?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If it is a matter of detail in

connection  with  the  Work  Brigade,  the  hon.

Member cannot do so. I have indicated that  this

is a general debate on policy. A detailed debate

on any specific subject can only take place on a

separate motion or on some other occasion - we had

the  occasion which has passed, and that is  the

discussion   in  the  Committee  of   Supply - but

certainly not in this particular debate which is

on general policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2643</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what  I  want to say concerns  the  general

policy.  In  this note it is stated - Comrade  Yong

Siang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> On a point of order. The

hon. Member is not on general policy.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must be

warned that if that note is, in fact, related  to

a  detail - and  if  he reads it - I  must  rule  him

completely  out of order and I will have  to  act

under Standing Order 55.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in Order to get the support of the English-educated,  such as the Government  servants,  the

P.A.P. restored the pay cut which was imposed  by

the  Minister  for Finance about two  years  ago.

Every  year from now onwards, an extra $5 million

will  have to be paid to the Government servants.

We   can  see  clearly  that  this  move  of  the

Government  was aimed at getting the  support  of

the  Government servants. When the  pay  cut  was

imposed, we knew nothing about it because we were

not  consulted  on it at all. At that  time,  the

unions  of the civil servants were not consulted.

But  at  the present time, the P.A.P. leadership,

which  is facing political bankruptcy, is  trying

to  get  the support of these civil servants  and

that is why they restored the pay cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that many people who

are  occupying  Crown land in Singapore  have  to

pay   an   increase  in  the  ground  rent,   and

sometimes this is retrospective. This move  is  a

blow  to  the  poor  people  of  Singapore.  The

people  living in Tiong Bahru and Toa Payoh  have

to  pay increased ground rent and assessment. The

ground rent in these areas has increased from  $2

to   $20.  But  so  far  we  have  not  seen  the

Government  taking  steps to  reduce  the  ground

rent.

We  know well the intention of the Government  as

it  has  only restored the pay cut to the  civil

servants just to get

their votes!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the

Chinese schools in the rural areas. It is  stated

in the P.A.P. pamphlet that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2644</b></font><br><br>



it is the policy of the Government to revise the

curriculum  in  the rural schools  by  including

horticulture,  agriculture and  other  practical

subjects.  I  want  to  ask  the  Minister   for

Education  whether the Government has done  this

in  the  course  of the last 2½ years.  Has  the

curriculum in the rural schools been revised  on

the  lines  indicated in the P.A.P. pamphlet?  I

believe  that all teachers in the rural  schools

know very well that this has not been done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chinese schools in the

rural  areas are still in a difficult  position.

Although the Government has promised to give aid

to school development in the rural areas, it has

done  very  little. For example, the  money  for

repairs  and extensions to school buildings  has

to  be raised by the schools concerned. If  they

can  raise  about  $10,000, the Government  will

give  them an equivalent sum of money,  that  is

about $10,000, in aid. But we must know that the

people living in the rural areas are very  badly

off   economically,  and  it  is  therefore  not

possible  for them to give more money  on  education.  On  the other hand, the plans  of  school

buildings have to be approved by the Ministry of

Education,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and   the

Housing  Board,  and they are  usually  approved

after a long time. According to regulations  set

down  by  the  Ministry of Education,  a  school

cannot be erected on land which does not have  a

30-year lease. It is difficult for rural schools

to  have  a 30-year lease on the land.  So  this

policy   of   the   Government   is   indirectly

restricting  the development of  rural  schools,

thereby depriving the people in the rural  areas

of   additional   educational  facilities.   For

example,  in  my constituency, there  are  three

schools which face this difficulty. One of  them

is  the  Hwa  Min Primary School. The  Board  of

Directors  of this school wrote to me  a  letter

saying that they received a summons because  the

school  building  was undergoing  some  repairs.

There  is  another  school, namely  Tan  Chiang,

which  applied for an extension 'to  the  school

building  but it has not received any  approval.

So some 100 school pupils will not be able to go

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2645</b></font><br><br>

the   school  next  year  because  of  the   non-extension  to  the  school  building.  There   is

another school, the Peh Tah Primary School, which

got  an approval from the Lim Yew Hock Government

to extend the school buildings, and it hopes that

this work can be carried out in a short time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on

flooding in the rural areas. In many rural  areas

in  Singapore,  the  drains and  rivers  are  not

looked  after  properly by the Government.  As  a

result,  the rural people are short of  water  in

the  dry season. In the rainy season these  areas

are flooded because the drains and the rivers are

not  cleared.  So the flooding during  the  rainy

season  will cause a great deal of damage to  the

crops  of  the  farmers.  I  want  to  give  some

examples.  One river is in the Thomson  area  running to Aljunied and then to the Kallang area. As

far  as  this river is concerned, all of us  will

remember that in 1954 there was great flooding in

this  area  and three persons lost  their  lives.

There  is another river, the Whampoa River, which

has been neglected by the Government and so it is

choked. Whenever there is rain, there is flooding

in  this area affecting the people living in  the

neighbourhood.   The   people   living   in   the

neighbourhood  of  the two  areas  which  I  have

mentioned have made complaints to the Ministry of

National Development, but in the course  of  some

two years nothing has been done about it. So they

are facing great difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has set up the

Adult Education Board with the aim of wiping  out

illiteracy in Singapore. But according to general

statistics,  there are about 500,000  illiterates

in  Singapore.  This is about  one-third  of  the

population  in  Singapore. I wonder  whether  the

Adult  Education Board has done a great  deal  of

work in getting rid of illiteracy in Singapore. I

wonder whether it has the co-operation of the peo

ple's  organisations, the unions  and  the  rural

people's organisations and associations in wiping

out illiteracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2646</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>7.18 p.m.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was just trying to push matters

in  the initial stage. The work concerning adult

education  was quite satisfactory in  the  rural

schools, but later on, especially at the present

juncture, adult education classes are  in  existence only in name because the number of students

is  dwindling away. Some of the classes  had  to

stop  because of the lack of students. Now  what

has  caused all this? The answer is very  clear.

The  Government has not thought carefully  about

the  plans and how to carry out the work to  get

rid of illiteracy. On the other hand, it has not

consulted  and  got  the  co-operation  of   the

people's  organisations to get rid of illiteracy

in  Singapore. In November we saw statistics  in

the newspapers that there were only about 11,000

students  in  the adult education classes.  This

number  included  students and  members  of  the

Country  People's  Association  and  the   Rural

Dwellers' Association. Now, I want to  make  use

of  the  statistics mainly to say that  the  Gov

ernment is not giving assistance to those  adult

education  classes run by the people themselves.

As   a   matter  of  fact,  talking  about   the

equipment, as far as I know, the adult education

classes  run by the people's organisations  have

to  make  use of soap-boxes as desks. As regards

the  financial position, the classes run by  the

people's  organisation are  not  very  well  off

because the students studying there do not  have

to  pay very high fees. Yet in spite of this the

Government has not given them financial  aid  or

encouragement.  As  a  result  of  this,  it  is

impossible for them to work in conjunction  with

the Government to get rid of illiteracy. It is a

matter for regret indeed. The Government has not

given them any assistance. Instead there is  one

instance  in  which the office of the  Singapore

Country  People's Association received a  notice

from  the  Government saying that the  classroom

was not suitable for any adult education course.

I   feel  this  policy  of  the  Government   is

incorrect.  It  is  impossible  to  get  rid  of

illiteracy without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2647</b></font><br><br>

getting   the  co-operation  of  the  people   of

Singapore.  It  is only with the co-operation  of

the  people  themselves that  such  work  can  be

carried out satisfactorily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to the people who are

engaged in agricultural activities, the land area

in  Singapore is indeed very limited. It  is  not

suitable for large-scale agricultural activities.

Even   agricultural  production,  such   as   the

planting  of  beans,  is  not  possible  in  this

limited area of land. As far as the production of

food is concerned, Singapore can produce about 40

per   cent   of   the   food   for   consumption.

Agricultural  products  mainly  come  from  other

countries  such as the Federation of Malaya.  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, the former Director of  the

Primary Production Division, Dr Tham Ah Kow, has

said that as a result of the import of vegetables

from  other countries into Singapore, we have  to

spend  about  $50  million a year.  The  area  of

arable  land is only about 38.9 acres. The actual

area of land under cultivation is 19 acres. So we

can see that the production of supplementary food

still  has  some room for improvement.  There  is

still  some  land  for the  people  to  carry  on

expansion  work, but we have not seen the  P.A.P.

Government   doing  anything  to  encourage   and

promote  agricultural  development  in  Singapore

during its office of about 2½ years. There is  no

overall  plan  to  encourage food  production  in

Singapore.  Neither is there any  step  taken  to

encourage  or  to give an impetus to agricultural

activities in Singapore in order to increase food

production  and  to  alleviate  the  unemployment

problem.  The Government is just trying  to  sell

some  pigs and inoculate some chicks, on the face

of   it.  Now  this  superficial  measure  cannot

basically  solve the question of food production,

and  cannot  help the interests of  the  farmers.

Concerning the capital of the farmers  and  their

land   and   the   supply  of  fertilisers,   the

Government still has to do a great deal.  As  far

as  the production of vegetables in Singapore  is

concerned,  leaf  vegetables and root  vegetables

come  to about 570 pikuls per year. According  to

the 1958 report, there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2648</b></font><br><br>

are  11  areas  which are mainly concerned  with

the  production  of food and vegetables,  namely

Potong  Pasir,  Choa Chu Kang, Jurong,  Lim  Chu

Kang,  etc.  As  far  as  leaf  vegetables  are

concerned, Potong Pasir occupies first place  in

the  production  of such vegetables.  The  daily

output is about 20,000 katties, which means that

it produces about 12.3 per cent of the supply of

vegetables  in Singapore. As far as the  farmers

in   Potong  Pasir  are  concerned,   they   are

contributing greatly to the supply  of  food  in

Singapore.  But the conditions under which  they

carry out their production are very bad. In  the

first place, they do not have enough capital. In

the   second   place,   fertilisers   are   very

expensive. Then, because of the middlemen,  they

have  to  lose some money when they  sell  their

produce. The Government was approached by  these

people  to  set up a market for vegetables,  but

the  Ministry concerned has so far done  nothing

about  it,  and  so the farmers engaged  in  the

production of vegetables are still at the  mercy

of  some  private persons who have control  over

the prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the arable land of the

farmers  is  quite  insecure.  This  sense   of

insecurity  has  dealt  a  great  blow  to  the

farmers  in their production. They do not  feel

secure  of  the  land on which they  cultivate.

When  the  Government tabled  the  Agricultural

Leases  Bill, the people of Potong  Pasir  were

told  that  their  land would  be  reserved  as

agricultural  land. But when this  Agricultural

Leases Bill was brought up, the farmers in  the

area I have mentioned could only be sure of the

land  for  12  years. When the  time  comes,  a

review has to be taken of the occupation of the

land.  So  the farmers are not very sure  about

their  land. They do not have a long-term  plan

for  their production and for the expansion  of

their  farm-land. As a result of this, directly

or indirectly, the production of the farmers is

affected.  I wonder whether the Government  has

paid any attention to this state of affairs.  I

wonder  whether it is now taking steps to  look

after  the farmers. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I

would  like  to  touch upon  the  Agricultural

Leases Bill.

he is completely out of order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, I know this Bill has not been passed and

we cannot discuss it at length now. But the Prime

connection with the Agricultural Leases Bill.  He

said at that time that this Bill was intended  to

safeguard the interest of the farmers.

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Agricultural Leases Bill

will be debated in this Assembly. The Member will

have  enough time to reply to the Prime Minister.

Will  the  hon. Member please confine himself  to

the motion?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  at that time the  Prime  Minister

told us that the problem of the farmers would  be

dealt  with  by the farmers' organisation  or  at

mass  rallies  of  the farmers  themselves.  This

point was brought up during the Anson by-election

shortly  before  polling day. At  that  time,  in

order  to  suppress dissatisfaction,  the  P.A.P.

leadership  told  us  that  the  problem  of  the

farmers would be dealt with at mass rallies.  But

now  several  months have passed,  and  I  wonder

whether  the Prime Minister has still the courage

to face the farmers and to hold mass rallies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for National

Development  said  last week  during  the  Budget

debate   that   the  rate  of  compensation   was

reasonable. That is to say, there was  some  sort

of  revision to the rate of compensation. But  we

can  tell  him  now  that  the  present  rate  of

compensation is based on the old rate made by the

old  Government  in  1956.  The  policy  and  the

regulations are the same. In the meantime, the so-called  revision is nothing but  a  bluff.  There

fore,  this  question of the rate of compensation

is  very important, because the Government is now

setting up a satellite town in the Toa Payoh area

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2650</b></font><br><br>

affects   many   people  in  this   area.   The

Government is now pushing through its policy of

setting  up  a satellite town in Toa  Payoh.  I

want to bring up some concrete illustrations to

show that the Minister for National Development

is  trying  to bluff the people by saying  that

the  revision  of  the rate of compensation  is

reasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Government

has  announced that it will set up a  satellite

town  in Toa Payoh, this announcement has given

rise  to great anxiety among the people  living

there.  In the meantime, the livelihood of  the

people living there is quite insecure. When the

Government  is developing and trying  to  carry

out  the  plan of setting up a satellite  town,

the interests of the people and the property of

the  people  are greatly affected. That  is  to

say,  the  work  and  the  maintenance  of  the

livelihood  of  these people  are  affected.  I

wonder  whether the Government has  given  much

thought   to   it  and  given  them  reasonable

compensation. At present the Government is  not

giving  full consideration to the views of  the

people    living   in   the   area,   or    the

representatives  or  the organisations  of  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I was still with

the  P.A.P., it was on the 3rd of May this year

that  I  sent a memorandum to the President  of

the Housing Board in which I touched upon three

concrete points regarding the interest  of  the

people  affected by the plan of  setting  up  a

satellite  town.  But this memorandum  was  not

given  full  consideration. The first  point  I

raised  was  that the rate of compensation  was

not  reasonable and that the Government  should

revise  it  so that the people concerned  would

not  suffer too much loss. The second  point  I

raised  was  that since the Housing  Board  was

increasing  the rents in general,  it  was  not

proper,  and  so this move should be  reviewed.

The  policy of increasing rents should  now  be

withdrawn.  The third point I raised  was  that

the  Housing  Board should set up a  Committee,

including  representatives from all  concerned,

and  get  the  opinions and views  of  all  the

people affected in order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2651</b></font><br><br>

to  solve the problems affecting the interests of

the  people  affected by the  resettlement  plan.

Although later on the Housing Board did set up  a

consultative  committee,  it  however  held  only

three meetings. At that time, some decisions were

made   by  the  Committee,  and,  as  far  as   I

understand,  such decisions have  been  submitted

for   the  consideration  of  the  Minister   for

National  Development. But there were no definite

results  about this. So you can see that  when  I

was still in the P.A.P. I had given my views,  as

I should, and it was not correct for the Minister

for   National  Development  to  say   that   the

dissatisfaction of the people affected  has  come

about as a result of agitation by the Members  of

the  Barisan Sosialis, because at that time there

was  no  such  Party  as  the  Barisan  Sosialis.

Lastly,  when he said that it was we who agitated

the dissatisfaction of the people, it was really

incorrect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Government has

no  reasonable solutions to the problems  of  the

people who have been asked to quit, and if  there

is no reasonable rate of compensation, then I can

tell the Government that if it wants to carry out

a  long-term  plan,  it  will  not  get  the  co-operation  of  the  people.  Without   such   co-operation,  it  is impossible to  carry  out  its

plans. I can say that it will not be easy to  ask

the  people  living  in Toa  Payoh,  without  reasonable  compensation, to move  away  from  their

homes. We all know that the people living in  the

rural  areas  are a very bad lot. They  are  very

poor.  In  the Toa Payoh area, the people  living

there  are also poor, as are all other rural  people.  Some of the people living in the Toa  Payoh

area are engaged in agricultural activities, some

in  industrial  activities, and some  in  cottage

industries.  They all belong to the  lower-income

group.  They  are the poor people  of  Singapore.

They  have  to  work very hard to earn  a  meagre

living. Some of them are still struggling  for  a

livelihood, and they are enduring a great deal of

suffering.  They can only ask the  Government  to

try  and alleviate their sufferings in life. They

can  only ask the Government to improve their lot

because they just cannot carry on in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2652</b></font><br><br>



such a state of poverty. Before such things  are

done,   they  just  cannot  believe   that   the

Government is for the good of the people. It  is

a  socialist Government that should  look  after

people  of  this type. As far as the farmers  in

other   areas  are  concerned,  the  same   also

applies.  They  have to work hard  and  irrigate

their land by sweat and blood. The land is their

asset. It is also their lifeline. The people  of

Toa  Payoh area have a special feature which  is

similar to all rural people living in the world.

That is poverty. Poverty is a typical feature of

all the rural people in Singapore as well as the

people  living in the rural areas in the  world.

Because  they are suffering a great  deal,  they

cannot carry on as farmers. They have to work as

hawkers and do odd jobs or engage themselves  in

cottage industries. These are the conditions  of

the  people living in the Toa Payoh area. So the

Government,  when carrying out  the  plan  of  a

satellite  town,  must take  into  consideration

such  facts  and the background  of  the  people

living  in  this  area. I want  to  give  a  few

illustrations  to show that it  is  unreasonable

for  the Government to stick to the present rate

of  compensation. For example,  an  attap  house

with  plank  walls and a cement floor  can  only

bring in about $500 as compensation. Now, when a

similar house is to be constructed, it will cost

about  $2,000. So the people concerned  can  get

only  one-quarter of what they have  spent.  How

can  you  say that this rate of compensation  is

reasonable? In the meantime, you have the durian

and  rambutan trees which can bring in only  $20

to  $30  each tree as compensation.  Now,  these

people have spent years to grow these trees, and

yet  they can get only $20 to $30 for each tree.

How  can you say that this compensation  is  reasonable?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to bring

up  another  point concerning light  industries.

This  again affects the people living in  places

where satellite towns are to be set up. Some  of

the  people engaged in light industries  in  the

Toa  Payoh  area are carrying out  rattan  work.

These  people  number about  5,000.  So  5,000

people depend on rattan work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2653</b></font><br><br>

for their livelihood. They are part and parcel of

the  people affected by the satellite plan of the

Government. If the Government does not take  into

account the possibility that these people may  be

out  of  jobs, then these people will go bankrupt

economically; and if  this should happen at  all,

it  will  also  affect  the light  industries  of

Singapore.  As  far  as  economic  activities  in

Singapore are concerned, rattan work as  a  light

industry  does play an important part. We  cannot

deny  that we do not produce our rattan  locally.

The  rattan comes mainly from Burma, Thailand and

Indonesia. But when the rattan has been  imported

into Singapore, it is processed locally before it

is  exported to other foreign countries. So  this

rattan  work and processing do play an  important

part  in our economic life. Some people are  also

engaged  in  making furniture and other  utensils

from rattan, but the Government is not giving any

assistance to the people so engaged. Although the

Minister for Finance has said that he will set up

a  sort  of  commission to look  into  the  light

industries  of Singapore, I wonder  when  such  a

commission  will be set up by the Government  and

when  the  light  industries  of  Singapore  will

receive the attention and care of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I only hope that the

Minister for National Development will take  into

consideration  the views of the people  regarding

the  development of the Toa Payoh area,  so  that

the  Government's beautiful plan  will  meet  the

requirements of the people.

<br><br>7.52 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, we have entered

the  second  day of debate an the speech  by  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara. During the course of  the

debate,  Members of the Barisan Sosialis and  the

United   People's   Party  have   levelled   many

criticisms  at the Government without giving,  at

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2654</b></font><br><br>

same  time, constructive suggestions. Such a  way

is  not  contributing any help to the formulation

of  Government policy. Here I wish to  point  out

that  Members  of the Barisan Sosialis  have  one

common purpose, i.e., to distort facts. They know

that  at present many things are being undertaken

by the Government, yet they want to criticise the

Government.  Their  purpose is  to  show  to  the

people that they have done something when the Gov

ernment's work on a certain project is completed.

I  believe this kind of tactic cannot achieve its

end  because we know that since 1959,  there  has

been a popularly elected Government and the condi

tions  of  the people have been raised.  If  they

want  to  play political tricks in order to  fool

the people, their actions will not be allowed  by

the people. If they are really concerned with the

interests  of the people, I hope they  will  help

the  present Government, in other words, to  help

meet  the requirements of the people and not  try

to  hinder  the Government when it is  trying  to

carry  out  all  kinds  of  work.  Their  present

attitude  and actions are not doing any  good  to

help  the  people of Singapore. The  Members  who

have  spoken have also touched on the poverty  of

the  people  at present. To sum up the  cause  of

this  poverty, it is due to economic factors.  We

should try to understand better that poverty  not

only exists in the rural areas, but also in other

areas too. There are many factors contributing to

this,  and  this  situation  will  lead  to   two

possibilities.  One is bright and  the  other  is

dim.  But without the darker side, without night,

we  cannot  see  and  we  cannot  understand  the

lighter  or the brighter side. Without  night  we

cannot  know  day-time; therefore there  are  two

sides  to every thing. For instance, it  is  true

that many people in the rural areas are poor. But

in  the city areas such conditions are also true.

We  cannot say that the hawkers, taxi drivers and

the  rest of them who live in the city areas  are

rich.  In other words, there are also poor people

living in the city areas. Therefore, in order  to

understand  the background of our local  economy,

we  have  to  study  Singapore's  geography,  its

environments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2655</b></font><br><br>

and the way of living of the people of Singapore.

We  all know that Singapore had been in the  past

under   colonial  rule.  Only  recently  it   has

achieved internal self-government -
