<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, according

to  the  Monthly  Digest for  January,  1972,  the

number   of   Malays,  from  1969  to   1972,   is

increasing.  What is the reason for the  reduction

in the collection of the Fitrah?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Fitrah

collection  from  1969  to 1971  showed  a  slight

decrease.  This was mainly due to a  reduction  in

collections  from certain groups of  Muslims.  For

example, a number of Muslim civilian workers  were

affected  by  the  closure  of  British  bases  in

Singapore,  and numerous Malaysian army  personnel

also  left Singapore, resulting in a reduction  of

Fitrah collections. This is shown in the following

statistics:

<div align="center"><b>(Request for favourable consideration)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs,  in  view   of   the

political and economic stability in Singapore, if

the  Government will consider favourably  granting

Singapore  on or before August, 1945, hut  who  do

not possess birth certificates: (ii) whose spouses

and   children  are  citizens:  or   (iii)   whose

brothers, sisters and parents are citizens.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. Wong Lin Ken):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of

consideration  for the granting of citizenship  to

applicants who were born in Singapore but  had  no

documentary proof of it had already been  answered

by  Government in Parliament on 10th  July,  1968,

and  it is not proposed to alter the position. The

Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



Labour,  who  was  then in charge  of  citizenship

matters,  stated  that  the Government  could  not

waive   its  citizenship  regulations  for   these

people.  If these rules were waived, then  anybody

could claim the right to citizenship by professing

birth  in  Singapore without documentary  proof  -

whether   true  or  false.  During  the   national

registration exercise, it was revealed that  there

were  many  people who claimed birth in Singapore,

but  on  investigations were found not to be  born

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government is prepared to consider

sympathetically  citizenship applications  from  a

person  who  is the remaining non-citizen  in  the

family, provided that he would not become a burden

to the State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall that in October, 1970, I

announced the Ministry's decision to transform the

Telecommunications  Department  into  a  statutory

board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



not  later  than April 1972. This  Bill  seeks  to

establish   a   statutory  board  known   as   the

Telecommunication Authority of Singapore. Before I

elaborate  on the provisions of this Bill,  may  I

give  a brief summary o the developments that have

taken  place and are taking place in the  Telecoms

Department,  and the rationale for  reconstituting

the Department into a statutory authority?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of telecommunication services in

Singapore  over the last 10 years has  been  at  a

rapid   rate.   In  the  international   telegraph

service,  the number of messages handled increased

by   65   per   cent  in  1971  over   1966.   The

international  telex service and the international

telephone  service increased by 630 per  cent  and

503 per cent respectively over the same period. In

1966,  the  Department's revenue  was  only  $19.5

million, but last year (1971) revenue increased to

$54.7 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of countries with which Singapore has

established traffic service has also increased. In

1966,   Singapore   had  international   telephone

service  with 74 countries, and this increased  to

147  countries  last  year. In  the  international

telex  service, the number of countries  increased

from  64 to 126. The public telegraph service  is,

however, on a world-wide basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the international telegraph service, the

growth  is expected to be maintained at  a  steady

rate  of  7 to 9 per cent per annum over the  next

five  years and around 4 to 6 per cent after 1977.

The  growth  in  international  telex  service  is

expected to be maintained at the high rate  of  30

per  cent per annum over the next five years,  and

thereafter we may expect a growth rate of about 25

to  30 per cent per annum, as in the case of  most

developed  countries.  The  growth  rate  of   the

international telephone traffic in other parts  of

the  world is about 20 per cent per annum, and  we

can  expect  our  own growth  to  be  around  this

figure, too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet these demands, the Department has

implemented certain projects, including subscriber

trunk   dialling   to  West  Malaysia,   automatic

national telex



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



exchange,  and  the  establishment  of  an   earth

satellite station at Sentosa. In the near  future,

the Department will also be providing an automatic

international  telex  exchange  and  an  automatic

message  switching system. A second earth  station

working  to the Pacific Ocean satellite is already

in the final planning stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the high rate of growth and fast changing

technology  in  communications, it is  clear  that

there  must be radical changes in the organisation

and  management to cope with the rapid changes and

challenges in the years ahead. An expert from  the

International Telecommunications Union was invited

to   advise  us  on  the  reorganisation  of   the

telecommunication   services    and    his    firm

recommendation  was that the Telecorns  Department

should  be  converted into an autonomous statutory

organisation, which was accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now summarise the main features of this

Bill.   The   Telecommunication  Authority   shall

consist of a Chairman, a General Manager and  such

other members totalling not less than five and not

more than nine, in accordance with Clause 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority shall have the exclusive privilege

of   operating   telecommunication   services   in

Singapore  with the exception of broadcasting  and

television  services  and the  domestic  telephone

service and telecommunication services operated by

the  Singapore  Armed Forces and the  Police.  The

main  object  of  the  Authority  is  to  provide,

operate,  and  develop telecommunication  services

within  and  outside Singapore, and to  co-operate

with  other  international  authorities  for   the

expansion  and  improvement of such services.  The

Authority  has  power to decide on charges,  rates

and fees for providing telecommunication services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority may, with the approval of the

Minister,  borrow, raise capital and  also  invest

its surplus funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is provided in clause 42 that the Authority

shall  issue  to Government ordinary  stock  of  a

total nominal value to be agreed upon between  the

Minister for Finance and the Authority.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Annual Report and audited Statement of

Accounts  of  the Authority shall be presented  to

Parliament under clauses 33 and 34. The  staff  of

the  Telecorns Department shall be transferred  to

the  service  of the Authority on  terms  no  less

favourable  than  those they  enjoyed  immediately

prior to transfer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the conversion of the Department into an

autonomous statutory body, I am confident that the

Telecommunication Authority of Singapore  will  be

able  to  provide Singapore with a more  efficient

telecommunication  service,   and   thus   enhance

continued  economic and commercial development  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of

<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Estimates of Expenditure of

Singapore  for the financial year 1st April  1972,

to  31st March, 1973, contained in Paper Cmd. 3 of

1972.  1  shall take the total for  each  head  of

expenditure  as it appears in the last  column  of

the Abstract of Estimated Expenditure on pages  49

and 50 of the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure

in  respect of which amendments stand on the Order

Paper Supplement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0104 -



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0104 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2010.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is moved to solicit

information. A vote of $600 was set aside for  the

last  financial year 197 1-72 for the rental of  a

photo-copying machine. I would like  to  know  how

much  of this vote was actually spent during  that

financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is advocating mechanisation

in  our various departments. Has the department of

Judicature a photo-copying machine or not? If not,

would  it  not be cheaper to purchase  one  rather

than  renting a photo-copying machine at the  cost

of $600 a year?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, based on the demand

for  copies  of exhibits, affidavits,  wills,  and

other  legal  documents,  from  legal  firms   and

litigants during 1971, it is considered economical

for  the  present to hire a photo-copying  machine

than  to purchase one. Besides, the company  which

is  presently  renting out  this  machine  to  the

Judiciary   does  not  sell  this  machine   which

apparently  has  been  found  to  produce   better

quality  copies and in less time. The  Member  for

Telok   Blangah  will  appreciate  that  a  better

quality reproduction of documents is required  for

use in our courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of exhibits, affidavits, wills, and other

legal  documents  supplied  to  legal  firms   and

litigants,  were  supplied at 30 cents  each.  The

cost was about 15 cents per copy, and so there was

a  net  profit of 15 cents per copy.  In  1971,  a

total  sum  of $11,674.50 was received as  revenue

for  making  copies of documents.  Expenditure  on

rental,   plus  the  cost  of  paper  and  copying

charges,  amounted  to $6,312.58;  leaving  a  net

profit  of  $5,361.92  from  the  rental  of  this

machine for 1971.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the  Minister's explanation and the fact that some

money was made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



out of this machine, I beg leave to my other

point, that is, the extent of withdraw,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,405,580 for Head 0104 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0108 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0108 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item concerns accidents involving

Government  vehicles. I would be grateful  if  the

Minister  for  Law and National Development  would

care  to  indicate the number of vehicles involved

in  accidents in the last financial year, the cost

of damage to these vehicles, which departments are

involved,  and  whether  action  has  been   taken

against  those found negligent, and  what  is  the

extent of injuries to persons, if any.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, altogether 192

claims   in   respect   of   accidents   involving

Government vehicles were received during the  last

financial year. Of these, the Ministry of  Defence

was  concerned  in 97 cases and the  total  amount

paid  out was $36,588.98. Second, came the  Public

Health  Department with 43 cases, and  the  amount

paid  was  $20,742.18. Third on the list  was  the

Police,  with 20 cases involving $6,552.19.  There

were   others   like  the  General  Post   Office,

Hospitals,  Prisons  Department,  Civil   Aviation

Department, and the Customs and Excise Department.

I  do not think I should bother the House with the

details  but, in all, the number of cases was  180

and the total sum paid out was about $70,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some outstanding claims, and the

estimated amounts involved are as follows:  Public

Health  Department, 4, about $2,800;  Ministry  of

Defence,  7, about $13,000; Police Department,  I,

about  $3,000;  making a total of about  12  cases

outstanding.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister has not replied to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



my  other  point, that is, the extent of injuries

to persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of claims, I note that there were 97

cases  involving  vehicles from  the  Ministry  of

Defence, 43 from the Public Health Department, and

20  from the Police. The total number is less than

200. But last year this House had occasion to hear

Members' views that drivers of Government vehicles

should take more care on the roads. Much has  been

done  to prevent accidents, by way of road  safety

campaigns  as well as industrial safety campaigns.

Therefore, to this extent, I would like to inquire

whether  the  Ministries or departments  concerned

would  seriously take note of the number of  cases

involving  them, because to my mind the figure  is

still quite high.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am afraid I do not have

particulars of personal injuries, which the Member

has  asked for in respect of these cases.  As  for

his  comments on the standard of driving and care,

there  are  so many departments concerned  that  I

would  not  wish  to add further to  what  he  has

remarked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0108 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub- head 2006.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am seeking information similar to what I

sought  just  now. Since this item concerns  legal

fees,  claims and Costs for all departments,  will

the Minister concerned inform this House as to the

number   of   claims   and  costs   awarded,   the

departments  involved, and what  action  has  been

taken  against  those  found  guilty,  wholly   or

partially?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, all the legal fees, claims and

costs   relate   to   cases   against   Government

departments, that is to say, claims for damages in

respect of tort and for breach of contract.  These

sums  are  payable  when the  court  decides  that

Government is liable or that there is a settlement

where we admit liability.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



These sums would include fees for claimants'

solicitors and the disbursements incurred in

making the claims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of the departments involved and the

amounts  paid for the last financial year  are  as

follows. Again, I am sure the Member does not want

details in respect of every department, but I will

read them out if he wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence again takes the lead,

with  about $50,000 paid out. Second, Police,  for

which $15,200 was paid out. Strangely enough,  the

Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau is third on

the  list,  with  $11,658.50 paid  out.  The  rest

consists  of small amounts each, about  $2,000  or

less.   The   Public  Works  Department,   $2,230;

Prisons,   $2,900;   the  Ministry   of   National

Development, $2,204; Ministry of Foreign  Affairs,

$437,  and the Attorney-General's Chambers,  $184.

The  total expenditure as at 15th March, 1972, was

$87,680.83.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 11 suits outstanding. I think the

Member knows that litigation in court takes  time.

Nine  suits  are against the Ministry of  Defence,

and  two against the Public Works Department.  The

estimated  total claims exceed $300,000 for  these

11  suits which are awaiting trial in the  Supreme

Court.  This estimated figure for claims is  based

on  cases  in  which legal proceedings  have  been

instituted  and dates have been fixed  for  trial.

Other  claims have not been included because  they

have  not  been  made, and it is not  possible  to

ascertain  with any degree of certainty  what  the

claims will be and when will they be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am grateful to the

Minister for his detailed reply. I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $996,350 for Head 0108 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0201 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0201 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Prime Minister's pay has remained

stagnant  for the past two years. Whether  or  not

"stagnant"  is the proper word to use,  I  do  not

know.  His salary has remained at $3,500 a  month,

while other Cabinet Ministers have been drawing  a

salary of $4,500 a month each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole of Asia, our Prime Minister is the

only Prime Minister to draw a salary less than his

Ministers. When the Prime Minister first announced

an  increase  of  pay for his  Ministers,  he  had

reason not to increase his own salary. However,  I

feel  that  the time has come for me to  speak  on

this  issue.  Therefore, I would  request  all  my

colleagues in this House to review this matter  in

view  of the fact that our country is doing  well.

it  is  high time we proposed legislation to raise

the  Prime  Minister's salary at least $10  higher

than a Minister's salary.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer the Member for

Anson   to  the  Prime  Minister's  Statement   on

Ministers' salaries and allowances for Members  of

Parliament as contained in Hansard, Volume 30, No.

I,  col.  8, dated 7th May, 1970, at paragraph  5,

and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English) `I am not increasing my own salary

of  $3,500 a month. My salary will stay as  it  is

until  the  end  of 1972, by which time  Singapore

should  have overcome the economic problems caused

by  the  rundown in British military  expenditure,

provided  we all work hard for higher  and  higher

productivity and more and more industries.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay) I would also like to refer to the

Government's  recommendation to the Wages  Council

that adjustments and rationalisation of wages  and

bonuses should be taken in two steps, one in  1972

and  another  in  1973. This is contained  in  the

Prime Minister's address to the N.T.U.C. Delegates

Conference on 5th March, 1972.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> It is true that the Prime

Minister  did say that he did not want a  rise  in

salary. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



now  every worker in the public service is getting

one month's extra salary as allowance. What is the

reason  for  that? It is because  the  country  is

improving   and   getting  more  prosperous.   The

Minister  for  Finance has already estimated  that

there will be a surplus. Therefore, although it is

most  probable  that the Prime Minister  does  not

want  a raise, can we not take some action in this

House to increase his pay to something more than a

Minister's salary, at least by $10 more?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Ya'acob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

feel  we  are  very  fortunate  to  have  a  Prime

Minister  who very rigidly upholds the declaration

he  made  two years ago, i.e., that he  would  not

seek to increase his salary until the end of 1972.

We  are  proud that our Prime Minister is a leader

with  a  conviction not to smile unless the people

themselves smile first.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the explanation, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0201 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1041*.(* The same  amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Budget debate last year, my

colleagues, the Members for Mountbatten and  Telok

Blangah,  expressed their views on this  important

set-up, the Anti-Pollution Unit, within the  Prime

Minister's  portfolio. Whilst  their  observations

are  noteworthy,  I  would like  to  seek  further

elucidation  from  the Minister  of  State,  Prime

Minister's  Office,  on the scope,  function,  and

future planning of this very important Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister of Defence, who was speaking

for  the  Prime Minister during the Budget session

last year, disclosed that this Unit, comprising  a

team  of  three  scientists of very high  calibre,

exists in the Public Works Department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



I  quote from Hansard dated 18th March, 1971, Vol.

30, No. 12, col. 790:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... - all three of them - have gone abroad to study

air  pollution  problems; one  to  Australia,  the

second to America, and the third to Europe.'



<br><br>He  also  mentioned that their functions were  not

those of an enforcement nature but purely to study

the problems and to establish monitoring stations,

make  recommendations  to the  Prime  Minister  on

matters  of  policy,  including  legislation,  and

advise  on measures that suit our situation  best.

In  this  respect, perhaps the Minister  of  State

would  care to enlighten this House as to  whether

any  recommendations from this top calibre,  high-powered team of scientists have been submitted  to

the  Prime  Minister. As a consequence,  will  any

measures  be  taken by this Unit, on  a  long-term

basis,  to ensure that our City state will not  be

faced  with the hazards of pollution? Sir,  it  is

indeed   highly  commendable  that  Singapore   is

tackling this pollution problem seriously and at a

much  earlier  stage  than  many  other  developed

countries  like  the  United Kingdom,  the  United

States  of America and Japan, which only  recently

began to grapple with this problem, long after  it

has become an environmental hazard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another minor observation, if I may hasten to

add,  is that, although this Unit has been charged

with   a  very  high  responsibility,  its  entire

staffing  position, ranging from the Head  of  the

Unit right down to the office boy comes to a total

strength of only 23 persons. In other words,  this

Unit  appears  rather small  to  be  able  to  co-ordinate  its  activities against  air  pollution,

pollution of water-ways, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, hope that the Minister of State

will  be  good enough to throw some light  on  the

measures which are being taken or will be taken to

ensure that Singapore will be pollution free.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, despite the

anti-pollution measures that have  been  taken  in

Singapore, there is still a great deal  of  noise,

smoke and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



pollution  of  water at present. It  is  a  common

sight  to  see  antiquated-looking buses  belching

smoke  to  envelope passers-by and other  vehicles

travelling along their side. It is high  time  the

Anti-Pollution  Unit  paid  greater  attention  to

these  lumbering monsters emitting poisonous fumes

into our atmosphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During pasar malam nights and at hawker sites in

various  parts of the island, the generators  that

supply  electricity are not only  noisy  but  they

also  emit a lot of fumes. Record shops and stalls

operating at pasar malam sites too seem to  derive

pleasure  in creating noise. They are  allowed  to

blare  out music from their records at a deafening

pitch.  It  is time legislation was introduced  to

compel   record   shops  to  install   and   equip

soundproof   rooms  within  their  premises.   The

Hawkers'   Department   should   note   this,   in

particular.  However,  ample  warning  should  be

given to those offenders before taking any action.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Ya'acob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I would like

to  explain to the Members concerned that the main

concern   of  the  Anti-Pollution  Unit   is   air

pollution.  The  other matter  of  air  pollution

comes  under  the  charge  of  the  Registrar   of

Vehicles,    and    water   pollution    is    the

responsibility of the Public Utilities Board.  For

the time being, this Unit is solely concerned with

air  pollution. In this respect, the Unit monitors

the   air  for  the  various  air  pollutants   in

different  parts of Singapore, and upon  detection

carries out enforcement measures under the  Clean

Air   Act.  The  Unit  also  advises  the  various

Government  agencies, such as  the  Jurong  Tower

Corporation,  the  Planning  Department  and   the

Economic Development Board, on various aspects  of

pollution  problems  and  also  acts  as   a   co-ordinating body for all such activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his recent Budget

speech  has  indicated that Government will  allow

accelerated  depreciation  over  three  years   on

capital investment in approved anti-pollution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



devices.  This, together with the new  tax  relief

measures, will cost the Government a total loss of

revenue of approximately $3.5 million. This is  in

the  interest  of  the people of  Singapore.  This

should  be an incentive to industrialists  to  act

now  by  installing anti-pollution devices and  so

take advantage of this opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Unit is taking every effort to ensure that

the  air around us is pollution free, so that our

people  can lead a healthy life wherever they  may

live.  I  assure  Members that our  policy  is  to

prevent rather than cure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of noise pollution raised by the

Member  for  Anson, I think that the Minister  for

Law  and  National  Development will  answer  that

point  because  it involves his Ministry,  and  is

outside  the  jurisdiction of  the  Anti-Pollution

Unit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the Minister of State has

just  explained  that  the Antipollution  Unit  is

primarily  concerned with air pollution  and  that

queries on other forms of pollution such as noise,

should  be  referred to the appropriate authority.

But  I  think  that this Unit should  not  confine

itself  to air pollution. For the moment, it  may

confine  itself to air pollution, but  as  I  have

mentioned  just  now,  it should  co-ordinate  its

activities  with  other  departments  though   the

Minister  of State has also pointed out  that  the

Unit   acts  as  a  co-ordinating  body  for  such

activities. What I would like to point out are the

important  functions this Unit will be  performing

and  is now performing. With a few officials - the

Head  of  the  Unit,  a couple  of  engineers  and

scientists - I doubt that much can be done for the

present. Even with the loss of Government  revenue

through  encouraging industries to  install  anti-pollution  devices  or  equipment  to  reduce  air

pollution,  I would say that the price  Government

is  paying  for is well worth it because,  in  the

long run, what little is saved at the moment, will

save  us  a  much higher price later on.  In  this

respect, will the Minister of State see to it that

more  trained  officers are  recruited  into  this

Unit?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State has also failed to answer

my  point with regard to the three scientists  who

were  sent  overseas-  one to  Australia,  one  to

America  and  another to Europe and  of  whom  the

Minister  of  Defence mentioned as a  high-calibre

team. I suppose these three specialists must  have

returned  with  bagfuls of ideas  on  the  various

measures  of  countering  pollution.   Will   the

Minister of State care to elaborate on this?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Ya'acob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As I said just now,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this Anti-Pollution  Unit  was

recently  established.  The  other  functions   of

pollution  control  are under the  charge  of  the

other   departments  which  come  under  different

authorities. However, I wish to assure the  Member

that although the number of officers in this Anti-Pollution  Unit  is  small,  they  are   officers

capable  enough to ensure that Singapore  will  be

free from air pollution and, under the control  of

the  officers  whom we have sent abroad,  I  think

this  Unit  is sufficiently able to discharge  its

function.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I do not have the slightest

doubt  that the officers who were sent abroad  are

capable.  What  I said was that this  Unit  should

have more such officers. But since this House  has

the  assurance  of  the  Minister  of  State  that

measures will taken to ensure that Singapore  will

be  pollution  free, I beg leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0201 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very recently, school children were asked about

their electoral districts. Unfortunately, many  of

them   did   not  know  the  change  in  electoral

districts.  Therefore, may  I  suggest  that  more

publicity  be  given through  the  medium  of  the

press, radio and television of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



changes  in electoral boundaries and districts  in

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Ya'acob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

most  of  the local newspapers have given adequate

coverage on the Report of the Electoral Boundaries

Delineation Committee, 1971. Some of them not only

gave  details of the electoral divisions affected,

but  also reproduced maps showing the newly marked

boundaries.  Television and  Radio  also  reported

fully on these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Report, descriptions of all

the 65 electoral boundaries were re-gazetted. Maps

were  also printed. The Report and the Gazette  on

the descriptions of the 65 electoral divisions are

obtainable   from   the  Government   Publications

Bureau, Fullerton Building, at the cost of $5  and

$4 per copy respectively. The boundaries of the 65

electoral  divisions are printed on 26  maps,  and

each of these maps costs

$5,   and   can  be  purchased  from  the   Survey

Department, National Development Building, Maxwell

Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Elections Department has already

published  the Registers of Electors  for  the  65

electoral divisions, and these have been displayed

to members of the public from 20th December, 1971,

to  3rd  January, 1972. This was announced to  the

people over the radio, television and the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member of the public can get further

clarification  on  the newly delineated  electoral

boundaries   and   related   matters   from    the

Registration  Officer, Elections Department,  City

Hall,  ground  floor,  St. Andrews  Road (Coleman

Street entrance).



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Minister  of  State for his explanation.  What  he

said  is quite true. But the publication of  these

electoral  registers  is  only  in  English.   Not

everyone in Singapore can read English. There  are

the  Malay, Chinese and Tamil educated people.  He

has  to consider about that. We do not want to  be

blamed for not properly bringing the attention  of

the public to the changes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



in the various electoral divisions. It is our duty

to inform the people thoroughly.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Ya'acob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we have community centres in each constituency and

through  them we have displayed for  a  period  of

more  than one month, the electoral registers  and

asking  members  of the public  to  inspect  their

names.  So  we cannot be blamed. We have  informed

them  through the television, radio and the press.

Also,    through   the   Citizens'    Consultative

Committees,  we have asked the people  to  inspect

their names in the electoral registers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public should take the initiative

to  find  out  under what constituency  they  come

under.  If  they fail to turn up at the centre  we

are  not to be blamed. We have provided them  with

all the facilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): But members of

the  Citizens' Consultative Committee do not visit

the electorate, which is not their work. It is the

responsibility  of the Government to  sufficiently

inform  members of the public of the new electoral

divisions.  We  cannot make use of the  C.C.C.  We

must  take  our own action; that is  our  job.  We

cannot pass the buck on to other people. We do not

know  whether  the  C.C.C, have  discharged  their

duties  or not. Therefore, the Minister  of  State

must   investigate  to  see  how   best   we   can

disseminate the news to the people.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Ya'acob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As I have said

earlier on, Sir, those who wish to know about  any

changes  to  their constituency can get  in  touch

with  the  Registration Officer of  the  Elections

Department, City Hall.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I do not want to pursue this

matter,  and therefore I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0201 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3013.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an industrialised country, air pollution is

the  most  serious  of all forms of  environmental

pollution.  This  is  no exception  to  Singapore.

Therefore,  we  must  take  steps  in  advance  to

prepare for such an eventuality and to prevent air

pollution from getting worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is now asked to approve a vote of

$50,000  for  the  purchase of equipment  for  the

measurement of air pollution. I would like to take

this  opportunity to ask the Minister of State  to

explain  to  the House the uses of this  equipment

and  its  specific purposes. Is it to be  used  to

combat   industrial  pollution,   or   to   combat

pollution   caused  by  vehicles,  or  for   other

purposes?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Ya'acob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

six types of equipment are likely to be purchased.

The  first  type  of  equipment,  the  Hydrocarbon

Analyser,  is used for measuring the  presence  of

hydrocarbons,  and  the  second  type,  the  Auto-analyser, is used for measuring oxide of nitrogen.

These  two  types  of equipment will  be  used  to

monitor  the  ambient air in the urban  area.  Two

other  additional  equipments  will  be  used   to

measure   dust   concentration   in   and   around

manufacturing   premises  having  dust   pollution

problems.  The fifth equipment will  be  used  for

general    monitoring   and   identification    of

particular  sources of pollution,  and  the  sixth

equipment  will  be  used in  the  laboratory  for

identification  and measurement of the  pollutants

that have been sampled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,120,230 for Head 0201 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0301 -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Science and Technology has

over the past two years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



or  so  had its responsibilities increased.  Until

recently,  its  staff has undergone  some  strain.

Through  my  membership of a few committees  under

the  Ministry's purview, I have personally noticed

this quite clearly. In the next several months the

work  of  the Ministry will be intensified further

with:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) further work of metrication;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) increased responsibility over the

construction,  staffing and  equipping  of

the Science Centre in Jurong; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the possibility of the setting up of the Centre for Applied Research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this pressure as well as

possibilities of expansion, I feel that  making  a

Deputy Secretary as the Chief Executive Officer of

the  Ministry,  instead of a  Principal  Assistant

Secretary,  is  overdue. I hope  that  this  post,

together with the other vacancies, will be  filled

as  soon as possible, and that a three-month delay

implied by the Vote is all the delay that will  be

tolerated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wonder whether the Minstrel would, in

respect   of  the  proposed  Centre  for   Applied

Research, care to expatiate on the brief reference

made on this Centre by the Minister for Finance in

his Budget address.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I indicated last year

that I would appeal to the Ministry of Finance for

a  Deputy Secretary as and when the volume of work

in my Ministry grows. Members can now see for this

year  that  there is provision for  such  a  post.

However, the provision is only for nine months  as

it  is  the practice of Treasury to allocate  only

nine  months'  salary for a new post.  Apparently,

they spend the remaining three months looking  for

a  suitable person. I do certainly hope  that  the

Establishment Division of the Ministry of  Finance

will  be able to appoint someone competent  enough

to  fill  the  post  of  Deputy  Secretary  in  my

Ministry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post of Principal Assistant Secretary

continues to remain in my Ministry. Members  would

perhaps  like to know that it is not very easy  to

get  people  who  are versed in administration  as

well  as in science and technology to occupy  this

post,  because  at the moment people  who  are  so

qualified  prefer to obtain a similar job  outside

the  public sector where it is more convenient and

better paid. Because of this competition which the

Government is faced with, there may be some  delay

before we can find a suitable person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no objection to replying to the Member

for Katong on the Centre for Applied Research.  As

Singapore's industrialisation and economic  growth

continue  to progress, it has become obvious  that

multifarious problems are popping up  to  confront

the  Government, statutory bodies, and the private

sector.  It is true that civil servants,  both  in

the Government and statutory bodies, are very much

pre-occupied    with    routine     matters     of

administration and day-to-day operations of  their

departments  to  apply their  minds  to  work  out

solutions to problems confronting them, or even to

sit  down and identify the problems which they may

have  to  deal  with in executing  any  particular

policy.  This  is particularly so  of  the  public

sector,  and  generally so of the private  sector,

where  the multi-national companies have  invested

heavily in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, my Ministry commissioned the

Stanford  Research Institute last  year  to  do  a

study  on  the setting up of a Centre for  Applied

Research in Singapore. Their report suggests  that

such  a  Centre should be established as a private

company  limited by guarantee, and  will  have  no

shareholders, in order to maintain confidentiality

of  research reports and in order that the company

can call itself a non-profit making institution so

that  it  will not have to pay income tax  to  the

Government. It will also have no dividends to  pay

out.  But  the ultimate objective of  the  company

will  be  to  sustain the costs  of  the  research

efforts  that it puts in. The Ministry of  Finance

has promised a sum of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



money to initiate operations for the setting up of

the Centre for Applied Research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas of research which the Centre will

initially  embark upon will be in market research,

particularly for export products, distribution and

transportation   analyses   (both   national   and

international), management information and control

systems and procedures, corporate strategy,  long-range  planning assistance, economic  analysis  of

growth potential in relation to changing economic,

political and technical environment in this region

and  throughout the world, industrial  feasibility

survey,  including  cost-profit  projections   for

specific   products,  processes,  and   industrial

undertakings,  industrial  engineering,  technical

problems  peculiar  to  our tropical  environment,

such  as corrosion control or insulation problems,

product  innovation and adaptation to  meet  local

and  other  market  requirements,  and  increasing

total  value  added in manufacture.  Subsequently,

when  the Centre has begun its initial operations,

it  will embark upon more technical studies  which

are  confronted  in  the engineering  and  applied

sciences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem which we are now confronted with is

manpower.  It is not the purpose of the Centre  to

recruit  very highly qualified and very  expensive

personnel  to form a nucleus for this Centre.  But

it will try to utilize whatever expertise there is

available  in  Singapore,  particularly   in   our

institutions  of  higher  learning.  Some  of  the

contract work can be farmed out to such experts or

they  can  be brought in as consultants.  The  key

person, who will be the manager of the Centre,  is

now  being sought, and when appointed, the company

will   be   launched   as  a   non-profit   making

institution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, my Ministry is engaged in drawing

up  the Articles of Association and Memorandum for

the company. When this is done, we hope to get the

Centre going sometime in 1972.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Minister  for  his  reply,  and  I  beg  leave  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the metre, as a unit of measurement, has

been  adopted in Singapore in stages, may  I  know

what   steps  are  being  taken  to  ensure   that

shopkeepers do not make use of this conversion  as

an   excuse   for   profiteering?   The   Hawkers'

Department  should ensure that all old methods  of

weighing should be replaced with reliable ones and

which  do  not  lend to tampering  by  hawkers  in

markets. At present, because of the various  forms

of   measure  used  by  the  hawkers,  the  poorer

sections  of  the community are being  cheated  by

unscrupulous hawkers. But I am not accusing  every

hawker, but only the unscrupulous ones. There  are

some shopkeepers who are very honest.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, metrication

has  not  yet  been extended to  hawkers;  so  the

Member  for  Anson  can be rest assured  that  the

problem  has not arisen. There is the Weights  and

Measures  Division  in  the Department  of  Trade,

which  regularly  inspects the  measures  used  by

hawkers. In the distant future, when hawkers begin

to  metricate, he can be assured that the Division

will be very active in inspecting the balances, or

whatever measures the hawkers will use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the Chambers of Commerce had

taken the initiative to ask textile shopkeepers to

sell  currently  by the metre instead  of  by  the

yard.  This began in March. But not all shops  are

following  this new practice, but we  expect  that

over  a period of time even the smaller shops will

gradually follow suit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent shopkeepers from

profiteering  on  this  change,  members  of   the

Metrication  Board and the Consumers'  Association

of  Singapore have been visiting textile shops  to

watch the progress of metrication. To-date, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



report that I have got so far is that  there have

been no serious complaint of cheating. In fact,

there are some textile firms selling by the metre,

but are charging rates at the old measure, i.e, by

the yard. In other words, they are prepared to

round off the old measures into metric, so that

the consumer, in fact, stands to gain rather than

lose. In view of this, the Metrication Board

intends to publicise those shops which are

charging at the old rates but measuring out with

the metre rule instead of the yard rule.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am very glad to hear

that. I do not think the hawkers will not be using

the  metric system of measurement in future.  Does

the  Minister for Science and Technology know that

before hawkers begin to metricate, we have to make

sure   that  they  do  not  use  this  system   of

measurement  to cheat. For example, textile  shops

have  started  to metricate, and  some  have  been

charging  their customers wrongly.  Therefore,  we

must very carefully see that when we go metric the

shopkeepers  and  hawkers do not  cheat  the  poor

people,   who  form  the  majority  of  consumers.

Therefore,  I  feel  that the Minister  must  take

severe  action against unscrupulous  retailers  in

the future when Singapore has fully gone metric.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in view of the detailed explanation, I beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $596,980 for Head 0301 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0401 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Defence has been allocated

a  provision  of  about $442 million.  This  takes

first  place in the national expenditure. This  is

38.9  per cent of our total expenditure; 16.5  per

cent  more  than  the estimate for  last  year.  I

understand  that  this  increased  expenditure  is

necessary to meet the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



effects  of the final rundown of British  military

expenditure  and that our Government  now  has  to

shoulder   the  entire  responsibility   for   our

internal  security. In view of this,  we  have  to

increase our expenditure to build up our own armed

forces.  At  the  same time, we  have  to  examine

whether  expected  and desirable  results  can  be

achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I touch on the problem of National

Service.  The  National Service Act  has  been  in

force for the last few years. With the support  of

the  people and the efficient enforcement  of  the

law,  it  has achieved certain desirable  results.

Our  citizens  now realise that as an  independent

nation,  we  must have our own defence  forces  to

safeguard  our  national and  territorial  rights.

They have also realised that national service  has

brought  about many benefits to our  country.  For

example,  our youths can be mobilised for training

to  become  the  stalwarts of our defence  forces.

National  service also enhances  the  quality  and

discipline  of  our youths, and  thus  promotes  a

better organisation of our society.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have achieved much from national

service, there are certain shortcomings. They are,

however, technical in nature. In other words, they

relate to the training courses. If the officers in

charge  of training can remedy these faults,  then

the  position  will  be all  right.  The  training

courses  do  not  inculcate a  sense  of  national

identity   and   consciousness  in  our   national

servicemen.  This is a very important  factor.  We

are  a very young nation. Therefore, in the course

of  our nation building, we have to instil a sense

of  national  identity in our young  people.  They

should  be  inculcated with a  sense  of  national

consciousness and patriotism so that our  national

servicemen will love our country. Only then,  will

they  identify themselves with the country and  be

given an opportunity to serve. In order to achieve

that  objective,  the Ministry of  Defence  should

strengthen its educational and cultural  division.

More cultural and educational officers should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



be  employed  to  promote  national  consciousness

among our national servicemen youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints from our

national   servicemen.  Having  reached   national

service  age, they registered themselves with  the

Manpower    Division,   and   underwent    medical

examination. But some of these youths have not  as

yet  been enlisted in the army. What is the reason

for  the  delay?  They are very willing  to  serve

their  country, and we should help them to realise

their aspirations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another problem. These youths have to

undergo  national  service training.  However,  in

looking    for   jobs   they   encounter   certain

difficulties  because the Government  has  decided

that   unless  they  receive  a  certificate   for

employment from the Manpower Division, they cannot

look  for  a job in either the private  or  public

sector.  Therefore, I urge the  Minister  to  take

note  of  this  situation and to take  appropriate

measures to remedy such shortcomings.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I agree very much  with  what  the

Member  has  said, particularly the need  to  have

soldiers who are loyal, patriotic and conscious of

their national identity. However, this business of

inculcating   national   consciousness   is    not

something  that can be done only in the  Singapore

Armed   Forces  during  the  period  of   national

service. If a boy of 18 goes into the army without

knowing  what country he belongs to,  and  has  no

loyalty   to  Singapore,  then  I  say  that   our

educational system has failed badly and  that  his

parents  do  not  know  how  to  look  after  him.

However,  within the army we do try  to  give  our

youths further education on this line. But this is

something you cannot overdo, because after all  in

the  army  they are to be trained as soldiers  and

not  as  patriots, and certainly not in  political

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards educational and cultural services in

the  Armed  Forces, the Member has  got  a  point

there. In fact, I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



looking for a person with sufficient knowledge and

experience to direct or promote cultural shows.  I

have  asked Radio and T.V. Singapore whether  they

can  send  such a person to my Ministry, but  they

have  said  that they need all the producers  they

can  lay  their hands on. They have  lost  a  good

number  of  producers to the  private  sector.  If

anybody, either within or outside the House, knows

of a good producer, please recommend him to me. We

do  want to run cultural and educational shows  in

the  battalion camps at night, because this  is  a

good  way of putting across the proper message  by

subtle means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the waiting period after medical

examination.  A  boy  is  put  through  a  medical

examination when he is l7-X years old.  Therefore,

he  will  not be called into the army for  another

six  to  18  months.  This period  of  waiting  is

unavoidable.  However, once  he  passes  his  19th

birthday and has not yet been called up for  full-time national service, he is not liable for a full-

time national service. In such circumstances,  the

Manpower Base will give him a certificate  to  say

that  he  is  not  liable for  full-time  national

service.  Therefore, there is no difficulty  about

his getting a job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the

Minister for his detailed explanation. I beg leave

to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1011.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a new vote providing for a

Principal Systems Analyst. Under the same Head,  I

also  notice that provision is being  made  for  a

number  of other Systems Analysts and Programmers.

This would suggest that the Ministry is going into

computerisation in a fairly big way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity of seeking

information   on  the  computerisation   programme

embarked  upon  by the Ministry. In particular,  I

should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



appreciate  it  if the Minister could  inform  the

House  of the total costs involved in the purchase

of    computers,   and   the   extent   to   which

computerisation   will  apply   to   the   overall

administration in MINDEF, and the possible effects

this will have on the future staffing position  in

the Ministry of Defence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, actually the Ministry of

Defence has been using computers since 1968,  when

we  leased  a computer from the Central  Provident

Fund  at  an  annual rent of $100,000.  Since  the

middle  of  last  year we have stopped  using  the

C.P.F, computer,  and  are  now  using  computers

belonging  to the Electronic Data Processing  Unit

in   the  Ministry  of  Finance.  They  have   two

computers  and they can spare some of  their  time

for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the sort of work that is being

computerised,  the  following subjects  are  being

computerised. First, the payrolls of officers  but

not  those of other ranks. I am not quite sure  of

the  reason why. Officers are paid by cheques  and

the  other ranks are paid by cash; we have not got

down  to  computerising the latter, and I  am  not

quite sure of the reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we need various data regarding manpower. We

want   to  know,  for  instance,  who  should   be

registered   in  any  one  year.   We   get   that

information from the identity cards, and therefore

nobody  can escape because his name is in when  he

applies for an identity card at the age of 12.  So

we know that 4X years later he should register for

the first time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we computerise other data on manpower, for

instance, how many soldiers are in each  unit  and

against   which  establishment.  This   is   being

reviewed  monthly and quarterly at various  levels

of detail and completeness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, the Member is aware that the

computer is an ideal system for keeping checks  on

inventories.   Our   Logistics   Division    makes

considerable  use of the computer in  working  out

catalogues, that is, giving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



all   the   components  and   code   numbers, in

maintaining  stock  level  of  the  hundreds   and

thousands of items which they have in their bases.

This work is done by the computer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the personnel employed in this work,

they   were  previously  listed  in  the  military

establishment.   There  were  actually   some   83

military posts concerned with producing the  data.

Unfortunately,  a  good number of  these  military

personnel  were national servicemen  who,  by  the

time  they  knew something about their work,  were

due  to  leave the army. The work was,  therefore,

not done very satisfactorily. We have decided that

we  had  better  engage  full-time  and  permanent

civilian staff to take over the work, so that they

can  accumulate the experience and  expertise  and

get better year by year. In fact, this is what  we

have  done  and we will replace these 83  military

posts  with  34  civilian  posts,  including  four

office boys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the cost of the system, as I have

said,  we are not buying computers of our own.  We

are  using Government computers. The pay of  staff

comes  to  $232,980  - it is  in  the  budget-  as

compared  with more than $671,000 previously.  The

maintenance of computers is estimated at  $132,000

as against $296,710 previously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this gives the Member all the information

he has asked for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,. I have raised

this  matter with a view to ascertaining from  the

particular  Ministry concerned whether from  their

own  experience they feel that computerisation  in

the  long  run  is  going  to  result  in  greater

efficiency, and perhaps will enable us to cut down

on  the  number of staff in the civil service,  in

view   of  the  acute  shortage  of  manpower   in

Singapore  today.  Therefore,  I  would  like  the

Minister  to  inform  the House  whether,  in  his

opinion  and  from his own personal experience  in

the   Ministry  of  Defence,  the  computerisation

introduced   so  far  has  resulted   in   greater

efficiency and with a smaller number of  employees

doing the same job.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would think

that that is so, if it is a question of collecting

data.  The computer saves a lot of manpower.  But,

of  course,  the  computer is  no  substitute  for

soldiers.  We still need that number of  soldiers.

The  computer, however, can tell us whether we are

training  the right soldiers and putting  them  in

the  right  unit.  To  that extent,  it  helps  in

increasing the efficiency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I thank the Minister for his

reply. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1036.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have another amendment* on subhead

1041  of the same Head, may I seek your permission

to range my remarks over both amendments?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead1041.



<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, subhead 1036 is the vote

for a Research Officer under Salary Code 154. This

Code  gives .a salary scale ranging from  $800  to

$1,650.  The  Research Officer under subhead  1041

comes  under  a  different Salary Code;  Code  216

which  gives a salary scale ranging from  $935  to

$1,255.  The question is: what is the  reason  for

the  disparity in the salary scales for these  two

Research  Officers?  It is understandable  if  one

officer  is  on a different grade from the  other,

but the Estimates of Expenditure does not indicate

so.  The  nomenclature is the same,  and  yet  the

salaries  differ.  Can  the  Minister  of  Defence

explain the difference in the salaries?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actually, the Research Officer

coded  under  item (1036), the  one  who  is  paid

higher, not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



only  belongs  to a different grade  but  also  to

another  Ministry,  that  of  my  colleague,   the

Minister  for  Home Affairs. This  post  has  been

entered  in error in the Estimates of the  M.I.D.,

owing  to an administrative slip which took  place

when   the  Ministry  split.  The  other  Research

Officer  is in my Ministry, Defence. We find  that

we  do  not need a very highly qualified  Research

Officer, and so we pay him less.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, now that the

administrative  slip has been  found  out,  I  beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, I would like to express my basic

agreement with the view expressed by the  Minister

of  Defence  at  a commissioning  ceremony  a  few

months  ago. He said that in order to attract  men

of high calibre into the officer-cadre ship of the

Singapore  Armed  Forces,  a  status  has  to   be

accorded   to  this  officer  corps  by   way   of

perquisites  like  housing,  provision  of   motor

vehicles,  and so on. I think there  should  be  a

general  acceptance of this principle.  In  modern

warfare,  it is not the man of brawn, the brawler,

the  tough, one of the Dirty Dozen, so  to  speak,

who really contributes to victory - except perhaps

in  television  performances -  although  soldiers

should certainly be tough fighters. Marshal Georgi

Zhukov,   perhaps  the  Soviet  Union's   greatest

soldier  in  the  last  war,  was  said  to   have

expressed the view that war is a science, a series

of  mathematical  problems to  be  solved  through

proper  integration and co-ordination of  men  and

weapons  in  time  and  space.  The  soldier,  and

especially the officer, is not the kind  of  metal

out  of  which rough nails are made. He has indeed

to have a fine intellectual temper. This being the

case, the Singapore Armed Forces has to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



seen  as occupying an appropriate position in  our

society. However, it should be easily agreed  also

that  status is won as much as it is accorded,  is

worked for as much as it is given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the S.A.F., especially its

officer corps, has a big role to play. In fact, it

has already begun this role for some time past and

should  continue  to play it more vigorously.  The

S.A.F, has   participated  in   many   community

projects. In my own constituency, we have received

help   in  cleaning-up  operations  after  serious

flooding. We have received help in the planting of

trees.   We   have   received  promise   of   such

cooperation any time we call upon the help of  the

military  in  the  vicinity  of  my  constituency.

Furthermore,  there  was a warm  response  to  the

military  static  display which was  held  at  the

Katong Community Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behaviour and the initiative shown by

officers  have  been generally exemplary  on  such

occasions.  It  would be good  to  reiterate  that

under  all  circumstances the behaviour of  S.A.F.

officers  should  be considerate and  gentlemanly.

When he appears in public places of entertainment,

for example, an officer should not forget that  he

represents the Armed Forces, even though he is not

in  uniform. When driving on the roads, he  should

always   show   courtesy,  even  if  courtesy   is

distinctly  lacking  in others.  The  point  I  am

trying  to  make is that not only should  an  Army

officer  set  high  standards  of  behaviour   for

himself,  so as to show a leading example  to  his

men but, wherever possible, also show such example

to  those  who may not be in the Armed Forces.  In

this  way,  if there is something wanting  in  the

behaviour  of non-S.A.F, members, this should  not

be  found  wanting  too in the  standards  of  the

officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect may then be won, and an appropriate

status  found  for  the  S.A.F, in  our  society.

Therefore,   when  the  soldier,  especially   the

officer,   undergoes  training,  he   should,   in

addition to normal military training, perhaps at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



some  stage  of  his army career,  be  exposed  to

knowledge  and experience that would have  a  fine

and civilizing influence over him, not to make him

less  of a soldier, but more of a gentleman. If  I

may quote from Shakespeare:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In peace there's nothing so becomes a man

As modest stillness and humility:

But when the blast of war blows in our ears,

Then imitate the action of the tiger;'



-Henry V. Act 111, Scene 1, lines 3-6..



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the speech that the

Member for Katong was ref erring to was made by me

at   the   Istana   commissioning  ceremony   last

November. Perhaps I might say a few words  on  the

progress  that has been achieved to give  officers

better perks, such as a decent car, house, and  so

on.   The  Manpower  Division,  M.I.D.,  has  been

applying  their  minds to this  subject  of  staff

cars,  and  the thinking now is that  officers  in

command of brigades or higher formations should be

getting   a  Mercedes,  and  battalion  commanders

should  get  a Ford Cortina, or a slightly  bigger

car,  but  I  am told that none of that  is  being

assembled here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards houses for them to live in and to buy

on  instalments, my Permanent Secretary  has  been

hunting for a suitable tract of land. After  three

or  four  trials, I think he has found  the  right

tract.  There is quite a good piece  of  land  off

Ayer  Rajah Road, where the British Navy  used  to

have  some  oil tanks which we now  think  we  can

afford  to  demolish. It is in a very  nice  area,

very central, and we are now negotiating with  the

Housing  Board to see whether or not we  can  take

part  of  the  land  to build high-rise  apartment

blocks  for  sale  to our officers  on  instalment

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the other matter of the way an officer

and  a  gentleman  should conduct  himself,  I  am

impressed by what the Member has said. If he  will

let  me have a copy of his speech, or perhaps with

your  permission,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  if  we  could

extract  it from the Hansard, we might publish  it

in the next issue of the Pioneer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am flattered by the

Minister's request, and I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $442,831,720 for Head 0401 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0501 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 4X50l be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs J. F.  Conceicao, Low Yong Nguan and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the allocation for the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs  is  $11,366,250. This is  only  a  slight

increase over the provision for the last financial

year. It shows that the Ministry has increased its

activities,   and  we  have  got  quite   a   good

reputation in the field of international diplomacy

and  foreign affairs. We have been able to acquire

more  international friends. Of course,  the  main

aim of our foreign policy is based on our national

interest. Under this grand ideal and principle, we

will  try  to resort to all practical measures  to

maintain  good relationship with as many countries

as  possible and to establish trade relations with

them.  Of  course,  this  is  Beneficial  to   our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that Members will agree with me

when  I  say  that  we can be  successful  in  our

foreign  policy because we have not  only  a  good

foreign  policy  but also a capable  Minister  for

Foreign   Affairs,  which  is  also  an  important

factor. However, I have four questions to  ask  of

the Minister:



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Up to-date, in how many countries have we set

up embassies or high commissions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is there any plan to set up any new `consular

corps in any country this year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In the past one year, what benefits have we

derived from the ASEAN organisation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) How many creditable measures in this year's

ASEAN  Regional Programme can help us  to  promote

our tourism and trade, and in other fields?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister will be good enough

to answer all these questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last

fortnight or so, a phenomenon has been reported  a

number of times in several newspapers about the so-called "squall" over the Straits of Malacca. There

were   arguments  as  to  whether  it  should   be

internationalised, or whether certain  limitations

should  be  imposed  on  navigation  through   the

straits, and a decision over this matter may  have

some  important  consequences  for  us.  I  wonder

whether  it is opportune and appropriate  at  this

time  for the Minister to comment further on  this

issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime

ago,  the Chinese Chamber of Commerce successfully

organised  a trade mission to Communist  China.  I

feel  that  more such visits should be encouraged.

May I ask if our Government intends to improve the

relationship  by sending more trade missions,  and

finally  establishing  full diplomatic  ties  with

China?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I must

say  that  I  am  always very glad  to  listen  to

speeches  from  the Member for Sembawang,  because

his  estimation  of my capability is  higher  than

that of my own. This is rather reassuring!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to his question as to how many

embassies  we now have in the different countries,

there  are at present seven Ambassadors  and  five

High Commissioners in Commonwealth countries,  one

Permanent  Representative in the  United  Nations,

and one High Commissioner in Hong Kong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards whether we have any plans to set up

new  embassies  or missions, we  have  set  up  an

embassy  in Brussels, and there is a consulate  in

Medan. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



far  as  I know, we have no other plans to set  up

any  more  missions, unless there is the need  for

it. As the Member probably knows, we do not set up

missions or embassies for the sake of prestige but

only where there is a clear need, either political

or  economical,  or  otherwise,  to  set  up  such

mission. As I have said in the past, sometimes you

are  able  to  promote the best of relations  with

other countries without having to set up embassies

or missions in them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question which the Member asked was

what  benefits have we derived from being a member

of  ASEAN. ASEAN has been undertaking a number  of

projects  during  the  past year  for  the  mutual

benefit of member-countries, but these are  mainly

in  the  field of tourism. In fact,  a  number  of

activities  were conducted as part of  the  "Visit

ASEAN  Year  of  1971".  We have  conducted  trade

seminars  in Auckland, Sydney and Perth,  for  the

tourist industry there. There was the Visit  ASEAN

Year commemorative stamps. Then also there was the

ASEAN   Film   Festival  held   last   year.   The

competition  was  organised  to  select  an  ASEAN

musical  team to introduce joint-ASEAN  Radio  and

T.V.  Programme as part of our cultural activities

with  ASEAN.  A  number of countries  participated

jointly  in the ASEAN Pavilion at the 1971 Jakarta

Fair,  which is part of a joint effort to  promote

trade and commerce among member-countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to civil aviation, four project-teams

of  aviation experts visited the ASEAN capitals to

survey    operational   and   airport   facilities

available  in  each country, with a  view  to  co-ordinating such services among member-countries so

that each country can provide a better service for

air  traffic operations within the region. We have

training  courses, workshops and seminars relating

to  a  variety  of subjects, such as  seminars  on

production and fisheries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these benefits, there are 11

Permanent  Committees, all of  which  continue  to

exchange  information relevant  to  their  fields.

During  the  year  a  number of them  consolidated

their activities by establishing clearing houses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



for  collection,  processing and dissemination  of

information and publications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also requested a United Nations Study

Team  to make a study and to report on the  fields

of trade and industrial co-operation, monetary and

financial   co-operation,  forestry   and   forest

industry,  agriculture  and  shipping.  The  final

report of this U.N. Study Team is expected  to  be

ready sometime at the end of this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from all this, there have been the

granting  of  scholarships under the ASEAN  scheme

and, as far as Singapore is concerned, there are a

number  of  ASEAN scholars studying in  Singapore.

For  example,  there are 15 in the  University  of

Singapore, eight in Nan-yang University and 74 Pre-University  students.  These  are  some   of   the

activities,  not  very  dramatic,  but   obviously

progress  is being made and this is a  bit  better

than making no progress at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question by the Member for Anson

about   establishing  diplomatic  ties  with   the

People's Republic of China, I have stated on  many

occasions  that,  in  principle,  since  we   have

recognised and supported China's admission to  the

United  Nations  we must, sooner  or  later,  have

other  forms of relation with them. But we are  an

island-state situated in South-east Asia. We  have

many neighbours whose interests and views must  be

considered   should   we  want   to   enter   into

negotiations to establish a diplomatic mission  in

the  People's  Republic  of  China.  And  as  some

Members  here may be aware, the members  of  ASEAN

have  discussed this matter and there  is  general

agreement  that before any member of ASEAN  enters

into   diplomatic  relations  with  the   People's

Republic of China, he must consult the body and co-ordinate his action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits of Malacca and of Singapore is a

topical  issue  at  the  moment,  but  it  is  not

necessarily the be-all and end-all of  the  issue.

It  is imperative that the Straits of Malacca  and

of Singapore should not become the catalyst for  a

new cold war. It could well become one,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



if  the discussion and approach to this issue  and

the  problems connected with it were discussed  in

terms  inviting  cold  war postures  by  countries

within  or outside the region. Once such  postures

and  attitudes  are taken then it becomes,  as  it

always  does, an intractable cold war issue.  Then

rational  solutions which are now open  to  us  to

resolve  some of the real problems connected  with

the Straits may be closed, if not forever, then at

least  for  a  long time. The real problems  could

well  be lost sight of, once the question  of  the

Straits of Malacca and of Singapore is befogged by

cold war considerations. I do not need to draw the

attention  of  the Member, if he had been  reading

the papers recently, that we are coming close to a

cold  war over the Straits of Malacca, and by that

I  mean that there are incipient murmurs of such a

possibility.  This  will be tragic,  since,  as  a

result of the detente between China and the United

States, the prospects of running down the old cold

war  in  Indochina  and  in  South-east  Asia  are

generally  better  than they  bad  been  for  many

years. Therefore, it will be tragic if we start  a

new  cold war in our region. As Singapore sees it,

the Straits of Malacca and of Singapore is a vital

lane  for  sea  communications and  trade  between

Europe,  Africa and Western Asia on the one  hand,

and the Far East on the other.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that this lane should be freely

accessible  to all nations without discrimination.

It  has been used as an international waterway for

centuries  and  has become a major artery  of  the

network of international communications and trade.

To  do anything or to say anything to disrupt this

is  to  disrupt  international communications  and

trade  seriously.  But  Singapore,  together  with

Indonesia and Malaysia, are concerned with some of

the  problems  affecting  our  national  interests

which have arisen as a result of increased traffic

through  the  Straits. There  is  need  to  ensure

safety   of   navigation,  to  avoid   danger   of

collisions  as  a  result of  larger  vessels  and

increased traffic. There is also the danger of oil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



and  other  forms  of pollution,  which  can  have

disastrous  consequences for the  three  countries

bordering the Straits. There are also problems  of

security arising from naval rivalry of big powers.

In   other  words,  while  Singapore  stands   for

unimpeded  passage  of all ships  of  all  nations

through the Straits, it also feels that those  who

use  it  must,  in turn, agree to observe  certain

rules  and regulations to ensure safety, security,

and avoid risks of collision in the Straits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this end in view, the three countries held

discussions  in November last year and  agreed  to

establish a body composed of their representatives

to   coordinate   efforts  for   the   safety   of

navigation.  The three countries agreed  that  the

problems  of safety of navigation and the question

of   the  so-called  internationalisation  of  the

Straits are two separate issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia and Malaysia were of the view that the

Straits  of  Malacca  and  of  Singapore  are  not

international straits, while recognising  the  use

of  the  Straits  for  international  shipping  in

accordance with the principle of innocent passage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, however, could not go any further

than  to  take  note  of  the  views  of  our  two

neighbours.  The  reason is that,  in  Singapore's

view, the status of the Straits of Malacca and  of

Singapore  should not be considered  in  isolation

but  in  conjunction with the status of  some  114

straits  scattered throughout the world and  which

are  considered  vital links in international  sea

communications. These straits are spread over  all

continents  and  adjoin many  countries,  such  as

Canada,  Denmark, United Kingdom,  United  States,

the   U.S.S.R.,   Japan,  China,  Australia,   New

Zealand, and many others. We feel that it would be

premature  to settle the status of the Straits  of

Malacca  one  way  or the other  without  reaching

agreement on the other 113 such straits which  are

considered  by  the  U.N, to be  of  international

importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be uniformity of agreement in regard

to  the  status  of  all straits of  international

importance.  The  alternative to an  international

agreement is a dangerous scramble for the carve up

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



not only straits, but of oceans as well. Hitherto,

most  conflicts known to mankind have  had  to  do

with  the  carve  up of land and rectification  of

land  frontiers. Now that most of the world's land

mass  have been carved up, there could well  be  a

scramble  for the carve up of straits and  oceans.

And once the principle is conceded that the oceans

are open for picking by those with power and might

and  strength,  and to declare portions  of  these

oceans as their preserves, then small countries  -

whoever  else  may  win-  will  certainly  be  the

losers. That is why Singapore is strongly  of  the

view  that  the  status of all straits,  including

that  of  Malacca and Singapore, should be settled

by  mutual accord and agreement in a rational  way

at  the  United Nations Law of the Sea  Conference

tentatively  scheduled for  next  year.  Were  the

future  of the oceans and straits of international

importance   to  be  settled  on  the   basis   of

unilateral carve ups on the principle of  "finders

keepers",  then the seas of the world - they  make

up  most of the world - could well become areas of

anarchy  and contest where right must be and  will

be largely on the side of those who have the might

which,  in  technological terms, means  those  who

have  the  biggest  navy,  the  largest  submarine

fleets,  and the greatest air power. So  for  this

reason, we believe that the Straits of Malacca and

of Singapore should not be made a cold war problem

or a power conflict problem, but largely a problem

of communications.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1051*.(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P.Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I merely wish to express my curiosity as to

whether  or not the salaries as indicated by  this

vote  for  our  Ambassadors and High Commissioners

are  really enough to enable them to perform their

functions without too much worry over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



expenditure.  I  know that there is  another  item

showing the payment of overseas allowances to  our

representatives abroad, but despite this allowance

I  have  the impression that total emoluments  for

our  Heads  of Missions are still not enough.  One

point  that  springs  to  mind  is  what  is   the

criterion used to determine the grade of allowance

that  a  particular Head of a Mission is  entitled

to?  Here  again, perhaps there is no relationship

between  the cost of living for an Ambassador  and

the  allowances that he actually gets. Sir, we are

supposed to be a Republic with the second  highest

per   capita   income   in   Asia.   Under   these

circumstances,  our  overseas  Heads  of  Missions

should receive emoluments commensurate with  their

importance  and  dignified  calling  to  meet  the

financial demands of their office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if it is about time we looked into

the matter of getting a cadre of full-time Foreign

Service officers at Head-of-Mission level who  are

prepared  to serve on a permanent basis. But  this

cadre  should not be seconded from among Ministers

of State, Members of Parliament, University staff,

etc. With the possibility of the emergence of this

cadre of Foreign Service officers, could not a new

scheme of pay be devised?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, looking

through  this year's Budget Statement,  I  noticed

that  our hotel occupancy rate is going down  year

by year. Is it possible that our overseas missions

have   not  given  sufficient  emphasis  in  their

efforts  to promote tourism? I think they  can  do

better  than  what they are doing at  present.  Or

perhaps if we could increase their salaries,  they

will then work hard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think what the

Member for Anson has been saying is less than fair

to   our   Ambassadors.  They  work   very   hard,

regardless of whether their salaries are increased

or  decreased.  However, since both  Members  have

raised   the  question  of  emoluments   for   our

Ambassadors and High Commissioners, I  would  like

to say that, as far as I know there have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



been  no complaints from them as regards salaries.

But   there  have  been  complaints  and   grouses

regarding their overseas allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grades and salaries of Heads of Missions are

equated  with the Civil Service Superscale  Grades

D,  E and G, i.e., salaries of $2,170, $2,070, and

$1,920  respectively. This is to  avoid  upsetting

the  Government  salary structure and  to  provide

prospects  of  advancement to higher  grades.  The

total  emoluments  of Heads of  Missions  who  are

married  with,  say,  three children,  range  from

$3,944.50  to  $5,903 per month  for  a  Grade  II

Ambassador  or High Commissioner. In  addition  to

all these, he is provided with rent-free furnished

accommodation,  a  chauffeur-driven  car  for  his

exclusive  use, and adequate financial  provisions

for entertainment and representational activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the rates for overseas allowances

depend  on the cost of living index applicable  to

the  country  o posting. However, in view  of  the

complaints from some Heads of Missions  that  they

are   not   adequate,   my   Ministry   has   made

representation to the Ministry of Finance  for  an

interim revision of the existing overseas cost  of

living   allowances  and  this,  as   far   as   I

understand, is under active consideration by them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has

not  touched on the possibility of a proper  cadre

of    ranking   Foreign   Service   officers    at

ambassadorial  level  for  the  Foreign   Service.

Perhaps this would be a better scheme than getting

people  from various walks of life and  post  them

overseas on a temporary basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think I have said on

previous  occasions that our Foreign Service  must

be re-modelled on the basis that it is not a trade

union  purely for professional diplomats. We  must

have a mixture of professional diplomats of M.P.s,

Ministers   of  State,  politicians,  businessmen,

university dons, etc., so that this wide strata of

our society can bring in the various valuable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



expertise. Our main concern in Foreign Service  is

the  development of commerce and trade  with  some

countries. So there is no use sending a politician

to  conduct  matters where commercial  acumen  and

industrial  understanding  is  the  more  dominant

function  of an ambassador. As it is,  I  can  say

that,  by and large, this experiment in recruiting

bankers   and  industrialists  has  produced   far

greater  results than having a purely professional

cadre of diplomats.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in many other countries too,

including the United States, it is not the  custom

to  take  the  old  approach that  the  diplomatic

service  is  completely  and  wholly  staffed   by

professional  diplomats. Until we have  reason  to

believe that this present system does not work, we

will  continue  to  adopt  this  present  form  of

approach to the diplomatic service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for

bringing  me  to  a  better understanding  of  the

principle   behind  recruitment  to  the   Foreign

Service. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3104.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns "Staff and Expenses

for  New  Missions  Overseas".  The  Minister  for

Foreign Affairs has pointed out just now that  two

missions  will  be  set up, one  in  Brussels  and

another  in Medan. He has also mentioned  that  an

overseas  mission  is  set  up  on  the  basis  of

necessity and of interest to Singapore. I suspect,

Sir,  that the setting up of a mission in Brussels

is for economic purposes, because the Minister for

Finance  has,  in his Budget Statement,  mentioned

that  it  would  be  to our benefit  if  Singapore

becomes   an   associate  member  of  the   E.E.C.

(European  Economic  Community)  or  the  European

Common  Market, whose headquarters is in Brussels.

Apart  from  this  benefit, perhaps  the  Minister

would care to elaborate on the other factors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



which necessitate our Government's decision to set

up a mission in Brussels, and in Medan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is whether

these   two   missions  will  be  established   at

ambassadorial  level.  The  reason  is   that   my

attention   has  been  drawn  to  the  grades   of

Ambassadors and High Commissioners, discussion  of

which  has  just been concluded under an amendment

to  subhead  1051.  In this matter,  1  think  the

grades  of  our Ambassadors and High Commissioners

should  not  be  indicated in  the  Estimates  for

obvious  reasons, It may well be that we  need  to

indicate  the  number  of  Ambassadors  and   High

Commissioners,  and together with it  their  total

personal emoluments. But by its inclusion  in  the

Budget  Estimates,  as it has been  in  all  these

years,  everyone will know that such  and  such  a

foreign mission is headed by such and such a grade

of  Ambassador.  I  am  aware  that  some  of  our

Ambassadors  and High Commissioners are  rendering

their   services   gratis;  I   appreciate   their

contribution to Singapore. But I would say that it

is  unwise  to  classify the different  grades  of

Ambassadors   and   High  Commissioners   in   the

Estimates.  Therefore, I hope  that  in  the  next

year's estimates we will not be able to know their

various grades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to a point which the Minister

has  just  replied that there were  no  complaints

about  the salaries of Ambassadors, except perhaps

Overseas Allowances. I take it that there has been

no  complaints  officially. But  I  have  had  the

opportunity   to  visit  some  of   our   overseas

establishments, and I think it is  high  time  the

Foreign   Ministry  seriously  looked   into   the

question  of providing adequate, if not more  than

adequate,    overseas   allowances   and    proper

accommodation for our high officials overseas. For

example,  let us take Japan. Our former Ambassador

to  Japan was put up in an apartment which was,  I

think, probably about I X- times the size of a  4-room  Housing  Board flat. I am  not  exaggerating

because on one occasion I paid him a visit at  his

residence. I doubt that with such an accommodation

and surroundings that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



he  was  provided, and with only a small place  to

park his car, he would be able to hold an official

function  in his house. I must point out that  the

Ambassador  concerned did not ask me to  bring  up

this   matter.   I  think  this  illustration   is

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A rugged Singaporean.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> It may be that he is a rugged

Singaporean. The Minister for Finance has  been  a

bit generous with his tax reliefs and, he has also

mentioned  that we are heading for a  surplus  and

that  our Gross National Product is going  up  and

up.  I  do not know how far up it is going to  be,

but let us come down to brass tacks.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> They have no trade unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, as the Member for Telok

Blangah  has  just remarked, Ambassadors  have  no

trade unions. Be that as it may, Sir, I hope  that

in countries where the cost of living is extremely

high,  for  example, Japan, the United  States  of

America and the United Kingdom, our Ambassadors or

High  Commissioners will get a level of  allowance

that  is  in  keeping with their status  in  those

countries. Of course, in respect of accommodation,

the Foreign Minister might say, "Look, what is the

use  of  having  so much space? After  all,  being

revolutionaries,  we  do not  need  that  sort  of

luxury!" No doubt, we may not want to look  at  it

from the prestige point of view, but it is my view

that they must at least be accorded some degree of

comfort  and  be happy enough to be able  to  say,

"Welcome  to  my little flat." I hope the  Foreign

Minister  will  elaborate further on  this  point,

taking into consideration what I have just said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with reference

to   the   Member's  query  as  to  why  we   have

established  a mission in Brussels, he  was  quite

right in saying that it was established primarily,

though  not wholly, for commercial considerations.

I  am  not quite sure whether he meant that  as  a

criticism or a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



commendation;   I  hope  it  is  a   commendation.

However,  the  Head  of the  Mission  will  be  at

ambassadorial level. It may well be that since  it

is  the  first mission in Continental Europe,  our

mission   in   Brussels   will   have   concurrent

accreditation  elsewhere  in  Europe,  if  it   is

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Medan, our Mission there is at

Consulate  level  and,  therefore,  there  is   no

question  of an Ambassador. We want to be  in  the

best  of terms with our Indonesian neighbour.  The

main  function  of a consulate is to  promote  the

potential for trade and, in particular, tourism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other comment by the Member concerns the

emoluments of Heads of Missions, and I have  dealt

with this subject. I think the lines for setting a

standard for what is comfortable or what  is  not,

may  vary. I have also been to what he has  called

"a little flat" of the Ambassador in Tokyo. As far

as  I  can  see, most flats in Japan  are  "little

flats",  because their concept of  size  is  quite

different   from   other  countries.   Many   very

prominent and wealthy people live in little  flats

in  Tokyo.  However, I get the point made  by  the

Member,  and that is, in countries where the  cost

of  living  is  high  our Ambassadors  should  get

appropriate  allowances. The cost of living  index

was formulated at the time when things were fairly

stable in Singapore. Many of our bureaucrats  tend

to think that the cost of living is also stable in

other  parts  of  the world.  But  in  many  other

countries,   the   cost  of   living   has   risen

considerably.   However,   we    have    made    a

representation to the Ministry of Finance to  help

Heads  of  Missions to meet additional expenditure

arising from the increased cost of living  in  the

countries where they have been posted. I hope  the

Ministry  of  Finance will, on both financial  and

humanitarian  grounds, pay considerable  attention

to our representation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I would like to

speak  on industrial accidents. Since the  present

Minister   for   Labour   took   office,   he   is

implementing  two  measures: (1) taking  effective

steps  to  reduce  and prevent the  occurrence  of

industrial  accidents;  (2)  making  certain  wage

adjustments and raising the standard of living  of

lower  income workers. I very much appreciate  the

two  measures  which the Minister is  implementing

vigorously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the prevention of industrial accidents, I

am  glad  to  see that the Ministry of  Labour  is

carrying  out  an  island-wide  industrial  safety

campaign  -  as can be seen from the publicity  in

the  newspapers, over radio and T.V, in  order  to

ensure   that   workers  can   work   in   safety.

Unfortunately,   while  the  national   industrial

safety  and health campaign is being carried  out,

the   number  of  industrial  accidents  occurring

continues  to increase. This is really  an  irony.

These industrial accidents include one which  took

place  in  Jurong Shipyard recently, resulting  in

the  death  of  a  few  workers.  Of  course,   an

occurrence of this kind of industrial accident  is

regrettable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many causes of industrial accidents,

e.g.,  the  machinery is faulty, or the  employers

and workers have been negligent. All these factors

contribute to industrial accidents. Therefore,  in

order   to   reduce  the  number   of   industrial

accidents,  the parties concerned should  work  in

close  co-operation. I hope the Ministry of Labour

can   take   up  a  leading  role  in  encouraging

management  and  labour to take industrial  safety

precautions.  As regards employers  who  disregard

implementing  safety measures,  steps  should  be

taken  to deal with them. The workers should  make

use  of safety devices in order to safeguard their

own lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister a few

questions  and  I  hope he can  give  me  detailed

answers.   On   the   prevention   of   industrial

accidents,  we have been paying much attention  to

it in the past few years. I would like to know why

there were more industrial accidents in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



1971  than in 1970. Is the department paying  heed

only  to theory and publicity about the prevention

of  industrial accidents, without actually  taking

effective measures to prevent them from happening?

Are Factory Inspectors being recruited in order to

send  them out to inspect factories regularly  and

to  find out whether factories are abiding by  the

safety   regulations  and,   if   not,   to   take

enforcement measures against them? As regards  the

Jurong Shipyard accident, has the Minister set  up

a  committee of inquiry to look into the causes of

the  accident, so that preventive measures may  be

taken to prevent similar occurrences?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

colleague,  the Member for Bukit Ho  Swee,  during

the   debate  on  the  financial  policy  of   the

Government,  spoke very frankly and forcefully  on

the  need for amendments to the Employment Act and

the  Industrial Relations Act. He covered a number

of  sections in the Acts that need to be reviewed,

namely,  sections  on  the limitation  of  bonuses

(this  has  clearly  proved to be  not  workable),

employer's  prerogatives on transfers, promotions,

dismissals,  etc.  I shall not  repeat  except  to

associate myself with the sentiments expressed.  I

hope  the  Minister has taken note  of  the  views

expressed  by  the Member for Bukit Ho  Swee,  and

that  in his reply today he will cover the grounds

raised by the Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only want to speak on two other sections of

the  Employment Act - sections 37 (4) and 41(4)  -

that  need  to be amended as a matter of  urgency.

These  sections  limit financial compensation  for

workers  in  the essential services  for  overtime

work  performed, when time off cannot  be  granted

within a reasonable period because of the shortage

of  staff  - many of these departments are  of  an

essential  nature.  Implementation  of  these  two

sections  of  the Act has encountered difficulties

by some Ministries and statutory boards and I will

give  details when I speak about these  Ministries

later  on.  The  Ministries and  statutory  boards

concerned cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



give time off for overtime work performed, because

of  serious shortages of staff. At the same  time,

the  employees of essential services are  required

to work and the Act restricts them from being paid

wages although they are required to perform duties

over and beyond the 48-hour limitation on overtime

work.  Both  these sections of the Employment  Act

have  proved  to be unworkable. Will the  Minister

consider  amending this section of the  Employment

Act?  Meanwhile,  can  the Permanent  Secretaries,

departmental  heads  and  Chairmen  of   statutory

boards, be given authority to grant overtime,  and

to  pay  for overtime if no time off can be  given

within a reasonable period?



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to speak on a subject to  which  the

Minister  for  Finance has  not  made  any  direct

reference but which is very close to the hearts of

workers. In his Budget Statement, the Minister has

given  credit  to the workers for  the  role  they

played in the economic success of Singapore during

the past few years. The Minister has also gone  on

to   say  that  it  has  been  necessary  for  the

Government  to  relax  its  stringent  immigration

policies  in  respect of workers who  possess  the

skill   or  expertise  required  in  the  economic

development  of Singapore. The general  impression

conveyed by the painless Budget presented to  this

House   is  that  Singapore  is  enjoying  booming

conditions   and   that  we  are  experiencing   a

situation  of full employment. Thus, by inference,

workers  should not have difficulty  in  obtaining

ample opportunities for suitable employment. While

it  is  true to say that the level of unemployment

has  gone  down  to a point that would  have  been

unimaginable two or three years ago, there remains

certain  categories of labour  which  cannot  find

employment  in  the  present  situation  of   full

employment. Such categories of labour are of a non-industrial variety or are not in possession of the

skill or expertise which is much in demand now,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



or  are unsuitable by reason of education, age  or

health. Even apart from the consideration  that  a

worker  presently in gainful employment  may  have

great    difficulty   in   obtaining   alternative

employment in the event of being deprived  of  his

present job, a worker will normally object to  his

employment  being  terminated by  an  employer  on

grounds which are not due to any act or conduct of

the worker.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of my speech today is to bring the

attention  of  the  House  to  the  grievances  of

workers  that the right to dismiss or  retrench  a

worker  has been somewhat abused by a considerable

number  of employers in obvious disregard  to  the

welfare or interest of the worker. In some  cases,

it may be even said that dismissal or retrenchment

has  been effected in circumstances tantamount  to

victimisation. Members of the House may think that

we have adequate legislation to protect workers in

the  event  of  victimisation, but the  fact  that

there  is  such  legislation does not  necessarily

mean  that  it  is effective for the purposes  for

which it is intended. Moreover, even if' there  is

effective   legislation  for  the  protection   of

workers against victimisation there is at present,

as  the law stands, no remedy for workers who find

themselves  thrown  out of employment  through  no

fault   of  their  own,  but  who  cannot   allege

victimisation by the employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that those Members of the House who are

not  employers,  or who have no occasion  to  deal

with  employer! employee relationship, may have  a

clear  picture  of  the problem of  insecurity  of

employment,  which  is  a haunting  fear  assuming

nightmarish  proportions to  workers  with  family

obligations and hire purchase commitments,  it  is

necessary  for me to give a brief outline  of  the

situation in which a contract of employment may be

terminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 10 of the Employment Act, it is

provided  that  an  employer or  an  employee  may

terminate  a contract of employment by  giving  to

the other party the right of notice of not less



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



than one day or not more than one month, depending

on  the  length  of service of a worker  affected.

Such  length of notice, of course, may be  greater

than that provided under the Employment Act, if an

individual  contract  of employment  contains  any

provision  to that effect. In the absence  of  any

such  contractual provision, the length of  notice

may   be  governed  by  the  Employment  Act.  The

provisions  of section 10 are as fair  as  can  be

desired. Both the employer and the worker have  an

equal right and correspondingly equal duty to give

the  same  notice of termination  of  contract  of

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snag, however, lies in the provision of

subsection  (2)  of section 17 of  the  Industrial

Relations Act, which provides for the right of  an

employer  to terminate the services of workers  on

the   grounds   of  redundancy  or  reorganisation

without   having  to  prove  such  redundancy   or

reorganisation. Thus, under the existing  laws  an

employer can call upon a worker, who may have been

employed for more than 10 years, and say  to  him,

"I hereby give you a month's notice, in accordance

with   the  Industrial  Relations  Act,  for   the

termination  of  the contract of  service  on  the

grounds of redundancy or reorganisation as  I  may

wish  to choose." And the worker has no remedy  to

the  court even though he knows very well and  can

prove   that  there  is  no  such  redundancy   or

reorganisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my own personal experience, I have come

across   many  cases  where  an  employer,   after

terminating  the  services  of  a  worker  on  the

grounds  of  redundancy, proceeds within  a  short

time  thereafter to recruit new workers under  new

designations  to perform the same  work  that  has

been done by the ex-worker who has been retrenched

on  the grounds of redundancy. What makes it worse

is  that the employer, who may be a director of  a

well-established company, will have no  qualms  to

echo  the  refrain of the Government that  workers

must  make sacrifices for the general good of  the

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members of the House may still wonder why

it  is  still so unfair of an employer to exercise

his powers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



under  section 17 (2) of the Industrial  Relations

Act, i.e., to terminate the services of workers on

grounds  of redundancy or reorganisation.  We  may

also  say  that there is nothing to stop a  worker

from terminating his contract of employment, if he

so desires. There are, however, two considerations

which may put the matter in a different light. One

is  that, with the generally accepted practice  of

employment  in  Singapore to  grant  a  worker  an

incremental  salary scale, a worker who  has  been

employed  for  several years  expects  to  draw  a

salary  considerably higher  than  that  which  he

obtains  at  the  commencement of his  employment.

However,   some  employers  feel  that  they   are

entitled  to  effect  savings by  terminating  the

services  of  workers who have been  employed  for

several  years and replacing them with  little  or

inexperienced  workers at far lower salaries.  The

damage  done to a worker whose services have  been

terminated may be irreparable, particularly if  he

belongs to a category of labour which is not  much

in   demand.   If  he  is  lucky  he  may   obtain

alternative employment with a far lower salary, or

he  may  join  the  ranks of the  unemployed  even

though  he  may have many years of active  service

before him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other situation is that if the workers are

in  possession of a skill, which is very  much  in

demand,  and  if  they are to  take  joint  action

against an employer in support of their colleague,

who  has  been  given a raw deal by the  employer,

then  by  jointly terminating their  services  and

seek alternative employment, the employer will  be

the  first to cry "blue murder" and would urge the

Ministry  of  Labour  to  intervene  in  what   he

constitutes   an   industrial   action.   Such   a

hypothetical  situation envisaged  by  me  is  not

likely   to   occur,  not  because   it   involves

industrial  action which is prohibited in  respect

of termination of service, but because workers are

generally  more  responsible than  that.  But  the

anticipated  reaction  of  employers  to  such   a

hypothetical situation is not at all far-fetched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you may recall the agitation of employers

over the high turnover of labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



in   the  industrial  establishment  in  Singapore

during the past few years, you will readily  agree

with  me  that  employers  were  not  prepared  to

concede  to  a worker the right of termination  of

contract of employment. That is exactly what  some

employers  have  suggested as a  solution  to  the

problem  of high turnover of industrial labour  by

depriving  the  worker of the right  to  terminate

employment. Then it may be argued that while trade

unions   are   debarred  from   negotiating   with

employers  or are prohibited from having  recourse

to  any industrial action over any termination  of

service, there are statutory provisions to  afford

adequate  remedy to any aggrieved trade  union  or

its  members.  Under section 35 of the  Industrial

Relations  Act, it is provided that if a dismissal

has  been  effected in circumstances amounting  to

victimisation of the dismissed worker, proceedings

can  be  commenced  in the Industrial  Arbitration

Court  for  the  reinstatement  of  the  dismissed

worker.  Similarly, if a worker has been dismissed

by  an  employer without just cause or  excuse,  a

representation  can  be made to  the  Ministry  of

Labour  for  the  reinstatement of  the  dismissed

worker. There are, however, three main aspects -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your ten minutes are up, Mr Cheong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

colleague,   the   Member  for  Toa   Payoh,   has

elaborated  on certain sections of the  Employment

Act  and the Industrial Relations Act, but I  have

only two points to raise to the Minister. Owing to

the  pullout of British Forces, the Government has

introduced very strict labour laws in 1968,  which

more  or less muzzled our workers. After they have

proved their worth and after having sacrificed  so

much  for  the  State, it is time  to  change  our

labour  laws  which  are  disadvantageous  to  the

workers who are open to exploitation by employers.

I quote one example. An employee,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



who has a malicious intent on a fellow worker, can

easily complain to the employer in confidence. The

employer can suspend the worker for any length  of

time    under    the   pretext    of    conducting

investigations. If a worker has been suspended for

a  period  of seven days, then by law  he  can  be

dismissed.    Unfortunately,   some   unscrupulous

employers  have  exploited  this  law   to   their

advantage. It is my wish that amendments  be  made

in  regard to this aspect of the law. Furthermore,

if  a worker is interdicted and charged in a court

of  law,  he  may be found not guilty and  thereby

acquitted  and discharged. By right he  should  be

reinstated   in   his   former   employment,   but

unfortunately this is not the case.  The  employer

has again exploited the poor worker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  must thank the Members for Telok  Blangah

and  Toa Payoh for supporting my request to  amend

the  Employment  Act and the Industrial  Relations

Act  on  the negotiability of bonus and to  remove

the managerial prerogative. Sir, yesterday I spoke

on  the  Budget Statement and gave reasons  why  I

requested amendments to the Employment Act and  to

section 17 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, so

that  the  union can negotiate with the management

on  the annual bonus up to three months instead of

one  month  only,  and  to remove  the  managerial

prerogative  so  as  to  stop  the  employer  from

abusing  them.  It  is  a  well  known  fact  that

employers  can easily victimise the  employees  by

using this prerogative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister for Labour to

tell  us whether he will agree to amend provisions

in the Employment Act and Industrial Relations Act

so  as  to  enable the unions to negotiate  annual

bonus  up  to  three  months  and  to  remove  the

managerial prerogative immediately.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang has touched

on  the  question of industrial accidents  and  he

asked  why  the  rate of industrial accidents  has

gone  up  in  1971  as against 1970,  despite  the

campaign introduced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



by   the   Ministry  with  a  view  to   reducing

industrial  accidents. The main reasons  for  the

increase in the number of industrial accidents in

1971  can be attributed as follows. Firstly,  the

rapid   expansion  of  our  industries  and   the

construction  boom  have compelled  employers  to

recruit  workers indiscriminately. Most of  these

workers  have  very little or no formal  training

prior  to  their being put on the job.  As  such,

they were more accident-prone, being ignorant  of

the   working   technique,  safety   and   health

measures.  Secondly, the shortage of  experienced

and  qualified  supervisors at the factory  floor

and  worksites,  and  the new  and  inexperienced

worker  who  is  often  left  alone  to  acquaint

himself with the job on a trial and error  basis,

can  be regarded as contributory factors. In many

cases  accidents  occur  because  employers  have

wilfully   neglected   to  provide   or   install

prescribed safety devices. Finally, in the larger

number of cases reported, the accidents were  due

to  the  irresponsible attitude  of  workers  who

failed  to use and wear safety equipment provided

by the employer.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the Member for Sembawang, the

Ministry   has  recently  organised  a   two-week

campaign  on  industrial safety. At  the  opening

ceremony  of the campaign on 1st March,  1972.  1

outlined  a three-prong strategy which  would  be

put  into  operation  to  reduce  the  number  of

industrial   accidents  occurring  in  Singapore.

Briefly,  an intensive period of social education

would be mounted to bring home to the public  the

high  social  and  economic  cost  of  industrial

accidents.  Workers would he helped to  form  new

and correct work attitudes and made to appreciate

the  need  for personal safety in their  everyday

working  life.  Employers would  be  reminded  of

their  duties and responsibilities to  provide  a

safe,  clean  and  healthy  working  environment.

Appropriate  legislation to  provide  for  higher

standards of safety, health and welfare, would he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



drawn  up.  In fact, the Building Operations  and

Works  of  Engineering Construction  Regulations,

1971,    have   already   been   enacted.   These

regulations   were  drawn  up   specifically   to

overcome  the problem of high accident  rates  in

the building and construction trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Factories Bill, to replace the Factories

Ordinance   enacted  in  1958, has   just   been

introduced earlier this afternoon. The  Workmen's

Compensation  Act, which was amended  last  year.

would   be  trebling  the  quantum  of  workmen's

compensation payable, and force employers  to  be

more   conscious  in  providing  adequate  safety

measures.  Consideration is also being  given  to

the   drawing  up  of  separate  regulations  for

Specific  industries, such as sand  blasting  and

quarrying  operations, to ensure that workers  in

these industries .are fully protected. Whilst the

Factories  Bill  will  set  higher  standards  of

safety,  health and welfare, and  ensure  a  more

stringent observance of these provisions, it  is

necessary for the Factory Inspectorate and Health

Unit  to  carry  Out more vigorous  and  frequent

checks on factories and worksites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Sembawang,

more   posts  of  Factory  Inspectors  and  other

subordinate staff have been created.  There  will

be  no  letup in bringing to book both  employers

and workers found contravening the provisions  of

the  Factories  Act. The proposed Factories  Bill

stipulates the employment of safety officers  and

the  formation  of industrial safety  committees.

the  Ministry of Labour, in conjunction with  the

National   Productivity  Centre, will   conduct

appropriate  training courses  for  these  safety

personnel  to supplement the work of the  Factory

Inspectorate, by emphasising on  the  preventive

aspects of accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However. I must reiterate that the Government on

its  Owl:  cannot fight the battle to reduce  the

rate  of  industrial  accidents.  Management  and

trade unions must also share and play their  role

in  keeping Singapore industrial safe, clean  and

health.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the accident in Jurong Shipyard is

concerned,  I  think the Member for  Sembawang  is

aware that the Government  has already appointed a

committee  of  inquiry  to  investigate  into  the

nature  and  causes  of the accident.  When  their

findings are known, appropriate measures  will  be

taken, and I hope sonic preventive steps could  be

taken to prevent such occurrences in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has touched on

sections 37 (4) and 41 (4) of the Employment  Act.

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  employees  of  Government  or

statutory  bodies  who  are engaged  in  essential

services are presently prohibited from payment for

work  done  on rest days or public holidays  under

these two sections of the Employment Act. Instead,

they   are  given  an  equivalent  time   off   in

substitution.   I think the Member is  aware  that

the  AUPE, which represents employees the  public

sector, has taken up this matter with the Ministry

of Finance, and certain compromised solutions were

offered  although not to the satisfaction  of  the AUPE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sections 37 (4) and 41 (4) of

the  Employment Act, restricting payment for  work

done on rest days and public holidays to employees

of Government or statutory bodies, were introduced

in  1968, primarily to prevent malingering  which

was then widespread among employees engaged in the

essential  services.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,I think the

Minister  has  not quit answered my  question.  We

know  that  sections 37 (4) and  4!  (4)  are  not

operable.  We cannot operate under those sections.

We  have  tried to do so since 1968. The  Minister

should he aware of it as the NTUC had sent  him  a

memorandum    on   it.   We   have    also    made

representations to the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Act provides for time off in lieu

the  major  Departments involved.   Ministries  of

Finance.   National  Development,  Communications.

Telecommunications and statutory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



boards  like  the P.U.B, and P.S.A, cannot  follow

the  law. Is the Minister suggesting that  because

we do not amend the Act, then these Ministries and

statutory boards should break our own law? This is

what  will  happen. We should either  not  request

them  to  work on public holidays, in  which  case

essential services will be interrupted,  or  allow

them  to  work and pay them for it.  But  the  law

prevents them from being paid. We have come to  an

impasse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore. I suggest one or two ways to solve

this  problem. One is a ministerial  directive  to

allow  the  Permanent Secretaries and Chairmen  of

statutory  boards to use their initiative  to  pay

for  overtime worked by employees whom they cannot

give  time  off in lieu. And if they  cannot  pay,

then amend the Act. There is no other way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Cheong, would you like to

continue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. Sir, if I

may have your permission to continue with just one

more paragraph. May I ask the Minister whether  he

is aware that any employer with average competence

can easily circumvent the provisions of section 35

of the Industrial Relations Act, which provide for

the termination of services of a worker, by giving

due  notice, rather than summarily dismissing that

worker without any notice?



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,I am anxiously

waiting for a reply from the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, coming to lie

Member  for Telok f3langah's question before  time

was  up. I was giving reasons as to why these  two

Sections  of the Employment Act were in t  roil  u

::ed. Before the introduction of these provisions,

there was considerable malingering  in those  days

and  there was high absenteeism on normal  working

days,  so  that  work could he accumulated  to  be

performed  on  rest  days a nil  public  holidays,

which  attracted higher rates of pay: I think  the

rate was treble.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, time and circumstances have changed.

We  are approaching full employment. Consequently,

I   think  these  essential  services  have  found

difficulty  in  recruiting sufficient  workers  to

perform  the  job, and as a result employees  were

called  upon  to work overtime on  rest  days.  In

fact, this matter is now under consideration,  and

we  have  made  our views known  to  the  relevant

authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the reasons for introducing

these two sections have been considered thoroughly

at  that time. Any amendment now would require due

consideration and consultation with  the  relevant

authorities.  I  can assure the Member  for  Telok

Blangah  that the question he has raised  will  be

thoroughly gone into. In fact, before coming here,

I  was  informed  by one statutory authority  that

they had taken active steps to recruit workers  to

fill up the establishment so that the workers will

not  be  called upon to perform work on rest  days

and public holidays.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of wages and bonus has been

occupying  the minds of Government for some  time.

The  Member  for  Bukit  Ho  Swee  is  aware  that

Government  has  made  its  views  known  to   the

National  Wages  Council.  We  are  awaiting   its

recommendations  as to whether  the  present  one-month  limit on the negotiability of bonus  should

he  raised and, if so, what should be the ceiling.

Until  the views of the Council are known,  it  is

premature  now  to consider any amendment  to  the

Employment Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have touched on the employers'

prerogative  to  hire and hre staff.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, when the Industrial Relations Act was amended

in 1968 to render certain management functions not

negotiable,  it  was generally accepted  that  the

amendments  were  necessary `to  allow  management

functions  to be properly performed and unhindered

as  otherwise there would be little or no economic

expansion or fresh investments coming in. Besides,

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



restoring to employers the right to hire or  fire,

to  promote and transfer employees, no rights were

taken  away  from  the workers. They  were  merely

amendments  to the common rights of management  to

administrate and now made into statute law.  As  a

safeguard  against  abuse  on  firing   at   will,

provisions were made, now contained in section  35

of  the  Industrial Relations Act,  for  a  speedy

redress for employees who consider that they  have

been  dismissed  by their employers  without  just

cause or reason. By virtue of this provision,  all

cases  of dismissal or termination of service  may

be  made, if a trade union so desires, the subject

of a representation in writing to the Minister for

the reinstatement of the dismissed employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the three full years of the

operation  of  this  provision,  a  total  of   74

representations  have been made by  trade  unions,

under  section 35 (2) of the Industrial  Relations

Act,  for  the reinstatement of 141 employees  who

considered that they had been dismissed  by  their

employers  without just cause or  excuse.  Thirty-four   representations  resulted  in  an  amicable

settlement, while another 17 were withdrawn by the

trade    unions   themselves.    Four    of    the

representations  were disposed of  by  Ministerial

order  for  their  reinstatement or  compensations

paid.  In another 15 representations, the Minister

found  no  sufficient  reason  to  intervene.  The

remaining   four  representations  are   presently

receiving attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these figures show that the

situation is not so serious as to justify  further

amendments to the Industrial Relations Act at this

juncture. However, the Ministry will continue  its

vigilance on the industrial scene and, if the need

arises,   will   take  prompt  action,   including

legislative   measures,  to  ensure   that   these

management rights are not abused.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

afraid!  the Minister has not answered  the  point

with regard to the retrenchment exercise conducted

by employers. For the information of the Minister,

most of the retrenchment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



exercises  did  not come before  the  Ministry  of

Labour  for conciliation. Therefore, the  Ministry

does  not  have  the  exact records  on  how  many

retrenchments  have  taken  place.  Most  of  them

negotiated  between the unions and the  employers,

on the understanding that the unions had no choice

but  to  negotiate on the quantum of  retrenchment

benefits  rather  than on the  pros  and  cons  of

retrenchment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for  Toa Payoh was present in  this  House

when the Employment Act was introduced in 1968. He

should   be   aware   of  the  reasons   for   its

introduction. It is already three years since  and

during  this period the whole employment situation

has  changed  from  a surplus to  a  tight  labour

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before we consider any proposed

amendment  to  the  Employment  Act  or   to   the

Industrial Relations Act, we should bear  in  mind

the  economic  situation of the country.  We  will

still  have  to  depend  considerably  on  foreign

investments  in  the next few years.  We  have  to

maintain the right climate in order to attract the

kind of investment we want. For this reason, we do

not  wish to take any action that will affect  the

investment  climate  of  Singapore.  However,  the

Government  is  not  unaware  of  the  abuses   by

employers  by taking advantage of these provisions

to   carry   out   certain  measures   which   are

detrimental to the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that if the Member for Toa Payoh

does come across any definite case of retrenchment

on  unjustified grounds, he should bring  them  to

the attention of my Ministry. We will then try  to

take   appropriate   action   to   alleviate   the

sufferings of the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I thank the Minister concerned for his  very

clear and detailed explanation. I believe that the

Ministry   concerned  is  now   seriously   taking

appropriate  and  effective  measures  to  prevent

industrial accidents. It is also my hope  that  in

the new financial year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



we  will  see  a  marked reduction  in  industrial

accidents. With these remarks, Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Low Yong Nguan-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> I am not moving,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,  That the sum to be allocated for Head  0601

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1104.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an item in respect of Inspectors of

Factories,  On  the subject of industrial  safety,

the Minister has just assured the House that there

will  be no letting up in efforts to minimise  the

rate  of  industrial accidents and  to  this  end,

additional  posts of Inspectors of Factories  will

be  created. But I am rather surprised to see that

under  this  subhead the number of posts  will  be

increased slightly, that is, from six to eight.  I

doubt whether these two additional Inspectors  are

going to do much good in view of the fact that, as

the  Minister has just mentioned, there will be  a

series of new rules and regulations coming out  in

the ensuing year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the number of Inspectors to

enforce the rules and regulations, there is, to my

mind,  the more important problem of whether these

Inspectors  are adequately trained. What  sort  of

training do we give them? There is no provision to

send them abroad for training. As I see it, if our

Inspectors of Factories are to be effective,  they

should  assume  not  only  the  functions  of  law

enforcers  but  they should also  be  able  to  go

further  and advise the factories on the types  of

safety  measures  to be taken. The  big  factories

will  have  their own officials to look  into  the

problem of safety measures. But in the case of the

small  factories,  however,  the  Ministry  should

provide  every assistance in this respect whenever

such advice is required. In view of the increasing

complexity in our manufacturing processes, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



strongly  urge  the  Minister to  look  into  this

question of training for our Inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect of industrial safety. I

have  heard  that  some of the  industrial  safety

equipment  available in the market do  not  really

come  up  to  the required standard, for  example,

safety belts and safety helmets. Some of them  are

just put on for ornamental reasons to satisfy  the

requirements of the Inspectors. When you put these

belts  or helmets to the real test, you will  find

that  they are really not suitable or ineffective.

Here  again,  I  urge the Minister to  direct  his

Ministry  to  look  into the  suitability  of  the

safety  equipment. There must be quality  control,

so  to  speak, and I am sure the Member for Katong

will be most interested.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out that

the  Factories Act is jointly administered by  the

Factory  Inspectorate  and the  Industrial  Health

Unit  of the Ministry of Labour. While it is  true

that  the  number of Inspectors of  Factories  has

only  increased from six to eight,  an  additional

post  of  Inspector of Factories has been  created

for  the  Industrial Health Unit. In  addition  to

these posts, a Civil engineer from the P.W.D, will

be  seconded to the Factory Inspectorate,  through

special arrangements; making the total increase to

four  Inspectors of Factories. Besides, the  staff

establishment of the Industrial Health Unit is  to

be  increased  by one Health Officer,  one  Senior

Public  Health  Inspector,  one  Sister  and   one

Executive   Officer.   With   the   abovementioned

increases in the staff establishment, the  Factory

Inspectorate and the Industrial Health  Unit  will

be  able  to take on the additional workload  that

will result from the introduction of the Factories

Bill. Notwithstanding this, the Ministry will also

review from time to time the staffing position  of

these   two   departments  and  to   rectify   any

inadequacies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I stress that however stringently we may

enforce the proposed Factories



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



Act,  by  increasing  the  staff  of  the  Factory

Inspectorate and the Industrial Health  Unit,  the

problem of industrial safety and health can  never

be   solved  by  law  enforcement  alone,  as  the

Minister has mentioned a few minutes ago.  In  the

final  analysis,  industrial safety  requires  the

concerted effort of everybody concerned - workers,

trade unions, employers, and the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the training of new Inspectors, at

the  moment  we  do not have plans  to  send  them

abroad.  They  are  being trained  by  the  Senior

Inspectors  within the Ministry.  With  regard  to

advisers,  we  are looking around to  see  whether

there  are suitably qualified and competent people

to assist us in the training of these officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding safety equipment, which the Member has

alleged  that they are just used for show,  may  I

say  that  we  have  the  Singapore  Institute  of

Standards and Industrial Research and that perhaps

some of the safety equipment should bear the stamp

of  that Institute. Anyway, I thank the Member for

bringing  this  matter to my  attention.  We  will

certainly  look  into it to see  that  the  safety

equipment  do  conform to the necessary  standards

set by the Institute.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1351*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi,Messrs Hwang Soo Jin, Ng Kah Ting and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is undeniable that over the past two

years the policy of the Government on work permits

has  been  very  liberal. This is to  enable  more

foreign   workers  to  enter  Singapore  to   seek

employment in order to meet the labour needs of  a

highly  industrialised  society.  But  in  certain

circumstances  there is room for improvement.  For

example, there are foreign workers who have worked

in  Singapore for many, many years, and have  even

married  Singapore citizens and living with  their

families  in Singapore. But these foreign  workers

have  not been able to get work permits when  they

apply.  This  is a great blow to their livelihood.

It  is  my  hope  that the Minister will  consider

their  applications for work permits, in  view  of

the  fact  that they are living in Singapore  with

children and wives who are Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should understand that the present

labour  shortage in Singapore is not only felt  in

the  industrial sector but also in the  commercial

sector,  e.g, in the retail shops. We  are  still

short  of  shop assistants, and even  barbers  and

domestic servants. There is a shortage of  similar

categories  of  workers as  well.  Therefore,  the

civil  servants  in  charge of  the  Work  Permits

Office   should,  when  considering  applications,

understand the actual position and appreciate  the

needs  of the various commercial houses so  as  to

enable them to get the necessary workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other questions which I wish to raise

with  the Minister. Firstly, how many work permits

have  been  issued to-date? Can the Minister  tell

this  House how many work permits have been issued

for  the  different  categories  of  workers,  for

example, skilled and unskilled workers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I think it is the policy to

sympathetically  consider  applications  for  work

permits   by  non-citizens  who  are  married   to

citizens  and  having children born in  Singapore.

This  policy  also applies to foreign workers  who

have families in Singapore, as long as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



application  does not jeopardise the  interest  of

our own citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the figures, I can only give the

Member the figure as at 29th February, 1972. There

were 69,790 work permit holders in Singapore. I am

afraid  I  cannot give him the breakdown  of  that

figure.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, just now during Question  Time  the

Minister for Home Affairs has stated in this House

that  the  Government will not alter its  decision

made  in  1968  with  regard to  the  granting  of

citizenship  to  those people  who  were  born  in

Singapore  but  without birth certificates.  These

people  are holders of blue identity cards and  it

is  clearly  stated in their identity  cards  that

their  place  of  birth  is  Singapore.  The  only

difficulty is that they cannot produce evidence of

birth   or  citizenship  certificate,  but   their

country  of The same amendment also stood  in  the

Kah  Ting, birth is clearly stated as  Singapore.

With this, Sir, it means that the Commissioner  of

National Registration accepts the fact that  these

people were born in Singapore. The only difficulty

is that they cannot produce evidence of birth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people were raised in Singapore, they went

to  school in Singapore and they have the required

residential  qualifications. They  have  undergone

the  way  of life in Singapore and their situation

is  similar to those who hold pink identity cards.

But  I  regret  that when these people  apply  for

jobs,  whether  in  Government departments  or  in

private firms, their applications are rejected  on

the  basis  that they are not Singapore  citizens.

The  departments and firms which are  prepared  to

employ them often ask for work permits, and  there

are times when their applications for work permits

are rejected by the authorities on the ground that

the  work can be done by holders of Singapore pink

identity cards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the time has come for the Ministry

of  Labour to consider exempting these people from

work  permit  requirements, so that  they  can  be

given   equal  treatment  with  holders  of   pink

identity cards with regard to securing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



employment so that the economy of the Republic  can

be  further boosted and, at the same time alleviate

the  burden  of some of our citizens. The  Minister

for  Labour  just  now  stated  that  some  of  the

Statutory  Boards  are faced with  the  problem  of

trying  to recruit additional labour, and therefore

their  workers are asked to work overtime, it  blue

identity  card  holders, who claim to  be  born  in

Singapore,   are   exempted   from   work    permit

requirements,  then employers and statutory  boards

will  not  have any difficulty in encountering  the

shortage of workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, as admitted by the Member,

these  blue identity card holders, who claim  their

place  of birth as Singapore, are not citizens.  As

far as we are concerned, they are not citizens, and

that is a fact. So they come under the category  of

non-citizens, and they must apply for work  permits

if they are looking for jobs. But it is also a fact

that  permanent residents with blue identity  cards

have  no  difficulty whatsoever in  obtaining  work

permits,  as  it has been the policy all  along  to

issue  them  with  work permits. If  there  is  any

company  which  says that they cannot  employ  this

category of residents because they cannot get  work

permits, then I will be glad to receive details  of

the particular incident from the Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

of  State one question with regard to the issue  of

work  permits? Lately, there have been one  or  two

instances  in  which a minor, who has  been  issued

with  a Singapore citizenship certificate, had  his

certificate  withdrawn for the reason that  he  had

not  taken  the  oath of allegiance.  He  has  been

employed  for  a number of years but was  instantly

dismissed  because  he  had to  exchange  his  pink

identity  card  for a blue one. In  cases  of  this

nature,   will  the  Minister  of  State   consider

allowing an employer to retain the services of such

an employee until the application for a work permit

is formalised?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, in this particular case,

the employee has to speak



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



to  the  employer that he should have no difficulty

in  getting  a work permit. I do not think  we  can

tell the employer to keep him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, in this particular

instance,  the employer is prepared to  retain  the

services  of  his employee because he is  a  useful

worker. But then, under the present regulations, he

cannot continue employing him until he gets a  work

permit.  If the work permit takes, say, a month  to

be  approved, then he stays out of employment ,for,

a month, and this affects his continuity of service

with the employer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, a temporary work permit can

always be given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, as the

Minister  of  State  has given  me  a  satisfactory

answer, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head 060! be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2004.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng is not here. Amendment (7),

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2008.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek information on how this

provision is to be used. Although this is  a  small

sum  of  $170,  it is part of the  money  from  the

taxpayer. I would also like to ask the Minister  to

tell  this House what kind of equipment  is  to  he

purchased, and whether it is necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, this sum of $170 is required

to  purchase boiler suits to be worn by  Inspectors

of  Factories in the course of their inspection  of

pressure vessels, and also to purchase and  process

35   mm   films  taken  of  scenes  of   industrial

accidents,  and  occurrences of  dangerous  machine

installations.   The  pictures  are   required   as

exhibits for court cases and investigation reports.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank

the Minister of State for his explanation, and I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2016.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item relates to rehabilitation and

retraining of disabled persons. I believe that  at

present  there  is  a scheme administered  by  the

Ministry  of  Labour  for  the  rehabilitation  of

disabled  persons. The scheme was first introduced

in 1953 and apparently it is the same scheme which

we  still  have today, though so much has  changed

over  the years. Judging by the latest report from

the  Ministry of Labour, very few disabled persons

seem  to  have  taken advantage of the  facilities

available.  This  does seem to  suggest  that  the

facilities  or  services available  might  not  be

really  suitable for present day  needs,  or  that

they  are not really good enough. I would like  to

take  the  opportunity of urging the  Minister  to

give particular attention to this area, which very

much  relates to the rate of industrial accidents.

Reading  the Ministry's report for the year  1970,

if  I  remember correctly, only about  31  persons

took  advantage  of the training. If  you  compare

this number of 31 disabled persons with the number

of disabled persons in another part of the report,

it  does  seem  that  a very small  percentage  of

persons sustaining permanent disablement has taken

advantage of the training programme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, first of all, let me give a

picture  of  what is happening and what  has  been

done in this particular section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme for the Rehabilitation and Retraining

of Disabled Persons renders assistance to disabled

persons suffering from any form of disability



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



caused by accidents or disease. Such assistance is

aimed   at   helping  them  to   regain   economic

independence by undergoing courses of training  in

trade  which  will  enable them  to  be  gainfully

employed on completion of their training. Training

is  normally fixed for a period of six  months  in

the first instance, with possible extension of one

to  three  months,  and in exceptional  cases  for

longer periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year 1971, 30 disabled persons were

placed  for  training under the  scheme  in  seven

different trades. Of these, eight completed  their

training   and  found  employment.  Eight   others

discontinued  their  training  due  to   loss   of

interest.  The  remaining 14  will  continue  with

their  training  in  1972.  Under  the  scheme,  a

trainee  obtains  a subsistence  allowance  and  a

transport allowance. The cost of training for  the

year amounted to $7,222.13.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I assure the Member for Jalan Kayu that the

Ministry of Labour will be prepared to expand  the

scheme  for  the rehabilitation and retraining  of

disabled  persons if there is a  demand  for  such

training.  While  training is one  aspect  of  the

problem,   the  more  important  aspect   is   the

employment   opportunities  available   for   such

trained  persons. It is hoped that employers  will

overcome certain prejudices and readily offer jobs

to disabled persons who have been retrained.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, may I put forward a

suggestion  to  the Minister of State  for  Labour

with regard to the employment of disabled persons?

As  you are aware, in Singapore there are a lot of

multi-storey buildings coming up, particularly the

shopping  complexes, where lifts are installed.  I

wonder   whether   the  Ministry  can   discourage

employers from employing able-bodied men  as  lift

attendants, and so give the opportunity  to  these

disabled people. In fact, we notice that  even  in

Government buildings the lift attendants are able-bodied men.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Yes, Sir, wherever possible,

these disabled persons, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



are  capable  of  working as lift attendants,  are

given  priority  of  employment.  But  there   are

certain cases where employers do not want  to  use

them  for various reasons and we cannot force them

to accept these people. However, we will certainly

give them priority if we have the power to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I am just wondering why

such  a  small number of persons make use  of  the

facilities  there. Could it be that there  is  not

enough  publicity? A lot of people are  not  aware

that there is such a scheme in existence. Has  the

Ministry  made an effort to try and find  out  the

reasons? Reading through the report, I cannot help

feeling  that even the Ministry itself is doubtful

as  to  why  only  eight out of  30  finished  the

training course. Is there any follow-up survey  to

find  out  why  only eight stayed on  to  complete

their training?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> As I said earlier, Sir, some of

them  lose interest very quickly. The Member  must

not  be  taken in by the figures as such,  because

not every disabled person can be retrained. It may

appear on paper that there is a big proportion  of

disabled people not making use of this scheme, but

I am sure that quite a number of them are not in a

position   to  accept  this  kind  of  retraining.

However,  we will see that our officials  do  make

this  training  scheme  known  to  those  who  are

suitable  for  training, and to  give  them  every

encouragement wherever possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I thank the Minister of State

for  his  reply,  and  beg leave  to  withdraw  my
