  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1995 to 31st March, 1996." - [Minister for Finance].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we had a $7 billion surplus. Is this because of good economic growth? Yes, Sir, it is. But I do not believe that that is the full picture because, to economic growth, we must add that the overall tax burden on Singaporeans, both individuals and companies alike, is much too high. So why do I say this? The reason is very simple. Besides direct taxes on income and revenue, there are many areas of indirect taxes in Singapore, including various transfer payments to the Government in the form of levies and import duties. We have GST, COEs, import duties, ARF, maid levy, foreign workers levy, property tax, water conservation tax, cess tax, etc. Even the method of computing corporate tax ensures that companies usually pay higher than 27% because companies normally have other companies under them as subsidiaries and when they lose money they are not allowed to offset against the subsidiaries which make money. So even the company cars are only allowed depreciation charges on a very much reduced basis. The result is that we are clearly overtaxed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government needs the money, I do not think we have any quarrel with it in getting so much money into their coffers. But the question is: does it need the money? The huge surpluses of last year's plus the previous years' tell us a definite no. While the Government preaches a balanced budget, it actually practises a surplus budget system because within the budgeting process there is a surplus-biased method of calculation. If the Finance Minister presents a balanced
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> budget year in year out, we are very sure that we will get a surplus budget year in year out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to reduce this overall tax burden. If the Minister agrees, the question is how do we do it. To reduce indirect taxes? Frankly, I do not recommend that we do this because, generally speaking, the indirect taxes usually have policy objectives. The primary objectives are not to raise money but to achieve policy objectives. The side effect of course is increased revenue which is good. I am not saying that increased revenue is bad. But it must be balanced with some form of corresponding drop in direct taxes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would therefore like to urge the Minister to consider three areas of direct taxation. One of course is the greater and faster reduction of income tax. The second one is the abolition of interest on savings which is now computed as part of income. The third area is to abolish the tax on dividends which is also now considered as part of income when individuals receive dividends from companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is logical because the Government has always been harping that indirect tax is a voluntary tax in the sense that if a consumer does not want to pay the tax the decision is in his hand. If he does not want to pay GST, obviously do not buy anything in Singapore. Buy them overseas and make sure that they are below $600. If you do not want to pay COE, do not buy cars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these three areas that I have mentioned, such comment is not true, because surely the Government does not want the people to earn so low that they fall below the income tax threshold. To become a more productive worker, a higher salaried employee, or a successful entrepreneur where your income rises, one automatically has to pay tax. One cannot say that he does not want to pay income tax and therefore he has a low salary. It is not the right way to do so. Therefore, to encourage greater fruits of labour accruing from greater efforts, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government should strive to keep direct income taxes lower and lower as long as it can afford to. The chronic surpluses show that the Government can still lower such taxes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is: why do we tax on interest from savings? Surely savings is one area we would like to encourage people to do more and more. After all, I believe the Deputy Prime Minister, in one of his speeches, said that one of the foundations of our economic growth is the high savings rate of the people. Here, I believe the Government should actually look into this issue of abolishing the tax on interest from savings. After all, savings are actually the residue of income minus the expenditure. In this respect, the residue of that income is already taxed because income is already taxed. When you tax on the interest on that savings, it is actually like double tax. So they are taxed twice. This is one reason why in a lot of countries where there are high inflation rates people want to spend more and more currently because they know that the interest from their savings in the future will be taxed. It is better to buy the things now rather than to keep the residue in the bank and let the interest earned be taxed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Minister can always say that there are two avenues where the Government does not tax on savings. One is the CPF which is a compulsory savings scheme and the other is POSB where it does not tax interest from savings. If there are already these leakages, then I would urge the Government to consider that it does not make any difference if this same concession is extended to other forms of savings, like savings in banks and finance companies. After all, looking at the size of POSB, the leakage is already wide enough and opening the floodgates a bit more to allow banks and finance companies into the scheme will not really decrease by too much the amount of revenue which the Government collects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of tax on dividends, if the Government is encouraging us to be a nation of shareholders of companies, I would again ask: how does one get the money to buy shares? Normally, for most
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of us, it is from savings again. So when we use our savings, as I have said, after taxed income, to buy shares. The benefits accruing from those shares in the form of dividends are again taxed. They should not be taxed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also know that if at all the Minister answers these points, he will come up with lots of arguments to defend his current policies. I would do the same if I were him. But even as I say that, Sir, I would like to urge him to seriously consider what I have just said. The huge surpluses are no longer necessary. They are no longer economically beneficial to us. They may in fact be a political embarrassment and liability. I think it is time to make drastic changes to the system to reduce the surpluses. If the Government wishes to continue with monetary means to achieve policy objectives, the surpluses must be reduced in other areas. Reducing direct taxes which penalise hard work and thrift fits in with the values we need to succeed in the brave new world of the 21st century.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget Statement is not unlike last year's in many respects. We have registered high growth and performed better than expected and, not unlike last year, it was met with lukewarm and indifferent reactions. Against the backdrop of so many depressing events which happened last year in the world, I cannot see how we can expect a better Budget Statement than the one we are having. If this Budget Statement is made in Mexico, I am sure the Mexicans will have a month-long fiesta.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that part of our surplus is distributed back to our people through the CPF top-up scheme, rebates in income tax and conservancy charges. This is consistent with the Government's intention to redistribute accumulated wealth on a broad-based basis. However, although at first glance, every Singaporean seems to benefit from this distribution, a small group of people who needed this most has somehow been left out. I am referring to those under the public assistance scheme. They do not generally have CPF accounts and therefore cannot
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> benefit from any of the CPF top-up schemes nor do they pay income tax, and not all of them stay in HDB flats. I think it is only fair that they should also receive something, perhaps in the form of a one-off cash grant or the Government can fund more generously through grassroots and charitable organisations to organise projects and activities that can benefit this group of people or even find ways to distribute some essential good to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address the two main areas where unhappiness comes from. The first area in which much was expected is the retail sector. But the problem facing the retail sector is complex. While I agree that they are going through a very difficult time the problem cannot be resolved by the reduction of a mere few percentage points in tax rebates. I attribute this structural problem to the following three major factors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we have an over-supply of retail outlets. Added to the worsening situation is the setting up of many shopping centres away from the traditional shopping areas because of the population shifts and the availability of MRT. I think our retailers have to realise that the demand of shoppers has decreased despite an increase in the number of tourists due to many other factors which I will elaborate later. Therefore, it is not uncommon to see that for every new shopping centre that comes into operation, invariably one old one will suffer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, due to our strong Singapore dollar, shopping outside Singapore has become very attractive. The lower-end shoppers will flock to Johor and other parts of Malaysia to do their shopping. The middle group of shoppers will venture into Thailand, Hong Kong or even Australia, while the upper-end shoppers will go to Europe and the United States to shop. Because of the price difference and because of the fact that almost every household in Singapore can afford to go abroad at least once a year, they find it economically advantageous to do this because, at the end of the day, most of them will save enough in shopping to pay for their annual holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, because of the reduced volume of turnover due to lack of demand, most retail outlets will have to raise their prices of goods to survive. And it becomes a vicious circle, the higher the price, the lesser the demand both from the local and foreign shoppers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the above, I have also observed that due to the buoyant property market, many Singaporeans have committed a sizable portion of their income to the purchase of properties. The high cost of owning a car also affects the spending power of a certain group of Singaporeans. Therefore, unless the retail sector can come to terms with all these constraints affecting the business and find innovative ways to deal with the situation, they will have a tremendous struggle to stay in business. A few percentage points in tax rebates is not the answer to their long-term survival. For this reason, I am sure the 2% reduction in property tax is not going to be of any help to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a survey on the retail market can be carried out by the Singapore Retailers' Association together with the help of the Ministry of Trade and Industry to make known more information on the volume of tourists, the amount of annual spending by the consumers, the quantum of new shopping space available and how much more will come on stream, so that it can help those who plan to enter the retail market to assess the viability of their intended undertaking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area in which much was expected is the commercial sector. They expected a reduction in corporate tax to help in their business venture. Although a reduction of costs in any form can provide a much more competitive business environment, in an economic buoyant situation where the existing tax rate is already competitive compared to other parts of the region, further stimulation may not be necessary at this point of time. In fact, it might have a negative effect on inflation. Even in the US where the economic growth is much slower, the Federal Reserve deemed it necessary to increase the interest rate to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> dampen the growth of the economy to fight inflation. Besides, this year, the business circle will not have to contend with the increase in the CPF contribution rate as compared to last year. So we have time to observe whether our cost of doing business this year will still be competitive enough to sustain our expected growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to draw attention to an area of great concern, ie, the effect of rapid aging population on doing business as a whole, especially on our tight labour market and the ever escalating labour cost. Raising of the retirement age is a step in the right direction, but it may not be enough to overcome the problem. Again, it is a structural problem, partly created by our continuous economic growth. As a result, employees are being promoted and wages increase at a very rapid rate. Although increased productivity and the constant effort in skills upgrading have always been the means to balance such increase in wages and promotions, nevertheless, most employees would reach his or her peak in terms of productivity, skills and total output at a certain stage before their retirement age, especially when no promotion is forthcoming. In a situation like this, the company will be tempted to replace this group of senior employees by younger ones for pure economic reasons. This is undesirable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although from the company's short-term outlook, it may make economic sense but, from the national point of view, it will be disastrous to lose the productivity and contribution of this group of workers. Therefore, a solution has to be found to strike a balance in recognising the contribution, experience and loyalty shown by the long-serving employees by the employers and, at the same time, adjustment made to the ever rising expectations by the employees. Long-serving employees who are being employed in the same position and not being promoted for any reason but, nevertheless, are able to continue contributing to the company should be willing to accept more reasonable yearly wage increments. And at the same time, the company also has to ensure the continued employment
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of these employees and reward contribution through bonuses and other means should the company make exceptional profits in any given year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that at the present moment the CPF rate of a re-employed retired person is being reduced abruptly from 20% to 7 1/2% at the age of 55. Perhaps a gradual reduction and starting at the age of 50 and continuing until the new retirement age of 60 so that the impact of reduction in pay will not be felt so sharply, could be considered. I urge the Government to address this problem and find appropriate solutions. Otherwise, with the aging population increasing, we will be faced with the problem of scarce labour resources on the one hand and, on the other, we would have a group of labour force which cannot be employed effectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to see everyone reflect on this year's Budget with a long-term view and in relation to the interest of the nation rather than measure it against the dollars and cents that we individually can expect. In this fragile world, we should rejoice to the fact that we are one of the few nations that not only are we able to float above water but actually doing it by sailing across in a luxury liner.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media covered this year's Budget with little fanfare. The Business Times called it an "unspectacular" budget. The Straits Times called it a "prudent" budget. I think such uninspired descriptions of a carefully crafted budget is precisely the reason why the Budget is a good one. I think it deserves accolades.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister was wise not to introduce a corporate tax cut. Contrary to what Mr Heng Chiang Meng has said, I think a corporate tax cut this year would almost surely overheat the economy. Last year's economic growth of 10.1% was spectacular, but it does come at a small price. After two years of double digit
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> growth, the economic engine was beginning to run up against available resource constraints. We know that the economy cannot grow faster than what two numbers add up. These numbers are (1) the productivity growth; and (2) the growth in labour supply. Last year's productivity growth was 5.6%. The labour growth, I estimate, was about 3%, making a total of 8.6%. But the economy grew at 10.1%. So the over-heating must appear somewhere. True enough, that figure turned up in the higher CPI which registered a gain of 3.6%, higher than 1993's CPI growth of 2.4%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the implementation of GST increased the CPI only marginally. The larger increase came from the increase in labour cost. The unit labour cost for 1994 increased by 1.9%, vindicating my suspicion that labour cost, not the GST, was the main culprit in the higher CPI.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even though the unit labour cost has gone higher, there is nothing to worry about. All developed countries have higher unit labour cost. That is the price of progress. That is the price of development. But to justify the higher labour cost, we need to push up productivity quickly. Since our growth in the labour supply will be constant for many years to come, unless we accelerate our landed immigration programme, sustainable growth in the next few years can only come from productivity increase. If we want to be a developed country, we must have the absolute productivity levels of the developed countries. Here, we still have a long way to go.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the question: how to increase productivity? We can throw in money for capital goods and increase productivity in the short term. But for the long term, we must depend on how clever our workers work the machines and squeeze higher productivity out of existing machines, instead of just buying new machines all the time. In short, we need to increase our, what we call, TFP - Total Factor Productivity. I think this is where the Government should come in and give incentives for companies to train workers. The problem here is very serious.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Out of a total workforce of 1.6 million, more than half or 850,000 have Primary Six or lower secondary education only. The figures are depressing enough. We do not have either the quality or the quantity to be a developed nation in the next 5-10 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies are loath to spend money on training when they think that the value added will accrue to another company once the trained staff leave to join their competitors. Hence, companies will always take a short cut. They prefer to upgrade machineries to capture higher productivity. The fact that they can write off the depreciation as expenses is another strong incentive not to spend money on labour training.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this method of capturing productivity in the short term leaves our mature workers poorer in skills. Why? Because companies will have to retrench older workers and employ young, more educated workers. The urgent task facing the Ministry of Finance is how to encourage employers to train smarter workers on the job. The NTUC and the Government, especially the Ministry of Labour, have been exhorting companies to spend more than 2% of their payroll on training. But most companies do not do so and for good reasons, because there are no incentives to train workers, especially the rank and file members. In order to facilitate a behavioural change, we have to make training worth its while. Make it worth its while for companies, make it worth its while for employees. And I think the best way is through tax incentives. Companies and people respond to incentives, especially monetary incentives, not through Ministerial exhortations. They just shut off their ears. I ask the Ministry to find a way to reward companies meaningfully and substantially. The Government has several tax instruments to do so. And I hope that in next year's Budget or the year after that, the Government can come up with some concrete tax incentives. The tax gain for the companies should be substantial enough. The Government should not worry about the tax loss because the Government can recapture
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the gains through higher total factor productivity in the 21st century, only five years away.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I move on to tax rebates and surpluses. Many people including Members of Parliament feel that the Government could have been more generous with its surpluses. On the contrary, I think we should build up our surpluses quickly. This is not to say that we should not along the way hand out some rebates to the ordinary folks. I know many Singaporeans, including Mr Heng earlier on, have said that the Government surpluses are becoming an embarrassment. I think the critics should look at two things.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the surpluses as a percentage of the GDP is growing smaller. That is the first thing. Second, if we were to look at the surpluses in the context of our foreign reserves, Mr Speaker, we see a totally different picture. The accumulated reserves standing today at about $70 billion as a ratio of our imports of $156 billion is only about 45%. What does this number mean? To get a feel for this number, I refer Members of Parliament to the 6th March issue of Fortune magazine. That issue has kicked up a row in Malaysia, because the magazine quoted a survey by Tom Riley who is a research director of an investment firm, Gary Shiling &amp; Co, who said that the Malaysian ringgit is on the target list of devaluation, following Mexico. Those countries which face a higher risk are the Philippines, Indonesia and Brazil. I think the survey definitely exaggerates the risk of the ringgit. Still, it is one survey which has found its way into Fortune. Fortune and Economist are two magazines read seriously by financial analysts. Obviously heads turned in Malaysia when this fact was published.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, Malaysia had a balanced budget. The inflation in Malaysia for 1994 was only 4.3%, slightly higher than ours, and their relative reserve position, ie, reserve as a percentage of their imports was much stronger than Singapore's. If we look at the Malaysian reserve as a percentage of their imports, their number is 60, ours is 45. So they are 15 points
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> higher than ours. Our reserve position is more like Indonesia which has a reserve position of about 40%. Indonesia is a country high on the target list of devaluation by this investment firm.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same article, Tom Riley quoted Singapore as the safest of the emerging countries, followed by South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Singapore is different because we have two pluses over a period of time. The first plus is the budget surplus, and the second plus is the current account surplus. If our current account surplus is strong, that is good. If our budget surplus is strong, it is even better. But if you look at the budget surplus in relation to the foreign reserve, our budget surplus is no big deal. If we were to run down our surplus or to have a smaller surplus, this might lull people into thinking that we can be liberal with our expenditure. The truth is until our reserves reach a position of about 80% of our imports, we should continue to build up our budget surplus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget surplus will come in handy when we need to spend extraordinary amounts of money on infrastructural projects like developing water resources or build desalination plants, or maybe build underground road tunnel systems. In a crisis, we may even have to buy water from afar to barge it in. These crises are real. Technologically, the problem can be solved, but the solutions are expensive, and the surplus should provide one way to the solutions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to move on to the income tax philosophy. Here, I am supporting my Parliamentary colleague, Mr Heng Chiang Meng, on the fundamental change in income tax philosophy that needs to be looked at in the years to come. If we look at the major sources of revenue for 1994, the lion's share came from direct taxes. It is about 37% of the revenue. The GST only contributed about 4.8%, which is a minuscule amount. This reliance on direct taxes is still, I think, too high. Since the Government is committed to holding the GST at 3% for the next four years, this pattern of revenue source will be more or less the same for the next few years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first came into Parliament, I proposed that we look at the expenditure tax seriously, and I mean seriously, but the Ministry has not looked at it at all. This expenditure tax idea is an idea whose time has come. The idea has moved from the academic area to the policy area, and now in America and Europe, into the political arena.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An expenditure tax is a tax levied on expenses, not on income. So it is a fundamental change. But like an income tax, it can be progressive. Many people fear that expenditure tax will hurt them, but the expenditure tax will not. The tax can exempt a typical household from paying taxes by raising the limit of tax expenses. For example, if a typical household needs, let us say, $10,000 to keep a family healthy and happy, then taxes need only be levied on expenditure in excess of $10,000. So on $11,000, he is taxed the $1,000 at the marginal rate. A higher threshold can be fixed which would exempt most households from paying taxes. But the important thing, as Mr Heng Chiang Meng has correctly pointed out, is that savings are not taxed, and should not be taxed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has told us several times in this House - in 1976 when Mr Heng first mooted it, and in 1992 when I mooted it - that the tax is difficult to implement and that it violates confidentiality. Of course, they are not true. Yes, there are problems but the only major obstacle is the political will, or the lack of it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, I am not saying that we need a tax now. I do not know whether Mr Heng says we need it now, but I am saying we do not need it now. We just need to study the idea and keep it on the front burner. Policy entrepreneurs in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry should start looking at different facets of the expenditure tax in a new light. There is nothing wrong with our system of taxation for now because everything balances out. Savings are still high. But as a method of taxation, the direct tax and GST combination would be out of date in the early part of the next century. I am convinced that in the next 10 years, one of the developed countries will gather enough political courage to implement the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tax. Why? Because the present tax system discourages savings, interest is taxed, it promotes profligacy and is screwing up all the economies of the developed countries except Japan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the gross domestic savings in Singapore are very high - 47% of GDP. But if we look at the disposable savings, ie, savings minus the enforced CPF savings, we find that our savings rate is not that impressive. In fact, many Singaporeans think that thrift does not pay. Unfortunately, events have proved them right. Over the last few years, savings earned negative returns. First, the CPI was higher or about the same as the interest given by banks on saving deposits, and then the interest earned was taxed. But what was right for them was not so good for the nation because people are going into debts to capture asset inflation and asset inflation is becoming a problem for the masses. Is it any wonder that young Singaporeans have decided to live today and let tomorrow take care of itself? There is an advertisement on watch which Mr Speaker might be familiar. It is in Chinese. The Chinese saying goes: bu yao tian chang di jiu, zhi yao ceng jing yong you [ ]. Translated, in a commercial sense, it means the present is more important than the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the idea of an expenditure tax was first proposed by Prof. James Meade, a British, in the early 1970s. But the idea is now uniting unlikely political bedfellows from both the left and right of the political spectrum, precisely because the present income tax system is putting people into debt. Mr Dick Armey, the US House Majority Leader, is already pushing for the expenditure tax in Congress. A variant of the Armey expenditure tax has now been proposed by Senator Pete Domenici, Republican Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee from New Mexico and also an unlikely bedfellow, Democrat Sam Nunn from Georgia. I do not expect them to push through the expenditure tax so quickly, but the idea is that it is at the top of the political agenda and is taking centre stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We move from America to Germany. Germany, once a bastion of financial prudence, has chalked up successive current account deficits and budget deficits and this has forced a serious rethinking into the present income tax system which has discouraged households to save. Instead they want to spend. I urge my fellow MPs, particularly the Ministry of Finance staff, to read an article by Thomas Mayer. The article was reprinted in the Asian Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, 25th January 1995. Thomas Mayer is the financial analyst from Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. He tells of how the German culture of savings has turned into a culture of spending. Mayer calls for the expenditure tax to be implemented quickly in Germany because the present tax system discourages Germans - once one of the world's most prolific savers - to spend and spend. The savings gap is now prohibiting investments in Germany. Thomas Mayer's views mirror the intellectual and financial elites in Germany.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on now to the rebates and the CPF Share Ownership Top Up Scheme. The Government has done the commendable, in my mind, by giving a generous one-off rebate to tax payers, and offering to pay some of the rent, and service and conservancy charges of HDB dwellers. But I hope that the beneficiaries of these tax rebates will not factor these rebates into their expenditures and adjust to a different lifestyle. I urge these beneficiaries to save the rebates and treat the rebates as a bonus to be saved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are critics who charge that the CPF Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme is no big deal. I think these people do not know the real value of money to ordinary folks. I see these folks in Shenton Way queuing up for long hours just to catch the opportunity to buy one or two Transit Link cards, hoping that these cards would go up in value. But how much can the value of a Transit Link card go up? Certainly less than the few hundred dollars that the Government is going to put into our accounts. I think the CPF Share Ownership Top-up Scheme deserves support and it should not be belittled.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget is a good one. I would like to congratulate the Minister. He is not here, but I hope that RAdm Teo Chee Hean will take it up with him. I hope that his staff will think seriously about the expenditure tax because he and I may not be in Parliament when the expenditure tax is finally implemented. But I think they will get the credit for seeding the idea into the Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget.

  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> A clarification, Sir. I was mentioned five times in Mr Koo's speech. I do not know whether to be upset or flattered because I am not too sure whether it was honourably or dishonourably mentioned. He said that a reduction in corporate tax would overheat the economy. I would like to ask him how he arrives at this conclusion. He uses the US as an example. Does he not know that one of the key financial instruments of policy by the Federal Reserve Board is money supply. In Singapore, the MAS has stated categorically that money supply does not have any significant impact on inflation in Singapore but the preferred instrument of policy for MAS is the exchange rate, and not money supply. So I would like to ask him how he arrives at the nexus that a reduction in corporate tax would overheat the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, I said it very clearly in my speech that the economic growth cannot exceed the sum of two numbers. The first number is the productivity growth. The second number is the supply of labour growth. If you add up these two numbers last year, they came up to about 8.69%. Our economy grew by 10%. So there was really a mild over-heating. If you were to reduce corporate tax this year, it will almost certainly overheat it. I do not know what the MAS has said, but these are economic fundamentals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Davinder Singh (Toa Payoh GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare my interest in a group which has gone regional.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Government has encouraged Singapore companies to go regional. Regionalisation is crucial if we are to meet the challenges of the global economy and to continue to create wealth for Singapore. Overseas expansion brings with it job opportunities which Singaporeans who are talented and adventurous can take up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is continually refining its policies to encourage regionalisation. Budget after budget, economic incentives to maintain Singapore's competitiveness and to encourage Singaporeans to venture abroad have been introduced and refined. This year's Budget Statement recognises that it is important to strengthen the incentives for businesses to venture and to succeed overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago, a package of incentives was introduced to encourage our companies to invest abroad. Today, if a Singapore company has an overseas investment and as a result derives foreign income, the Singapore company does not have to pay any Singapore tax on that income in Singapore if tax exemption has been granted or if the foreign tax credit is equal to or exceeds the Singapore tax payable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax exemption is granted on a case by case basis under the Income Tax Act and the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act. Under those statutes, companies must make applications to the authorities and satisfy a number of criteria before tax exemption can be considered. It is a matter of discretion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other route is to obtain a foreign tax credit which is equal to or exceeds the Singapore tax payable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under existing law, foreign income in relation to which there is a foreign tax credit is allowed to be distributed as
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tax-exempt dividends. This enables foreign income to flow through to shareholders without double taxation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the flow through is limited to two levels of shareholding. It is also subject to the Singapore company owning at least 50% of the shares of the company paying the dividends.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has recognised that companies have found it necessary to restructure their holdings in a manner which results in more than two levels of shareholding in Singapore. Also, because it is common practice in Singapore for companies to form consortiums to invest overseas, it is not uncommon that shareholders own less than 50% in the dividend paying company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address these realities, the Minister has decided to extend the flow through of tax-exempt dividends beyond two levels of shareholding provided that the 50% shareholding requirement is satisfied. He has also decided to waive, but on a case by case basis, the requirement of the 50% shareholding in the dividend paying company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole idea behind regionalisation is to add wealth to the nation. That is done by investing overseas and, in due course, channelling the profits back home. In making the changes announced on Budget day, the Government has shown that it is alive to business realities. It has made changes which will result in more money ending up in the pockets of shareholders resident in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the object is to enable Singaporeans to keep more of the profits, it is difficult to understand why the Government has not recognised that companies may have to restructure not only their Singapore interests, but their overseas holding as well, and this restructuring may have to be done in a manner which results in the imposition or the intervention of a foreign subsidiary between the Singapore holding company and the foreign operating company which pays overseas tax. In other words, the holdings overseas may have to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> involve more than one tier. The concessions just announced only apply if the first tier foreign company pays tax overseas. The issue that is left unaddressed is what if, as is often the case, the second tier company and not the first tier foreign company is the company that pays the tax?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tier foreign company may be sited in a tax haven and may not pay tax. And in that event, tax-exempt dividends cannot be received and/or paid in Singapore. I would be interested to understand the rationale for this distinction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many investors either buy into or incorporate groups of companies overseas for various reasons, including reasons of tax efficiency. Countries like the US or the UK allow group relief for corporate groups in their territories. A Singapore investor may find a foreign asset or business very attractive but may have no choice but to invest in an entire group to get at that asset or business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the object is to encourage regionalisation and the repatriation of profits, the Singapore Government should grant a concession to ensure that, first, the income received in Singapore can be received as a tax-exempt dividend and, secondly, that that tax-exempt dividend can flow through to many levels in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I would be interested to learn what the rationale is of the 25% or 50% shareholding requirement to qualify for this concession. As part of our drive, we are encouraging companies from other countries to enter into joint-ventures with us with a view to investing in third countries. If those joint-ventures are incorporated locally, and if because of demands of equity or because we need the expertise of our foreign partners, a Singapore party's stake is limited to less than 25%, there is no reason in principle why the Singapore party should not enjoy a flow through of tax-exempt dividends if the dividends originate from foreign income earned by the joint-venture. If one has to settle on a figure, why 25%, why 50%, why not 5%? After all, the Companies Act deems a person who has an interest in 5% of the voting shares of a listed company as a substantial shareholder.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, is there a reason for not extending the concessions to capital gains on foreign investments? Today, capital gains on disposal of foreign investments cannot be passed on to shareholders in Singapore in the form of tax-exempt dividends. This is because capital gains are not taxable here. Therefore no foreign tax credit is available. This may result in double taxation for Singapore companies if the capital gain is taxed overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason in principle for the different treatment. A disposal of a foreign investment contributes as much to our accumulation of wealth as trading profits. What is the evil which we are seeking to address by not extending the existing concessions to capital gains overseas?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer should not be that Singapore companies can make applications for tax exemptions under the Income Tax Act or the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act. Those applications sometimes make things quite cumbersome. We want to promote ourselves as an attractive place to do business from. We should rationalise all these incentive schemes to make matters simple for the investors. Unless there is a serious likelihood of a substantial loss of revenue to the Government, we should extend the concession net as wide as possible and not make businessmen go through cumbersome application procedures.

  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Budget presented by the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have spoken in this House in support of the Government's move to help Singaporeans offset the introduction of the GST. Like them, I welcome the 10% rebate on personal income tax, the rebates for HDB homes and the crediting of the $500 into the CPF accounts of Singaporeans. I also agree with the development expenditure to upgrade HDB flats, build schools, hospitals, improve on our transport system and R&amp;D spending.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various tax measures to promote high value-added financial activities and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to encourage regionalisation have been examined by more able MPs expert in this field and I do not wish to go over them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to cover a few areas like the CPF scheme, water conservation and funding for bus shelters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we intend to give out $500 into the CPF accounts of Singaporeans. I receive this with mixed feelings because not all Singaporeans will benefit. In fact, we might have missed giving to certain sections of our population like housewives in their late 50s or 60s. We also intend to credit $300 into the CPF Share Ownership Top-up Scheme. Not all Singaporeans want to put their money in the stock market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, I would like to put forward a few thoughts and ideas which the Minister may like to consider. To begin with, we may perhaps categorise Singaporeans into those below 60 years old and those above 60 years old. The two groups, I believe, have different needs. The first, being younger, want to venture into stocks, shares, housing. The second group may, in my opinion, be more concerned about health and financial support.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest, therefore, for those below 60 years, we should give them an option to have the $300 top-up into the Share Ownership Top-up Scheme, the Medisave scheme or the Special Account. And for those over 60 years, we should credit the $500 into a Special Medisave Account for all Singaporeans aged 60 years and over and who have no CPF or very little CPF. The first option is worthwhile considering because not all Singaporeans are interested in shares, stocks or gold. Some, for personal or religious reasons, do not find the stock market a place to put their money in. I suggest allowing them the choice to put their money either in the Special Account or the Medisave Account.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second option is for putting aside $500 into a Special Medisave Account for Singaporeans aged 60 years and over. I think we can create this account. This is to ensure that the surplus is shared by more Singaporeans than what the working CPF members are at present
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> enjoying. My thinking is many Singaporeans 60 years and over have little CPF or no CPF because they worked at a period when CPF contribution was low or negligible. They are now in the autumn of their lives. Cost of living has gone up. Inflation has eaten into what little savings they have and, above all, some are beginning to have medical problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many in this group of Singaporeans are women, and I think there are about 53% of Singaporeans 60 years and above who are women. This group was highlighted recently in a report by an NUS lecturer, Dr Shantar Kumar. And in this report, amongst others, he highlighted the plight of many 60-year old women who would very likely go through their twilight years, widowed, with little or no income, and with low savings. Many will also have health problems which will rob them of some or all of their mobility. The monograph calls for a study into support needs of this group. I am therefore suggesting that this group of Singaporeans, which falls into the 60 years and above category, should be assisted by way of crediting a similar amount of $500 into a Special Medisave Account. It is no use putting aside $200 into their Ordinary Account or top-up $300 for the purchase of shares. I think it is good to put it into a Medisave Account for their health needs, especially hospitalisation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are about 247,000 Singaporeans over the age of 60 years. Of these, 20% are working and therefore can benefit from the present schemes. 80% or approximately 180,000 Singaporeans are not working, do not have CPF accounts, and therefore cannot benefit from the schemes. If the $500 given to the Singaporeans with CPF accounts is also given to this group, the Government will have to pay out approximately $98,700,000. I think we can afford to give out this amount to these Singaporeans as we have sufficient surplus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me bring to the attention of this House and you, Mr Speaker, Sir, an observation that irks me, and I am sure your goodself, and many Singaporeans.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you happen to visit some of our HDB estates, you will probably be impressed generally by the estate. However, if you let your eyes wonder to the bus shelters, you may wonder if our town planners have lost their sense of balance and aesthetic taste. Look at our bus shelters and look at the new covered linkways. It is a contrast. A beautiful linkway ending in a tardy bus shelter. They are a sight for sore eyes. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the town planners' fault. It is just that PWD and the town councils cannot agree on the terms of dovetailing the two. Both have their reasons. PWD gives nine conditions for town councils to comply, amongst which town councils must pay and maintain the upgraded bus stops. Town councils cannot be responsible for maintaining bus shelters. Town council funds are used to improve the estates. However, we have reached an impasse. The question is: Are we prepared to let this mis-match to be perpetuated? I think we should not. Beneath all this exchange of letters and meetings, Mr Speaker, Sir, I suspect PWD has not set aside funds for this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, can I ask the Minister to be generous to PWD if they do apply for funds for upgrading or even to town councils by the CIPC funding, if the Minister thinks town councils should be allowed to do the job. I leave it to the Minister to decide whom he thinks fit. All that we want is to bring some sense of balance and proportion to our otherwise beautiful HDB estates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the water conservation tax. Yesterday, the Minister for Trade and Industry had told this House about the pressing need to conserve water, and I support this call and the call made by the Prime Minister earlier this year. This tax is a reminder that we should not take this very precious commodity for granted and that we should save today to avoid unpleasantness in future. Perhaps, instead of using punitive measures, we should reward those who make special efforts to save water. For a start, we could give tax incentives for those who build water tanks in their homes, not HDB or in flats, and we can also give those who build water tanks in factories. Of course,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the design and safety aspects must be carefully looked into. We could provide tax concessions and incentives to those who put money into the research and development of water conservation systems in the estates, both private and public. Town Councils should be encouraged to look into ideas to conserve water within neighbourhoods to clean our corridors and void decks. I believe it can bring out the best in people who have to face very difficult situations. Singaporeans must read what Prime Minister Goh said recently about the water situation. Ignore this and we will be queuing up for water very soon.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Speaker, Sir, I sought your permission to share my constituency's experience on the use of industrial water to flush our toilets. But time constraint did not allow me.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, you were out of order.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> This is one of the suggestions being considered by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, industrial water is very corrosive and was used in Teban and Pandan HDB estates and some estates in Boon Lay and Jurong. It was an experiment conducted some 18 to 20 years ago when the estates were built. The water corroded the pipes very quickly and before long, these toilet pipes leaked. My poor residents spent many years warding off smelly, messy industrial water by way of umbrellas and plastic covers over their heads whenever they went to the toilets. [Laughter.] This is not a laughing matter, Mr Speaker. They went through this. I tried to persuade the Government to stop its use for the last 15 years. And in fact, I spent a good deal of my MP life chasing and persuading every newly-appointed Minister for National Development to intervene. But to no avail. Because it was a Government policy. I even brought photographs to this House to show the Minister and all present to prove my case. But my poor residents continued to suffer from the leaking toilet pipes washed by this corrosive industrial water. I almost gave up fighting. But each time, I visited their flats, I was more determined to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> help. It was very embarrassing visiting them because the first thing they wanted to show you was their leaking toilets. This embarrassing experience was also shared by Mr Ong Teng Cheong, our present President who was then making a Ministerial visit to my constituency, and I believe you also, Mr Leader of the House, when you visited my constituency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in 1991, armed with the 75.5% support from the last General Election, I succeeded in persuading the Prime Minister, Senior Minister and Mr S. Dhanabalan, then the Minister for National Development, to understand the depth and extent of the issue, and now my residents do not need umbrellas and plastic covers to go to the toilets. But it was a heavy and costly price, a tidy $22 million had to be put in to repair and replace these leaking pipes. At this point, I must thank the Senior Minister whose support finally turned the issue around. On behalf of my residents of Teban, Pandan and, I am sure, Boon Lay and Jurong, I thank the Prime Minister, the Senior Minister and Mr Dhanabalan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you need two systems - a potable water system and an industrial water system. You need two sets of pumps. Industrial water, as I said, is very corrosive. It eats into the pipes, especially cast iron pipes and also it leaks at the joints. It is smelly because it is not treated sufficiently well as it cannot be drunk. It stains the toilet bowls and, worse still, it invites mosquitoes into the flats, even the highest flats. Because mosquitoes lay their eggs in the reservoirs, and by the time they are transported and go into the flats, into the water closet, they become adults. And they fly out through the water closet outlets, so you get mosquitoes right even on the 20th floor. On top of this, the use of more pumps means more noise and more frequent breakdowns. I understand my fellow MP colleagues' concern about our water problem. I too am concerned. Their suggestion to use industrial water to flush toilets seems a very practical and logical one. But my Ayer Rajah's experience shows that this seemingly practical idea turned out to be a nightmare for my residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, I do not want to discourage the use of industrial water. Presently, it is being used to serve our industrial estates. If the time comes when the water needs have been stretched to the limit, we may not have much choice. In the meantime, we must continue to better manage this industrial water to be less corrosive. We must experiment with different piping systems. I hope the time will not come when industrial water may have to be reintroduced to flush our toilets in public and private housing. To avoid this, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must save water.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the industrial water problem will not be brought to our estates. The Member has given a gruesome picture on this whole issue. But if we conserve water and think of the water problem ahead, we would not face Dr Tan Cheng Bock's dilemma.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has surfaced an important problem, that is, the rising expectations of the young. We will face this problem inevitably. However, it is important that we grapple with the problem. We cannot avoid the problem, and we need to find effective solutions to meet the needs of our growing affluence and the expectations of the young. I hope the Minister for Finance, in his discourse, in the years to come, will be able to find some effective solutions to meet the expectations of the young.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can alert young Singaporeans to the challenges and the difficulties that they will face in meeting their aspirations. Nevertheless, if their aspirations are not met, I suppose there are other consequential effects that we are likely to face. Migration is likely to be one of the issues if the hopes and promises are better in other areas in the region and these are some of the consequences that we will have to face. Therefore, to avoid these problems, we need to try and find ways to meet these rising expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that we could look at some of the fiscal policies which will help to prepare our young people to be more skilled and better trained. And if they are better trained, they would be able to grapple with the complex changes in technology and be better prepared to become more competitive. If we can enlarge the cake and they can probably have more resources and more income, then we will be able to meet some of their expectations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there should be a better control of monopolistic tendencies in the private sector for housing, car ownership and bus transport. I feel that we have not done sufficiently enough to undertake some selective interventive measures to deal with such monopolistic tendencies, be it in housing, car ownership or transportation. We have not intervened sufficiently enough. The contrary argument is to let market forces decide. But market forces can decide to some extent. If left in the hands of a few key selective players who monopolise the sector, then I think the market forces will be askewed and the price escalations are likely to be very acute.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the Minister should consider, where possible, selective intervention in some of these sectors. We should control, when necessary, in some of the sectors where there are a few key significant players because these significant players are likely to escalate prices and create excessive inflation, ie, asset inflation, price inflation and, to some extent, excessive profiteering.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the consequences of these will be that the young will find themselves being displaced quickly in getting access to these goods and services. They can get frustrated as these goods and services remain elusive. True, we should allow market forces to decide in this matter from time to time. But I think there is a need for the State to intervene and mediate in some of these matters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps, the Government can allow more large cooperatives and Government-owned corporations to enter the market to compete and break the monopoly where necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue that I would like to address is the relocation of industries which we are likely to face in the near future. Our labour-intensive economic sectors would be affected by increased competition for cheaper labour cost in the region. Many older semi-skilled and unskilled workers could be affected by the relocation of these industries. Some factories can be saved by automation and workers can be trained for other gainful jobs. It appears that the training funds and incentives are not attractive to both employers and employees for them to take advantage of it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could more realistic and attractive fiscal measures not be implemented to help our companies to restructure and to train our older workers who could be affected by future retrenchments at the various factories? Small and medium enterprises could be given grants to restructure quickly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Skills Development Fund, which my fellow Members have talked about, there have been appeals for the Skills Development Fund to be reviewed. I think we have been very slow in attempting to look at how the Skills Development Fund could be made more relevant and accessible to meet the training needs of older workers and others whose skills need to be enhanced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is an urgency to address this problem so that older workers and others who are less skilled could be better prepared to meet the challenges of imminent retrenchment and relocation problems that we will be facing in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other area which is of concern and we should pay a bit more attention is the greying population. The fiscal measures to deal with the greying population is limited to tax relief for the care of aged parents. This only deals with the tail end of the greying problem. I think we should be more pre-emptive and we should probably be looking at how we can implement fiscal policies which will strengthen the family's capacity to address some of the problems of the care of the aged sick.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to look into the provision of more comprehensive policies to deal with the needs of our aging population. Tax relief for the care of the aged sick, incentives for employers to re-employ older workers after 60 years of age, support for voluntary initiatives to provide services, all these need to be reviewed urgently. We should not be caught with the burden of State care for the aged. Where possible, more relief should be given to families for looking after their aged sick. The present tax reliefs and incentives given to families for caring their aged sick are rather dismal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another matter is the issue of help for low income pensioners. As I pointed out in the earlier debate, low income pensioners have been a neglected group of people. Their problem deserves attention because they have low income and because of the increased cost of living over the last five years, their effective pensions and savings have been reduced and their capacity to purchase goods and services has been reduced to a great extent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these pensioners have given long years of public service, but their pensions are dismal and cannot help to meet the rising cost of living. Should they not be given a revision in their pension? I strongly feel that they should and they are no less deserving than those who were pensioned later.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their Singapore Allowance should be revised upward. And the depleting Medisave of these low income pensioners could be replenished and this would be a positive gesture by the Government to recognise the contributions of this group of pensioners who have in fact given bastion services to the Government in the earlier years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last but not least are the problems and aspirations of the low income families. We could afford in this Budget to be a bit more generous to low income families. The rental and service and conservancy rebates are only a trickle of the surplus budget. It accounts for only about 0.001% of the budget surplus. This is indeed very minuscule. In giving a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> further increase to these families, we hope it will help them to offset the GST burden. And I hope that the Minister in his subsequent review would think about this group of families and see how their burden could be reduced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Budget Statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget has been described as a development budget. It is in line with the Government's philosophy of investing in our future to "lay the foundations for sustained growth into the next century", as the Finance Minister said in his Budget speech.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good and efficient transport system, where goods and people can move about freely, with minimum hassle and minimum cost, is a very basic, although sometimes taken for granted, pillar of a modern economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has never hesitated to spend on transport infrastructure. In the last 10 years, our spending on road infrastructure was $2.3 billion, and on public transport and rail infrastructure, including the construction of the MRT, another $5.2 billion. This year alone, we will spend $216 million on roads and another $325 million on public transport and rail.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have these massive investments achieved? 20 years ago, many roads were narrow and congested. Only 17% of households owned cars. Today, 31% of households own cars. 20 years ago, the vehicle population was 280,000. Today, it is 614,000, more than double. Yet, we have managed to keep our roads relatively free flowing. We have achieved this through timely infrastructure building and better traffic management.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road capacity was increased significantly. New traffic demand management measures like GLIDE and ALS have kept traffic flowing in the CBD. The MRT was introduced in 1987 and it ushered in a new era in public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our transport system is now the envy of many cities around the world, many of which suffer from grid-lock and chronic traffic jams. But Singaporeans expect more, and why not when rising income levels and uninterrupted improvement in living standards for more than two decades have conditioned Singaporeans to expect that life will get better year after year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is it sustainable? The answer lies in whether we can temper our expectations with a sense of reality, and whether we can free ourselves from conventional wisdom and look for new and innovative ways of meeting these expectations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aspiration of many Singaporeans to own a car must be tempered by the reality that ours is a small country, with limited land, which has many competing uses. The frustration at seeing car prices rising over the years must be balanced by the realisation that this is because more and more Singaporeans are doing well. In 1980, 5% of every Primary One cohort became graduates. Today, the figure is 19% and is growing. If you include diploma holders, the figure is coming close to 60%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the reality is that we cannot all expect to own a car. The Government cannot create more land to build more roads to meet this aspiration. But the Government can, within the constraints we face, provide an efficient transport system that keeps Singapore and Singaporeans on the move, so that you and I can enjoy a good life and business can make money. This is a realistic goal. This is one which the Government can and will fulfil.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we enhance the mobility of Singaporeans and meet our transportation needs into the next century and beyond? The approach of simply increasing road capacity is not sustainable. Many roads are already built to the limit. We can build underground tunnels to relieve congestion, but they are very costly. We can build more viaducts, we can build more spaghetti junctions which are also very costly, very pollutive, very noisy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to build as far as possible. Over the next few years, our road building programme will add 225 lane-km of roads. Government will invest heavily on new roads, expressways and viaducts and we will spend, instead of $200 million a year, something like $250 million to $300 million a year, or roughly $1.1 billion for the next five years. At a later stage, we may have to embark on an underground road system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also relieve bottle-necks, for example, by building interchanges as we are now doing for junctions like the Holland Road/Farrer Road/Queensway interchange, and by extending the expressways like Tampines and Seletar Expressways, and by upgrading certain trunk roads into expressways like Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also apply intelligent traffic management techniques to improve traffic flow. By 1997, all traffic lights would have been linked to the GLIDE computer which will provide more green waves. We will also install systems which can warn motorists of traffic jams and accidents ahead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these investments in road building and road management alone are not enough. To further improve our transport system to meet the aspirations of Singaporeans for greater mobility, within the constraints of limited land, my Ministry intends to take the following additional measures:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We will increase the spectrum of public transport services and, more importantly, service levels.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We will improve the management of vehicle usage to sustain a higher vehicle population while preserving mobility for both motorists and public transport commuters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We will give due priority to public transport.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We will integrate and optimise the planning, development and management of our land transport system.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Rail</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me to elaborate. The MRT has allowed our city to be developed to a much higher intensity. It is the backbone of our public transport system. We intend to make the rail network more extensive. We expect to ultimately extend the present 67 km of MRT lines to about 160 km of MRT and LRT lines by the year 2030. This estimate excludes possible LRT feeder systems in HDB new towns.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently undertaking feasibility studies for a new North-East Sector MRT Line, and also for an MRT extension to Changi Airport, and an LRT system to serve the Marina Centre area. Results of these studies should be completed by the middle of this year. We will also study whether it is feasible to have additional LRT lines.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I led a delegation of transport specialists and town planners to Europe to look at various LRT systems. We were shopping for ideas, not hardware. So we did not come back with any particular system. But what we saw convinced us that the technology is available to bridge this gap between bus and MRT. The technology is available that can offer a level of service which approaches that of the MRT in terms of reliability and comfort and, at the same time, has almost the same flexibility and accessibility as that of the bus. The question is whether this technology is cost effective.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MRTC has called for tenders for the provision of LRT systems in two areas: Bukit Panjang and Buona Vista. Results of Stage 1 of the tender will be released soon. Stage 2 of the tender will involve the financial feasibility of the projects, including the cost to build and to operate the system, the fare structure, and so on. Whether the projects will proceed will depend on the results of Stage 2 of the tender. If feasible, LRT system studies will be initiated for other HDB towns, both existing and planned.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Bus Service</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MRT and LRT cannot serve every area. Buses will continue to play a key role in the public transport system. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government's policy of allowing a duopoly of bus companies to provide the bulk of bus services, with smaller companies providing services at the fringe, remains our best option. It allows the Government to insist on universal coverage and also to regulate fares so that the public's access to basic bus services remains good and affordable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Transport Council has established a set of comprehensive bus service standards, which defines what is a basic bus service, at today's fares. The setting up of standards is an important step in our efforts to further improve services. What these standards mean is that operators are put on notice that these are the standards that they must meet. Commuters know that if they do not get such a service, they have cause for redress. The Public Transport Council knows exactly where it stands in settling disputes and in deciding on new services. It does not mean that all services are up to par. For example, three trunk bus services will have to be upgraded to within 12 minutes of peak headway, and 12 feeder services must be upgraded to within the 10 minutes peak headway specified in the standards. The bus operators have until May this year to achieve this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also encourage bus companies to exceed current service standards instead of just simply meeting them. Feedback indicates that commuters want higher frequency of feeder services. They want additional short services to alleviate over-crowding on major demand corridors and they are concerned with long travelling time on buses. The PTC will ask the bus companies to consider providing special buses which can meet the demand for a higher level of service. As these services are optional services requiring additional buses, passengers who want such a service must be prepared to pay a premium.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Priority for Public Transport</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will seek to make public transport more convenient. We will smoothen transfer between buses and MRT, and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> further integrate bus and MRT facilities. We should work towards reducing total journey times, by speeding up bus journeys as well as minimising the waiting time, both real and perceived, in between connections.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to accord efficient road users greater priority in the use of road space. For example, buses compete with other vehicles for limited road space. Buses carry 80 people; cars typically carry one or two. If you compare with double-decker buses, for example, the illustration is even starker because double-deckers can carry up to 120 people. So it is only fair for buses to be given priority over other road users. Measures to give priority to buses will include more B-signals and more bus lanes. These measures, I am confident, will lead to speedier bus travel and more reliable bus schedules.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area we will look into is waiting time. Waiting is inevitable. We cannot eliminate it totally. But we can transform waiting into a more acceptable experience. We will begin by managing the psychology of waiting. By this, I mean we will reduce the cost of waiting and reduce the uncertainty of bus arrival times. Passengers can use their time better if there is real time information on departure and arrival times at bus stops and nearby MRT stations. If the real time information is available to him, the commuter can decide whether he should rush or whether he can afford to take a leisurely stroll, or do something else.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I visited a Transport Co-ordinating Centre in Frankfurt recently, I was told that they have done surveys which showed that passengers perceive waiting time to be shorter if they know exactly when their bus will arrive. Our bus companies are now studying the feasibility of implementing systems which can monitor the location of buses on their roads, provide real time passenger information and also correct deviations of buses when they stray from schedule. On its part, the Government will consider providing the necessary infrastructure at bus stops and MRT stations for bus operators to display relevant passenger information.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also spruce up selected bus stops and provide more amenities. New bus stops will be better designed, and some will have sheltered linkways to the nearest building. We will look into providing bus stops with amenities like telephones, food and drink dispensing machines. So if Dr Tan Cheng Bock has got any good idea, I will be happy to hear it from him.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Taxi Service</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxis constitute the high-end of the spectrum of public transport modes. A high quality taxi service must provide the convenience of a car with the personalised service of a chauffeur. It must also be of a consistently high standard and it must be generally available on demand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINCOM's policy is to price taxi service correctly and let supply and availability of taxis respond to market demand. This policy is sound provided we correctly reflect the cost of taxis as a highly personalised form of transport. For example, a taxi occupies as much road space as any other car, but unlike a car, it causes more road congestion because of empty cruising which is unproductive and wasteful.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that commuters receive the high quality service they expect, the ROV will introduce an operator licence for taxi companies. Taxi companies will be held accountable for the service provided by their drivers. ROV will monitor indicators on customer service provided by each taxi company, for example, number of complaints, ability to meet taxi despatch bookings, accident rates and roadworthiness of taxis. These service indicators will be published regularly for the benefit of passengers. It will serve to encourage those companies with good service quality and put the rest on notice that they have to pull up their socks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROV will also discontinue the current practice of issuing and renewing taxi licences of taxi companies liberally. Instead, taxi companies will be benchmarked regularly according to performance indicators that emphasise productivity increases and reductions in empty
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cruisings. Only taxi companies which meet the performance targets will be able to renew taxi licences or granted new ones. The ROV will announce details soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Managing Private Vehicle Usage</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that there will always be Singaporeans who will prefer to travel by car, notwithstanding any improvement to the public transport system. We also recognise the growing desire to own cars. These are legitimate aspirations of an affluent society. To accommodate these aspirations without congesting the roads, we will need to optimise vehicle flow through vehicle management and usage measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Road Pricing Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the ALS has been confined to the CBD. The Whole-Day ALS allowed us to increase the COE quota. When the Electronic Road Pricing system is ready in late 1997, we will also be able to relieve congestion on roads outside the CBD and release additional COEs to allow more Singaporeans to own cars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressways are potential candidates for ERP. Surveys conducted by PWD show that certain stretches of our expressways are already congested during the morning peak hours. Traffic volumes on these stretches are very heavy, and they have exceeded the design capacity. Vehicle speeds have fallen to as low as 17 kph, in contrast to the average speed of 55 kph recommended by PWD.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be implementing a pilot Road Pricing Scheme (RPS) for a short stretch of the East Coast Parkway during the morning peak period when traffic there is at its heaviest. A pilot project will start in June this year. Gantries will be erected at the stretch of the ECP between Fort Road junction and Rochor Road towards Jurong. Another will be at the entry into the ECP from Ophir Road, again in the direction of Jurong.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have chosen the East Coast Parkway because the area around the gantries has adequate bypasses and is also well-served
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> by public transport. Motorists will be required to purchase and display an RPS licence to pass through the gantries. Details of the pilot RPS will be announced shortly.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Whole-Day ALS</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started Whole-Day ALS in January 1994. A comprehensive traffic survey in January 1995 showed that the traffic situation in the CBD remained unchanged since the last survey in May 1994. Since the Whole-Day ALS has kept traffic conditions in the CBD at an acceptable level, no adjustments will be made to the ALS fees for the time being. However, we will make one slight adjustment. In response to requests from retailers in the CBD and members of the public, and in view of the traffic survey results, we will be shortening the ALS hours on Saturdays by one hour to end earlier at 2.00 pm instead of 3.00 pm with effect from 2nd May 1995.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Vehicle Quota for Next Quota Year</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With road pricing schemes like ALS and ERP, we can keep expressways and trunk roads which provide vital links to economic activities relatively free-flowing even during peak hours. However, it is impractical to price all roads. With increasing vehicle population, we cannot sustain free-flowing traffic conditions on all roads at all times of the day. Traffic conditions will worsen over time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Whole-Day ALS, we could, and we did, increase the COE quota. With ERP, we should be able to increase the COE quota further. We will evaluate the Road Pricing Scheme in a year's time, and then study whether additional COEs can be released pending the implementation of ERP. In the interim, growth of the vehicle population will be fixed at 3% per annum. The quota allocation for the next 12-month period from May 1995 to April 1996 will be 45,552 COEs or a monthly quota of 3,975 COEs. Further details on the breakdown by vehicle categories will be released shortly by ROV.

  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Land Transport Authority</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to coordinate our efforts to improve our public transport system and to manage traffic more effectively, the Government will set up a new statutory board to be known as the Land Transport Authority (LTA). The LTA will integrate the functions of planning, development, implementation and management of all public and private transport infrastructure and policies. It will be formed by merging the Roads and Transportation Division of the PWD, the ROV and the Land Transport Division of the Ministry of Communications. It will also merge with the MRTC so that planning and implementation of both road and rail infrastructure will be under one roof. This will not be done immediately, but should be achieved within two years. A single integrated agency, given the mission and the responsibility of meeting the nation's transport needs, will be better able to identify alternative infrastructure and policy options and evaluate the trade-offs between them. It will ensure that transport projects and measures undertaken complement each other in the most effective and cost efficient manner. This in turn will help us achieve an optimal national transport system, providing better service to commuters and value-for-money for the nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINCOM expects to establish this Authority within six months. Details are being worked out and will be announced in due course.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the challenge facing us now is not how to give every Singaporean a car. This is not possible even if our roads are congestion free. The real challenge is to meet the aspirations for increased mobility.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will provide commuters with more choice. We will create a more comprehensive range of public and private transport modes, ranging from buses, LRT, MRT, taxis to private cars. The individual can then choose the mode of travel to suit his preference and his pocket.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on the Presidential Address in January 1994, the Member for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Braddell Heights, Mr Goh Choon Kang, quoted a Chinese proverb used by the wise men of ancient China to advise their rulers: `fang min zhi kou, shen yu fang chuan' (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), loosely translated, it means that governing the people is more difficult than guarding against the water level in a river. In essence, what Mr Goh meant, I believe, was that the principles of taming a river resemble the art of governance. He added that to prevent a river from over-flowing and flooding requires more than damming. Dredging and providing outlets are equally important.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may paraphrase Mr Goh, in formulating our land transport policy, my Ministry will not only dam, but also dredge and provide alternative outlets. We will improve mobility for all Singaporeans by extending the range of public transport services available and upgrading the quality of service; managing vehicle usage to sustain a higher vehicle population; giving due priority to public transport; and coordinating all efforts to improve our national transport system, through a newly-established Land Transport Authority.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen (Nee Soon Central)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise two main points today. One is the question of saving water and the other is the merger of town councils.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the PAP Cadre Members' Conference on 15th January 1995, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong stressed the need to arrest the trend of rising water consumption and indicated that the Government would implement measures to conserve water. I then expected that in the 1995/96 Budget, water tariffs would be raised. True enough, as expected, the Minister for Finance announced the increase in the water conservation tax by 5% for both domestic and non-domestic use, citing prevention of water wastage as the reason.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in population and more activities in commerce and industry, consumption of water is inevitable. Water is precious and it should not be wasted. In Singapore, which is lacking in water
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> resources, this is certainly true. But increasing the water conservation tax will increase the burden of the people, especially those lower income and larger families. This is very unfavourable to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is essential. We cannot live without water. The question lies in the habit and method of using water. Good habits and correct methods are important. For example, when you are not using water, the tap must be turned-off; when you are using water, the tap should not be turned on full blast; and when you wash your car, you should use a pail instead of running a hose, etc. These correct methods of water usage can save water.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that nobody wants to burn his own pocket by deliberately wasting water. They are in fact lacking in the cultivation of good habits and neglecting the correct methods of using water. Therefore, we must promote the education of water conservation, rather than resorting to the imposition of a water conservation tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more than 50% of our water resources are dependent on the water supply from Johor, the reduction of water consumption will not have much effect on our water supply. The only thing is that we may lose more foreign exchange. That is the real problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the report in the Lianhe Zaobao on 11th March 1995, the Johor State government had intended to discuss the new water prices with the Singapore Government. I guess the Government's increase on water charges this time may have something to do with this matter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is precious. We should not waste it, but we must try to promote the conservation of water at all times, and not just before the increase in water charges. The effect of just one "Save Water Campaign" is not enough. We must start from the school and the family to educate our children and family members on how to save water. Only when we have enhanced the water saving awareness among our people, and cultivated in them the good habits and correct methods of water usage, then can we achieve the desired results.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long-term, apart from saving water, we should also actively develop our own local water resources. I think this is a better way. In yesterday's debate, I was very happy to hear the Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, telling us that the Government had already carried out such plans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short-term, I think the most effective way is to continue to get water supply from Johor. In view of this, to maintain and improve relationship with Malaysia is very important. In this regard, the Government has been doing well and I am very happy about it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one thing that puzzles me. On one hand, the Government is stressing the preciousness and importance of water, yet on the other hand, it has covered up part of the Lower Seletar Reservoir for the construction of the golf course for Orchid Country Club. This is ironical. Because of this country club, the area of the reservoir has to be reduced by about one-quarter. Why is the Government so inconsistent?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the merger of town councils, because this involves the wastage of public funds. Under the present regulations, town councils can merge into a larger town council. This is not a healthy way of doing things. I feel that the town councils should function on the basis of the constituency it represents. We should not allow the merger of one single constituency with another single constituency, one single constituency with a Group Representation Constituency (GRC) or a GRC with another GRC, because if one of the constituencies should be lost to another political party in future, then you will have to have a separation. So this merger and subsequent separation will cost a lot of money, such as the changing of signboards, directional signs, logos, letter-heads and other stationery, and accounts have to be settled before handing over. All these will cost a lot of public funds to be wasted. I hope that the Government will pay attention to this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, I have no objection to cooperation between town councils, but I do object to their merger. Cooperation between town councils will save on expenditure, particularly in making purchases and contracts. There are quite a lot of benefits in such cooperation between town councils.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to raise two other points with the Government with the hope that they will attract the attention of Government:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. I have noticed that when contractors are drawing lines on our public roads, they dirty the road surface by causing paint to spill and stain on the roads. This makes the roads very unsightly. I hope that the PWD will take the necessary action to prevent this staining on the roads;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Vacant flats in the various constituencies should be let out or sold to the people as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, this year's Budget is not bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar GRC):</b> Clarification, please.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask Mr Cheo two points. Firstly, he said that there was a loss in foreign exchange when we bought water from Johor. What is the connection between the two - the loss of foreign exchange and the purchase of water from Johor?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is he thinking of merging his Nee Soon Central Town Council with the PAP town councils in his neighbouring constituencies? In fact, I feel there is nothing wrong with a town council merging with another town council. It is a case of mutual willingness. I can appreciate his predicament, but can he please clarify?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on this question from Mr Choo, I would like to elaborate. On the loss of foreign exchange, if we buy water from a foreign country, we have to use our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> money to buy the water, so we lose our money to the pockets of the foreign country. This is a loss of foreign exchange. If we conserve water and the water is ours and we have our own water resources, we can use them for a longer period of time. But now most of our water comes from Johor and so what we should do, over the long term, is to actively develop our own water resources and not to continue relying on foreign supply of water.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the merger of town councils, why am I raising this question here? I think it will be easier to explain if I give you an actual example. For example, in the past, Nee Soon South and Nee Soon Central were jointly managed by one town council to take care of the area. But when the SDP won Nee Soon Central, the town council was split into two. In the course of splitting, we have to settle our accounts, change the road signs, signboards, letter-heads and other stationery of both constituencies. Both sides would have to do these all over again. That means we have to spend a lot of money. Both town councils have to waste a lot of money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Nee Soon South Town Council has merged with Ang Mo Kio Town Council. If the Government keeps the same electoral boundary and, in future, if Nee Soon South is won by another party, not necessarily the SDP, then they may not want to continue to remain in the Ang Mo Kio Town Council. So again, they will have to separate from the Town Council and in the process, more public fund will be wasted. The two town councils would start all over again. Their stationery, signboards, logo and a host of other things will have to be changed. The road signs would also have to be changed, and they will have to go through all the trouble of settling their accounts again.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more in favour of cooperation rather than merger between town councils because in cooperation, like in the case of joint purchase of dustbins for the town councils, they can call just one and the same tender exercise, and with the economy of scale, they can buy them at a cheaper price.
  <br>

  <br>2.31 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to join in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1988, the Government has accumulated surpluses every year. This year is no exception. Instead of the usual $1 billion or $2 billion surpluses each year, the Minister had budgeted a huge $5.8 billion surplus for FY 1995/96. If we add to that the investment income and receipts from sale of land, the Government shall be receiving a whopping $9.3 billion, representing something like $3,200 from every man, woman and child in Singapore, taking our Singapore population at 2.85 million. The fees and charges to be collected are budgeted at $3.6 billion. That sum is nearly three times that budgeted for FY 1992/93.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Singaporeans applauded the Government for being so efficient in the management of the finances of the country when it accumulated surpluses year after year. But now, I sense that the mood has changed. I can even venture to say that the average working Singaporean and Singaporeans who are running small businesses shall grit their teeth when they learn that the Government is budgeting for another surplus, not $1-$2 billion this time but $5.8 billion. And knowing the efficiency of the Government in collecting money, the budgeted surplus may well exceed the $6 billion mark.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do they grit their teeth? They do so because they know from past experience that when the Government is aiming for a budget surplus, the high costs shall not come down and Government and statutory board fees and charges shall certainly increase before the end of the year. It is also unlikely that licences, like the COEs, shall drop further. Anyway, it is a good source of revenue for the Government. The level of collection of other fines and charges shall have to be increased as shown by the increased budgeted amount. On record, so far, this Government is budgeting for more surpluses than the previous Government. I suppose it has to, because it cannot use the surpluses accumulated
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> by the previous Government unless it gets the consent of the President and no new self-respecting Prime Minister will go to the President to seek that consent in normal times. The Goh Chok Tong's Government shall have to build up its own surpluses. So do all incoming future governments unless, of course, the Constitution is amended, which is unlikely as far as we can see.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it would appear that budgeting for surpluses shall be the order of the day in the years ahead. It would appear that Singapore would not have an easy time ahead of us. Having noted that the Government shall have a big surplus this year, the obvious question is: what does the Government intend to do with all that massive amount of money? The total budgeted receipt is $9.3 billion. The Government is clearly not handing them out to the poor and needy or to support any welfare programmes. I say that the Government owes a duty to the people of Singapore to let them know what it intends to do with those surpluses. Does it simply just want to preserve the bulk of it in case of emergencies, or invest it, or what? If it intends to invest the money, whether it is to be done locally or abroad. We know that the Government has initiated the Suzhou project which costs about $30 billion. Is the Government going to commit more money in Suzhou? The sum of $9.3 billion is receipts over outlay. That means all the developmental and infrastructural needs of the country have been catered for. The $9.3 billion are pure surpluses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should tell the people of Singapore what it intends to do with those moneys. Most people in Singapore would not object to the Government accumulating surpluses. What they are unhappy about is the way the Government does it. The Government always uses fiscal means to solve almost every problem in Singapore, whether it be a national, social or health problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A current example is the so-called water problem. The Prime Minister announced that we may suffer water shortage in 15 to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 20 years' time. The next thing we know is that the water conservation tax is raised. There must surely be other solutions other than increasing the tax on water conservation charges. My estimate is that the increase in water conservation tax may be close to $30 million which will offset the $30 million the Government is making payment for rental and service and conservancy charges for HDB flat dwellers. The Government will not lose anything.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is really a water problem now, I would suggest that the Government start a Save Water campaign for one month and repeat it every year. Then it could monitor the water consumption of every household and commercial and industrial enterprise. If water consumption rises above the permitted amount for a householder, now fixed at 20 cubic metres, then a warning should be served on that consumer. If that consumer fails to heed the warning, then his water supply should be shut off for one or two days. Once the consumer is deprived of water for one or two days, the lesson of water conservation shall surely be put across to that person very effectively. The consumer shall, of course, be made to pay the turn-off and turn-on charges. On the other hand, an increase in water conservation tax will not effectively teach people to conserve water. For the rich who can afford to pay the water conservation tax he would merrily continue to consume large amounts of water. He may use our good clean water to wash three of his cars and hose his garden to make it look like the Garden of Eden. Where is the lesson of water conservation as far as that rich person is concerned? The lesson cannot be really got on to him. Instead of increasing the water conservation tax, the Government should replace it with a more equitable solution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government says that householders consume about 55% of the water supply and that businesses consume the other 45%. This statement does not give the true picture of water consumption in Singapore. Although the industrial and commercial sectors use up 45% of the water supply in Singapore, their number comprises only about 15% of the account
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> holders, whereas domestic account holders add up to 85% of the total consumers. This means that we have a situation where 85% of household consumers use up 55% and the other 45% is used up by only 15% of the account holders. In other words, if we compare account holder with account holder, you will find that in fact the industrial and commercial account holders use up to five times more water than the domestic account holders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore today, the big time water guzzlers are not families but those in the industrial and commercial sectors. The Government should then not penalise householders but get the businesses to do something about the water problem. It is not that businesses like to use more water because as the economy improves, so do businesses improve, and water consumption will also increase.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the most obvious thing to do is to make factories and other industrial plants recycle their waste water for reuse. The Minister has suggested that desalination is a solution. But it is not really the best. We are not an oil producing country, like Saudi Arabia. If there is going to be another oil price hike, the desalination plant may not be economically feasible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1965, Lee Kuan Yew said that if there was a hostile government across the Causeway, we have to start to dig wells in Singapore. My question is: has the Government done a thorough research into the possibility of being self-sufficient in water supply from local sources? If the Government carries out an intensive investigation to find water resources locally, it may well discover a huge reservoir underground somewhere in Singapore. Have we done that? Of course, as suggested by a hon. Member, I am tempted to say that maybe at Potong Pasir you will find one reservoir. And I can tell you from personal knowledge that it used to be a water resource-rich constituency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has plenty of money. It should set up some fund to engage a special team to specifically advise the Government on how Singapore can be self-sufficient in water supply. Somebody
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> has suggested that a dam be built across the Singapore side of the Straits of Johor. I think this is a very good idea. It was, in fact, canvassed in the local papers a few years back. In fact, Hong Kong has done it. I have read about the building of that dam in Hong Kong and the engineering side is not that really difficult. They just have to pile rocks and, surprisingly, pile mud on top of the rocks. When the mud settles, the mud seals off all the gaps in the rocks and then you have a dam. I think the Singapore Government should seriously consider this idea.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a large surplus expected this year, it is expected that there will be a large number of proposals and suggestions on how the surpluses can be used. In principle, the Government should look at the needs and priorities objectively. After all, we are Singaporeans. "We are Singapore" as the patriotic song which is broadcast over TV regularly tells us. The Government should not in its use of the budget surpluses distinguish between Opposition and PAP wards, although on record PAP constituencies have benefitted $51 million to-date towards community projects. And the Opposition has not been given one cent in respect of such projects. Similarly, upgrading programmes up till now have only been confined to PAP constituencies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will change all that and look objectively at the urgency of the needs of each constituency, especially in the older HDB estates. Some of the more urgent problems the Government should give assistance to are, for example, grants to older estates to repair sunken aprons. These are caused by the sinking of the lower level at the void decks, causing ugly and dangerous gaps between the void decks and the level below them. The Government should give grants to repair sunken aprons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another urgent matter is that in older estates which are 20 or more years old, you will find that nearly all the water pipes underground have corroded and there are massive amounts of water leakage underground which are sometimes hard to detect. What the Government needs to do is to give money, because they are costly
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and the Town Councils find it a burden on them. The Government should step in to replace all those underground water pipes that are in fact more than 20 or more years old. Because it is difficult to repair them ad hoc. Whenever there is a leakage, you try to repair them which is difficult. Money should be spent and replace the whole lot of them. Since at this time there is talk of conservation of water, perhaps Government could treat that as one measure of conserving water in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the older estates also, in the early days, the Government was eager to plant big trees. All these trees have now matured and their roots are causing great problems to the car parks. They have spoiled all the car parks and these trees need to be cut down. The car parks have to be repaired and then the trees have to be replanted and the car parks redone again. All these are very costly projects. I am involved with a Town Council and I personally know these are the problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also join Members in urging the Government to help pensioners who are not earning very much, especially more assistance should be given to pensioners who are chronically ill. Government should either waive their medical charges or allow them to pay at a lower rate. I think Government should help these workers who have given much of their whole life to building the nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem that has been brought up, which is close to every housewife, is the maid levy. Much has been talked about it. Unless, of course, the Government can build enough creches or child care centres to mind the babies, I think the Government should take steps to waive or lower this levy to help mothers to go to work and increase their combined household income. I think this is a real problem and the Government should look into it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone through this year's Budget and noted that there is no subvention for Woodbridge Hospital. The Government has asked Singaporeans to be more
  <br>

  <br> competitive and go abroad in its regionalisation drive. This has put great stress on families. The society has also become more affluent and successful. One of the main problems of success is also the growing problem of mental illness. The Government should pay more attention to this area in its health policy. Mental illness is a growing problem. I urge the Government to put aside more resources for more mental health facilities. For a start, it could build more psychiatric outpatient clinics and to train more social workers who can help people who have psychiatric problems or who are suffering under great stress. I think the Government should not neglect this area in its health care policy.

  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar GRC):</b> May I seek clarification, Sir, from Mr Chiam?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I have four questions to ask Mr Chiam. First of all, I wonder how Mr Chiam will reconcile the fact that a country having surpluses means that the people will have a tough time ahead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether he would consider volunteering his Potong Pasir ward to have a water shut-down for two or three days per week to encourage people to save water.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I am not an engineer, but I would like to know how can a dam be so easily built by piling mud and rock. Maybe he can explain.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, he talked about upgrading of old estates. I think the Prime Minister already mentioned before that all of us have got to queue. I do not think Mr Chiam would like the Government to carry out upgrading projects in the four Opposition wards and not in the other PAP wards. All of us have got to wait. So be a bit more patient.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, if every government's aim is to have surpluses, it must collect its money from somewhere. The money just does not drop from heaven.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> So it is going to collect more money from the people. Of course, the people will have a tough time ahead. They will have less money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal that I mentioned is not for the whole population to shut down water for two or three days. Everybody can have their needs of water. The PUB can monitor the water bills and if they note that this fellow has been consistently consuming above the permitted level, then they send him a warning and say, "Look here, your water consumption is too high. Please reduce it." If he does not heed the warning, then they take enforcement action to shut off the water supply. It can be easily done. You just lock it up. And then for one or two days, if he has no water, he has got to go next door with a pail to try to get some water, then he will learn the lesson.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards building a dam, this is what I read in the Readers' Digest many years back when Hong Kong built this dam. It has been done. Of course, there are engineering problems. But I am talking of just the bare basics. You dump a lot of rocks and then you cover up with mud. And surprisingly enough, the mud will seal off the leaks. [Laughter]. Do not laugh. This is an engineering possibility. I think it is a feasible thing to do in Singapore and the Singapore Government should give it a go.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the problem is the salinity of the water. Over time, the saline water will be diluted. Of course, you cannot totally get rid of salinity in such a situation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that Opposition wards will not be given upgrading. They have to. But the point is that although they are equally old, equally run down in status, there are as yet no signs that they will be upgraded. Because I know that just across my constituency, Kim Keat Constituency has been upgraded. It is just across the road and some people described it as a first-class condominium. If it can be done across the road, why can it not be done on the other side of the road?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I am still not convinced with Mr Chiam's answers. Since he cannot answer me on how to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reconcile having surpluses and having a tough time ahead, can he tell me how many countries in the world are having deficits and yet the people are enjoying it?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have not said that. He wants to put words in my mouth and ask me to answer him. I have already explained. Because of the amendments in the Constitution, each government must accumulate its own surplus. Otherwise, if there is an emergency, it has got no money to rely on.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> So it is a good thing to have surpluses.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I did not say that. I said that since that is the order of the day, surpluses must be obtained from someone. So in this case, it is from the people of Singapore. And if the people of Singapore are going to pay more to the Government, they will have less and so they will have a tough time ahead. That is what I said.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State for Health has pointed out to me that in fact there is a sum allocated as subvention for Woodbridge Hospital. Therefore, with your permission, I would like to withdraw the statement that I made that there was no subvention for Woodbridge Hospital.

  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget, to me, is both special and unusual. It really indicates that our economy is doing well
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and we are, to sum it up, on the right track. I think it is also clear that it was designed to bring Singapore into a higher level of economic development and, hopefully, more prosperity for our people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Singapore had, on several occasions, been highlighted by many international magazines as one of the economic miracles in the world. Until today there are several more examples highlighted from time to time. It was Jurong at one time, later on the Port of Singapore, Changi Airport, Singapore Airlines and various other stories.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these were products of good and prudent financial policies, good Government and, of course, the hard work of the people of Singapore. Today, we have a Singapore, not as one of the richest countries in the world, as mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, but despite not being one of the richest countries in the world, we know, by international reports and findings, that Singaporeans today are enjoying one of the highest standards of living in the world and by the purchasing power parity, ranked ninth in the world and the first in Asia. This is in a way another miraculous situation whereby our country has progressed so fast within such a short period. That means we have from year to year budgets that were specifically designed to manage the success stories of Singapore. I think this will become very challenging.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I notice that this year's Budget has no new tax introduced. Of course, what we heard from the Minister for Finance was that almost all of them are tax reductions and even financial contributions to Singaporeans. I am sure this will draw welcome news from many people in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One matter that I would like to mention here today is the $500 top-up, comprising $200 CPF top-up and $300 Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme. Sir, to me, this is something very unusual, and for many Singaporeans it is also unusual that they
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are getting special cash grants from the Government although it started last year. I am sure many welcome it. But I am not sure how Singaporeans would be able to appreciate such a gesture. In the long term, my fear is that people will get so used to getting direct contributions from the Government that they would expect similar gifts every year, and every year they would even expect higher give-aways, ie, more money from the Government to them through CPF or other means. Already today there are some people who have said that the amounts given through the CPF and other means, like the payment of rental of HDB flats and S&amp;C charges, were small and they compare this to the $1.5 billion collected by the Government through GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also indicated that many people, or at least some of them, have forgotten that the GST was introduced last year and when it was introduced the level of income tax has already been brought down. I think we should wait for one or two years before further changes can be expected. These and other rebates given to flat dwellers, especially rental flats, I consider as bonuses from the Government to the people of Singapore as a way to share the nation's wealth that we have accumulated over the years. On top of that, the Minister for Finance also announced the contribution of $1 billion to the Edusave Scheme and a 10% tax rebate to income tax payers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister in this case may want to address one issue that has been brought up through the feedback channel that many of these rewards were actually benefiting the not-so-poor or even the rich in Singapore. I am not sure this is true. But maybe it would help if we could assist Singaporeans to see the meaning of these rewards clearer so that they could appreciate it better, especially those in the lower income group. In future, I would also hope that the Government, through the Minister for Finance, would perhaps consider and think of other ways to reward Singaporeans for their hard work instead of these direct financial rewards. Of course, one way is, if you want to help the lower income group, to assist in providing financial assistance through
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> various organisations, like one area mentioned by my colleague from Thomson GRC, Mr Leong Horn Kee, that the Government consider in assisting CCCs and other grassroots organisations to help finance the lower income group so that they could attend school in Singapore from primary one right up to university level without any financial worry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I would like to support the Budget Statement made by the Finance Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lau Ping Sum -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lau Ping Sum (Ang Mo Kio GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, against a forecast of a FY94 budget surplus of $1.58 billion, the revised figure was $5.95 billion. As we all know, Singapore is one of the few countries capable of increasing the cumulative surplus year after year. Other countries with recurrent deficit face mounting debts or escalating inflation or both. The surplus of $5.95 billion is therefore good news. However, the original assumptions underlying the forecast of $1.58 billion appear to have been extremely conservative. While prudence in budgeting is necessary, official estimates may lose their credibility if the gap between the estimated and the final figures is too large. In this case, the revised FY94 budget surplus is 3.8 times the estimate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the MTI Economic Survey of Singapore 1994, it is stated that sustained efforts were made to maintain a small and efficient public sector to release maximum financial and manpower resources to the private sector to build up the Singapore economy. Some people have therefore wondered if the high excess of receipts over outlay has not compromised these efforts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned three key areas in which we need to devote attention. First, to prepare Singapore for the global economy; second, to provide maximum incentives to create wealth; and third, to build a more cohesive society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a cohesive society, even a highly skilled population will not be able to sustain Singapore in the long run. At the first sign of trouble, some of the highly skilled will leave for the greener pastures of other countries. On the other hand, if a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> large number of Singaporeans are not convinced that their future or their children's future is in Singapore, dissatisfaction will spread.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that the Government has time and again re-emphasised the importance of every Singaporean to have a role to play and a contribution to make to the country. The HDB upgrading programmes, the CPF top-up schemes, rebates on rental and service and conservancy charges are visible measures to allow every Singaporean to enjoy the fruits of success. To promote social cohesion, these measures are necessary but not sufficient. But the desire for more of the good things in life can never be completely satisfied. We should be mindful of the universal values of diligence, thrift, mutual support and respect. Our neighbours in Malaysia have recently discovered that there are certain common principles between Confucian and Islamic teachings. We in Singapore should re-examine the way in which such basic values can be strengthened now that the teaching of Confucian ethics and religious knowledge has been discontinued in the schools. When Singaporeans learn to be more gracious and less self-centred and develop an interest in the non-materialistic aspects of life, we will have a more balanced perspective.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to comment on some of the tax changes. On the payment of tax-exempt dividends out of foreign income, at present, a Singapore company may distribute foreign income as tax exempt dividends to its shareholders. If the shareholder is a company owning not less than 50% of the capital of the company paying the tax exempt dividend, it can in turn pass on the tax exempt dividend to its own shareholders. But the flow through of tax exempt dividend is restricted to two levels of shareholdings. Any further upward payment of dividend would be taxed in the hands of the recipient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to encourage companies to venture abroad, the Minister announced removal of the two-level restriction. However, it is not entirely clear what the 50% shareholding requirement entails.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Does it mean that the flow through is allowed as long as the company receiving the tax exempt dividend holds directly or indirectly at least 50% of the shares of the company paying the dividend? Or is a direct shareholding of at least 50% in the company from which it receives the dividend sufficient, notwithstanding that its indirect interest in the company paying the dividend is less than 50%? The incentive would be more attractive if the flow through of tax exempt dividends is allowed in both cases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Minister has stated that the 50% requirement may be waived on a case-by-case basis. As the granting of a waiver on a case-by-case basis involves some degree of subjective judgement, can the guidelines used in such reviews be made known?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, would the Minister consider the following measures to further encourage Singapore companies to venture abroad:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To review the credit limitations rule from an itemised income basis to permit `averaging' of foreign taxes with respect to foreign income from different countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To allow carry-forward excess foreign tax credits without time limit for utilisation in subsequent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Taxation on Unit Trusts</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister announced a number of changes for interest, gains on disposal of securities, dividends and other income received by the unit holders. These changes by and large benefit the non-resident unit holders. Can the same benefits be extended to the individual unit holder resident in Singapore? For example, 10% of the gains on disposal of securities used to be taxed at 27%. It will be exempted in the case of non-resident unit holders. By granting the same benefit to Singapore residents, investment in unit trusts will be more attractive. For the CPF account holders who use their CPF
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> savings for investments, unit trusts will be a much safer bet than venturing into the volatile stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, basically the Budget presented by the Minister for Finance this year is intended to satisfy all sectors of society. I think the Minister's objective has been achieved because the Budget has benefited both individuals and the business community. However, people being what they are, when money is the issue, there is often a desire for more, as we have heard from speeches before. The Government's generosity in returning the surpluses to individuals and to those living in the flats gives the impression that the Government is beginning to pamper the people, although that is not the real intention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I am concerned that this generosity might be held by the people against the Government one day when it is not in the position to continue giving these handouts. I hope this will not happen and the Minister for Finance will continue to increase our surpluses so that the people will always be grateful for whatever they are given. At the same time, I would like to say that in raising the surpluses, the Government should consider the difficulties caused when levies are imposed abruptly and at high rates. In this regard, I must commend the Singapore Post for its wisdom in raising the postage rate by only 2 cents, when we know that petrol prices have not gone down and the cost of transportation continues to rise. In this way, the people do not feel the burden and I have not heard anyone criticising Singapore Post for the increase in postage. I believe the move by the Singapore Post should be followed by other authorities in terms of raising their charges. Similarly, Singapore Telecom has been bold enough to reduce the subscription rate for handphones from $50 to $45. These are two examples out of a number of measures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the best way to do things. I mean, when profits have increased, levies should be reduced. Charges should also be reduced. These are things that the people always look forward to, and they will be really appreciative of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made these points, I can conclude by saying that the PAP Government -P A P - has become a Profitable government and from its profits, the government Pays the people and I would urge the Government to continue doing so. As an example, the Government has given out a total of $594 million to the people, $234 million through the 10% income tax rebate and $360 million through CPF top-up on 1st October. This amount does not include rebates for Service and Conservancy charges and rentals. I believe these measures will leave the people with a sense of pride in the efficiency of the Government, and they will continue to support the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some quarters might look upon this generosity as an economic or fiscal instrument to curb undue expansion of the economy without sacrificing growth. The Government actually realises that the people play an important role in the country's success because the people have been hardworking, because they have maintained stability and racial, social and political harmony in the country and because they have been determined to improve their life and education. In appreciation of their hard work, the Government is now distributing the surpluses gained. I believe the people of Singapore are proud to have an efficient and effective Government and will continue to support the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak in support of this motion in the name of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people the GPC members talked to in the business sector are concerned with rising business cost. We have heard this so many times and the Government has rebutted this issue so often that somehow I feel somewhere something is amiss.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to concerns and queries received in the House by Members, the Minister has included a Table this year in the Budget Statement to show how our tax revenue and non-tax revenue
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> compared with other countries. At 22.1%, comprising 17.7% of GDP for tax revenue and 4.4% of GDP for non-tax revenue, it is interesting to note that we are not exactly the lowest in this respect. The fact is that the data show that we are higher than the average for the other four ASEAN countries, comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, and higher than the average of 21.6% of GDP for the NIEs. But tax and non-tax revenue in relation to GDP is only one dimension to this problem of concern for rising cost of doing business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part to look at is from gross profit rate in the business sectors in Singapore. If the tax and non-tax revenue part of GDP is high and the gross profit rate part is relatively low, then naturally the complaint by those business sectors must be justified. What we should focus on is that the tax and regulatory costs and fees constitute only one aspect of the problem. The level of the cost structure affects the gross profit rate. If the high costs, including regulatory cost, impinge directly across the board on many sectors - rentals, wages, levies, transport cost, COEs - many of the lagging business sectors will naturally feel the pinch more than the others.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I would like to suggest that what we are seeing at work is an economic allocation process. Naturally, resources, whether it is labour, office workers, managers, or tearing down of old buildings and building new ones in its place, will move to higher value-added sectors or more profitable business. The problem is that we need some of these laggards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to the predicament is not necessarily less regulation or let the free market rein wild but targeted assistance to certain business sectors to improve and imbibe newer technology and organisation with the goal to raise value-added. It is in this area that we should do more, particularly assistance schemes to the small and medium enterprises. Small and medium-sized enterprises given a chance will also want to move out of Singapore. That is a sentiment I get talking to some of them. The difficulty is that they may not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have the ready access to opportunity and capital, compared with the bigger companies. It is perhaps inevitable that a certain hollowing-out of industries and businesses may take place as regionalisation takes up speed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MNCs who have been investing overseas for decades finally end up using more and more of the local industries as supporting contractors where such industries have the low cost, the skill and the quality in servicing them. But for the home-based suppliers and the contractors who have certain technologies or special skills in the production of the intermediate input, it is possible to continue supplying the MNCs overseas from home. Hence, I consider a renewed and more deliberate scheme to pull up the small and medium-sized industries to be a corollary to our regionalisation drive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our big boys go and establish beachheads overseas, our small and medium-sized industries should be pulled along. Otherwise, the so-called building of the second wing is not complete. One may ask why do we need to specially help our own small and medium-sized industries when they are supposed to be competing with the world. My answer is because they are largely our own.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own market, we all know, is too small. Our economy is largely dominated by MNCs who can make their own way in third countries on their own in collaboration with the locals in those countries. They will also bring along their own home country suppliers or subcontractors or pass jobs to them. All these have been done by MNCs for decades. If our SMEs are not pulled along, the danger is that our economy will not only be hollowed out, the linkage in the business sectors will be more and more fragmented. Entrepreneurial businesses riding on the coat tails of the big boys will be affected. The political economy will lose its social economic bonding. Suddenly, as the Minister has so aptly put it, the balls may not be so readily fed for the goals to be scored because the team has been thinned out.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Command Paper 3 of 1995 which spells out the Budget spending of the Government last year, in 1994, only $5 million out of a budget allocation of $20 million was used to assist under the EDB assistance schemes under Phase I, that is, 25% of what was allocated. And only $20 million out of an allocated sum of $56 million, that is, 36% was used to assist under the EDB assistance schemes under Phase II. This figure for 1994 was very much lower than for 1993. These figures are found in page 675 of the Command Paper. Are we reaching out to the SMEs in a timely and approachable manner?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad that the Minister has mentioned that the Government is studying possible changes to its fiscal policies to make the economy more competitive and to strengthen the incentives of businesses and individuals to venture, succeed and enjoy the fruits of the enterprise. I hope he can consider how to give the SMEs a great lift.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has announced that in order to equip Singaporeans to meet new challenges in the global economy, the Government will increase the proportion of young people going into tertiary education from 71% in 1994 to 85% by the year 2000. This consists of 20% of each cohort going to university, 40% to polytechnic and 25% to ITE. This is the direction that Singapore will be heading.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with more and more young people receiving tertiary education, we can expect even higher expectations and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> aspirations. There will be more expectations for the four "Cs", that is, cars, credit cards, cash and condominiums. These young people want the four "Cs" and, rightly or wrongly, they expect to achieve this within the shortest possible time. They constitute the emerging middle class which expects Government to place as few obstacles as possible in their paths and help realise their aspirations for an even better life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, Government is facing a huge challenge of meeting these aspirations. Land is a limited resource. Our capacity to put more cars on the roads or allow more private housing is constrained by our land size. Eventually, people will have to pay even more for the privilege of using our limited road space and land for private housing. In fact, even those who already own cars are unhappy because they know that the cost of owning this asset is going up every year. Those who have yet to have a house or car worry that the value of these assets will inflate beyond their means. What is the solution? If the Government cannot solve this problem, there will be more and more disillusion on the part of the people. How can we get out of this dilemma, short of an economic recession? How can we continue to maintain this bond between the people and the Government if the majority of the aspirations of tertiary educated graduates cannot be met?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Government is aware of this dilemma and is calling Singaporeans to peg their aspirations to a more realistic level. They want young Singaporeans to bear in mind our limitations and factor in our constraints as a small country. In short, the Government is suggesting that the people lower their expectations. The Prime Minister has also proposed that we should start by educating our young to understand these constraints so that they can be more realistic in their aspirations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, aspiration is something that is derived when people see their contemporaries doing better than they do. It is relative. It is inevitable when people start to compare. Therefore, it is not something that you can ask the people to lower or even forget about it. They may understand
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the limitations but still their aspirations must be met and if they cannot be realised, an alternative must be given. Understanding the limitations alone may not be enough to temper people's expectations and desire to own a car or private housing. The question now is what can the Government offer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example. If Government wants people to live with the reality that not everyone is going to be able to afford a car, then it is imperative that the Government take active steps to improve the public transport system. For instance, increasing the frequency of bus services, speeding up the construction of MRT extensions, implement the much talked about Light Rail System and building more underground tunnels. These programmes must now be brought forward and not postponed due to economic reasons. The Government is hesitant to embark on such programmes on grounds that they are not economically viable, or not enough demand. But I think the longer the delay, the heavier will be the political price.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the Minister for Communications' announcement just now on land transport policy. I am glad that the Minister also sees some wisdom in the quotation I used last year, that is, he will adopt a two-pronged approach in his land transport policy, ie, both damming and dredging. But I hope that he would not use one preceding the other, that is, damming before dredging. Already we know that he will be damming part of the ECP and maybe some of the expressways, CTE, and so on. Because if you dam and not dredge at the same time, the traffic will overflow in certain areas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has been successful in providing the alternative in public housing. In recent years, we have seen quality housing in HDB 4- and 5-room flats, Executive apartments and maisonettes. They are built to a standard which is comparable, if not better, than private condominiums. HDB has also raised its income ceiling recently to allow more households to buy HDB flats. Even the existing owners of 3-room flats are not left out. They enjoy the benefits of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> upgrading and see their houses appreciate in value. Upgraded HDB flats with better facilities and landscaping look every bit like private apartments. Therefore, I think the Government has been successful in providing the people with an acceptable alternative in public housing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, meeting the higher expectations and aspirations of a better educated population will increasingly be a major challenge faced by the Government in the future. On the one hand, the Government must weigh its policy priorities with the aspirations of the people as well as find ways and means to assist them to realise these aspirations. On the other hand, the people should continue to understand the constraints faced by the Government and the fact that it takes time to work around this limitation to make improvement. This should be a two-way process, failing which distrust and misunderstanding will set in. Only when both parties make efforts to understand each other that we can continue to strengthen the bond between the Government and the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>4.00 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all the Members of the House who have spoken on the Budget over the past two days. Time will not permit me to address every Member's concern in detail and I will focus on the major issues and leave matters of detail to be considered in the Committee of Supply.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of GST, we have laid the foundation for a major transformation of our tax system. The necessary tools are now in place to ensure our long-term competitiveness and to support the development of our external economy. This year's Budget builds on this foundation. It fine-tunes the tax system further to meet specific needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address the specific major issues raised by Members.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Impact of GST on the Economy</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first review the implementation of GST. On the whole, the implementation of GST has been smooth, considering that it is a new tax with a very comprehensive tax base. Apart from some minor hitches in the initial stages of implementation, businesses and the public have adapted very quickly to the new tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fears were expressed when GST was first mooted about its adverse impact on prices and on our overall competitiveness. Some Members had also expressed concern over the administrative burden that GST would impose on businesses. Let me deal with each of these in turn.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, the public's fear of sharp price increases on account of GST did not materialise. In the Budget debate last year, Mr Chiam See Tong predicted that GST would raise the consumer price index (CPI) to 9% in 1994. He will be pleased to know that the CPI rose by only 3.6% last year, significantly lower than the 5.5% earlier projected. The low CPI increase was due in no small part to the widespread support given by grassroots shopkeepers to community leaders' appeals not to raise prices and to keen competition in the retail sector. Credit must also be given to the efforts of CASE in publicising prices of essential goods.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of GST has also clearly not dampened our economic growth in any way. The economy grew by 10.1% in 1994. If anything, our concern is with the overheating of the economy, rather than sluggish growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly high economic growth last year raised GST collections to $1.5 billion, well above the original estimate of $960 million. At the same time, the value of the GST offset package was also increased to $1.7 billion. Overall, the implementation of GST remains revenue negative as promised by the Government. Some Members want to know why there was such a large variance between the projected and the revised figures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the reasons for the variance. On the revenue side, the original estimate of $960 million was based on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Private Consumption Expenditure (PCE) figures of 1992, adjusted to 1993 and 1994 levels. It assumed nominal GDP growth rates of 7.5% for 1993 and 8% for 1994. As it turned out, the actual nominal growth rate in 1993 was much higher at 13%, while that for 1994 was 14%. Assumptions were also made about the likely reduction in consumption arising from pre-GST purchases, the level of tourist refunds and possible revenue leakage. All of these factors would have reduced GST revenue. As this was the first year of GST implementation, accurate forecasting was obviously not possible. In addition, the PCE figures may also have been understated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high economic growth in 1993 and 1994 also raised the value of the GST offsets and rebates package above estimates by about $500 million. Most of this increase came from higher revenue foregone from corporate and personal income tax. The revenue foregone figures for corporate and personal income taxes were computed in 1992, based on figures for Year of Assessment 1991 which were the latest figures available then. Income tax collections are highly buoyant and increase rapidly with economic activity. Of the increase of $500 million in the GST offset package, about $160 million was in the form of revenue foregone from corporate tax, while some $270 million was from revenue foregone from personal income tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, revenue foregone from the reductions in the various indirect taxes accounted for about $20 million of the increase in the total offset package, while the property tax rebate accounted for another $6 million. Additional subsidies for health, education and public assistance to offset the impact of GST accounted for $4 million in the value of the offset package.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that actual GST collections have surpassed what was originally projected has led some Members to call for additional rebates to be given to individuals. Concerns have also been expressed over the impact of GST on the lower income groups. When the GST offset package was announced in the 1993 Budget, we had already analyzed the net
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> change of expenditures for typical lower-income households before and after the introduction of GST, including the forecast impact of GST on the CPI. As actual CPI was substantially below forecast, most households should end up being better off after the implementation of GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that although GST collections have exceeded original estimates, it does not mean that all individuals are paying more GST as a result. The GST burden borne by individuals varies directly with their spending. For individuals with lower purchasing power, the offsets received by them as a group should be sufficient to cover the GST they incur on their basic expenditures. Those with higher purchasing power will tend to spend more. The higher than expected GST collection is therefore likely to have come from this latter group of individuals who, in turn, would have benefited from higher income tax offsets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member has expressed concern on the impact of GST on pensioners whose pensions were not adjusted and who do not live in HDB flats. This group of persons would thus not enjoy the rebates on HDB rental and service and conservancy (S&amp;C) charges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In formulating the package of GST rebates in 1993, the Government had recognised that there would be a group of persons, such as retirees and pensioners living in non-HDB properties, who would not be able to enjoy the full benefit of the offset package. The CCC Assistance Scheme was set up precisely to cater for this group of persons. Under the CCC Assistance Scheme, those with monthly incomes below $1,500 may apply for a grant to top-up the difference between the GST they have incurred and the GST offsets they received.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would like to reassure the House again that the Government remains committed to implementing GST in a revenue negative way in the short term, and in a revenue neutral way in the long term. For FY95, GST collection is estimated at $1.6 billion while the GST offsets package is estimated to cost Government about $1.9 billion.

  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Compliance Cost of GST</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey by the Singapore Manufacturers Association (SMA) in August last year among 130 companies showed that although 72% of them encountered some administrative and accounting problems in the initial months of the GST implementation, the problems were relatively minor. Most of the problems arose out of unfamiliarity with GST procedures. All of these initial problems have since been resolved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed concern with the administrative burden that GST has imposed on businesses. They argue that the reduction in corporate tax only applies to profits while GST is on revenue. I would like to point out that GST is a tax on consumption and is ultimately borne by the end-consumers and not by companies. Corporations which are GST-registered merely act as tax-collecting agents for the Government. It is therefore incorrect to say that their burden is in the form of the 3% GST on their revenue. Instead, the burden faced by GST-registered corporations should be measured by their compliance cost. The tax savings from the 3% reduction in corporate tax should be more than sufficient to assist businesses in setting up internal systems to comply with GST procedures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non GST-registered corporations, on the other hand, may incur some form of GST burden as they cannot claim back the input GST incurred on taxable purchases. This is true for those which choose to absorb the 3% GST instead of passing it on to their customers. Even so, the final tax burden on companies which absorb the GST may be minimized somewhat by the fact that their prices will be lower, and hence more competitive than those who pass on the GST to their customers in the form of higher prices. Whether they choose to absorb the 3% GST or not, non-GST registered corporations also get to enjoy the tax savings from the 3% corporate tax reduction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had promised last year that the tax authority will undertake a study on the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> compliance cost for businesses one year after the implementation of GST. The preliminary results of the first phase of this study, of a limited number of companies, indicate that compliance cost of GST is low.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax authority is conducting a second phase of the compliance cost study. Businesses should by now have progressed beyond the learning curve and compliance cost settled at steady state level. We will have a more accurate picture of the compliance cost imposed by GST on various sectors of the economy when the study is completed. If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken to reduce compliance cost for those sectors that require it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also raised several other questions in connection with GST. As these are matters of detail, I will find an opportunity to deal with them during the Committee of Supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Expenditure on Health Care</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ling How Doong quoted figures to show that our expenditures on health care are well below that of other countries. Unfortunately, he has compared donkeys with zebras. I believe that the figures for health expenditures which he quoted for Hong Kong, Japan, USA and Malaysia came from the World Bank's World Development Report of 1993. He said that Hong Kong, Japan, US and Malaysia spent 5.7%, 6.5%, 12.7% and 3% of GDP respectively on health care in 1990 compared to 1.2% of GDP for Singapore. If he had read the tables carefully, he would have realised that the figures he quoted referred to the total health expenditures in each country, both public and private, whereas the figure of 1.2% of GDP he quoted for Singapore refers only to government expenditure on health care in FY 95. For his information, our total national health expenditure, both public and private, currently amounts to about 3% of GDP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not base our health care expenditures on what other countries spend but on what we consider is needed to maintain a high standard of health care.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> On the whole, our health care expenditures are lower than that of many other countries and there are several reasons for this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, currently we have a young demographic structure, notwithstanding our rapidly ageing population. Singapore's proportion of those aged 60 and above is only 9% now as compared to 16% to 18% for Japan and the United States, and more than 20% for the United Kingdom and Germany. Hence, lower health problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with fee-for-service and other mechanisms to curb excessive demand, Singapore is able to maintain an efficient health care delivery system. In fact, we have been ranked No. 1 in the World Competitiveness Report 1994 in this aspect. This means that we can get more value for money out of our health care system compared to the other nations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, our GDP has been growing very rapidly. This reduces our health care expenditure as a proportion of GDP. Notwithstanding our low expenditure, the quality of our health care services has remained high. This is reflected in our low infant mortality rate and long life expectancy, which are on par with the developed nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Expenditure Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar GRC has resurfaced his proposal of an expenditure tax in place of GST and income tax. An expenditure tax is conceptually very attractive. However, in practice, it is a very difficult tax to administer. Difficulties will arise with regard to the treatment of durable consumer goods such as housing. Every individual would also need to maintain a comprehensive set of accounts of their cash balances, borrowings and sales of assets. This will create tremendous scope for under-reporting and tax evasion. As savings will not be taxed, the rates of expenditure tax will generally have to be higher to generate the same amount of revenue. Finally, as I have pointed out before, expenditure tax has not been formally adopted by any country whereas income
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tax is accepted internationally. Over the years, we have built up a wide network of tax treaties to avoid double taxation. The introduction of an expenditure tax will have implications on these treaties as many areas involving cross-border transactions may have to be re-negotiated.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Budget Surpluses</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have again questioned the wisdom of the Government in consistently maintaining budget surpluses and whether this might not be deflationary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's long term fiscal policy aim is to contain expenditure within operating revenue. The large budget surpluses realised in the past few years are the direct result of strong economic growth linked to careful control of expenditure. We spend only what is necessary and need to create long term growth, not because we have the money or because other people spend more. We cannot presume that the large domestic budget surpluses seen in the past will continue indefinitely. This will be particularly so, as our population ages and the economy matures. Our strong fiscal position gives us some leeway to consider changes to fiscal policies to enhance the economy's competitiveness as it faces new challenges in the next decade, and has to develop new strengths. The Government is committed to reducing the overall burden of taxes and levies on the economy over the long term.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the context of our recent rapid economic growth of well above our potential growth rate of 6-7% per annum, running a budget surplus is an appropriate macro-economic policy. An expansionary fiscal policy would aggravate the overheating of the economy and worsen labour cost pressures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our budget surpluses are not reflective of high taxes. The tax burden, comprising individual and corporate income taxes, property tax and consumption tax, is lower than that of most industrialised countries. It is also no higher than that of other ASEAN countries and the Asian NIEs (except Hong Kong). Recent budget surpluses were higher than expected
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> largely because of revenues from our use of fiscal measures to allocate scarce resources through the COE system and foreign worker levies. These are efficient price mechanisms, but the intention was not to boost Government revenues.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure side, Government has been consistently investing heavily in education, health care, public housing and infrastructure development. Efforts have also been made to channel some of the surpluses back to citizens via schemes such as Edusave, Medifund and SOTUS.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Elected President</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ling How Doong touched on the amendments to the Constitution made last year to say that the Elected President's powers to safeguard past reserves had been unduly compromised in the area of defence and security. He alleged that since defence allocation is not transparent, what safeguards were there to prevent future Governments from using the defence allocation to provide subsidies and handouts resulting in a draw on past reserves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I should say that although details of the annual budgetary allocation to MINDEF are not made explicit in the House, this allocation is part of the overall budget passed by this House. In passing the overall budget, I am required to furnish a statement to say whether or not the budget is likely to draw on the past reserves. There is therefore no likelihood of the budgetary allocation for defence being used to draw down on past reserves without the President knowing it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for amendments to the Constitution to provide that certain Articles in the Constitution shall not apply to any defence and security measures was clearly spelt out in the speech for the Second Reading of the Constitution (Amendment No. 2) Bill 1994 on 25th August 1994 and I will not go over the same ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Foreigners Working in Financial Sector</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cheng San GRC has also asked if the same stringent conditions imposed on locals wishing to work in the financial sector are also applied to foreigners. I would like to assure the Member that this is so for foreigners working in the banking and securities industries. In the example on remisiers he has quoted, I would like to inform him that foreigners have to pass the same examinations that Singaporeans are required to pass, in order to apply to the SES to be remisiers. Currently, individuals, whether local or foreign, working in financial futures companies do not need to be licensed by the MAS. However, when the Futures Trading (Amendment) Act which was passed by Parliament on 1st March 1995 comes into effect, both local and foreign individuals working in the financial futures industry would have to be licensed by MAS and be subject to the same licensing criteria.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Corporate Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, the business community was disappointed with this Budget as it did not contain a corporate tax cut. I would like to reiterate that the corporate tax rate of 25% is our medium term target. Our existing tax rate of 27% is already very competitive. With our economy entering into its third year of very buoyant growth, it is unnecessary, and indeed unwise, for us to further stimulate the economy through another cut in the corporate tax rate. Otherwise, we run the risk of overheating the economy, fuelling inflation and undermining our competitiveness. As a measure of our competitiveness, Members should not forget that we attracted a record of $5.8 billion of foreign investment commitments in 1994.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Business Costs</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed disappointment that nothing was done in this Budget to reduce business costs. They have called for the Government to provide some means to help restore our competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Government is fully aware of the need to keep our business costs competitive, we must at the same time recognise that our operating costs reflect our basic resource constraints. Singapore will not be able to match the lower costs of labour, land and natural resources in the emerging economies. We should instead aim to be competitive in high value added and high technology economic activities, while keeping costs as low as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, we must focus on strengthening our capability to enhance our competitiveness. We can achieve this through developing our human resources, our core capabilities in key industries and our local enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, as a measure to reduce business costs and enhance our long term competitiveness, I had reduced the property tax rate for commercial, industrial and let out residential properties by 1% last year, and by a further 2% this year. I have also committed to reducing the property tax rate to 12% in subsequent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Strong Singapore Dollar</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have questioned the objectives of maintaining a strong Singapore dollar and expressed concern about its impact on our overall competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to Members that it is not the MAS but the international market which determines the value of the Singapore dollar. The value of a currency is determined by the international market's evaluation of a country's fundamentals. The Singapore dollar is strong because our fundamentals are strong. We have a strong stable Government, large reserves, no foreign debt, current account and budget surpluses, low inflation and large inflows of direct foreign investment. All these are factors which support the appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the currencies of other countries which are deficient in one or more of these fundamentals. MAS role is to manage the movement of the Singapore dollar against a basket of currencies of its main trading partners to avoid large specula-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tive movements, either upwards or downwards as these can be damaging to the real economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore dollar has appreciated by about 3% against the US dollar since the beginning of this year. This has, however, reflected the US dollar's weakness in global currency markets. Against the Japanese Yen and major European currencies, the Singapore dollar has in fact weakened by as much as 4-8%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the Monetary Authority of Singapore exchange rate policy is to promote long term export competitiveness and to sustain economic growth by keeping inflation low. A relatively strong dollar has allowed us to neutralise imported inflation. This is an important consideration, since imported consumer goods, capital and intermediate inputs account for some 70% of our expenditure and exports. Given our tight labour market conditions, a strong Singapore dollar has also helped to alleviate overheating in the economy and the labour market. By curtailing labour demand and achieving lower CPI inflation, wage growth has also been lower than what it would otherwise have been without an appreciation of the currency. Productivity growth has also been stronger, as the strong Singapore dollar has propelled businesses to upgrade and automate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that, apart from China, Singapore's GDP growth - averaging about 10% per annum over the last two years - has been the strongest in Asia. On the other hand, our inflation has been one of the lowest. Indeed, in a situation of full employment, holding down the Singapore dollar artificially, even if we could do this, would only buy temporary improvement in competitiveness. This will be quickly undermined by its inflationary consequences.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS recognises that exchange rate appreciation poses short term adjustment problems for exporters. It also recognises the imbalances in demand conditions across different industries. The MAS has thus sought to ensure gradual appreciation of the Singapore dollar against a basket of currencies of our main trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Small and Medium-sized Enterprises</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members are concerned that little has been done to help the local Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Others have called for greater coordination amongst the various Government agencies in this respect. In fact, many schemes have already been put in place to assist them over the years. Moreover, an extensive multi-agency network has been established to provide assistance in a coordinated manner. Currently, this network involves six statutory boards, nine industry associations and four institutions of higher learning, helping SMEs to develop their operations. I will highlight a few major ones.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Local Enterprise Finance Scheme provides low cost loans to help local companies invest in modern and sophisticated machinery to upgrade their operations and purchase larger factories to expand their capacity. Since its inception, a total of over $3.4 billion worth of loans has been extended under this scheme to help fund about 14,700 projects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Local Enterprise Technical Assistance Scheme provides grants to help SMEs modernise, upgrade and improve their management and business operations through seeking external expertise and training. In 1994, a total of $8.6 million was given to 656 approved cases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Business Development Scheme provides grants to help SMEs develop business opportunities in international markets through organised overseas missions. A total of $600,000 was given to 190 approved cases in 1994.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local small and medium-sized enterprises are integral to the economic development of Singapore. They are encouraged to upgrade their operations and technology. In this regard, Government will continue its efforts to facilitate their growth and development. There is, however, no need to set up a new agency to focus on the needs of the SMEs. This is because the multi-agency network in operation now has already made available an immense and diverse range of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> expertise needed by SMEs to improve themselves. This expertise comes from the various specialist agencies such as the National Computer Board providing IT expertise, NPB - productivity expertise, SISIR - technical expertise, etc. Setting up a separate body would in effect be recreating the various expertise. This is essentially duplicating existing agencies' SME developmental efforts. Moreover, the development of different expertise is difficult to achieve by any one organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Two-tier Corporate Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the SMEs, some have proposed that the Government implement a two-tier corporate tax system, with a lower tax rate for smaller companies. Such a tax system will simply encourage tax avoidance through business splitting. The better approach, which we are adopting, would be to lower corporate tax across-the-board over time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Measures to Assist the Retail Sector</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls for the Government to come up with some measures to help the ailing retail sector. As the Minister for Trade and Industry will be addressing this issue specifically during the Committee of Supply proceedings, I will not deal with it now.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Venture Capital Funds</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have called for the Government to do more to help local entrepreneurs venture overseas. I would like to assure Members that there are already a number of measures in place to help local entrepreneurs do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pool of venture capital funds allocated to assist local entrepreneurs venture overseas has increased by 33% from $2.6 billion in 1993 to an estimated $3.5 billion in 1994. To-date, more than 150 local companies have received venture capital funding. Of these, 25 have gone public with a market capitalization of $3.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a $120 million venture capital fund was set up in 1994 for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> investment in small and medium-sized businesses in Singapore with the potential to expand into the region. The fund will be managed by the Regional Investment Company which will in turn be jointly managed by the Economic Development Board Investments Pte Ltd and Transpac Capital.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the venture capital fund, the Government also provides other forms of assistance to help local SMEs venture overseas. The Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (Overseas) helps local enterprises to set up overseas operations through low-cost loans. Local entrepreneurs can also apply for grants provided under the Market and Investment Development Assistance Scheme to help cover expenses incurred for activities such as feasibility studies, overseas missions and marketing and development trips. In addition, double tax deductions are allowed against income of approved expenditure incurred in initiating and developing investment outside Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Property Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some businessmen have complained that the property tax cut will not help to reduce business cost. They argue that its benefit is negated by increased annual values of their properties. The annual value of a property is determined by market forces. Just as annual values are adjusted upwards when the property market is buoyant, it is also readjusted downwards when rentals fall. Businessmen should remember that without a tax cut, their property tax burden would have been even higher when annual values rise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some small businessmen who rent their premises have complained that the property tax cut will only benefit landlords, as they do not pass on the tax cut to their tenants in the form of lower rentals. I am pleased to say that the Jurong Town Corporation had passed on their tax savings to their tenants last year and are likely to do so again this year. HDB is currently looking into doing the same. I would like to urge private landlords to follow their example and do likewise. The certainty that the property tax rate will be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cut to 12% over the next couple of years should also give tenants greater scope to negotiate for better rental rates with their landlords, and thus benefit from the tax cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Rising Aspirations of Singaporeans</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have asked what the Government plans to do to meet the rising aspirations of younger Singaporeans. It is good for the nation as a whole for each generation to have higher aspirations than the last. That is the way to progress, as aspirations are what drive all of us to apply our minds to achieve even more.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a distinction needs to be drawn between realistic and unrealistic aspirations. While realistic aspirations drive progress, unrealistic ones simply breed resentment and disenchantment. Singaporeans should realise that dreams will forever remain as castles in the sky if they are not tempered with a dose of reality.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has tried and will continue to try to meet the aspirations of all Singaporeans. We will continue to invest heavily in education to enable every child to flourish, in our road system to enable more Singaporeans to own cars, in our public transport system to make it more comfortable and convenient for commuters. More land will also be released to meet the housing needs of the population.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singaporeans must realise that there is only so much that the Government can do. We cannot promise every Singaporean a landed property nor enable everyone to own a car, as the Prime Minister has said. As I have also said in my Budget Statement, the quality of life in Singapore has to be taken as a package.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Tax Changes to Encourage Singaporeans to Work Abroad</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have asked the Government to do more to help Singaporeans who are posted overseas to work. When Singaporeans work abroad, they are liable
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for personal income taxes in two countries; firstly in Singapore, and secondly, in the country they are working in. This gives rise to two major concerns. One is the possibility of double taxation of the same income. The other is the likelihood that Singaporeans will have to pay higher personal income taxes in the country in which they are working.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the concern of double taxation, the Government has concluded 30 Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) with other countries. For countries with which Singapore has yet to conclude DTAs, the Government has been giving unilateral tax credits for foreign tax paid on employment income earned by Singaporeans in these countries since the Year of Assessment 1993.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern of Singaporeans who have worked abroad is that they have to pay higher personal income taxes in the countries in which they are working. This arises because most other countries impose higher personal income tax burdens than Singapore. However, we cannot recognise the additional income taxes paid to other governments for Singapore's personal income tax purposes. Doing so would be tantamount to the Singapore treasury paying the additional income taxes, on behalf of Singaporeans working abroad, to foreign treasuries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, in my Budget last year, I had announced two tax changes to help Singaporeans working abroad. The first is the reduction of tax rates used to compute non-resident tax reliefs in Singapore. The second is the tax exemption of voluntary CPF contributions by overseas posted employees which are obligatory by contract of employment. These tax changes will result in a lower tax burden on the Singapore source income of Singaporeans working abroad. They have taken effect from the Year of Assessment 1995. We will continue to look into what other personal tax changes can be made to encourage Singaporean employees to venture abroad.
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Personal Income Tax</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wong Kwei Cheong has asked that the 10% personal income tax rebate be made a permanent feature of our tax system. He has also suggested that the personal income tax marginal rate be reduced to the corporate tax rate level.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Year of Assessment 1995, a 10% rebate has been given. Its effect is equivalent to a 3% proportional cut in income tax rates. This method of lowering the personal income tax burden of individuals provides the Government with the flexibility to vary the reduction in income taxes according to Singapore's economic performance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of this method must be viewed in the context of Singapore already having one of the most competitive personal income tax systems in the world. The top marginal personal income tax rates in Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and Japan are 32%, 40%, 45%, 47% and 50% respectively. Ours is only 30%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, some people may assert that Hong Kong has a more favourable personal income tax system than Singapore. Hong Kong's marginal tax rates range from 2% to 20%, with a cap of 15% on the effective tax rate. Hong Kong's personal reliefs also appear to be more generous.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the reality is that our personal income tax burden is lower than Hong Kong's, except for some very high income people. By way of illustration, a working couple with two children will pay less income tax in Singapore than in Hong Kong for assessable incomes not exceeding $459,700. Also, our average tax burden is lower than Hong Kong's. In the Year of Assessment 1993, Singapore's average tax rate for resident individuals, which is a measure of the total tax assessed over the total assessable income, was just 7%. The corresponding figure for Hong Kong was 9%.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>S&amp;C and Rental Rebates</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cheng San GRC has commented that the relief given to the 1- to 5-room HDB flat residents in terms of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> service and conservancy (S&amp;C) charges and rental rebates is too low compared to the revenue loss for the 10% rebate given to individuals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10% tax rebate is given to individuals who pay income tax and contribute directly towards the cost of public services. On the other hand, the HDB S&amp;C and rental rebates benefit mainly individuals who do not pay income tax. Nonetheless, as these people have also contributed to the growth of the economy, the Government has decided to share the nation's wealth with them by giving them these rebates. However, there is a need for the Government to ensure that relief given in this form is not too excessive and does not result in a welfare mentality. Otherwise, Singaporeans will come to expect increases in such handouts year after year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Rising Cost of Living for Retirees</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chin Harn Tong has expressed concern for retirees. He feels that retirees are experiencing difficulties in coping with the rising cost of living. Therefore, more should be done to assist them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 250,000 individuals aged 60 and above in Singapore. Of these, only about 5% are paying income tax. The other 95% do not pay income tax, and therefore cannot be helped through the personal income tax route. Nonetheless, the Government recognises the contributions of these older Singaporeans to Singapore's development and is looking into ways to assist them through non-tax routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Tax Incentives for Care and Re-employment of Older Workers</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar GRC may wish to know that older workers are already eligible for higher earned income relief. The relief which is given to encourage skilled and experienced people to work beyond their normal retirement age is $3,000 for those over 55 years and $4,000 for those over 60 years. The lower CPF contribution rate for older workers has also made it easier for employers to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> employ such workers. There is thus no need for new tax incentives on this issue at this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Skills Development Fund</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow Chin Hock has suggested that part of the collection of the foreign workers levy be channelled to enlarge the resources of the Skills Development Fund so as to provide more incentives and programmes, particularly for on-the-job training.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly salary ceiling for Skills Development Levy will be raised from $750 to $1,000 with effect from 1st April 1995. This is estimated to increase the funds available for skills development by $14 million in FY95 and will enable more skills upgrading programmes and on-the-job training to be undertaken. There is thus no need for Government to contribute to the SDF at this point of time. The Government can consider doing so should there be a shortfall in the SDF. However, even in that event, the contribution need not be tied to the foreign workers levy collection.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>CPF SOTUS</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of SOTUS is to help citizens to enhance their assets through share ownership and other investments. The top-up should be in cash to allow citizens to choose whether to use it to purchase shares, invest in property, or simply retain as cash in their CPF accounts. In other words, the investment decision should be left to individual citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have questioned the need for co-payment under CPF SOTUS and pointed out the burden this imposes on the lower income groups. We should remember that CPF SOTUS is not intended as a handout or welfare benefit. Hence, the principle of co-payment. Seen in this light, it is appropriate that the individual citizen be prepared to come up with his share of the cost for enhancing his own assets. In the case of SOTUS II, he has to deposit a sum of $750 in his CPF account over an 18-month period before he is eligible for the $300 top-up. The deposit requirement, which works out to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> $42 per month, has been set sufficiently low to enable most eligible citizens to qualify for the top-up. For the first SOTUS exercise which had a similar deposit arrangement, 1.17 million of eligible citizens were able to enjoy the full top-up of $200. Another 90,000 citizens who were unable to deposit the full amount also received a pro-rated top-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>$200 CPF Top-up</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the $200 CPF top-up which I announced in this year's Budget is different. It is meant to reward all our citizens who have contributed to the good economy last year. One could regard it as a kind of dividend payment to all citizen shareholders. As such, every Singaporean, rich or poor, whether working or not, should be eligible for the top-up as long as he is aged 21 and above and has a CPF account.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, let me emphasise that the $200 CPF top-up is not intended to be a handout or a welfare scheme. There are other schemes in place to help the lower income groups. One of them is Medifund which, through contributions from the annual budget surpluses, provides a safety net for those in the lower income group who are unable to afford basic healthcare. Other schemes include the Public Assistance Scheme, Small Families Improvement Scheme and the CCC Assistance Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Kah GRC has suggested that the Government should top up the accounts of citizens who cannot attain the CPF Minimum Sum even after working until age 60. The Government recognises that there may be a case to help the older generation of Singaporeans who have missed out on the CPF scheme for the most part of their working life. However, this should be looked into separately from the top-up scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ayer Rajah has suggested that the $300 and $200 CPF top-up be credited into the Medisave Account of those who are not paying CPF and those who are above 65 years of age.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The top-ups will be credited to the CPF Ordinary Account to give citizens maximum flexibility on the use of the grant. Citizens can choose subsequently to credit all or part of the top-ups to their Medisave Accounts, if they choose to do so, and to open Medisave Accounts for this purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Use of CPF Funds</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua has asked the Government to consider allowing Singaporeans to invest their CPF in certain designated overseas projects. This is not advisable. The risks involved in investments in foreign projects are high. It is also not practical to designate specific projects for investment of CPF funds. CPF members who invest in this way will receive little or no protection for their savings.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Edusave</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member has asked for more assistance schemes to be set up to help the lower income groups. He has suggested that more could be given in Edusave to children from lower income families. Edusave is a scheme designed to maximise the potential of every school-going child. It represents Government's commitment in investing in the most important resource we have, which is its people. I would not like Edusave to become a social assistance scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier, we have several assistance schemes for lower income families and their children. These include the Public Assistance Scheme, Small Families Improvement Scheme and the CCC Assistance Scheme. Families with school-going children who require further financial assistance should apply for these schemes which have been specifically set up to assist them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>White Collar Crime</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Walter Woon has expressed concern that the existing penalties are insufficient to deter white collar criminals. I agree with him and I would like to inform him that I have already asked my officials to work with the Attorney-General to review the adequacy of penalties under
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the various Acts under my purview. Nevertheless, I will convey Prof. Woon's concerns to the Attorney-General. Prof. Woon may also be interested to know that the Criminal Procedure Code and the Penal Codes are already currently under review. I am also aware of Prof. Woon's pet monster, the Companies Act, and I will refer his suggestions to my officials for consideration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now sum up the debate. We have had two years of exceptional growth. The outlook for 1995, while slightly less sanguine, is nevertheless still very rosy. The projected economic growth of 7.5% to 8.5% still surpasses our medium growth range of 6% to 7%. In short, the future looks bright, barring unforeseen circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must note that at the end of the day Singapore is a very open economy; highly susceptible to the vagaries in the rest of the world. It is tautological to say that no one can predict the unforeseen. The Kobe disaster, the devaluation of the Mexican peso and the record slide in the US dollar which now threatens the recovery of the Japanese economy all took the world by surprise. What these events highlight is that we should never take the good times we have enjoyed for granted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to stay vigilant, capitalise on our strengths and draw upon our resilience to seize the excellent opportunities that abound in the booming Asian economies around us. Singaporeans should ride on the wave of progress that is sweeping through this region, exploit its momentum and raise our nation to even greater heights. I have every confidence in the vitality and versatility of Singaporeans to rise to this challenge. [Applause].

  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is normally not the tradition to speak after the Minister has replied. But if you so wish to, I will allow you this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> There are two clarifications, Sir. The first clarification is that when the Ministry of Finance uses the private consumption expenditure to estimate the revenue for GST, was it aware that the assumptions based on the PCE may be on the low side and thereby would result in a lower estimate for GST collection? The second clarification is on the question of offset package. Did the Government foresee that if economic growth continues, the higher income groups would benefit more from the offset package of tax reduction, or was this the original intention of Government?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The answer to both questions is no. To answer his second question, it is not designed specifically to help the higher income groups. The tax rebates were given in several forms. One, for those who pay tax, you have to give them a tax rebate. For those who do not pay tax, we have special rental and S&amp;C charges. And these were all calculated to ensure that the average family, I stress the average family, will not be worse off. When we first estimated the GST collection based on the PCE, we were not certain whether they were accurate because these figures may not capture some expenditures, particularly in the services, and we will not know until we have had a full year of GST tax data.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
