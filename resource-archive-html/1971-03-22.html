<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>MALAYSIA-SINGAPORE AIRLINES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Restructure of)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  whether it was not possible  to  reconcile

the  conflicting  objectives of the  Singapore  and

Malaysian  Governments  on  the  running  of   MSA,

chiefly  in relation to the expansion of  Malaysian

domestic  air  services,  in  order  to   avoid   a

dissolution of their partnership. Next, what is the

current state of the negotiations and what are  the

objectives  of  the  proposed  Singapore   national

airline.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it has become common knowledge  that

the  policies and objectives of the Governments  of

Singapore  and  Malaysia towards Malaysia-Singapore

Airlines  have  become divergent. Differences  have

arisen from time to time in recent years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 2nd September, 1970, the Malaysian

Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the

Singapore   High   Commission   in   Kuala   Lumpur

requesting the Singapore Government to designate  a

committee  of  officials  to  discuss  with   their

committee the creation of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



Malaysian  Domestic Airline. On the 13th  November,

the Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note in

reply to the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore

nominating this committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The differences of objectives between the two

Governments have become irreconcilable.  A  parting

of  the  ways was unavoidable. Continuation of  the

partnership   would  only  have  led  to   constant

friction and unnecessary conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government's interest is centred

upon a fast-expanding commercially viable operation

with flights on international routes to Europe  and

the  United  States. The Malaysian  Government  has

different priorities. A major point of disagreement

was   the  proposal  to  expand  MSA  domestic  air

services   regardless  of  the  loss  forecast   by

management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the decision has been taken to dissolve

the co-ownership and joint control of MSA, it is in

the  best  interests of both Governments  that  the

proposed  restructuring of the  company  should  be

proceeded with as expeditiously as possible.  There

are  good  reasons for proceeding  with  deliberate

speed.  First,  in  the  airline  business  nothing

stands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



still. The transitional period before restructuring

is  completed  is not conducive to  the  taking  of

important  decisions on the expansion  of  services

and  the  acquisition  of new  aircraft.  Secondly,

staff   of   the   company,  contractors,   agents,

suppliers   and   clients   would   find   a   long

transitional  period unsettling not  knowing  where

exactly  they stand. Thirdly, Government  officials

as  well  as  the  staff of MSA who are  directing,

planning and undertaking the arrangements  for  the

restructuring  of  the company  cannot  have  their

attention distracted from their normal duties for a

prolonged  period  of uncertainty and  restlessness

pending  the  final  hiving off into  two  separate

airlines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations between officials of the two

Governments   have  resulted  in   a   measure   of

agreement. There are a few points on which  further

talks  are to take place. It has been agreed  that,

first,  the restructuring will be completed by  the

end  of 1972 or any earlier date that may be agreed

upon  by  the two Governments; secondly,  that  the

Fokker aircraft will be transferred to the proposed

Malaysian  national  airline  and  the  Boeing  707

aircraft   to   the  Singapore  national   airline;

thirdly, that projects approved will be implemented

and  that projects required for the orderly  growth

and expansion of the company will not be held up on

account  of  the  proposed  restructuring  of   the

airline.   The  Governments  have  also  appointed,

through  MSA,  a  reputable firm of accountants  to

value the assets, both tangible and intangible,  of

the company; the report of the accountants is to be

submitted by 30th June this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has proposed that, to

facilitate  the  establishment  of  the   Malaysian

national  airline, the internal operations  of  MSA

should  over  a  period of time be  separated,  and

placed  under the control of a "Malaysian Division"

of the company. In the near future, such a Division

would  become the nucleus of the Malaysian national

airline and would be handed over as such. It is the

intention  of  the Singapore Government  that  this

transfer should take place as soon as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



It  is  the  Singapore Government's intention  that

there   will   be  completely  separate   financial

accountability  in  respect  of  domestic  services

under  the  Malaysian Government, and international

services  under the Singapore Government,  by  1st.

January,  1972, or that the national  airlines  of

the  two countries should be on their feet  by  the

1st January, 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dealt with the distribution of the Fokker

and  the  Boeing  707 aircraft, but  not  with  the

Boeing  737  aircraft.  These  aircraft  are  used

extensively  on  services  between  Singapore   and

Malaysia   as  well  as  on  international   routes

stretching  to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Djakarta,  Bali

and  Sumatra. Clearly, a sharing of these  aircraft

will  have  to  be worked out on the basis  of  the

requirements  and  interests of  each  Government.

This basis will be decided at separate negotiations

on an air services agreement which are scheduled to

be completely by the end of this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate for me to outline the policy of

the  proposed Singapore national airline.  We  have

conveyed to the Malaysian Government the fact  that

the Singapore Government will inherit the corporate

entity  of  MSA  which  is; a Singapore  registered

company, as was its precursor, Malayan Airways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should not be any hiatus in the rapid

growth  of  the  airline. Since the bulk  of  MSA's

international  services are operated  on  Singapore

traffic rights and as a considerable proportion  of

traffic   originating  in  the   Singapore-Malaysia

region  is  derived  from Singapore,  the  proposed

restructuring  of the company will not  impair  its

growth  prospects. MSA is now preparing a five-year

development  plan which, subject  to  scrutiny  and

approval  by  the Government, will  be  implemented

vigorously. I understand that consideration of  the

purchase  of  wide-bodied aircraft is  one  of  the

highlights of the plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment opportunities in a wholly- owned

Singapore  company should grow at  a  rapid  rate.

Management  will  be given a free  and  unfettered

hand  to  carry  out its tasks under the  effective

control and supervision of the Board of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



Directors.  With good management and  run  on  the

basis of efficiency and profitability, our national

airline  has  considerable growth expectations.  It

should  be  at least as profitable as and  probably

larger  than  Hong  Kong's airline.  Unlike  Cathay

Pacific  which  is not allowed to cut  into  BOAC's

profitable  international routes, we  shall  circle

the globe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee

of Supply [3rd Allotted Day].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question (19th March,

1971),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2109." -  [Mr Ho Kah Leong].

<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0801 (contd.) -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head 0801 - amendment (18) . The

Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2109."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education had the Floor when the Committee rose last Friday night,Mr Lim.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  think I have clarified  all  the

doubts  that  were in the minds of Members  at  the

last  sitting  with regard to this subhead.  Unless

they want further clarification, I propose that  we

go on to the next amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2118*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr N. Govindasamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that there is an increase of $1.1

million  for the 1971-72 estimate over the  1970-71

estimate  in  regard  to the  item  of  "Substitute

Relief  Teachers". I presume that  this  additional

sum  of  money is for the Ministry of Education  to

employ more relief teachers in the coming year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the ratio between the number of

relief  teachers and the total number of  permanent

teachers  reaches  an  unhealthy  proportion.   Any

further  increase of the present number  of  relief

teachers   is   going  to  further  aggravate   the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he

should not consider the immediate reintroduction of

part-time   teacher  training  at   the   Teachers'

Training   College  at  this  stage.  I  am   quite

confident  that  the response to part-time  teacher

training  will be good. Part-time teacher  training

will alleviate the present shortage of teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of part-time teacher training over

full-time  training for student  teachers  is  that

while undergoing training they will be able to earn

a salary which will help them economically, whereas

in  the  case of full-time students, not  only  are

they  not paid a salary but they also have  to  pay

tuition fees instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must appreciate the position of many school

leavers  who do not come from well-to-do homes  and

who   would  like  to  earn  a  living  after   the

completion  of  their studies.  For  such  persons,

while  they  may  not  take  on  full-time  teacher

training  because  they  will  become  economically

inactive when undergoing training, they may find it

attractive enough to do part-time training and,  at

the same time, earn a salary as trainee teachers in

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a partial solution to the problem of teacher

shortage is the reintroduction of part-time teacher

training.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  for the last three years I have been  harping

on the matter of substitute relief teachers without

appearing to make much headway with the Ministry of

Education. If I have harped on the subject over and

over  again, it is because, having been  long  with

education  and  having children in school  who  are

sometimes   taught   by  these  substitute   relief

teachers, I sincerely believe that it is about time

that  the  Ministry of Education gradually  stopped

its   existing   practice  of   using   unqualified

youngsters as relief teachers and made attempts  to

replace them with a corps of qualified teachers. It

appears  that  the  number  of  unqualified  relief

teachers increases year after year with no sign  of

any   attempts  being  made  by  the  Ministry   of

Education  to  rectify  this,  to  say  the  least,

unhappy   education  system.  The   provision   for

substitute  relief teachers for  1969-70  was  $1.2

million  for  15 months. The provision for  1970-71

was  $1.3  million. This year, as  the  Member  for

Moulmein  has  pointed out, the provision  is  $2.4

million.  Can  the  Minister tell  the  House  what

attempts  the  Ministry has made  to  rectify  this

unhappy practice?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, amongst the ranks of the relief teachers

there  are  many  who would want to  make  teaching

their   career,   but  they  are  not   given   the

opportunity  or  the training to  become  qualified

teachers.  Why  cannot  the best  of  these  relief

teachers who wish to make teaching their career  be

given  part-time  teacher  training,  as  has  been

advocated by the Member for Moulmein, so that  they

will  take  up teaching as a career and  not  as  a

stepping  stone  to other jobs? What  we  must  not

forget   is  that  the  backbone  of  our  teaching

profession  today comprises teachers who  have  had

part-time  teacher  training. There  are  many  who

become daily-rated teachers today while waiting for

some  other employment. In any case, this  business

of  unqualified  relief teachers  teaching  in  our

schools is a bad reflection on our education policy

and at the same time makes a mockery of teaching as

a profession.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to hear the Minister advance the practice of

leave-taking  among teachers as a  reason  for  the

need  of  relief  teachers, it  would  appear  that

teachers  have  never taken leave previously.  This

is,  of  course, not true. Teachers  have  gone  on

leave before. It is not a recent phenomenon, as was

pointed  out  earlier. But what really happened  in

those  good  old days, not more than four  or  five

years  ago,  was that there were one or  two  extra

qualified  teachers in every school  to  take  over

classes  from  the  regular teachers  who  went  on

leave.  But now with the quota of teachers  rigidly

imposed  on  every school, there is the problem  of

relief  teachers who are unqualified to  take  over

classes  from the qualified teachers. As a  result,

we  have been relying on unqualified persons to act

as  relief teachers. Sir, if there is a shortage of

qualified teachers - and I believe there is - as  a

result  of some planning defect in the Ministry  of

Education,  some  serious  attempts  must  be  made

quickly  and  effectively to obviate  the  need  of

using  unqualified  people as  relief  teachers  in

schools.  One  way  is to increase  the  output  of

trained  teachers.  The reason  for  regular  class

teachers  to  be trained is equally  applicable  to

temporary relief teachers. The minds of the  future

citizens of Singapore are too precious an asset  to

be imperilled by improper teaching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has mentioned that the response

to  advertisements  in respect  of  recruitment  of

teachers was poor. Did the Ministry attempt to find

out  the  reason for the lack of response from  our

school-leavers waiting for jobs? I can  advance  my

own  reason,  but I will be accused of  harping  on

salaries  and working conditions all the time.  Let

the Ministry of Education advance their reasons for

the lack of response from qualified persons for not

wanting  to  become teachers. Perhaps  one  of  the

reasons  advanced  by the Member for  Moulmein  may

stand  up. Is it because teachers in training  have

to  pay  for their training and, as a result,  they

are not responding?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will notice that this year the vote

asked for in the General Education Department alone

is  almost twice as much as that for last year.  Of

course, the allocation will have to be more  if  we

include  the  vocational institutes  and  technical

schools in this particular vote. If the Ministry of

Education  does  not make any serious  attempts  to

remedy the situation, I am sure that next year this

vote  of  $2,400,000 that we are asked  to  approve

this  year will have to be doubled. When this sorry

state  of  affairs is going to end will  be  a  big

question  mark.  Sir, not very  long  ago  we  were

talking in terms of coming to the end of the  phase

of  quantitative  education  and  launching  on  to

qualitative education. May I humbly suggest that we

have not even arrived at this phase at all. A total

of 99 per cent of our schools are still functioning

as  two-session schools. The number of  classes  in

schools has not been reduced; the number of  pupils

per class has not been reduced; and the shortage of

teachers has increased year after year. When can we

have  qualitative education at this rate? Sir,  all

persons  who  are interested in education  and  who

have  children in school would want their  children

and future citizens to be taught by persons who are

teachers  by  training and by choice,  and  not  by

persons who act as relief teachers for $7 or  $8  a

day,  or  whatever the daily wage that the Ministry

of  Education pays them. So long as this phenomenon

of   substitute  relief  teachers  exists  in   our

schools,  we will have to remind the Minister  that

it  has got to stop. Can the Minister for Education

inform the House of any plans that the Ministry may

have  to overcome this educational problem that  we

face?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, fortunately

enough I have looked into the establishment  of  my

Ministry,  otherwise  after listening  to  the  two

Members  I would have thought that my Ministry  had

been   staffed   completely  by  relief   teachers!

Actually,  only  five per cent of them  are  relief

teachers, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



the  other  95 per cent consist of a hard  core  of

fully competent teachers who are there by their own

choice.  I would like very much indeed to  see  all

one hundred per cent of the establishment filled by

people  who become teachers "by their own  choice",

to quote the words of the Member for Telok Blangah.

It is because we do not have enough people who want

to  join  the teaching service by their own  choice

that we are at present in this plight, and have  to

resort  to engaging five per cent of the  staff  as

relief  teachers. The key words here are "by  their

own choice".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the point raised by the Member for

Moulmein.  I  am  very  glad indeed  that,  whether

consciously or unconsciously, he has advocated  the

point  which I have made about not proceeding  with

the setting up of the Institute of Education. It is

precisely because of the fear that I had of  having

insufficient  people  enrolling  to  pay   for   an

education  in order to be able to teach four  years

later  that I have had second thoughts, and he  has

stated  it  correctly in this House that there  are

lots of people who would prefer to learn while they

work.  The  question of whether we should institute

full-time  training  for these relief  teachers  is

under  consideration by my Ministry,  because  what

started on an ad hoc basis looks as if it is  going

to  become  a permanent feature in the Ministry  of

Education, largely because - and I repeat  -  there

are  insufficient people who would  opt  to  teach.

Therefore,   we   are  seriously  considering   the

proposition whether we should reintroduce part-time

training.  But here again, may I point out  to  the

House  the  problem of sufficient  staff  to  teach

these relief teachers who will be going in for part-time  training.  This is a question  of  staff  and

facilities.  In  the same ways we would  very  much

prefer, if we could, to have one-session schools in

Singapore  right  through. We  are  prevented  from

doing  that  largely  because of  the  insufficient

facilities  for one-session schools. It means  that

we  have  almost  physically to double  the  school

buildings that we have now. For the information



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



of   Members,  when  I  attended  the  Commonwealth

Education   Ministers'   Conference   recently   in

Australia,  I  was surprised to find that  a  large

number  of  countries were very much interested  in

our  two-session schools because, to  their  minds,

this feature represents the full utilisation of the

resources at one's disposal. So while we  here  may

think that it is an unsatisfactory way to cram  all

our students in the schools, others think it is one

way of fully utilising one's resources. It could be

that  the  double-session school is a way  out  for

most  countries.  Maybe later on we  will  reach  a

state  of  affluence  and, with reclamation  making

good  progress  and  providing us  with  sufficient

land,  we  may  be  able  to  build  single-session

schools for all children going to school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Telok Blangah and Moulmein are

wondering why there is an increase in the vote  for

relief  teachers. As I have said, what has  started

on  an ad hoc basis is probably becoming permanent,

but  I  can tell them that my Ministry now is doing

its  very best to relieve the situation. All I  can

promise  is that things may get a little bit  worse

before  they  get better, largely  because  of  the

difficulties involved. It takes about  three  years

at  least  to  train a teacher. If we start  making

teaching  as a career more attractive or  enlarging

the  intake  of trainees in the Teacher's  Training

College,  you will not see the result  until  three

years after.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the measures taken by the Ministry to

solve  the  problem of shortage of  staff,  I  have

figures here to show that the intake of the  T.T.C.

has  been greatly increased. We expect 660 trainees

to  qualify this year and 950 next year.  Thus  the

intake  is increasing. Therefore, you can see  that

relief  is  on the way, and I hope the  Member  for

Telok Blangah need not stand up again and say  that

he  has  been  at this problem for  the  last  five

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase in the workload, I

believe  this is due to the fact that we  are  also

engaging graduates as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



relief  teachers. Unfortunately, there is a certain

quota  to be observed with regard to the intake  of

graduates and T.T.C.-trained teachers. This may  be

due  to  financial considerations but it is largely

because  the  professionals have  advised  that  we

should  maintain  a  certain proportion.  In  their

view,  it  would not be realistic at this stage  of

our development to have the full complement staffed

with graduate teachers. If Members want to know all

the  facts, they can refer to the professionals  in

the Ministry of Education, who are their colleagues

or  ex-colleagues.  Anyway, I  completely  disagree

with the Member for Telok Blangah when he said that

we have not succeeded in expanding quantitatively.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, are you prepared to give

way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, what I said was that

since we have finished with the quantitative phase,

we  should  now  talk in terms of  the  qualitative

phase  of education. My question was: when  can  we

achieve  qualitative  education?  Not  quantitative

education.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Not overnight.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We are in the process of trying

to achieve that, but there are many matters to look

into  now.  I think the Member is not unaware  that

there  has  been  a  curriculum  revision  in   the

Ministry. There is a Department of Research looking

into  ways  and  means  of  improving  methods   of

teaching.  We  have launched the  Educational  T.V.

service,  and  we are using all forms  of  aids  to

reach the young minds. And improving the quality of

education is not an overnight process. It  takes  a

long  time and careful research. I would  say  that

our circumstances here are different from those  in

most  other countries, because when we set  out  to

achieve  multilingualism, or at least  bilingualism

in the schools for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



majority  of  our  students,  it  was  not  just  a

question  of learning two languages but  three.  We

must  remember that our students have also to learn

the native tongue used in their homes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, your ten minutes are up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I think I have dealt with

almost  all the points raised, but if Members  have

any  more  queries, they can raise them under  some

other amendment so that I will try to answer them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

inform    the   Minister   that   consciously    or

unconsciously I am not advocating the abolition  of

the  Institute of Education, because I do  not  see

the  point  there. The Institute of Education  does

not necessarily have to confine itself to full-time

teacher  training,  as after all  there  are  other

activities  to  think of. And even if  there  is  a

reason to hold back full-time teacher training  and

part-time  teacher training, it does not mean  that

we  must  also hold back the establishment  of  the

Institute,  because, as I have said, the  Institute

of  Education could incorporate so many other forms

of  activity.  Anyway, the Minister has  said  that

next year over 600 trainees will pass out from  the

T.T.C. and the following year another 900 trainees

will  qualify. The question I want to ask is  this:

will  all these teachers be given jobs? It must  be

remembered  that much money has been spent  on  the

training of these teachers. It has happened in  the

past  that teacher-trainees who underwent  training

and  obtained the Certificate of Education were not

guaranteed  jobs, and I have pointed  this  out  in

this   House  previously.  This  is  one   of   the

disincentives  to this full-time teacher  training,

and  therefore there is no response because,  apart

from  the  fact  that they do not earn  any  salary

while  undergoing training, there is  no  guarantee

that  they are going to get jobs at the end of  the

course. So you can see the kind of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



situation  that the teacher training scheme  is  in

when  there  is  this disincentive in  the  system.

Therefore, I just want to ask the Minister  whether

he  can  give the assurance that all these teachers

will  be  given jobs when they pass  out  from  the T.T.C.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I am not aware of any

teaching institution in the world guaranteeing jobs

for its graduates. And I am afraid I cannot start a

precedent.   If  the  Minister  for   Finance,   my

colleague here, would like to guarantee them  jobs,

then that is his business.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I think the Minister did

not  answer  my question, which is this:  will  the

Ministry   look  into  the  possibility  of   again

instituting part-time teacher training in order  to

overcome the present shortage of teachers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I think I did answer that

question,  and  I  said that the  matter  is  under

consideration. But while it is being considered,  I

would like to ask Members to appreciate the problem

of getting sufficient teaching staff to teach these

trainees. I have mentioned this in the course of my

reply earlier.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw

the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this stage of our educational

development,  when the emphasis is  on  qualitative

rather  than quantitative education, I am surprised

to  note that the ensuing year's allocation for the

item  "Educational Exhibitions, Career  Conventions

and Teachers' Seminar" has suffered a cut of $3,500

as  compared  with the allocation for the  previous

year.  The  amount allocated for the previous  year

was $10,500, but this has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



been  reduced  to  $7,000 for  1971-72.  Activities

under   this   subhead  are  to  me  of  tremendous

educational  value, and I should imagine  that  the

vote should be increased rather than decreased,  if

we  are  really serious about pursuing  qualitative

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the "Teachers' Seminar", I

would like to draw the attention of Members to  the

recent Teachers' Seminar from 27th February to  1st

March,  1971, organised by the Singapore  Teachers'

Union.  Some  250  teachers participated,  together

with representatives from the Ministry of Education

and  the  Teachers' Training College.  The  seminar

papers, as well as the discussions, were guided  by

a  sense of proportional responsibility and realism

on the part of the participants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the seminar papers, as well

as   the   findings  of  the  seminar  on   various

professional  problems of the teachers,  should  be

discussed  among  teachers  in  the  schools.   The

Singapore  Teachers' Union, therefore,  intends  to

organise group meetings of teachers on Saturdays to

enable  as  many  teachers  as  possible  from  the

various schools to benefit from the ideas contained

in  the  seminar papers as well as the conclusions

of  the  seminar. I would like to ask the Education

Minister if he thinks that it will be a good  idea

for  the  Singapore Teachers' Union, the  Education

Ministry  Research  Unit, the Inspectorate  of  the

Education  Ministry  and  the  Teachers'   Training

College jointly to organise meetings of teachers to

enable  them to discuss their professional problems

with  a  view  to  establishing a larger  sense  of

involvement  and  participation in the  educational

development  of  Singapore.  I  am  also  sure  the

Minister  will agree with me that if Inspectors  of

Schools  are  asked  to  hold  seminars  or   group

meetings of teachers to discuss the educational and

professional problems of teachers, this would be  a

much more fruitful way for them to spend their time

than   going   around  snooping  and  investigating

complaints from anonymous letters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

if I may briefly make a few points. I would like to

support what the Member for Moulmein has said,  and

perhaps  articulate specifically the point  he  has

raised  -  that  there  should  be  more  of  these

seminars. In my own experience, I find them  to  be

very useful, but perhaps more use could be found at

district level. In other words, the organisation of

these  educational seminars, which  at  present  is

confined  only  to  the central  level,  should  be

brought lower down to the district level, so that a

number  of schools could come together and join  in

these   discussions,  and  maintain  a   continuing

discussion of their role in relation to society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to make is this.

Perhaps  the  Ministry  of  Education  could   give

teachers  a  feedback as to what it thinks  of  the

proposals  that  have  been  formulated  at   these

seminars.  This will encourage teachers to  express

their views continually on the sort of action which

the Minister himself has sought to encourage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Member for Moulmein is

out   of  date.  Inspectors  do  not  snoop  around

inquiring  into  fictitious  complaints.   I   have

already  made  it clear to them that  unfortunately

their  office carries some sort of an  odium  about

it; and that their job is not so much inspection of

schools  as  advising  and  helping  teachers   and

principals  of  schools to achieve the  quality  of

education that we want and to carry out the  policy

that we have set out to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Teachers' Seminar, which was

organised   recently  by  the  Singapore  Teachers'

Union, of course. I was very much encouraged by the

response  given to it, and by the discussions  that

took  place. I very much welcome the suggestion  of

the  Member for Moulmein to get the various sectors

of  the  Ministry  of Education  to  enter  into  a

dialogue  on the role of education and on education

itself in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has made it necessary for me to stand up

here to reply is because of the confusion that  has

arisen  with regard to the reduction of  the  vote.

Actually  there  is no reduction in the  allocation

for  "Education Exhibitions, Career Conventions and

Teachers' Seminar". What happened was that  out  of

the  provision  of $10,500 for the  financial  year

which is about to end, there was included a sum  of

$5,000 for guidance and placement. But this sum has

now  been transferred to the vote for the Technical

Education  Department. Therefore,  though  the  sum

asked for is $7,000, there is, in fact, an increase

of  $1,500 in the provision. We feel that this vote

should  be  enough  for  the  use  of  "Educational

Exhibitions,   Career  Conventions  and   Teachers'

Seminar".  But  should there be a shortage,  I  can

assure  Members  that  during  the  course  of  the

financial  year if seminars are held and proved  to

be of practical value - I have no doubt at all that

they  will  be  of  value  if  enough  thought  and

interest  are  shown by those who  participate  -we

will  either ask for a supplementary vote  or  vire

the  amount from savings, if any, from other  heads

of expenditure.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $191,098,630 for Head 0801 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Conceicao.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Culture is a very

important Ministry. It has the responsibility of looking

after broadcasting in our country. More



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



important  still,  it  is also  charged  with  the

mission  of  taking  the  lead  in  developing  our

national  arts and culture. It is also  responsible

for  creating  a national cultural image.  It  must

inculcate  in  our  people  a  sense  of   national

consciousness  and patriotism. It must  enrich  the

life   of   our   people  with   healthy   cultural

activities.  It  also  has  the  duty  of  imposing

censorship  on publications and books in  order  to

remove  any material that may poison the  minds  of

our people and to ensure that they obtain a healthy

mental pabulum. I have received complaints that in

recent months chain picture books have flooded  our

markets. The contents of these chain picture  books

are  full  of  fantasy. They contain  mythical  and

pornographic material which adversely  affects  the

children of this country. These children read these

undesirable  picture books and, as a result,  their

studies are adversely affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a matter of grave concern to us. It is my view that the civil servants in the Ministry of Culture have failed in their duty. I hope that the Minister will take the necessary action to ban all these fantastic, mythical and pornographic picture books, so that

the  minds  of our young children are not  poisoned

because they are the future leaders of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I wish to talk about television. At the

moment  television  has  many  viewers.  Therefore,

whether the programmes are good or bad, they have a

great  influence on the people. There is  no  doubt

that  in  the past one year we have seen many  good

programmes on T.V. They include forums and  debates

on social and economic problems. These are all very

educational.   However,  there   are   a   lot   of

shortcomings in the light entertainment  programme.

For  example, the Chinese variety show produced  by

R.T.S. has  no  educational value.  The  programme

consists of nothing more than showing men and women

in  love  and  stories of jilted love. The  singers

always sing, "I don't want to go home



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



tonight."  All  the items in the programme  are  in

very  low  taste.  They give our young  people  all

kinds  of funny ideas. I cannot see any educational

value in such a programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of films shown on T.V., I regret

to  say  that  most of the actors and actresses  in

these films are already dead and gone. In fact, the

pictures are too old for screening. It is  my  hope

that  such nauseating programmes will not be  shown

again on T.V. We should not show pictures which are

more  than ten years old. I hope the Minister  will

see to it that some improvement is made in the T.V.

programmes,  especially those relating to  culture.

For  example,  concerts or  variety  shows  can  be

produced  by  inviting students  from  the  various

language streams, the universities and institutions

of  higher  learning. I am sure that some  students

are  able  to  produce good and healthy programmes.

They already have their choirs. They can sing, blow

the  harmonica, put up plays, give piano  recitals,

and  even recite poetry. These programmes are  very

popular with our people. I am sure the public  will

be  very happy and welcome them. At the same  time,

R.T.S. will be able to nurture a new generation  of

artistes. It can kill two birds with one stone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our able Minister for Culture has always emphasised the importance of creating healthy culture and art. He has also stressed that good cultural traditions should be encouraged. I endorse his views without any reservation. But the important thing is this. His Ministry does not

appear  to  be following this policy. It  does  not

provide good educational programmes for the benefit

of   our  people  in  consonance  with  the  policy

pronounced by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to discuss the question of

how  to promote healthy cultural activities. I have

mentioned  at the beginning of my speech  that  the

Ministry  of  Culture  has  the  responsibility  of

developing   our   national   arts   and   culture.

Unfortunately, in the past one year the Ministry of

Culture has done very little in this direction.  At

the very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



most, it held a talentime contest on T.V. and  some

art  exhibitions.  I  would,  therefore,  like   to

propose to the Ministry of Culture that in order to

develop our national culture and inculcate a  sense

of  national consciousness in our people, it should

take   the  responsibility  of  promoting   healthy

cultural activities. It should lay down a policy on

culture   and   art   so  as  to  encourage   their

development and bring about a flourishing  national

culture and art in Singapore. I would like to  take

this  opportunity to propose to the  Minister  that

there  should  be a cultural festival  on  a  large

scale  this year. All the cultural and art  workers

in  Singapore can then participate in it.  In  this

way,  they can not only show their culture but also

learn  from  the others. At the same time,  we  can

also  give  proper encouragement to our  people  in

their  efforts  to  bring about a healthy  cultural

life.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

refer  to  a socio-cultural condition which,  I  am

sure,   the   Minister  will  agree   prevails   in

Singapore.  May I refer to the problem arising  out

of  this  condition as the problem of two cultures?

This  is no hackneyed phrase, I hope, because  this

problem of two cultures has nothing to do with  the

celebrated problem once elaborated by C.  P.  Snow.

It  is  our  own  problem and  relates  to  a  non-convergence  in  certain  important  attitudes  and

characteristic  modes  of  thinking  between  those

educated  in the English medium and those  educated

in the Chinese medium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently there was a certain amount of animated,

perhaps   even  agitated,  discussion  in   English

newspapers    on    the    necessity    for    film

classification.  While this was  going  on  in  the

English papers, the Chinese newspapers did not seem

to  evince  the slightest interest. Any  comparison

between  the  respective themes in the "Letters  to

the  Editor"  in the Chinese press and the  English

press  will  indicate  that the  preoccupations  of

those  people  who read the English papers  differ,

and  perhaps radically, from the preoccupations  of

those who read the Chinese newspapers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



The   Minister   has  himself  remarked   on   this

phenomenon. I think one has to see this  difference

initially and in its correct perspective,  in  view

also of the various remarks made by the Member  for

Sembawang  who  has  spoken of the  propagation  of

healthy cultural traditions and a national culture.

I   speak  in  the  same  way  as  the  Member  for

Sembawang,   but  perhaps  what  I  think   of   as

propagation  of  healthy  cultural  traditions  and

national  culture may be different  from  what  the

Member  for Sembawang thinks in terms of a  healthy

cultural  tradition. I think this  point  is  worth

making  and it is worth while getting us to realise

it. Now, having made the point, I must say that our

people are basically tolerant. I think there  is  a

basic subscription to the importance of respect for

one  another's  ways of living and  behaviour.  And

certainly  the Government must take  credit  for  a

policy  that has resulted in this sort  of  respect

and  tolerance. Where the Ministry  of  Culture  is

concerned,  its  attitude in respect  of  a  multi-cultural   development  up  till   now   has   been

apparently to contrive the maximum exposure of  the

cultural  aspects of one group for the  benefit  of

other groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think exposure alone is not enough. For example, it is not enough to put on a programme like "Tapestry" - and I am quoting this only as an example - incorporating the dances and music of the various cultural streams for the delectation of all. This is what I mean by

exposure.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we attend a school concert or a cultural

presentation organised by some community or even  a

communal organisation, there is this exposure.  And

certainly all this exposure is good. But as I  have

said,  it is not enough. What the next step  should

be,  I think, is to provide a deeper experience  of

one  another's  cultural ways. One approach  is  to

provide  opportunities whereby one  may  acquire  a

more analytical awareness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



of  the characteristics of the other person's

culture. Where culture in the sense of dance, song,

art,  music is concerned, we could have programmes,

which teach an understanding of these things,  both

in  a language which is a fairly common medium like

English  and in a medium different from that  which

is a characteristic of the culture to be presented.

In   other   words,  if  you  put  on   a   Chinese

presentation, let us find out all about  the  finer

aspects  of this presentation in English, Malay  or

Tamil. Let there be explanations. Let there  be  an

interesting  attempt to teach  the  finer  and  the

deeper aspects of this culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember once seeing on television what

appeared to be an interesting and detailed  account

of  the basic characteristics of Indian dance.  But

the  programme was in Tamil. I would have liked  to

appreciate  the programme myself. But I  could  not

because  the medium of explanation was Tamil.  That

particular programme should have been in Chinese or

English as well. There does not appear to be enough

of  education  of one sector of the people  to  the

cultural  forms of other sectors through  our  mass

media. That is with respect to culture in the  art,

music, or dance aspect of the term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to culture in the sense of outlook

and ways of thinking and behaving, it may be a good

idea  for newspapers to select items that  seem  to

reflect characteristically the attitudes of  people

who   read  newspapers  in  a  certain  medium  and

reproduce   these   characteristic,   idiosyncratic

notions  in  a  paper  using  another  medium.  For

example,  the  English newspapers could  scrutinise

those  characteristic reflections  in  the  Chinese

papers  and  reproduce  these  reflections  in  the

English  newspapers and vice versa. And  this  goes

for  the Malay and Tamil press too. Indeed our T.V.

and  radio  could  do this sort of  thing  with  or

without  comment. In other words,  to  say  in  one

language  what  characteristic  things  others  are

saying in other languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that perhaps with the production

of  at least a bilingual population, we would  have

overcome



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



such   problems  of  cross-cultural  understanding.

Already our schemes to educate children bilingually

are difficult to implement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Conceicao, you have one minute

more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> But even if they are easy to

implement we will get a new population of bilingual

people.  But  what about the parents  who  are  not

receiving  the  effects of a  bilingual  education?

Perhaps the Minister could think of ways and  means

to carry this idea across.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I actually meant to move the next

amendment* but I would like to speak now.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The amendment reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1003.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to confine my discussion to the

development   of   dancing  and   music   and,   in

particular,  to  the  National Theatre  Trust.  The

National  Theatre  Trust,  under  the  Ministry  of

Culture,   is  responsible  for  certain   cultural

activities  and  cultural  work.  And   they   have

organised  some  orchestras and dance  troupes.  In

other  words, the National Theatre is more or  less

an institute of performing arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, to train an orchestra, a choir or

a  dance  troupe to a certain standard  is  a  very

difficult  task  indeed. It is much more  difficult

than training a violinist or a pianist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Theatre has a modern stage of

considerable  size and the National  Theatre  Trust

has  many  able  conductors and dance  instructors.

These  are  the  pre-requisites necessary  for  the

training   of  members  of  orchestras  and   dance

troupes. Endowed with such facilities, it is a pity

that  the  National Theatre Trust  is  experiencing

financial  difficulties.  As  a  result,  all   the

facilities that are at its disposal cannot be fully

exploited.  If  we  view  this  problem  from  this

perspective, we would feel a great deal of pity and

sympathy for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



National Theatre Trust which must not be allowed to

die because of financial difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember some time early this year I read

in  the  newspapers that the Australian  Government

had  extended to us an invitation to send a mission

to  attend the Adelaide Cultural Festival. At  that

time, a spokesman from the Ministry of Culture said

that  it was a great honour for Singapore that such

an invitation had been extended to us. He also said

that  the Ministry of Culture would do all it could

to  accomplish the mission. This is, of  course,  a

matter   which  we  should  be  very  happy  about.

Admittedly,  Sir,  the  best  item  that  we  could

contribute   to  such  an  international   cultural

festival  would  be  to send a  mission  comprising

Chinese   orchestra,  the  Philharmonic  Orchestra,

local  dance  troupes and choirs.  Such  a  mission

would be able to reflect the characteristics of our

multi-culture. If this invitation had been  handled

by the National Theatre, I am sure the result would

be   very  good.  But  unfortunately  the  National

Theatre  is  unable  to  do  anything  because   of

financial    difficulties.   Even    the    present

Philharmonic  Orchestra  and  dance  troupes   have

already ceased their activities at the moment.  The

remaining  organisations that are still active  are

the  Chinese orchestra and the choir. And even they

are  in  a very precarious position. They  are  not

able  to do what they can for the country.  If  the

Ministry  of Culture cannot give adequate financial

assistance  or encouragement to the orchestras  and

dance troupes, how can we expect them to contribute

to the cultural life of our country? As a matter of

fact,  in  my  view, the various orchestras,  dance

troupes  and choirs in the National Theatre  should

be  regarded  as a cultural army representative  of

Singapore. We should therefore, in all seriousness,

give   them  proper  training,  encouragement   and

financial  assistance. Whether it is a philharmonic

orchestra or a Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



orchestra or any dance troupe, they should be given

proper training opportunities and facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point which I wish to deal with is in

connection  with  the  treatment  of  the   various

orchestras  and  dance  troupes  in  the   National

Theatre.  There has been some injustice or  unequal

treatment  in  certain ways. I wonder  whether  the

Minister   for   Culture  is   aware   of   certain

discrimination existing in the National Theatre. As

far  as  I  know, members of the Chinese  orchestra

receive  different  treatment  from  those  in  the

Philharmonic  Orchestra. I am given  to  understand

that the reason is that members of the Philharmonic

Orchestra  have  passed  certain  examinations  and

obtained certain qualifications, and therefore they

are  given better treatment and emoluments. In  the

case of the members of the Chinese orchestra, there

have    been    no   examinations,   no    official

qualifications,  and so their  salaries  should  be

lower. Sir, in my view, this is unreasonable. As we

know,  the  Chinese orchestra has  its  origins  in

China.  But  in China there is no proper  institute

for  the  training of musicians. This  is  done  by

those who have a liking for Chinese music under the

guidance  of experienced players. After  that,  the

trainees  themselves  will have  to  practise  hard

before   they   can  be  anywhere   near   success.

Therefore, it takes a very long time and plenty  of

practice  and  energy to train a Chinese  musician.

There  is  a  Chinese  saying,  in  regard  to  the

learning  of Chinese musical instruments,  that  it

takes  1,000 days to learn the pi pa,  which  is  a

Chinese  flute; 100 days to learn the ku  chern,  a

Chinese  harp;  and more than half  a  lifetime  to

learn a three-stringed instrument.

been said by the Members who have spoken just now.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1211.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you going to repeat what they

have said?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No, Sir, I

support  their views, but I have my own  points  to

make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first sign of daybreak we can hear music

broadcast over the radio. Of course, music is meant

to  soothe  our mind and body, and to provide  some

entertainment  for  us. More  important,  music  is

supposed  to lift up our spirit and to stimulate  a

greater sense of one's upward orientation. I regret

to  note  that  what  we are  subject  to  nowadays

consists  merely of an unhealthy and decadent  type

of music. Although we are awake, after listening to

this kind of music we become drowsy again. How  can

we  be roused to work in this mood? This is what we

are  subject  to  at home. If we go  out  into  the

street  we  can  hear music of  the  unhealthy  and

sickly  type, music which consists of  nothing  but

shrieking, screaming and shouting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us share this feeling. When foreign

singers  come to Singapore and sing pop  songs  and

dance  in  the latest style, our audiences  blindly

follow  them and popularise their songs and dances.

However,  if  we put on a serious concert  or  show

with  classical  music or art  songs,  it  is  very

difficult  to sell even a small number  of  tickets

and  those who buy them merely do so to oblige  the

organisers. For the last few years the youth of our

country  have  been  exposed  to  influences   from

foreign countries. Many of them have taken  up  the

songs  of  the  Beatles and their  dances  and  the

Western soul-dance. The men keep long



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



hair,  wear  a  long beard, and sport bell-bottoms.

The  girls  wear  jeans. It is  very  difficult  to

distinguish between the males and the females. Most

of   them  are  like  hippies.  This  is   a   most

undesirable  tendency. It corrupts the  body,  mind

and spirit of our youth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reasons for this tendency are, firstly,

external influence; secondly, imitation from films;

thirdly,  what  they learn over the  Radio  and  on

T.V.; and, fourthly, what they learn from books and

magazines.  If  we  look at  our  newspapers,  what

catches  our eyes consists of publicity stunts  and

propaganda  for  singers,  film  stars,   fashions,

hairstyles, entertainment and such like. Newspapers

are  full  of sensational stories like  murders  of

passion and revenge. All these are meant to  arouse

the  interest  of the readers and to  increase  the

circulation  of the newspapers. But  have  we  ever

paid  attention  to the ill effects or  undesirable

influence of such stories of sex and violence?  The

newspapers  even  show  bloody  scenes  of  murders

described  in  the fullest detail. Have  they  ever

thought  what sort of influence or effect  this  is

going to have on our youth? The small bookstalls in

the  backlanes  and street corners stock  unhealthy

stories   of  passion  or  violence  and  low-class

comics. This is all bad for our children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, films are a popular medium

of entertainment. If we want to know how many  healthy

or  useful films we had last year, the result

will be  most  disappointing. All the films  shown

last year   were  about  soldiers,  cowboys,   sex

and violence.  I suggest that the Ministry  of  Culture

carry  out a comprehensive review of this so-called

"culture" of our country. We should not allow films

to be shown if they portray violence and mysticism,

particularly because they will adversely affect the

minds and bodies of our youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand some of these foreign singers can earn

as much as $2,500 by performing just one show. This

has  been  given wide publicity in our  newspapers.

What sort of impression is this going to create? If

we look at our own situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



and  we try to publish a healthy magazine or  book,

it  is very difficult to sell even 2,000 copies. Is

it because our people do not possess the ability to

read  that  they  do not like to  read,  or  is  it

because  the  interest  of  our  readers  has  been

channelled into other directions? If the answer  is

the former, it is sad. If the answer is the latter,

I  think the Ministry of Culture should quickly  do

something about it. If we can ban advertisements on

cigarettes,  why  cannot  we  ban  those  unhealthy

publications  and advertisements which  will  lower

the  morals and adversely affect the minds  of  our

youths?  We are now in the initial stage of  nation

building  and  we  should therefore  cultivate  the

qualities of our youths. Is this not a step in  the

right  direction? If necessary, I think  we  should

impose  a  "cultural quota system"  and  we  should

leave   out  those  publications  which   are   not

necessary  or  of pressing need to  us.  We  should

encourage  local writers and artistes  to  be  more

productive.  At  the  same time,  we  can  organise

something like a cultural centre and employ  people

who  specialise or are experienced in the arts  and

culture and those who are interested in the various

fields  of our arts to work for the cause. It  will

be  a  good idea to draw up a programme of the work

to  be  done as an immediate requirement or put  up

one  or two concerts or shows a month. I think  all

these will be of help and benefit to us.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to criticise T.V.

Singapore's  programmes which I  consider  are  not

suited  to  our country. I refer to the  Pesta  Pop

programmes  in which are featured crazy dances  and

Red  Indian dances. Watching these dances  we  feel

ourselves  to be in a jungle with Red  Indians  who

are  isolated  from the world of  progress. Is  the

Minister  satisfied  with  such  dances?  Does   he

consider that they reflect cultural advancement for

our country? Do such dance programmes deserve to be

telecast  on our T.V. Singapore? If we look  around

us,  we will find there is an abundance of national

dances which we can tap from our multi-racial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



people  and which should be appropriately  telecast

on  T.V.  Singapore.  But why  are  these  national

dances  completely ignored? Can  the  Minister  for

Culture clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem of this cultural gap

is  a very complex one, and it is even reflected in

this House. On the one hand, we have Members asking

for  a  more  liberal attitude towards  censorship,

and,  on  the other, we have Members asking  for  a

stricter  censorship on films,  to  cut  out  films

showing  girls' bare bosoms and to stop  using  pop

songs  in  the  variety shows  on  T.V.  They  have

suggested that, instead, we should only have  piano

recitals  and cultural dances. So this  is  a  very

complex  problem.  I  think we  will  be  deceiving

ourselves if we say that a simple and easy solution

for it can be found overnight. This has come to our

notice only recently after more and more of us have

become  bilingual and begun to move from one  group

to  another.  In  the past we always  thought  that

differences in tastes, in outlook and in the way we

look  at  life  existed only  among  the  different

racial  groups,  and  we  felt  that  if  we  could

introduce  a  common  language  so  that  we  could

communicate with one another, the problem would  be

half  solved. However, this is not to be the  case.

We  have  now found that even among people  of  the

same  race  but  coming from different  educational

streams, there exist differences in tastes, in  the

way  they  look at life and in what they understand

to  be  their responsibilities towards  society.  I

suggest that this has something to do with the  way

one  is brought up, the kind of friends one has and

the  kind  of books and newspapers one  reads.  All

these  factors  tend to pull our people  apart  and

confine  them in different compartments. A  vicious

circle is therefore formed. If a person is educated

in,  say,  the English stream, he reads merely  the

English  newspapers  which  emphasise  subjects  of

interest only to the English-educated group.  After

some time he is conditioned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



to  certain  fixed  views which  only  he  and  the

English-educated group hold. He begins to adopt the

outlook  which  is  typical of that  group.  So  he

closes  his  mind to things which are happening  in

the  other  groups. The same thing happens  in  the

Chinese  newspapers  which, amongst  other  things,

constantly  remind their readers of their  glorious

past -four thousand years of history and so on, and

of the importance of not giving in to the influence

of  western decadent culture. This brings  about  a

polarisation of views between the two groups.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One interesting thing for us to do here is to

watch  how  different newspapers play up  different

things.  Take,  for  instance,  the  story  of  the

shooting  of  monkeys in the Botanic  Gardens.  The

English newspapers splashed the story on the  front

page,  with follow-up stories of demonstration,  by

some students, presumably from the English schools,

against  the  shooting of these  monkeys.  But  the

Chinese  newspapers laughed their heads  off.  They

thought the whole thing was very funny, that it was

ridiculous.  They laughed at the stupidity  of  the

English  press for playing up such a  story.  Their

immediate reaction was: Chih pao fan mei  yiu  shih

ching  tsuo.  To  express it in English  is  a  bit

difficult,  but it means something like this:  they

are too well fed, so much so that they have nothing

to  help them digest their food; they therefore had

to  play  up  this story as a pastime. The  Chinese

press asked, "Why waste time and valuable space  on

this story of monkeys? Why do they not think of the

thousands of human beings being shot in Vietnam  by

weapons far more deadly than those used against the

monkeys in Singapore?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the way the different language

newspapers report the debates in this House. A  few

days  ago  the  English newspapers played  up  only

those  speeches  of Members who spoke  in  English.

Similarly, the Chinese papers only picked up  those

speeches  delivered  in  Chinese.  Presumably  some

Members must have cyclostyled their speeches and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



distributed  them  to the Chinese  newspapers,  for

they printed them in full, every word of it without

any editing. This is the way things go. But I think

we  will be deceiving ourselves if we say that this

problem can be solved very quickly. We have so  far

only diagnosed the symptoms, but I think we are far

from finding a cure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presenting cultural shows in the different

language    media,    with    interpretation    and

explanation, might be a help, but I doubt very much

they  will, because cultural dances and  shows  are

only staged very occasionally. We need to look into

other  fields, like the newspapers, to see  whether

they  should also play a role in bridging the  gap,

so to speak, between the different cultural groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar spoke about the

National  Theatre. The National Theatre  Trust  has

done  a  very  commendable job in the promotion  of

cultural activities. This is even more evident when

we  consider the fact that since the time the Trust

was  formed,  not a single cent has been  voted  in

Parliament  to subsidise it. Nevertheless,  it  has

been   able   to  raise  from  scratch  a   Chinese

orchestra,  a  choir and a symphony orchestra,  and

together  they  have staged many fine performances.

In 1970 they conducted 14 indoor concerts.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have one minute left, Mr Jek.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that

many  Members will be withdrawing their amendments,

I  wonder if we can lift Standing Orders to  enable

me  to  give  them a more detailed  reply  on  this

subject.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us see what the response is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I interrupt

briefly?  I  would like to make one point  clear  -

when   I   suggested  that  there  could  be   more

explanation, I do not mean that that would  be  the

sole  way  of  overcoming the lack of understanding

between one culture and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



another.  I  only  meant that  to  be  one  of  the

possible ways of making this approach.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jek, you may proceed. There are

ten minutes more to go.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Thank you, Sir. So in spite

of  the  fact that the National Theatre Trust  have

not  received a single cent from this House in  the

way  of direct subsidy, they have been able to form

very good cultural groups in the Theatre. This  has

been  made possible by the hard work and dedication

of  the  Trust members and the artistes  concerned,

and also by the generous donations from the public.

But  I think this state of affairs cannot last very

long.  The members of the Trust are tired of  going

out  now  and  then to ask for donations  from  the

public for the National Theatre. In fact, the  time

has  come  for  us to ask this House for  money  to

subsidise  the cultural activities of the  National

Theatre  Trust.  We  must realise  that  we  cannot

expect to promote the fine arts for nothing. If  we

think  that these cultural shows are good  and  can

contribute  to  our  gracious living,  we  must  be

prepared  to  pay  for them. We  want  to  pay  our

artistes  as  much as we can, and as much  as  they

deserve.  But  as  I have said,  due  to  financial

limitations, we are not able to do so.  It  is  not

possible   to  pay  each  member  of  the   Chinese

orchestra  more than $40 per month, but members  of

the  Singapore National Symphony Orchestra are paid

higher  rates of honorarium because the  rates  are

laid down by the Musicians' Union of Singapore,  of

which many of them are members. The honoraria  paid

to  members of the Chinese orchestra are lower than

the  rates  laid  down by the Musicians'  Union  of

Singapore, and also lower than the fees paid by the

Broadcasting  Department. Therefore,  I  am  giving

very   serious   consideration  to  the   financial

position of the National Theatre Trust as  a  whole

with a view to ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Point of order, Sir, I cannot hear

the Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Some Backbenchers are having a

private conversation among themselves, and I  think

that  is  interfering with the  Minister's  speech.

Will you carry on, Mr Jek?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> As to the healthy cultural

activities referred to by the Member for Sembawang,

although  I  do not fully agree with  what  he  has

said,  we will look into it. Of course, we need  to

have some entertaining programmes on television  as

well as over the radio. We cannot only have what he

calls   educational   programmes.   If   he   wants

educational  programmes, or if he is interested  in

secondary  education,  then  he  should  switch  to

E.T.V. But there are also good programmes on  T.V.,

such  as  documentaries, music, and other  cultural

programmes.  If  we  were to  accept  the  Member's

suggestion  that  we should wipe out  all  the  pop

songs  and the more popular programmes on T.V.,  we

would  end  up with nothing at all. I am afraid  we

cannot do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his other point about holding a cultural

festival  in  Singapore,  I  think  this  is  worth

looking into, and I am definitely going to give  it

very  serious  thought.  But  if  I  am  right   in

interpreting  what  he  has  said  just  now  about

cultural  activities,  that  they  refer  to   free

cultural  shows  in the open air,  like  the  Aneka

Ragam we had in the old days, then I would say that

those  days  are gone, because since then  we  have

become  more  sophisticated. Instead of  performing

their  shows in the open air, the artistes are  now

invited  to  perform in our T.V. studios,  so  that

their  shows  can  be enjoyed not  only  by  a  few

thousand people, as in the case of open air  shows,

but  by  hundreds of thousands of T.V. viewers.  In

this  respect, I think T.V. has supported  cultural

activities in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like to ask  the  Minister

whether he considers Red Indian dances suitable for

Singapore's culture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I have no idea that our

artistes  are  capable  of  performing  Red  Indian

dances  in  our T.V. studios. I think the programme

producers are trying to experiment with new  trends

in the various folk dances. It is admitted that the

Pesta  Pop  programme is produced in  the  national

language,  and therefore we should have more  Malay

folk  dances in the programme. But it does not mean

that  we  have to confine this programme  to  Malay

folk  dances  only. It is meant to  cater  for  the

tastes  of  everyone, although more  Malay  viewers

enjoy  this  programme. We also hope  that  viewers

from the other language streams can also enjoy  it.

Therefore,  I  think we should allow the  programme

producers to experiment with whatever new forms  of

dances they wish to.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I am

not only concerned with Pesta Pop which is produced

in  Malay,  but  I  am  also  concerned  with  such

programmes  in  the other languages.  I  hope  such

dances are not telecast on T.V. Singapore. What  is

the  opinion  of the Minister with regard  to  such

crazy dances being given a place in such programmes

in all the languages?



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

remember having seen any Red Indian dances  in  the

programme  Pesta  Pop.  It may  well  be  that  the

wearing  of costumes resembling those worn  by  the

Red  Indians  has given him that impression.  As  a

matter of fact, we do not know whether or not it is

really a Red Indian dance. There is no authority in

Singapore  on  Red  Indian  dances  or  Red  Indian

costumes.  They may look like Red Indian dances  or

costumes, but they may not be so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I think the Minister is rather excited and, as

a  result,  he  has  not answered  my  question.  I

therefore  wish  to raise again the question  about

the  chain  picture books. What is the Government's

attitude towards them?

They have an adverse influence on our children. Can

the  Minister tell us the official attitude towards

these books?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  will  study  the question  of  the  chain

picture  comic books. However, on the  question  of

books  imported from abroad, they are censored.  Of

course,  this does not necessarily mean that  every

book must go through censorship. Perhaps some hooks

may have escaped the net or there may be some books

sent  by  post.  We cannot carry out censorship  on

books  sent  by parcel post too strictly.  In  our

system  of  censorship, other than in the  case  of

undesirable publications, we have tried to adopt  a

liberal policy so that the people of Singapore  can

read various kinds of books, particularly those  in

good  taste.  Of course, we will pay  attention  to

censorship. We have set certain standards in regard

to  books,  particularly those  relating  to  chain

picture comic books which depict violence and  sex.

We  have laid down certain criteria by which we  do

not allow such books to be imported into Singapore.

However, Singapore is a centre of communications in

this region and, as such, many people can send such

books  into or through Singapore by various  means.

Therefore, there are loopholes which we cannot plug

for   the  time  being.  So  far,  these  are   the

principles I have enumerated, but I should say that

in   general  we  should  hold  liberal  views   on

censorship so as to enable an exchange of minds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  believe the Minister is quite  sincere  in

dealing   with  this  matter.  He  is  giving   his

attention and consideration to the views which have

been  expressed  by Members of Parliament.  He  has

given  detailed  answers  to  their  questions.  He

thinks  that the whole thing is rather complex  and

he  is not able at the moment to think of a perfect

solution. Since he is going to consider this matter

in detail, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood on the Order Paper Supplement -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1003.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1301*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead I wish to speak on the

standard   of  Tamil  programmes  and  Tamil   news

bulletins   over  Radio  Singapore.   The   general

standard of Tamil programmes has been deteriorating

from  year  to year. We have some Tamil  television

programmes which are not in good taste. It  can  be

said,  of course, that this is a matter of opinion.

However, the general opinion is that the programmes

are  not in good taste at all. Some announcers  who

read  the  news  bulletins over the  radio  and  on

television  pronounce their words wrongly,  thereby

conveying the wrong meaning. Their pronunciation of

the Tamil words is very poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How poor?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> One Backbencher is asking me how

poor  it  is.  I  will try to explain  it.  If  you

pronounce  panam  with  the proper  intonation,  it

means money. If you pronounce panam in another way,

it  means coconut. If you pronounce vanam in  Tamil

with  the proper intonation, it means the  sky.  If

you  pronounce vanam differently, it means a  fire-cracker.  A  little  bit  of  difference   in   the

pronunciation makes a lot of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



difference  in the meaning. And when you  take  two

words  together  and pronounce them together,  they

convey   one   meaning.  If  you   pronounce   them

separately, they mean a different thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Member mentioned

air hostesses who announced in Tamil which he could

not understand, can he give us some examples?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I did not say that I could not

understand  them.  The sound is defective,  whether

the announcements were made in the Tamil or English

language. Later when I raised this question in  the

House,  I  was  told that the defect in  the  Civil

Aviation  Department's  announcements  lay  in  the

sound  system.  Moreover, the announcers  read  the

announcement  with an English accent.  I  was  told

that  this occurred not only in the Tamil  language

announcements but also in the Chinese, English  and

Malay  announcements. There was this defect in  the

airport  because there was something wrong  in  the

sound system. I was told about this by some Members

and also by other people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to Broadcasting. Some of the

announcers may have the necessary qualifications in

the English language but their spoken Tamil is very

poor.  In  view of the examples I have  given  just

now,  the  announcers should be  tested  in  spoken

Tamil before they are appointed. I do realise  that

it  is  very hard to get properly qualified persons

to fill these posts as those qualified in the Tamil

language  are very few. However, will the  Ministry

take  steps  to improve the standard of  the  Tamil

language spoken over Radio and Television Singapore

by   employing  competent  people  as   announcers?

Alternatively,  the Ministry can  employ  part-time

announcers who are capable of doing the work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter I wish to raise. There is

only   one   Tamil  film  screened  on   Television

Singapore a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



week.  It is shown very late in the evening and  it

finishes almost towards midnight. The children  who

watch this programme have to go to school the  next

morning.  So  they either see this  film  and  miss

school  the next morning, or deprive themselves  of

seeing  this film if they wish to go to school  the

next  morning. I wish to point out that at one time

these  films  were  screened  quite  early  in  the

evening.  Can  the  department  screen  this   film

earlier, as was done before?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

regarding  the announcements in the Tamil language,

my  colleague has already explained the  situation.

The Minister for Communications is not here now. He

must,   however,  understand  the   difficulty   of

pronouncing Tamil words correctly. If he has learnt

the   language,   he  will  know  the   difficulty,

especially  the  pronunciation.  Even   those   who

announce in the English medium swallow their words.

Some  of  the female announcers also swallow  their

words.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague has also raised the question of the

late  Tamil film show. I think the films are  shown

on  Friday, and, as a result, complaints have  been

made  because the Tamil people want to  go  to  the

temple  on that day. If the film is shown  earlier,

the  people  will not go to the temple. The  temple

people  have  therefore complained  that  the  film

should be shown later in the evening. That may  be

the reason why the Minister has decided to show the

film  later, because the people can then go to  the

temple early in the evening and come back later and

see  the  film. I think that is the reason why  the

Tamil film is shown late and my colleague here will

probably understand that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to another matter. What the Member for

Potong Pasir has said about the Tamil programmes is

correct.  They  are not up to standard.  There  are

many  local people with talent who are able to give

artistic  performances to suit the taste  of  every

community.  If we can give these talented  artistes

intensive training, the quality of the programmes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



over the radio and on television  will  be

greatly improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the announcers in the Tamil language are

not  fluent because of the poor standard  of  local

Tamil  education.  Therefore, I suggest  that  they

should  be  given  proper  training  in  the  Tamil

language before they are appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Tamil television programmes,

we have seen that the scope is limited. Most of the

programmes  are repeated over and over again.  This

applies   also   to  the  Tamil  films   shown   on

television.  I  suggest that they can  be  improved

greatly  so  that  the Tamil community  will  enjoy

viewing them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice that the T.V. cameramen are using a

lot of blank films to shoot scenes in the course of

their work. It does not matter if the films serve a

useful  purpose, but it is noticed that  the  films

are  not fully telecast in the T.V. programmes.  In

view  of  this, I feel there is a wastage of  films

which    involves    Government   in    unnecessary

expenditure.  I  would,  therefore,  suggest   that

unnecessary  shooting  of  scenes  should  not   be

allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I came across an article on the front

page  of  the  Eastern Sun regarding complaints  by

T.V. cameramen about their working conditions.  It

was  reported  that  the cameramen  were  certainly

going to stage a walk-out. Can the Minister explain

how  such a situation has arisen and what steps the

Government is taking on this matter?



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that, of late there has been a

lot  of  talk  about  price increases  of  consumer

products made by shopkeepers, hawkers, fishmongers,

etc.  I  wonder whether the Minister will  consider

advertising   the  official  prices  of   essential

products  daily  in every medium of  communication,

such  as  on  T.V.,  over  the  radio  and  in  the

newspapers, etc. For I feel that it would  be  more

convenient  for  the  general public  to  know  the

official prices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards

the  problem of Tamil pronunciation, I am afraid  I

cannot participate in that kind of debate because I

am no authority on the matter. But the complaint is

taken  note of and we will get our Tamil announcers

to  improve  in  their  pronunciation.  This  is  a

problem  not  only  with Tamil but  also  with  the

Chinese   language  and  other  dialects  such   as

Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien and so on, because  we

are so far away from the original country where our

ancestors  came from. They brought with them  their

languages.  But  after so many  years  of  use  and

misuse,  I  am afraid there must be some distortion

in  the languages. This is unavoidable. But we will

look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Tamil films in T.V. programmes which

we  telecast every Thursday and Friday at about  10

o'clock at night, they are mainly meant for  adults

and  not for tiny tots. If they are telecast  at  a

late  hour,  I presume they are feature  films  for

adults.  It should not affect the children  because

there are other more suitable programmes which they

can watch in the earlier part of the evening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked for clarification

on  why there was a report in the newspapers  about

T.V. cameramen  who  had  complained  about  their

conditions of employment. The main reason  is  that

they  are made to work harder. Recently very strict

rulings  were  applied  to  the  use  of  freelance

cameramen.  As  a result, the pressure  is  on  the

cameramen  who  are  permanently  engaged  by   the

Broadcasting  Department. Furthermore,  there  were

two or three cameramen whose contracts had not been

renewed  due to certain reasons. This made  matters

worse.  And  so  there was this  complaint  in  the

newspapers.  I  would say that it is  human  nature

that if you make them work too hard, they complain.

That is quite true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of blank films, I do not understand

what  the  Member for Anson meant. I  presume  that

when  the  cameramen are sent out to shoot  scenes,

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



have  to take a lot of them. But then it is  up  to

the editors to select the most appropriate films to

be  used on T.V. Most probably they may select only

40 per cent or even less of the total film shot.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, it is not true that there are

other  feature films shown on T.V. for the  benefit

of  the  Tamil children. Only one film is  shown  a

week  for  all  the Tamil-speaking people,  whether

they are adults or children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about pronunciation of Tamil

words which could convey the wrong meaning. I  have

just  given  examples  of this,  and  the  Minister

should take steps to remedy this. Otherwise it will

defeat  the purpose of broadcasting news  bulletins

in the Tamil language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will

look  into  the  matter and try to  get  the  Tamil

announcers to improve in their pronunciation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1351.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points which I would like to bring

up   against  this  subhead.  One  relates  to  the

programme "What Others Say". Basically, I think the

concept behind "What Others Say" is sound.  What  I

am  complaining about is that we have to listen  to

news  that has already appeared in the English  and

the  Chinese press a few days after they have  been

current,  with  the result that this  news  becomes

stale.   Perhaps  some  added  interest  could   be

injected   into  the  programme.  The  views   from

newspapers in Manila, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Indonesia

and maybe even further afield could be reflected in

the programme. In this way, we could have a broader

perspective really of what others say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to talk about is what

sort of training might be given to our producers in

order  to improve the quality of local productions.

Perhaps  there  could be some schemes  whereby  our

people could be sent abroad. Or we could even bring

in experts in order to devise and implement schemes

of training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards

"What Others Say", I understand that there has been

an  improvement in the programme. If you watch this

programme,  you  will see that it has  been  vastly

changed; one of the changes is the presentation  of

this  programme. There are now two readers  instead

of  one - a male and a female -in order to make  it

more  interesting.  The graphics  are  also  better

presented.  It  is  not correct  to  say  that  the

programme  is confined to quoting local newspapers.

Frequently,  quotations are included  from  English

publications  like  The Times,  the  Guardian,  the

Economist; American publications like the U.S. News

and  World  Report  and  The  Times  of  New  York;

Australian  publications such as the Bulletin;  the

Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review and the

English translation of the French paper, Le  Monde.

We  have also quoted from the Bangkok Post and  the

Manila Times on matters of interest for our viewers

or   listeners.  But  the  problem  is  that  these

newspapers do not always carry articles  which  are

of  relevance  to us. If there is anything  in  the

newspapers  which is of interest  to  us,  we  will

certainly use it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the technique of the producers and the

announcers, I agree with the Member for Katong that

there is room for improvement. This matter will  be

looked  into.  We  also have  regular  courses  for

producers  and  announcers to attend,  and  regular

training  sessions  in  all  aspects  of  programme

production in radio and T.V, with the assistance of

foreign experts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the

Minister  and I just differ on what should  be  the

frequency with which we should resort to quotations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



from newspapers further afield. However, Sir, I beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Conceicao ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1481.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy, amendment (7) .



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1631.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the estimates for the Printing

Department,  I notice there is an increase  in  the

posts  of  senior officials. But I do not  see  any

increase in the posts of junior officers. I do  not

know  what is the reason. Perhaps the Minister  can

explain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the senior

posts  referred  to  are  the  Cost  Accountant  or

Financial  Manager, the Assistant Cost  Accountant,

the Production Planning Manager, the Works Manager,

the Estimator and the Purchasing Officer. The first

four  are  Division I posts and the  last  two  are

Division II posts. However, the Production Planning

Manager  and the Works Manager are posts which  are

regraded from the Deputy Government Printer and the

Superintendent posts respectively. In terms of  net

increase,  there  are only four  new  appointments.

These,  together with the regraded posts  mentioned

above, are meant to serve as a nucleus of executive

staff  to  undertake  new functions  in  the  cost-conscious  set-up. It will be noted  that  the  new

senior  appointments  are not  the  result  of  any

increase  in the work-load but a need to  undertake

jobs competitively and economically viable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why there is no increase in the junior

appointments,  the  reason is  that  there  are  at

present insufficient job commitments to warrant  an

increase in their number.

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced  by  the  whole sum in respect  of  subhead

2169.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to know how the amount given in

the  Estimates  for  1971-72  is  to  be  used  for

acquiring  T.V. and radio programmes, and  what  is

the  proportion  to be spent on each  of  the  four

language programmes. I also wish to know which  are

the  countries  from which we have been  purchasing

these programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been trying very hard to drive home

the  importance of regional co-operation and better

understanding  between  our neighbouring  countries

and  of not creating an introvert society. I wonder

whether  the Ministry of Culture has taken this  as

one  of  the  guidelines in acquiring or purchasing

T.V. and radio programmes so that our T.V. viewers

could  be  well  educated  and  informed  in   this

direction.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that there are many good, educational,

informative   and   entertaining  T.V. programmes

produced in countries other than the West.  We  are

not  only interested in what others say, but we are

also interested in what others perform and produce.

I  wonder  whether  the Ministry  of  Culture  will

include some of these films so that the horizon  of

our T.V. viewers could be constructively widened.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we accept

the  argument  that we should have more  T.V. films

from  the countries in this region. It is important

that  we  should  know more about  our  neighbours,

learn  more  about  their ways of life,  understand

their customs and even their love stories. However,

most countries in this region, for that matter  the

whole  of  Asia, do not have an economy  which  can

support a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



sophisticated film industry. We need a lot of films

to  fill the long telecasting hours we have on T.V.

We   have   altogether  106�  hours  per  week   of

telecasting time to fill. When we look at  the  map

of  this  region or the whole of Asia, and ask  the

question, which are the countries which can provide

us  with  a regular supply of films in the language

understood by the majority of the people  here,  we

find  that the answer is in the negative. Japan  no

doubt  has a film industry but we cannot use  films

which  are in Japanese dialogue. Dubbing them  into

one  of  our languages is out of the question.  The

equipment, the time and the technicians required to

do the work would make the cost too prohibitive for

us.  Besides,  there are political implications  to

consider. Hong Kong produces a lot of Cantonese and

Mandarin films, but they are mainly feature  films,

love  stories, sword fighting and so on.  They  are

produced by a few big film companies which are very

much  profit-minded  and they  would  not  normally

allow  their films to be used by the T.V. stations

unless the earning power of the films is exhausted.

In  fact, there is an understanding among them that

only  films  of more than ten years  old  would  be

released  to  T.V. stations. So this  is  far  from

satisfactory. Besides, we cannot get films of other

types   from  Hong  Kong,  such  as  documentaries,

variety  shows  and  so on.  The  same  applies  to

countries like Thailand, the Philippines,  Vietnam,

Indonesia  and others, because these  countries  do

not have a film industry. So whether we like it  or

not, we have to depend on western countries such as

the  United States, Britain, Germany and  Australia

which have better developed resources to supply the

whole   range  of  T.V. programming  on  a   world

syndicated  basis. Films from these  countries  are

normally   in  English.  Therefore,  the   language

problem  is  not so great when we use these  films.

That  is  the  reason  why a  great  percentage  of

telecasting  time is devoted to western  films.  In

fact, about 52 per cent of the telecasting time is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



given to English films and programmes like that. It

is  not that we want to, but because we just cannot

get  enough  films in the other languages.  But  to

help our audience understand some of the films, sub-titles  are used. Even with the English films  that

we  are getting, our choice is very narrow. We  can

only pick and choose from a list of films which the

film  distributors  have  decided  to  release  for

circulation  in this region. In normal practice,  a

distributor  only brings in a film for  circulation

in  this  region  when  he  is  sure  that  several

stations in this region want to rent that film.  In

other words, we have to follow the crowd, and it is

difficult  to impose our independent taste  in  the

matter of film selection. For example, recently  we

wanted to acquire some films from Britain on opera,

ballet dancing, choir singing, music and so on.  We

thought  this  would help our people to  appreciate

some  good aspects of western culture, but we  were

forewarned  that if the Singapore  station  is  the

only station in this region that wants this kind of

film,  it  would have to bear the cost of the  film

print  and  the  cost  of  freight,  including  the

insurance  charges, to bring the film all  the  way

here  from Britain and to send it back also.  This,

plus  the  rental of the films, makes the  cost  of

acquiring such films prohibitively high. If we have

to  do the same to every film that we show and  pay

the  high cost, I think the money provided  for  in

this  subhead  would not last  for  more  than  six

months,  let  alone for the whole of the  financial

year. So that is the position we are faced with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

quite  agree  with the Minister when he  says  that

dubbing  the  Japanese film in one of our  official

languages  is impossible. I do not understand  what

he  means by "out of the question", because I  have

seen   some  T.V. films  dubbed  in  one  of   our

languages. One is "Run for your life" in  Cantonese

and   the   other  is  "Samurai"  in  the  national

language. Can the Minister clarify what he means by

"out of the question"?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Dubbing is out of the

question simply because of the high cost. The films

that we are showing, already dubbed in the language

which  our  people understand, are  not  dubbed  in

Singapore  but are dubbed either in  Hong  Kong  or

Japan.   In   these  countries   they   have   very

sophisticated film industries, so they  can  afford

to  have very expensive dubbing studios. If we were

to  set  up a studio merely for dubbing,  the  cost

would be very prohibitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I merely wish to know if the Minister can

let  us have such details as to make it clearer for

us  to  understand what this "Adult Education  T.V.

Production  and Training Centre Project"  is  about

for which we are allocating the sum of $10.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, this is a token sum for

a plan which we have in mind to be introduced later

this  year, but we are not quite sure of the  exact

amount we will require for this project. Therefore,

we have just simply put in a token sum for the time

being,  but  when  the  details  of  the  financial

arrangement have been obtained, the amount  can  be

properly  specified in the subsequent supplementary

estimates for the budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister

give   us  some  description  of  what  this  Adult

Education  T.V.  Production  and  Training   Centre

Project is about?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

very complicated plan, but if the Member wants  it,

I  can,  of course, give him a very brief  idea  of

what this is about. This is a project supported  by

both the Government and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



Frederich  Ebert-Stiftung  of  West  Germany.   The

agreement was signed between the Government and the

Foundation  in  1970 to establish an  international

centre   for  the  production  of  adult  education

programmes  and the training of T.V. producers  and

technicians  in  this field. The  project  will  be

known as CEPTA - Centre for Production and Training

for  Adult  Education Television. CEPTA will  be  a

joint  venture with Singapore contributing  to  the

capital  cost of the building to house studios  and

offices, and the Frederich Ebert-Stiftung providing

capital equipment. Most of the staff for CEPTA will

be  employed  by  Government, while  the  Frederich

Ebert-Stiftung  will  provide  five  officials  and

experts.  There  will  be  a  sharing  of  annually

recurrent expenditure for production costs. Most of

the countries in South-east Asia have indicated  to

the   Frederich   Ebert-Stiftung  that   they   are

interested in participating in this project. It  is

the  intention that an association of participating

members   will  be  formed  to  formulate  members'

programmes   and  training  requirements.   It   is

expected that the United Nations agencies will also

co-operate  in some of the undertakings  of  CEPTA.

This  is as far as I can say, and I hope the Member

gets a clearer picture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Sports Division comes under the Ministry

of  Social Affairs. The main responsibility of this

Division is to promote and develop sports. Recently

this  Division  has  done  a  great  deal  in  this

direction. We can see that sports activities in the

republic  have been very active and are  developing

at  a  fast pace. The Sports Division has also done

its  share in the promotion of regional sports  and

athletics. For instance, we have already sent quite

a  number  of  sports delegations to take  part  in

various  regional sports meets, such  as  the  SEAP

Games  and the Asian Games. At this moment  another

regional  sports  meet  is  taking  place  here  in

Singapore,  namely,  the First  Commonwealth  Table

Tennis  Tournament. All these can help  to  promote

the  development of sports in our country, and will

make  our  people  healthier and more  rugged  than

before. Besides making our people more healthy  and

rugged,  these  sports and athletic activities  can

also   play  a  role  in  raising  our   level   of

sportsmanship. We should develop the skills of  our

sportsmen  in  the various fields of  athletics  in

order to raise our standards so as to enable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



us  to  win honour for our country in international

competitions. In this respect, I would like to  ask

the Minister some questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Has the Sports Division any plans to train

our  national sports representatives?  I  ask  this

because  our  standards  in  basketball,  football,

soccer,  and badminton have gone down.  Very  often

our  teams have brought back a big duck's egg  from

international  competitions. So we  should  do  our

best  to  remedy  this situation, so  that  in  the

shortest  possible time we may bring our  standards

up   to   the   level  required  for  international

competitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We are now building the National Sports

Stadium,  better  known  as  the  National   Sports

Complex.  I would like to know what is the progress

up  to  date,  and when will construction  work  be

completed. And when completed, what kind of  sports

facilities  will be provided by this complex.  Will

we  have  the honour of hosting any regional  competitions or international tournaments in sports or

athletics?  Moreover, are there any  opportunities

for sports bodies to make a comparative study so as

to improve our own standards and, at the same time,

bring  about  a richer recreational  life  for  our

people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, first of all, I must  thank  the

Member for Sembawang for raising his questions  and

for  saying  so  many  words of  encouragement.  In

recent  years our Ministry, particularly the Sports

Division,  has actually done a great deal  for  our

sports and athletic activities. The Member wants to

know  what plans the Sports Division has  to  train

our  sports  representatives. I would like  to  say

that   we   all  know  that  sports  and   athletic

activities in Singapore are mainly carried  out  by

the  individual  amateur sports  bodies,  and  they

select   their  own  representatives.  We,   as   a

Government  department, are  only  responsible  for

administrative matters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards training, it is undertaken by the

various  amateur  sports  bodies.  The  Member  for

Sembawang   may   recall  that  we  have   recently

established  the  National Sports Promotion  Board,

which  is a statutory body. It is charged with  the

promotion  and development of sports  and  athletic

activities,  and  at  the  same  time  to   provide

facilities  for the various amateur sports  bodies.

Now that the Board is functioning, I am sure it has

a lot of plans to promote and to develop sports and

athletic  activities  in  Singapore.  The  National

Sports Promotion Board has, among its members,  the

Minister  for Social Affairs as Chairman. Since  he

is  in  the  chair, I am sure the Board  will  have

enough  plans and facilities to promote sports  and

athletic activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to when the National Sports Complex will be

ready, I can say that the building progress is  now

half-way  through. It is expected to  complete  the

Sports Stadium by the middle of 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question whether regional or

international tournaments or competitions  will  be

held  in our Sports Stadium, I think this can  best

be answered by the National Sports Promotion Board,

because  it is up to the Board to decide what  kind

of  regional  or international sports  or  athletic

tournaments  or competitions will  be  held.  So  I

think  this  question will have to  depend  on  the

decision  of  the Board before any  answer  can  be

given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view

of  the  detailed answer given by the Parliamentary

Secretary, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears to me that the Central Complaints

Bureau  has  outlived its usefulness.  I  say  this

because there seems to be an obvious preference  on

the  part  of  the general public  to  bring  their

complaints to Members of Parliament



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



or  air them through the press. Many people seem to

be   running   their  own  independent   complaints

bureaux.  Even  Radio  and  T.V.  Singapore  has  a

Chinese programme called Tah Chung Ter Hua. So with

all this competing demand for attention, I think it

is  a  waste  of money to continue to maintain  the

Central  Complaints Bureau. We might as well  close

it  down  and divert the staff to, say, the Factory

Inspectorate, a move which I am sure will please my

union colleagues here very much.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Sir, I think it is still necessary to have

the  Central  Complaints Bureau. It operates  as  a

central  agency for members of the public  to  make

complaints  so  that  any  discourtesy,  delay   of

service,  or  petty bureaucracy in  the  Government

service  can  be eradicated or kept under  control.

These  facilities should be made accessible to  any

member  of the public, in addition to any  protests

or  complaints  made to Members of Parliament.  The

Central  Complaints  Bureau is not  competing  with

Members, but is just an additional means of helping

the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1970 alone the Bureau attended to 794

cases  as  compared with 654 in 1969. The staff  of

the  Bureau rendered services to 28,103 members  of

the  public in 1970, when they wanted to know about

the   locations  and  functions  of   the   various

departments  in the vicinity of Empress  Place  and

elsewhere.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example of the investigations and action

taken by the Central Complaints Bureau, out of  794

complaints received in 1970, only 19 cases could be

attributed to rudeness or discourtesy. As a  result

of  this, the following action was taken: dismissal

of  officers, one case; disciplinary action  taken,

five  cases; retirement due to disciplinary action,

two  cases; resignation before investigation -  the

officers were a bit afraid - two cases; warning  by

the department, eight cases; insufficient evidence,

27  cases. There were 65 cases of complaints  which

were not substantiated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



With  due respect to Members, this Bureau is  still

necessary and it has not outlived its usefulness.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I would like to thank the

Minister for his explanation but, at the same time,

I  wish  to suggest that perhaps a little time  and

effort  should  be spent on public relations.  Very

few  people  seem to know about the Bureau.  I  beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1171.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, I wish to say something

about  the Legal Aid Bureau. The Bureau looks after

poor  people who need legal aid. It tries to  solve

their  difficulties so that law and justice can  be

put at their service. It seeks to provide effective

service to the masses and in a way it is a kind  of

welfare   institution.  However,  I  have  received

several complaints recently that when people go  to

the  Legal  Aid Bureau for assistance, their  cases

are  usually delayed for three or four  months  and

sometimes even up to six months. If that  is  true,

then  I  feel  that it is very unreasonable.  There

should   not  be  any  delay  because  this   would

inconvenience the people seeking its services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is about the staff in the

Bureau.  Their attitude, when dealing with  members

of   the   public,   seems  to  be   arrogant   and

indifferent.  They  seem to  be  half-hearted  when

people go to them to seek legal assistance.  It  is

natural  that  people only turn up  at  the  Bureau

because they wish to seek legal assistance in order

to get justice done to them or to get help to solve

their  problems.  If the staff in  the  Bureau  are

arrogant, the members of the public will be  afraid

of  them,  and they will not dare to turn up  again

for assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter about which I have

received complaints from members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



of  the public. The Bureau is rather slow  in

dealing with the cases. Very often the public  have

to  wait in the Bureau for two or three hours at  a

stretch.  The efficiency of the Bureau is  actually

in question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take this opportunity to request the

Minister  to  look into these three complaints  and

see whether they are true. If they are true, I hope

he  will  take  immediate measures  to  remedy  the

shortcomings  in the Legal Aid Bureau  so  that  it

will be able to serve the poor people better.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member

has raised three points. First, on the question  of

delay,  let  me  inform the House  that  since  its

inception  in 1955, the Legal Aid Bureau has  dealt

with  about  31,000 cases. There  are  about  3,000

files  in circulation at the moment which are being

attended  to  by five legal officers. Thousands  of

files  which have since been classified  as  closed

were  settled  within six months and some  of  them

between  six  months and two years. The  period  of

settlement in each case depends on the type of  the

problem  and  its  complexity. If  proceedings  are

instituted,  it is out of the hands of  the  Bureau

and there may be delay in the fixing of the date of

hearing  by the courts. This is one of the  reasons

for  the  delay. So far we have not  received  many

complaints  about this. There may have been  a  few

complaints  in  delay but this is easily  explained

and  they  are due to a variety of reasons.  First,

the applicant's inability to supply the Bureau with

the  necessary information. Second,  delay  on  the

part  of  the  opposing party in  replying  to  our

letters in spite of reminders. In cases of accident

claims,  we  have  to wait for police  and  medical

reports.  Lastly, all matters which are contentious

must  be brought before the Legal Aid Board  either

for  approval or refusal, depending on whether  the

applicant has reasonable grounds for being a  party

to  a  civil  proceeding. In  all  such  cases,  an

opinion  must be returned by the legal  officer  in

charge  for  the consideration of the  Board  which

convenes once in six weeks or so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to please everyone, Sir, but it

can  be simply said that the officers of the Bureau

have  always  endeavoured  and  will  endeavour  to

assist applicants as best they can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the arrogance of the staff,

this  is  another reason why as I  have  said,  the

Central  Complaints Bureau is still  essential.  In

general,    very   few   people   appreciate    the

difficulties and handicaps which the staff  of  the

Legal  Aid  Bureau have to face. This can  only  be

appreciated by spending some time in the Legal  Aid

Bureau.  I  hope that one of these days the  Member

for  Sembawang will visit the Bureau  and  see  for

himself  the difficulties that are being  faced  by

the  officials. I have not received any  complaints

of my staff being arrogant. On the contrary, I have

had  praise  for  their work in the Bureau.  Should

there  be  any  such cases, I hope the  Member  for

Sembawang will bring them to my notice and  I  will

surely get an investigation instituted and take the

necessary  action if it is proved that the  officer

is arrogant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained the procedure in the

Legal  Aid Bureau. There are four reasons why  some

of the cases are delayed. I do not think I need add

anything further to that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Minister has said just now that there  are

many cases pending in the Legal Aid Bureau, that  a

lot  of  cases have to be settled and, as a result,

the staff might be a bit overworked to be polite to

members of the public. If that is the case, I would

like to suggest to the Minister that more staff  be

recruited  in  order to deal with  the  many  cases

outstanding.  This is one of the solutions  to  the

problem.  I wonder whether the Minister will  agree

to this.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> I will certainly do so if my

colleague, the Minister for Finance, will  give  me

the money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the

Minister  will submit his proposal to the  Minister

for  Finance, I am sure it will receive sympathetic

consideration. In any case, the Minister has  given

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



detailed  explanation  to  the  House  and   I   am

satisfied  with his reply. I beg leave to  withdraw

the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1203.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is an increase in the establishment of the Probation and Aftercare Officers from 17 to 21. I would like to ask the Minister how many of these officers will be assigned to the Adult Probation Section which is housed in the subordinate court opposite the

Central  Police  Station.  If  more  officers   are

assigned  to that section, I am afraid  there  will

not be any place for them, because it is so crowded

that  there  is no possibility of adding  one  more

desk and one more chair for another person. Perhaps

the   Minister  might  care  to  look  for   better

accommodation for his officers, because they cannot

function properly without the privacy that  is  due

to those whom they are looking after, and under the

conditions  that I find prevailing  in  the  little

cubicles  in the subordinate courts. It will  be  a

gross exaggeration if I term it a "black hole", but

the conditions there are grim. Perhaps the Minister

will look into this particular matter.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

certainly look into the adverse conditions  in  the

passage  leading  to  the court and  administrative

offices where some of the public officers are  put.

However, I wish to inform the House that they  will

soon  be moved to the Ministry building itself when

part of the Legal Aid Bureau is moved to our office

block  at  Havelock Road. There is ample space  for

every  one of them in the new place in the Ministry

building. They can work much better under these new

conditions than they can now.

stand part of the Estimates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1002 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Augustine H. H. Tan.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Social Welfare Department is a welfare

institution which looks after the needs of the poor

and  unemployed  people. Every year the  Government

sets aside a few million dollars for the welfare of

people  who require and deserve assistance.  In  my

opinion,    this   measure   is   noteworthy    and

praiseworthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are certain matters about the

department which are not satisfactory. In  fact,  I

have received several genuine complaints about  the

department.  For  example,  the  rates  of   public

assistance  have  been reduced. In  the  past,  the

amount of public assistance given to the head of  a

family  was  $21  per month. The complaint  I  have

received is that this sum has been reduced  to  $16

per month. I wonder whether this is true. If it  is

true,  has  the  reduction  been  made  with   good

reasons?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, $21 per month is already a meagre sum. It is

not  adequate  to  maintain  the  existence  of  an

individual particularly at a time when the cost  of

living is rising. So a reduction of this sum to $16

will  make life even more difficult. Therefore,  we

should  not only refrain from reducing the rate  of

public assistance but instead give consideration to

increasing    it,   in   view   of   the    present

circumstances, in order to enable the recipients of

public assistance to pull along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to explain and also to

look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  note  with  great concern  the  almost  $2

million  cut in expenditure on social welfare.  The

Minister  for  Social Affairs has in recent  months

pointed  proudly at the decline in  the  number  of

persons on social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



welfare as an indicator of economic development and

increasing  employment. As  an  economist,  Sir,  I

naturally  endorse such a reaction. As a socialist,

however,  I  would want to say that the  Government

should  give  more  in welfare  aid  per  remaining

person   and   perhaps  lay  down  less   stringent

requirement for such aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, you will note that

disbursements  of  only  $4.9  million  under   the

heading "Other charges, annually recurrent" require

personal emoluments of $2.2 million. Sir, the rates

of  welfare assistance are paltry by any  standard.

The  maximum receivable per family is  on  $60  per

month,  a  rate which has remained unchanged  since

1962,  so  I am informed by the Director of  Social

Welfare. As an economist, I am aware that too  much

public  assistance  can be a serious  deterrent  to

individual  motivations to work.  However,  in  our

situation, we are far below the disincentive point.

Consider, Sir, the rent for Housing and Development

Board  flats is at least $20 per month for  a  one-room flat and public utilities probably cost $10 to

$15 per month. Even if a distressed family receives

the  maximum amount of $60, there is not very  much

left to keep body and soul together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest cut under the Social Welfare

Department's   Head   is  in  respect   of   public

assistance  allowance  from $5.2  million  to  $3.4

million. Next is the T.B, treatment allowances from

$450,000  to  $250,000.  The  item  in  respect  of

assistance  to displaced and distressed persons  is

given  only a token vote. I cannot believe that  we

have  no  more displaced and distressed persons.  I

may  be  able to understand and perhaps support  an

expenditure cut on social welfare if our economy is

doing  badly.  But with the present boom,  this  is

unwarranted   and  goes  very  much   against   our

socialist principles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unlike other classes, the poor and the

illiterate  are  not  just inarticulate,  they  are

voiceless. The employers have their representatives

and the middle-class has the Member for Katong. But

how many will speak up for the poor?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen some beautiful penthouses recently,

not  private  ones too. Our statutory boards  spend

hundreds of thousands of dollars on such things  as

holiday bungalows and recreational clubs for senior

officers.  I have nothing against luxury,  Sir,  if

the poorest classes are well taken care of. If this

House  will vote an increase for social welfare  at

the  rate  of  at  least  two-thirds  the  rate  of

increase  in  national income, I  promise  to  stop

talking about penthouses here or elsewhere. I might

even consent to open one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a great deal that needs to be done

in  respect  of  social  welfare.  There  could  be

improvements in the homes for orphans, for example.

Let them have some pieces of chicken along with the

curry  instead of the curry alone. Our old people's

homes  could  do with more attention  too.  In  our

society  which  is fast modernising,  the  extended

family system is breaking down rapidly. Fewer older

people  are living with their children. The mother-in-law  no  longer commands the household  in  many

homes.  Probably our flats are too small  to  house

more  than two generations under one roof.  Let  us

therefore have more and better homes for the  aged.

Sir, I hold no brief for the idle and the lazy. But

people cannot compete if they are handicapped,  and

when such is the case, our society should have  the

compassion  to  care and to provide  adequately  if

only because of our common humanity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first

answer the query of the Member for Sembawang on the

decrease in the rate of public assistance from  $21

to  $16  per  month? The present  rates  of  public

assistance  are: $21 for the head of a family;  $10

for  the wife; $8 for dependants above 16 years  of

age, and $5 for dependants below 16 years of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



age. The usual payment for the head of a family  is

$21  if  the  person receives no other  sources  of

income.  However,  if  he has partial  income  from

other sources, the allowance may be reduced. It  is

not possible to comment on individual cases without

knowing  the  full circumstances  of  the  case.  I

repeat, we have not reduced any welfare rate at all

and, in fact, the policy has not changed so far. In

case   the  Member  for  Sembawang  has   got   any

individual case, he can take it up with my Ministry

and we will look into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Whampoa, he is correct in

saying  that  the  cut  in  expenditure  on  social

welfare  will amount to almost $2 million  for  the

coming  financial  year.  To  be  more  exact,  the

current provision of $9,080,200 will be reduced  to

$7,178,250,    representing    a    decrease     of

approximately $1.8 million or 21 per cent. I should

point  out, however, that this substantial drop  in

expenditure  for the Social Welfare  Department  is

due  mainly  to  more efficient management  of  the

existing  welfare services aided by  the  improving

social  situation,  and not due to  any  deliberate

policy  to cut down expenditure on social  welfare,

in  fact,  it  is the policy of the  department  to

assist  all  families who are  in  need  of  social

welfare assistance in one form or another. I  would

also  like  to  assure the Member for Whampoa  that

there  will  be  no  curtailment  in  the  existing

services  provided by the Social Welfare Department

during  the  next financial year. On the  contrary,

there  will  be  an  expansion  of  some  of  these

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that the bulk of the reduction

in  the expenditure estimates of the Social Welfare

Department fall under the following items:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Public Assistance



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision reduced from $5.2 million to $3.4

million.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  improving

unemployment  situation and fewer applications  for

public  assistance, and not to any change in policy

or in the rates of payment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) T.B. Treatment Allowance



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision reduced from $450,000 to $250,000. This

is  mainly due to improving standards of living and

better medical control and treatment of disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Teachers in voluntary institutions



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $252,910 for the salaries of 32

teachers in voluntary institutions has been entered

under the expenditure estimates of the Ministry  of

Education  and therefore there will be no reduction

in expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three items alone account for a reduction

of  $2.3  million in expenditure estimates for  the

Social  Welfare Department. Members will  therefore

agree  that, although there is an overall reduction

of  $1.8  million in the provision for  the  Social

Welfare  Department, the department  will  in  fact

have  approximately half a million dollars more  to

spend  on  its  other services, apart  from  public

assistance and T.B., treatment allowances.  We  agree

that  the disbursements of only $4.9 million  under

"Other   charges,   annually   recurrent"   require

personal  emoluments  of  $2.2  million.  I   would

suggest  that  it  is  not  a  good  criterion  for

assessing  existing  social  welfare  services   by

relating  personal  emoluments to  "Other  charges,

annually recurrent".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the provision of the social welfare services,

assistance given to needy families in the  form  of

personal services is as important as the giving  of

cash allowances. There are many types of supporting

services  which  the Social Welfare Department  can

give to enable individuals and families to function

more  effectively,  and unless adequate  funds  are

provided   to  enable  the  department  to   employ

professional personnel, the work of the  department

may tend to become merely palliative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa is correct in saying that

the   existing  rates  of  public  assistance  have

remained unchanged since 1962. But he will no doubt

agree  with  me that the years subsequent  to  1962

have been rather difficult years for the Government

and that it is only now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



that  our  economy  has entered  a  more  promising

phase,  although we are by no means totally out  of

the wood yet. It is true that the existing rates of

public assistance are on the low side, but I should

mention  that, in addition to the public assistance

allowance, a disability allowance of $10 per  month

is  payable  to  the  head of a  household  who  is

certified as permanently disabled and incapable  of

engaging in gainful employment. Bus fares are  also

given to recipients who have to attend hospital for

medical  treatment. Supplementary payments  in  the

form of educational grants, meal subsidies, old-age

allowances,   funeral  grants  and  other   special

allowances  may also be made from other  charitable

funds  to needy families, e.g., the Silver  Jubilee

Fund,  the Lee Foundation, etc. The sum of $250,000

provided  for the T.B., treatment allowances  under

subhead   2064  will  be  adequate  to   meet   all

applications  for  assistance under  the  Treatment

Allowances  Scheme. There is no point in  providing

funds  that will not be required during the  coming

year, and it is anticipated that the number of T.B.

cases will continue to decline in the years ahead.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the subhead on assistance to displaced

and  distressed persons, I should explain that this

vote  is utilised to provide emergency cash  relief

to victims of civil calamities and other categories

of  persons  who  may  be placed  in  an  emergency

situation.  It  is  not possible  to  estimate  the

amount  of funds required for such purposes.  Hence

the  provision  of  a token vote of  $10.  Whenever

expenditure  is incurred under this  item,  payment

will,  in  the first instance, be made out  of  the

public  assistance  vote, and should  it  be  found

insufficient, an application will be  made  to  the

Ministry of Finance for supplementary provision.  I

tend to agree with the view expressed by the Member

for  Whampoa  that the poor and the illiterate  are

inarticulate,  and  I  am  glad  to  know  that  he

champions  their cause. My Ministry is not  unaware

of this fact. We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



doing  everything possible to help this segment  of

our  population. There is no doubt as to what needs

to  be  done in respect of social welfare. In fact,

during  the last few years the department has  been

actively engaged not only in consolidating some  of

its  services  but also in expanding  some  of  the

existing services, as well as introducing new ones.

It  will  be tedious for me to enumerate the  whole

list of improvements that have been made during the

past  few  years. Suffice it for me to give  a  few

examples  of improvements that will take  place  in

the coming financial year to illustrate my point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Woodlands Home for the Aged is currently

being extended with the construction of a  few

dormitories  and  dining  halls.   This   will

increase  the bed capacity in this  home  from 500 to 704.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Junior Approved School and Remand Home,

when   completed  in  mid-1971,  will  provide

accommodation and training facilities for  112

young offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Jurong Town Creche, when completed in mid-1971, will cater for 120 children of working

parents. The Fostering Scheme for Infants  and

Children  will  be expanded to  take  in  more

babies  and children who are in need of foster

care.   The  provision  for  this   has   been

increased from $107,000 to $114,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Rent subsidy for Malay families affected by

urban   redevelopment  will  be  paid  to   an

increased  number of families.  The  provision

for  this  has been increased from $35,000  to $80,000.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I was told that the people

is true or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not

been changed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Will the Parliamentary

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

for  his very satisfactory answer. I am also  happy

for  all  the poor people in Singapore. In view  of

that, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1003 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the point I am raising here is a

comparatively minor one, nevertheless  I  think  it

worth while to take up the time of the House as  it

concerns  the  dignity of the  House.  If  what  we

discuss  here  concerning the  various  aspects  of

Government  administration  is  not  to  be   taken

seriously  by  the  departments concerned,  then  I

think  we are making a mockery of the parliamentary

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During last year's debate, I drew the attention

of  the  House to the late publication of the  Fire

Brigade  Annual Report for the year 1967,  and  the

Minister in reply said that he regretted very  much

that  it  had come out two years late. He  promised

that  something  would be done immediately.  Up  to

date  we still have not got the report for the year

1968. We are not only two years late but more  than

two   years  behind  time!  I  hope  this  is   not

characteristic of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



the  manner  in which the Fire Brigade responds  to

fire  alarms.  I would appreciate some  explanation

from the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

this  is  the  only department where  the  personal

emoluments have been decreased by $7,090,  although

four new posts have been created. The Memorandum on

the  Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure  for  the

financial year 1971-72 states that this is  because

variable  and special allowances have decreased  by

$147,290.  What  are  these  variable  and  special

allowances and why have they been withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard of many resignations from the Fire

Brigade.  Does  the  Minister not  think  that  the

removal of existing allowances enjoyed by the  Fire

Brigade  personnel could lead to more resignations,

and  does  he  not find it difficult  to  fill  the

vacancies caused? It is also known that there is  a

lack  of response to filling them. Can the Minister

confirm  or  deny  that  this  is  because  of  the

unsatisfactory working conditions and perhaps  also

because of the unrealistic salaries offered?  Since

a  commission  has  been set up to  look  into  the

salaries  of our Police Force, will the  Government

not  set  up  a  commission also to look  into  the

salary structure and working conditions of our Fire

Brigade personnel?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with

reference to the question put up by the Member  for

Jalan  Kayu,  I  remember that at the  last  budget

session   he  raised  the  question  of  the   late

publication of the Fire Brigade Annual Reports, and

I   said  that  I  would  look  into  it.  For  the

information of the House, the 1968 and 1969  Annual

Reports  were  published in January 1970  and  July

1970  respectively.  I am also  pleased  to  inform

Members  of  the House that the 1970 Annual  Report

has  been  completed  in draft  form  and  will  be

published   shortly.   I   hope   the   answer   is

satisfactory to the Member for Jalan Kayu.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Telok

Blangah,  there is no question at all of a decrease

in  the personal emoluments of the Fire Brigade. In

fact,  there  has  been  some  reorganisation   and

expansion and the provision of more senior staff to

meet  the  needs  of industry and fire  prevention.

Although  we  have some vacancies  in  the  various

categories of officers and firemen, this is not due

to  the  poor  conditions of work  or  salary,  but

because   the   private   sector   offers    better

emoluments.  We  find  very  few  people  who   are

interested in joining the Singapore Fire Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the variable allowances given to the

members of the Fire Brigade some years ago,  it  is

true  that the provision for 1971-72 is much less,

for  the simple reason that many staff members  opt

to  accept  the  new  consolidated  salary  scales.

Variable allowance, of course, is not available  to

personnel  who  accept the new consolidated  salary

scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the special allowance, this is in lieu of

the  ration  allowance. Those who joined  the  Fire

Brigade up to the rank of Section Leader before 9th

May,  1961, are eligible for the special allowance.

The  collective agreement that was effective on 9th

May,  1961,  was extended until 1969  when  it  was

renegotiated.  In  1969 it became  effective  as  a

special allowance on the 1st January, 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that the Member raised concerns

the  possibility of reviewing the emoluments of the

staff of the Fire Brigade Department. This is being

done,  and  it  is hoped that the  review  will  be

completed in the near future.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my

amendment,  I would like to clarify a small  point.

As  far  as I am concerned, I cannot recall  having

received  the  Annual Reports of the  Fire  Brigade

Department  for the two years 1968 and 1969.  These

Reports  are  also not available in the  Parliament

Library. According to the Library records, the last

report received from

later   reports  have  since  been   presented   to

Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, usually copies of these

reports  are sent direct by the Government  Printer

to  the  various Government departments. Anyway,  I

will inquire whether or not copies of the 1968  and

<br><br>1969&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports  have  been sent to  the  Library  of

Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I beg leave to withdraw, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1004 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will agree with me that the standard

of  furniture  and other woodwork produced  by  the

Prison  Industries is considerably high.  Will  the

Minister consider setting up a permanent office and

showroom  in  the city area in order  to  push  the

sales of its products vigorously?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nearly $l 1/2 million, which is a large sum of

money,  will  be spent in the ensuing year,  and  I

think  it  will be a good idea if we can  get  back

some money from the sale of the goods. I wonder  if

the Minister will consider my suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

problem at all in the sale of goods produced by the

Prison  Industries.  I agree with  the  Member  for

Changi  that the goods are of good quality. At  the

moment,  we  have  a  showroom  in  Changi  in  the

precinct  of the Prisons, which I am told  is  very

well  patronised.  At present the  goods  are  also

displayed at the showroom of the Singapore  Council

of  Social Service at Penang Lane. This provides an

additional  sales outlet for the goods produced  by

the Prison Industries, So there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



is  no  need  for  another  sales  centre,  as  the

showroom  at Penang Lane is big enough  to  display

the products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the House -if you will

allow  me  to take a little more time,  Sir  -  the

gross income derived by the Prison Industries  over

the last three years is:

<pre>

             1968          $759,000

             1969          $811,000

             1970          $904,000

</pre>



We  can  see  that  the income is increasing  every

year, and this is a good sign.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the

Minister for Health the annual number

of admissions into WoodBridge Hospital

for the years 1968 to 1970; and the

annual number of psychiatric cases

treated as out-patients in the varous

out-patient clinics, where such treatement

is available, during those years; and if

such data could be given according to

categories of mental illnesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a Speacial Referral Clinic

is held at Thomson Road General Hospital

on Friday afternoons for referral

of hospital patients only. A Referral Clinic

was held in Outram Road General Hospital

up to April, 1970, but was

dicontinued due to the Clinic being

utilised for the Medical Officer i/c Officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis of the attendances according

to categories of mental illnesses in respect

of patients admitted to WoodBridge Hospital

for 1969 is shown below and the figures are

about the same for the other two years:



<pre>

                             Percentage



Schizophrenia                   60.0

Manic and Depressive Illness    10.1

      (excluding reative)

Dementia due to old age          6.5

Alcoholic psychosis              1.7

Neurosis                         1.4

Personality Disorders            2.6

Metal Defective Epileptic        6.2

Epileptic                        1.6

Other Organic Psychosis          9.9

                               -----

                               100.0

                               =====

</pre>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to give a break-down of

the categories of mental illnesses seen in the

Outpatient Clinics, although it is likely to

be the same as that of patients admitted to

Woodbridge Hospital except for the lower

incidence of mental defectives and dementia due to

old age.
