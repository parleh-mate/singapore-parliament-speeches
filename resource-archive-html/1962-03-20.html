<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL UNREST</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Amendment [19th March, 1962] to Question [16th  March,

1962],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House views with grave concern the

mounting  of  industrial  unrest  and  calls  on   the

Government  to  take all reasonable  steps  to  ensure

industrial peace with justice in the interests of  the

economic well-being of the people of Singapore.".-(Tun Lim Yew Hock).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To leave out from "unrest" to the end and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"by pro-Communist political agitators for political

ends  and  calls  on  the  Government  to  take   all

reasonable  steps  to  ensure industrial  peace  with

justice  in the interests of industrial expansion  so

vital  to  the economic well-being of the  people  of

Singapore   and   to   prevent   genuine   industrial

grievances   from  being  exploited   for   Communist

ends".'-(The Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for Labour-Mr Wee Toon Boon).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to

be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, as I said yesterday, the Party in  power

moved  the  amendment  with two  objectives  in  mind:

first,  to shirk its responsibility for the industrial

unrest and to put the blame on other people because it

came about as a result of the dictatorial attitude  of

the  Government;  and second, to threaten  unions  and

organisations so that the leaders of the workers  will

not  be  able to protect the interests of the workers.

In  this  way, the Government will be able, by  taking

advantage  of  intimidation  and  other  excuses,   to

achieve their aim of suppressing the working class and

their organisations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point that the arguments in favour of the

amendment cannot stand because the amendment reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House views with grave concern the

mounting   of   industrial  unrest  by   pro-Communist

political agitators for political ends...'.



<br><br>I  feel  that  the  insertion of these  words  is  not

reasonable  and  cannot stand up to any  argument.  In

this  connection, I would like to quote  the  Minister

for  Health  and  Law  when  he  said  yesterday  that

industrial  unrest was not unique to Singapore.  I  am

now quoting from yesterday's Sin Chew Jit Poh in which

the  Minister is reported to have said that industrial

unrest was not unique to Singapore. He went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is industrial unrest even in all

industrialised  countries in the  world.  In  England,

civil   servants,  traditional  moderates  and   trade

Unionists  are  now in the frontline o the  industrial

battle  because the Government had rejected  the  wage

claims  to  offset inflationary pressures and  adverse

balance  of payments. The industrial strife in England

came about as a result of the industrial struggle.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, this paragraph of his is enough  to

explain  that  the  arguments  put  forward   by   the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the  Minister  for  Labour

cannot  stand. From this, we can see that liars cannot

always explain things away.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Has the hon. Member alleged that

the  Parliamentary  Secretary or any  Member  of  this

House  is  a  liar?  If he has, he must  withdraw  the

expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I must thank you for your directive and I withdraw the

term "liar". But I say that the people who put forward

such  arguments  are really unreasonable  people.  For

example,  the Minister said that industrial unrest  is

not   unique   to   Singapore  but  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  said that industrial unrest has come  about

as  a result of the trouble created by the Communists.

From this we can see that the arguments put forward by

both  the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary  on

the  same  day  were contradictory. I  would  like  to

remind  Members  of  the  Government  that  industrial

unrest has come about as a result of the irresponsible

and  dictatorial  attitude of the Government.  We  can

therefore draw the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



inference that the Government are trying to  make  use

of  the  amendment to deal a blow at  their  political

opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to acquaint you with

certain  facts  to  prove why their  arguments  cannot

stand. For example, they talk about Mr Fong Swee Suan

as  a  man  who  rose in life with a  good  reputation

because of his connection with the Bus Workers  Union.

In  the eyes of the Government, Mr Fong Swee Suan  is

now  a  Communist and the Bus Workers Union is  now  a

Communist organisation. But we can see that for a long

time  now  the Bus Workers Union have not started  any

trouble to inconvenience the people of Singapore.  All

these facts go to show that it is false and untrue  to

say that industrial unrest is generally as a result of

agitation  by  the  Communists.  They  also  show  how

irresponsible the Government are in respect of strikes

and industrial unrest. Their argument is that anything

that  goes  wrong  in the industrial field  should  be

attributed to the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Labour was not speaking the truth

when  he said - I am quoting from a newspaper - that there

were  about 116 strikes between 1961 and 1962 of which

96  strikes  were  started by the  Singapore  Business

Houses  Employees Union and the other strikes  by  the

non-P.A.P, unions.  He also said  that  most  of  the

strikes   were   started  by  the  Singapore   General

Employees Union. His statement is not correct  because

he tried to describe these organisations and unions as

pro-Communist  and  open front  organisations  of  the

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this reasoning is really illogical

because the S.G.E.U. and the S.B.H.E.U. are interested

in  a  very wide range of workers. These organisations

take into consideration the interests of thousands  of

workers. There are many, many workers who are  members

of   these   two  unions.  Now  if  the   people   are

dissatisfied with their employers, they will certainly

organise themselves to fight against injustice. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



will  take the City Council strike as an example.  The

Daily-Rated  Employees. Union was confronted  with  an

unreasonable  employer and so there was a  strike.  I

feel  that  the  leaders  of  the  S.G.E.U.  and  the

S.B.H.E.U. are  sensible and, reasonable  people  and

that  is  why  they are able to deal  with  industrial

disputes in a peaceful manner with the minimum  number

of strikes involving so many people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Labour also said - this is

also  reported  in the newspapers - that the  Communist-controlled  unions and the non-Communist  unions  were

different  in their attitude towards the  workers  and

that  non-Communist  unions were  more  reasonable  in

their  attitude when dealing with industrial  disputes

but   that  the  Communist-controlled  unions,   which

include   the   S.B.H.E.U. and  the  S.G.E.U.,   were

unreasonable.  I say that the Parliamentary  Secretary

to the Minister for Labour was quite malicious when he

made this allegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see from political history that whenever

there are any new developments in a country, they  are

always  described as bad. For example, when the P.A.P.

was not yet in power, the Lim Yew Hock Government used

to  describe it as Communist-controlled. And  now  the

P.A.P. is resorting to the same tactics used  by  the

previous Government, that is to say, anything that  is

started as new should be oppressed and suppressed, and

a  smear campaign should be started against it.  So  I

say that this argument is illogical and unreasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Parliamentary Secretary said yesterday

that   pro-Communist  unions  very  often  made  Press

statements accusing the Government of using the police

against  strikes.  He  also  said  that  non-Communist

unions were quite different from pro-Communist unions.

Is there any reasoning in his argument? I say there is

none  because if the workers go on strike and  if  the

Government  is  aware of its responsibility,  then  it

should not use the police against the workers. If that

had been the actual case, then there would have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



been  no need whatsoever for the unions to issue Press

statements against the Government for using the police

on  the  workers.  Now,  if  the  Government  had  not

resorted  to police action, such statements would  not

have been made against the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, actually I have a lot to say about

this  motion and the amendment, but I feel that  other

colleagues  of mine will further explain  this  point,

and I am not going to speak any more.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is there any other Member who wishes to

speak on the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> On the amendment, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br>2.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears

strange  to me that a motion introduced by  me  on  an

important  issue couched in plain and simple language,

free  from  high-sounding  and  ambiguous  words,  has

brought  forth two amendments, both as wide  apart  as

two opposing forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this House to view with grave concern the

mounting  of industrial unrest. The Member for  Anson,

by  his  proposed amendment which was speedily knocked

out   yesterday,   attempted  to   distort   a   truly

disgraceful    situation   into    something    highly

praiseworthy.  And now the P.A.P. Government,  by  the

amendment  proposed by the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the Minister for Labour, is saying that the same truly

disgraceful  situation  is something  for  which  they

should not be held responsible, although it is fond of

claiming  that it is a strong, responsible Government,

dedicated to serve the best interests of the people of

Singapore.  I  say  there  has  been  a  mounting   of

industrial  unrest. The Government  says,  "Yes,  yes,

quite  true.  There has been a mounting of  industrial

unrest.  But all this industrial unrest is  caused  by

pro-Communist political agitators for political ends."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a responsible Opposition which has the

sacred  duty  of looking after the well-being  of  the

people  of Singapore, it behoves us not to play  party

politics in a matter that means life and death to  the

economic  well-being of the people of  Singapore.  The

Government  has  made a very serious  charge.  Let  us

examine  that  charge,  not as an  opposing  political

Party  out  to  down the P.A.P., but as a  responsible

Opposition  discharging its sacred duty  in  the  best

interests of the people. Personally, as Chief Minister

in  the  previous Government, and as its Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare who had occasion  to  face  these

forces  now  described by the P.A.P. as  pro-Communist

political  ends  at  a  time when  these  forces  were

glorified by the P.A.P. as their comrades in  arms,  I

am  therefore in a better position than many  in  this

House to pass judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Lim Yew Hock Government fought these forces

openly  and squarely facing up to its responsibilities

as  a Government and guided by only one principle - that

the  security and well-being of the people is  greater

than  the  survival of a political Party.  We  fought,

because   we  wanted  security  for  the   people   of

Singapore.  We preserved the well-being of the  people

of  Singapore, but we lost in the general elections in

1959.  And how and why did we lose, Sir? It is because

these   leaders   who   form  the  Government   today,

unashamedly,  as disclosed in ,the 12  Confessions  of

the  Prime  Minister  over Radio  Singapore  recently,

joined  forces with these mischief makers and  bluffed

their  way  to power in 1959. I could quote  instances

upon  instances  of the treachery  of  the  P.A.P. in

selling  out the interests of the people of  Singapore

to  achieve  their own political ends, but  I  do  not

propose  to  do  so because the people  now  know  the

P.A.P. for what they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of Mr Lim Ching Siong. He was a

Member  of  this  Assembly and yet the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government  had the courage, in the best interests  of

the  people  of  Singapore, to arrest and  detain  him

under the P.P.S.O. because he was found to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



closely involved in the 1956 riots. And the abuse  and

harsh words heaped upon me by the Prime Minister  when

he  was  on  this side of the House can  be  found  in

Hansard, and I need not quote them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. won the 1959 elections, but it

refused  to  take  office until  it  had  secured  the

release  of Mr Lim Ching Siong and his group of  top-notchers.  Not content with their release, the  P.A.P.

Government appointed Mr Lim Ching Siong and his group

of top-notchers to be Political Secretaries - handsomely

paid  at  $1,100  a  month each out of  public  funds.

Moreover, it appointed this group - Mr Lim Ching  Siong

and  his top-notchers - as Assistant Secretaries in  the

T.U.C. - Ten  Tall Men (tall indeed) - because they  hoped

that in this way through the T.U.C. they could capture

the trade unions in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we see today, Sir? Comrades have at long

last  fallen  out,  anti Mr Lim Ching  Siong  is  now

described, in the words of the Prime Minister, as  the

most   important  open  front  Communist   leader   in

Singapore. The amendment proposed by the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Labour would  make  it

that all the industrial unrest is due to Mr Lim Ching

Siong   and  his  group,  and  that  this   group   is

responsible for the mounting of industrial unrest.  In

other  words. Sir, it is now openly admitted  in  this

House that the group that caused the industrial unrest

at  the  time of the previous Government is  the  same

group that is causing the industrial unrest today. The

previous  Government fought them and  contained  them.

The  present  Government released  them;  worked  with

them; accused them; but did nothing about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these facts, Sir, the public can form their own

estimation  of the standard of political morality,  of

political  integrity,  and of public  conduct  of  the

previous and the present Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by the amendment proposed by the Government, it

would  seem that they are putting the blame  for  this

industrial unrest on pro-Communist political agitators

for  political ends, instead of trying to search their

conscience and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



find out who are the real culprits. I say, and I speak

from  experience,  that the pro-Communistic  political

agitators are involved in this industrial unrest.  And

I  say too that the Government is not free from blame.

Having tried to get them to work for them, having done

all  they  could to get them to be on their side,  and

having  used them to achieve their own political  ends

during  the last general elections, they are no  doubt

in  a  better position than I ant to see and  to  know

that  these forces are out to destroy them,  now  that

they  are  no  longer  with them.  But  what  did  the

Government do? Just for the Prime Minister to stand up

here and say, "Oh, we know all that. All these strikes

are  political strikes for political purposes - ha, ha!"

And that is that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> What

would you do?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I did the right thing that a

responsible Government did. If they can he  found  and

can  be  proved to damage the security and  the  well-being  of  the people of Singapore, and  that  is  the

first  sacred  task of any Government, the  Government

should not shirk its responsibility. Do not just  say,

`Ha,   ha,   yes,   politics,  Communist,   Communist,

Communist'  and do nothing about it in  this  way  the

Government  are doing more damage to the security  and

the  economic well-being of Singapore. Is it  expected

of foreign industrialists to want to come to Singapore

when  the Government itself says, `There are Communist

political agitators.'



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Nature will take its course!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They know, of course, that the

reason why they are playing this game is that to  them

the  survival  of  the  P.A.P. is  greater  than  the

interest of the people of Singapore. But I say this to

them here, as I have said before, and I repeat it, the

P.A.P. is  dead, and no kind of political maneuvering

will  make it live again. Its funeral day will be  the

general election day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Whose?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Let us see whether the P.A.P. is

free  from  any  blame. It was said in this  House  of

Communist  front trade unions, and how they  described

the  other  group  as  the non-Communist  front  trade

unions. Why cannot the Government come out openly  and

say,  there is one group, the Barisan group, and there

is  the  other group, the P.A.P. group, and  there  is

keen  rivalry  in  the trade union  field  today;  and

because of this keen rivalry and their attempt to  try

to  prove  to  the workers of Singapore that  each  is

better  than  the  other,  there  is  this  industrial

unrest.  When  it  was found that the Business  Houses

Employees Union had to go on strike because  of  their

failure  to achieve their object through negotiations,

the  Bank  Employees Union would stage something  too.

What is this? This competition that is doing damage to

the   economy  of  Singapore  is  nothing   but   open

competition.  What  is  the use  of  saying  that  the

Barisan  unions had called 69 out of the  96  strikes?

What   about  the  balance?  There  were  27   strikes

organised by the P.A.P. group of unions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You are not competing, are you?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> As a man who has been in the trade

union  field  for years and as a man who believes  in,

works  and strives for and is prepared to die for  the

interest  of  the people of Singapore, I  say  that  a

political   Party  must  not  make  use  of   workers'

organisations  to  achieve its own political  ends.  I

have not done it. That is why I have not come out into

the trade union field.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What about the old T.U.C.?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The old T.U.C. Laughable, Sir! It

was   the  old  T.U.C. that  made  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Culture the  Secretary-General  in  order  to show to the world  and  to  the

workers  of Singapore that there should be no politics

in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



T.U.C.  And  quite rightly. A strong P.A.P. supporter

was made the Secretary-General of an organisation that

has  been  labelled  a Lim Yew Hock organisation.  But

look  at  the  P.A.P.  T.U.C.  There  are  P.A.P. men

everywhere. Every kind of man - tall men, short  men - is

in  the  P.A.P, and because there has been a  break-up

between  the  Barisan and the P.A.P.,  the  Secretary-General   of  the  T.U.C. says,  "Oh,  Mr  Minister,

dissolve  the  T.U.C.". And the Minister  says,  "Yes,

dissolve  it."  And  yet we are told  today  that  the

T.U.C. is still a registered trade union. What is  all

this?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I know the Member for Cairnhill

was jockeyed into the last part of the speech, but  we

are  now  on the amendment. Let us try and dispose  of

the amendment because it seems to me that if we go  on

this  strain we will have overlapping. Let us  dispose

of  the  amendment  and then, if it  is  carried,  the

debate can go on to the motion as amended.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, that little bit that I have

said about the T.U.C. is a very clear illustration  of

the attempt of the P.A.P. to try and capture the trade

unions  for their own political ends. They have failed

miserably  and  now  they  are  accusing  the  Barisan

Sosialis   and  suggesting  that  these  pro-Communist

political agitators are creating industrial unrest for

political  ends. In other words, what they have  done,

what  they  are  prepared to do, what they  are  still

prepared to do is all right, so long as it is done  by

them.  But  if it is done by somebody else,  they  say

"pro-communist political agitators". That is  not  the

way  to  run a government. The Government is there  to

look  after  the  best  interest  of  the  people   of

Singapore; not one group against the other group! That

would  be wrong. That would bring unhappiness  to  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go to the other side, the previous speaker

and  other speakers of the Barisan Sosialis said, "Now

the   P.A.P. is  behaving  like  the  Lim  Yew   Hock

Government." All I can say is, "God forbid!"  We  will

have  nothing to do with the P.A.P. We hope the P.A.P.

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



learning  the  error of its ways and  is  prepared  to

admit   the  error  of  its  ways.  As  a  responsible

Opposition, we are only guided by one principle.  That

is  the well-being of the people of Singapore. If  the

Government  is out to discharge its duties responsibly

and   courageously,  a  responsible  Opposition   must

support  and must not try and play politics.  All  the

Barisan   Sosialis  Members  who  have  spoken   said,

"Repressive  measures.  Look  at  the  Lim  Yew   Hock

Government.  What did it do? They arrested  the  trade

union  leaders  and  put  them  in  gaol!"  They  were

speaking  out  of  ignorance.  The  people  who   were

arrested were people who were found to be indulging in

subversive  activities and because  there  was  proof,

these people were detained. The Barisan Sosialis  were

on  that side before they left and came to this  side.

And  the P.A.P. Government, as a government, of course

had  to consider the security of the country. The fact

that   there  are  today  still  some  detainees - those

detained by me - is sufficient evidence that what I  did

was  right and could not be wrong. I do not  say  that

the  P.A.P. is wrong in still detaining them.  I  say

that   it   is   the  responsibility  of  an   elected

Government,  even if it were to be a Barisan  form  of

government, to look after the security of the country,

and  in  the  discharge of that duty,  unpleasant  and

unpopular things have to be done. They have to be done

if  the  Government  wants  to  claim  that  it  is  a

responsible and strong Government meant to look  after

the  interest  of  the workers. Some  Members  of  the

Barisan Sosialis behind me said, "Look at the Lim  Yew

Hock  Government. They arrested trade union  leaders."

They  were arrested not because they were trade  union

leaders  working  in  the  trade  unions.  They   were

arrested because of their other activities which  were

of a subversive character and damaging to the security

and  well-being of the people of Singapore. They  said

the Lim Yew Hock Government closed down the unions. As

far  as  I  can remember, Sir - in fact, I had  hoped  I

would  have  the  time to go through Hansard - the  only

union  that  I  dissolved was  the  Shop  and  Factory

Workers' Union led by Mr Lim Ching Siong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



That union was dissolved because $120,000 of its funds

simply  disappeared. As a Government, we had  to  take

action  against  the people who were using  legitimate

trade  union  funds  for  their  own  political  ends.

$120,000  disappeared! I do not know where. I  do  not

think  even the Prime Minister, although he  was  very

closely connected with that union, knows where it  has

gone to. That was the only union we closed down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come to the P.A.P. at the time when the

Barisan was on that side of the House. As soon as they

came  to  power, there were so many unions  closed  by

them.  Registration was withdrawn on the  ground  that

they were yellow, splinter - I do not know what -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

allegation  is  that  they were  closed  down  on  the

grounds that they were Communist-inspired. We are  now

on  the amendment. Will the Member please keep to  the

amendment? I have already suggested that he will  have

an opportunity later on of expanding on this theme. We

are now on the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I have said just now, with

respect, Sir, that it is in reply to the speeches made

on the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That makes no difference at all.

An  irrelevancy  does not excuse another  irrelevancy,

especially if there is an opportunity of answering the

allegations made.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I bow to your ruling, Sir. There

is  a  next and better time. Sir, now coming  to  this

amendment. First, it says industrial unrest is "by pro-Communist  political  agitators for  political  ends".

Sir,  I cannot accept that amendment because it  would

mean that all the industrial unrest is because of pro-Communist political agitators for political ends. That

would  not  be  true  of  the  present  situation   in

Singapore. It is true, and I am prepared to  admit  it

and  accept  the Government's contention,  that  there

have  been  pro-Communist political agitators  in  the

trade union field. But I accuse the Government of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



indulging  in  similar tactics of trying  to  win  the

workers   to   their   side  by  mounting   industrial

agitation.  If one were to go through the  newspapers.

one would find this. Take the case of one known P.A.P.

union,  the  Singapore Manual and  Mercantile  Workers

Union,  a  well-known P.A.P. union, a union  that  was

knocked out in a secret ballot conducted by the Labour

Department; and yet because it is a P.A.P. union,  it

was  allowed  to  call a strike. Take the  Amalgamated

Union of Public Employees too. In the Health Ministry,

a   secret   ballot  was  undertaken  by  the   Labour

Department.  The result showed that the  A.U.P.E. was

not  accepted by the majority of workers in the Health

Ministry, in  so  far as manual  workers  there  were

concerned.  Yet  the  Minister  for  Health  says  the

A.U.P.E. can  collect  subscriptions.  Is   it   not

instigating  pro-Communist political  agitators?  They

say.  "Look  at  this." The Government is  making  the

ground  fertile ion political agitation. We are  happy

that we have not made use of this given Opportunity to

get  the workers out against the Government. As I have

said earlier, a political Party should not, if it  has

any  conscience  at all, try to lead  or  mislead  the

workers to achieve their political ends. Sir, we  then

conic to the last part:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and to prevent genuine industrial grievances from

being exploited for Communist ends.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet-sounding words, Sir, but what do they mean? We

do  not  understand what they mean. If the  Government

will  only  tell us what is meant by that.  If  it  is

meant   that  as  a  result  of  the  present  chaotic

situation in Singapore today, the Government,  in  the

discharge  of  its responsibilities to the  people  of

Singapore, is going to put an end to political strife,

then  say it. We will support it. But do not just  put

in sweet-sounding words and do nothing about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Prime Minister in his radio

broadcasts - his  12  confessions - described  Lim   Ching

Siong  as  the  most  important open  front  communist

leader in Singapore. He kept on repeating it. In fact,

Mr Lim Ching Siong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



receives honourable mention here in this booklet. What

does  all  this  mean?  Does  it  not  mean  that  the

Government is condoning Communism? Does it  not  mean

that as far as the P.A.P. Government is concerned,  it

is  all  right  to  be a Communist,  you  can  receive

honourable  mention  by the Prime  Minister  over  the

radio  and in publications and newspapers? It  is  all

wrong.  If  the  Government  believes  that  Communism

should  be  allowed  in  Singapore  to  compete   with

democratic  forces in a parliamentary democracy,  then

say  so. But do not try to describe anyone as an  open

front Communist leader with ridicule and contempt  and

yet  do  nothing about it. We want to  know  from  the

Government and we want to know it because it has  been

proved  in  this House many and many a time  that  the

P.A.P. sometimes say what they do not mean  and  mean

what  they do not say. We will ask them to say in this

House what is to be achieved by the amendment proposed

by the Parliamentary Secretary. If what is meant by it

is that the Government have now accepted the challenge

and  will  fight it out to preserve the  security  and

economic  well-being of the people  of  Singapore,  we

will  be with them. But if it is just another  way  of

trying to shirk their responsibility and say, "Oh,  it

is  not my fault, not my fault. Communist. Communist,"

then  we  are not going to be a party to this kind  of

mishandling of public interest.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether the Government

are   confident  that  they  are  going  to  win  that

amendment. If they are, then I would suggest  that  we

dispose of the amendment and then when the motion,  as

amended, is put to the House, the Government can still

speak on the same theme. I am only suggesting a method

of saving time.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Victorian  melodrama  consists  of   a

standard  plot enacted by stereotyped characters.  The

central  figure is a villain usually with  a  sinister

moustache  who goes around with diabolical cunning  to

ensnare the innocent heroine into a fate worse than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



death.   His  machinations,  however,  are  inevitably

frustrated  by the timely intervention  of  the  hero.

Stories  of  the  Wild West also run  according  to  a

standard  pattern. The scene of activity is usually  a

small  town in the middle of nowhere. Large tracts  of

scrubland  and  desert surround  this  town  which  is

inhabited  by cowboys, wicked gunmen and,  of  course,

the  inevitable  hero. The populace is  terrorised  by

villainous  gunmen, banks are robbed,  innocent  women

are insulted, and the whole little town is reduced  to

a  state  of impotent terror until it is liberated  by

the  hero  who, after vanquishing the villains,  rides

off  into the sunset as the film fades off in the last

scene.  And  so  Hopalong Cassidy  rides  again.  Sir,

literature and films of this kind cannot be considered

great  literature by any standard. But that  does  not

detract  from  their merits as popular  entertainment.

But  no  one  will  regard cowboy films  or  Victorian

melodrama to be serious attempts to portray the  great

truth  of  human life. It is just not intended  to  be

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I hear the speeches of the Barisan

Sosialis   on  industrial  strife,  I  am  immediately

reminded  of  the  intellectual  standards  of  cowboy

stories and Victorian melodrama. There is exactly  the

same  utter  simplicity  in  stereotyped  roles.   For

villain, read "the wicked employer"; for arch-villain,

read  "the  P.A.P.  Government"; for innocent  heroine

read  "the helpless worker"; and for Hopalong Cassidy,

read  "Barisan Sosialis". It is all so utterly simple.

The  worker  is  oppressed by  wicked  and  avaricious

employers  supported by a villainous Government,  i.e.

the  P.A.P. Government. Unhappily the Barisan Sosialis

have  not  been  as  dextrous as Hopalong  Cassidy  in

disposing  of his adversaries. So from each and  every

one  of  the  speeches of the Barisan Members  emerges

this  grotesque  caricature of what  is  happening  in

Singapore. I venture to suggest that no one except the

most  stupid and idiotic of the Barisan Members  would

believe  in this absolute trash, and yet we have  this

caricature being repeated time after time in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



Assembly, and in the midst of it all, a comedian flits

across the stage to declaim -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Harold Lloyd.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - strikes "What is wrong with

strikes'?  Strikes are good. Strikes  are  normal  for

society.  Every sound democratic nation  has  strikes.

The  more  strikes, the merrier. When I was the  Chief

Minister  we  beat the world record for strikes."  And

yet the same hon. Member, on exactly the same day, had

previously  asked  the Government  why  employment  in

industry had been declining over the last five or  six

years.  In the face of this assault on our sanity,  it

requires  an effort of will to retain one's  sense  of

proportion  and to preserve balance of objectivity  in

approaching this question of industrial disputes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try to put the events during the last 2½

years in proper perspective. Once this perspective has

been  established, then the real significance  of  the

mounting  industrial strife will be plain to everyone.

When  we  formed the Government in 1959,  we  had  the

Communists with us. But we never integrated  into  one

unified   movement.  We  stood  for  an   independent,

democratic, non-Communist Socialist Malaya. They?  The

Communist People's Republic of Malaya. On their  part,

the  Communists  attempted  to  infiltrate  our  Party

organisation    while   maintaining   an    increasing

stranglehold  over  certain  trade  unions,   farmers'

associations  and  sections of the  student  movement.

During the first year of our office, it was clear that

with   the  freedom  they  enjoyed  under  the  P.A.P.

Government, they were able to expand their  influence

and consolidate their position. They always maintained

separate identity as a group from which they attempted

to  manipulate the Government for their own advantage.

By  the  end of 1960, we had arrived at the conclusion

that   this  state  of  affairs  could  not   continue

indefinitely.  The activities of the  Communists  were

motivated  entirely by their own political  ambitions.

While  paying  lip service to Government  policies  in

labour  matters, they always reserved  the  right  of

complete independence of movement and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



action  for  themselves. The basic problem confronting

the   Government,  the  people  and  the  country  was

economic  and industrial expansion. This is  necessary

to  give  jobs to our growing population. But economic

expansion  cannot  take  place  without  stability  in

labour-management  relations,  and  because   of   the

influence of the Communists in important trade unions,

the Government's policy of economic expansion could be

frustrated  at  any  time  the  Communist  wished.  We

therefore  wanted to pin down the Communists  and  the

union leaders to a firm commitment to ensure just  and

stable  relations between labour and management.  That

was  the  purpose of the series of meetings  which  we

held  with  them  and  to which I  referred  when  the

question  of  unemployment insurance was discussed  in

the  Assembly.  We had agreed with Messrs.  Lim  Ching

Siong  and company on the list of industries in  which

industrial stability was to be maintained. This  is  a

very comprehensive list and includes all industries of

any   significance  in  Singapore.  Direct  industrial

action  was  to  be  avoided in  this  sector  of  the

economy.  The  welfare  of  the  workers  was  to   be

safeguarded    by   properly   negotiated    long-term

agreements where the full apparatus of negotiation and

arbitration  was  to  be  applied  should   there   be

differences  of opinion between unions and  employers.

Agreement   was  reached  in  principle  between   the

Communists and us in January 1961. Further discussions

were scheduled to take place on the exact and detailed

manner  in which the proposals in this agreement  were

to be implemented. In this way we hoped to bring about

a relaxation of tension in relations between employers

and trade unions. This would give a decided impetus to

industrialisation. Whether the Communists intended  to

honour  the agreement and work in good faith to  carry

out  their obligations we shall never know. But we had

decided  then that if they did not do so then we  must

part  company  with  them on this issue.  However,  as

events  turned out, we never reached this  stage.  The

Hong  Lim  by-election intervened and after  that  the

Anson  by-election. In the course of this  latter  by-election, as everybody knows,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



the  Communists  and  the P.A.P. parted  company.  We

wanted  to pursue merger with Malaya as vigorously  as

possible. The Communists, on the other hand, wanted to

pursue the anti-colonial struggle, but pursue it in  a

very odd way which I, for one, cannot understand. They

wanted to fight the colonialists not by getting rid of

them by independence for Singapore through merger, but

by  demanding that they remain in Singapore. In  other

words,  they wanted British sovereignty to  remain  in

Singapore which should be satisfied with internal self-government with, of course, internal security  in  the

hands  of the Government. Their stand, of course,  has

led  them  to an impossible contradiction  which  they

cannot resolve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After their break with the P.A.P., the Communists

decided to attack the Government with all the means at

their disposal. I have already described these attacks

in detail and I only wish to refer to them in passing.

First,  there  was  a  direct  assault  on  the  Party

organisation  and  on  Assemblymen  and  Parliamentary

Secretaries  of the Party. Here they achieved  notable

success  as  evidenced by the 13  Members  across  the

Floor.  They  then proceeded to attack the  Government

through   other   channels,  such  as   the   People's

Association,  the  Work  Brigade,  the  middle  school

students  and  the  City Council daily-rated  workers.

They  even attempted to manipulate the Chinese Chamber

of  Commerce. But in all these attempts,  they  failed

disastrously. The result of their effort was merely to

bring  misfortune upon those people who  were  foolish

enough  to believe them. Some 160 former employees  of

the People's Association have lost a useful career and

are  now  unemployed. 500 young men and women  in  the

Work Brigade for whom we tried to find useful work are

now  without  any  hope. Another 800 misguided  middle

school  students have wasted a year's effort in  their

futile  and  unsuccessful boycott of the  examinations

last  year. So in all, 1,400 young men and women  have

been  sacrificed.  In  the meantime,  of  course,  the

Communists   were   stepping  up  agitation   on   the

industrial front. Strikes were called before the  full

process  of  negotiation  and  conciliation  had  been

exhausted. What was the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



net result of all this? Eventually the workers had  to

settle  on  terms hardly better than those offered  by

the employers at the beginning. So here again, tens of

thousands  of workers have been sacrificed. They  have

lost  many  weeks  or  many months  of  wages  through

unnecessary  strikes which brought them little  or  no

benefit  over  what they could have  obtained  without

these   strikes.   My  colleagues,  who   are   better

acquainted  with  the details of these  strikes,  will

inform the Assembly of just how the workers have  been

cheated in these strikes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one, least of all the P.A.P., will condemn

all  strikes  out  of hand. A strike  is  a  necessary

weapon  of  the  working class so long  as  there  are

stubborn  and unreasonable employers. But the ultimate

justification for a strike are the benefits  that  the

workers  get  from such a strike. The Communists  will

disagree with this criterion. They believe - though they

may  not say so openly - that a strike is justified even

if the workers lose by it provided the fighting spirit

of  the workers is heightened thereby, that is to say,

that  more hatred is generated which they can  exploit

to  strengthen their stranglehold upon the  unions.  I

suggest  that  this  is  a  purely  selfish  political

objective  intended to advance not the livelihood  and

the interest of the workers but the political power of

the  Communist open front organisations. By  the  test

which  I  have described, that is, whether the workers

have  obtained  improved  conditions  sufficiently  to

justify  the  loss of income during the  strikes,  the

strikes which the Communists have mounted in the  last

7  or  8  months have not been in the interest of  the

workers. All the evidence points to the fact that  the

workers  could  have  got as much,  if  not  more,  by

negotiation, conciliation and arbitration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another way in which workers suffer in

strikes. And in this respect, the loss is more serious

than the direct loss of an unsuccessful or unnecessary

strike. This loss results from the serious check which

industrial  strife  applies  to  the  growth  of   new

industries. I have already stated on my recent  return

from  Japan  that  the  industrialists  in  Japan  and

Hongkong who are contemplating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



the  investment  of  capital  in  new  industries   in

Singapore  are  seriously  disturbed  by  the   labour

situation  here.  I  have yet to  receive  intelligent

comment  on this from the Communists and their stooges

in  the  Barisan  Sosialis. Everybody knows  that  the

Government  is mounting the maximum effort  to  create

new  industries. The range of inducements which we are

offering  to  new enterprises is without  parallel  in

this  part of the world. Let us not forget that  there

is  keen  competition  all over Asia  to  attract  new

industries.  Unless  we can offer  better  terms  than

others,  we  are not going to get new industries.  The

Government has done its utmost, and if the result  has

not  been  as  gratifying as the people  of  Singapore

would  wish, then the blame rests on those trade union

leaders  who  mount industrial strikes  for  political

reasons. The blame rests fairly and squarely on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say this to the growing army of

Singapore's   unemployed.  New   industries   can   be

established in Singapore which can give you good  jobs

with good pay. If they are not coming fast enough, you

are  entitled to know why. You should try to  get  the

answer  from  Mr Lim Ching Siong and his  accomplices

who  are  stirring  up  trouble  and  tension  between

workers  and  employers. And you will continue  to  be

unemployed  so long as these men continue  with  their

mischievous and anti-social activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the Government's

amendment to the motion is twofold. First, it seeks to

expose  the  political basis of the Communist-inspired

industrial  unrest in Singapore. Second, it  seeks  to

show  the direct loss suffered by workers and the even

greater  loss  to those deprived of a decent  hope  of

early employment as a result of industrial unrest. Men

who  deliberately  stir up unrest for  political  ends

deserve the strongest condemnation, as also those  who

try  to conceal their mischief by various pretexts and

pretences.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  today  we have heard  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  and  the  Minister  for  Finance  and   the

conclusion we can arrive at is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



that  they  are  playing the same  tune  on  different

instruments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill accused the Government of

not  facing up to its responsibilities in dealing with

those leaders it terms as pro-Communist and in closing

down  the  so-called pro-Communist trade  unions.  The

Minister for Finance said that if Mr Lim Ching Siong,

the  leader of the Communist front organisations, were

allowed  to  carry on, then Singapore could  not  have

industrialisation and the unemployment situation could

not he resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, we can clearly see from the speech

of  the Member for Cairnhill that he is trying to  ask

the  government to take drastic measures to deal  with

those  trade union leaders who are really working  for

the  interest of the workers. Actually the  Government

should  have the courage to shoulder this trade  union

work.  But according to the Minister for Finance,  the

Government  is willing to shoulder this responsibility

but  not  alone  by  itself. According  the  him,  the

responsibility   for  taking  such  drastic   measures

against the so-called pro-Communist elements should be

shouldered by the whole Assembly and not by  the  PAP.

Government  alone. It was because  of  this  that  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour put

forward this amendment to the motion before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past and also at present, the P.A.P. have

been saying and are still saying that they are for the

workers. But now the question of the true struggle for

the workers has been termed by them as a, kind of pro-Communist struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the workers of Singapore and their

organisations have been termed pro-Communist and their

activities  have been termed pro-Communist activities:

We are not hearing such accusations for the first time

today.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> It is

true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Why should a pro-workers' Government like the P.A.P. Government

describe  such  genuine trade unions and organisations

as pro-Communist?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one logic of the P.A.P. Government

is  this: if there is no P.A.P., then there will be no

Government; if there is no Government, then there will

be  no  trade  unions. In other words, if these  trade

unions want to continue existing, then they must  kow-tow to the leadership of the P.A.P. If they do not toe

the line of the P.A.P., then the P.A.P. will think  of

various  methods  to inflict a deadly  blow  on  these

trade  unions.  In  order to implement  this  kind  of

policy  of  disrupting  and damaging  the  true  trade

unions,  the P.A.P. must find some convincing pretexts

so  that the Press and the people will think that  the

policy of the P.A.P. is correct and justifiable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in carrying out this kind of

subversive  activities, the P.A.P. has  a  very  good

pretext of accusing these genuine trade unions as pro-Communist  trade  unions, because  it  knows  that  it

cannot   call   them   yellow  unions,   because   the

organisation  of such trade unions and  their  leaders

cannot  be made use of by the capitalists, and because

they  cannot  be controlled by the P.A.P. These  trade

unions  are, therefore, sincerely working hard in  the

interests  of  the workers. Therefore, if  the  P.A.P.

wants  to brand them as yellow unions, then the  minds

of  the  people can never be convinced and  they  will

never  believe  such accusations. I can  give  a  very

simple  example.  The  Prime  Minister  mentioned  the

strike  at Ford Company. The Ford workers had been  on

strike  for  110  days.  In the  end  this  industrial

dispute  was  resolved. The demand of the workers  was

met by getting an increase of 6 cents per hour and not

6  cents  per  day as said by the Prime Minister.  And

their  bonus  was also increased by 4 days'  pay  more

than in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to correct certain wrong

information  given by the Government, I  wish  to  say

that  labour  wanted  to  sign longer  contracts  with

capital  but  capital  conceded  to  only  a  two-year

contract. Therefore, we can clearly see that if such a

trade  union is to be accused by the Government  as  a

yellow  union,  then, first and foremost,  members  of

this trade union cannot believe it. The leaders of the

trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



unions are always on the labour side in their struggle

for   the  benefit  of  the  workers.  And  since  the

Government cannot use the label of "yellow  union"  to

destroy  genuine trade unionism, they  therefore  have

resorted to a second method.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has been using

the expression "yellow union". By that, I take it,  he

means "alleged pro-Communist unions". If he does  not,

then  he  is irrelevant to the amendment, if  he  does

mean  "an alleged pro-Communist union", then he is  in

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  I  was  saying was that I did not  mean  that  a

yellow  union is a Communist or a pro-Communist union.

I  was  referring to the P.A.P. because  I  wanted  to

point  out  to you that the P.A.P. has been using  this

kind  of  tactics to break up the unity of the workers

of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind the hon. Member

then  that  we  are  now on the  amendment  which  has

brought in the Communist element. And if he wishes  to

pass  remarks on other aspects of the motion, he  will

have the opportunity when we come to debate the motion

in general.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

was  only  trying  to  prove to you  that  before  the

Government can break up the unity and organisation  of

the  workers,  the Government is trying  to  use  this

label  of  pro-Communist  to  break  up  the  workers'

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present in Singapore in the

field  of trade unionism the workers are more rational

and  intelligent  and the leaders of the  workers  are

more   sober   and  rational  in  all  dealings   with

industrial  disputes. We cannot term  this  industrial

dispute  as pro-Communist and say that these are  pro-Communist  activities. It is entirely  wrong  to  make

such accusations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. now is hoping that

there  will  be  more  industrial  disputes  and  more

strikes, so that in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



future  when  they  want to resort to  the  action  of

selling  out, they will have more pretexts to show  to

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now quote the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Labour who  said  this

yesterday  when  introducing  his  amendment  to   the

motion - I  am  quoting from the Sin  Chew Jit Poh  of

today, page 1 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Parliamentary Secretary said that the Prime

Minister,  in his letter to the Deputy Prime Minister,

had  already pointed out that because three  Political

Secretaries, namely, Lim Ching Siong, Fong  Swee  Suan

and  Wood-hull,  are openly opposing the  Government's

policy of achieving independence through merger,  this

is  causing  the Government serious difficulties.  The

Prime Minister continued to say. "Lim Ching Siong  and

his  friends wilt resort to industrial action, and are

trying  to  use tactics to prevent the Party  and  the

Government from achieving their merger policy."'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, talking about trade union  leaders,

they  can  see  from  this  that  trade  unionism   in

Singapore  in  the  future  will  meet  with   certain

unpleasant  situations, and certain unpleasant  events

will  happen  to  these  leaders.  They  have  already

expected long ago the beginning of this smear and  the

resultant political actions. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  can

therefore  say the leaders of these trade  unions  and

workers,  since  the parting of ways with  the  P.A.P.,

have  now become more sober in dealing with all  trade

union  disputes. The Government is trying to say  that

all  trade  disputes now have been organised  by  pro-Communist  elements. Such an accusation is groundless.

Mr  Speaker. Sir, in order to point out to  you  this

groundless  smear, let me quote what the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for  Labour  said.  I  am

quoting from today's Nanyang Siang Pau:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Parliamentary Secretary said that last year on

the  17th November at the Seiclene Company the workers

blocked  a military truck for five hours from  leaving

the  Company. The strikers under the direction of  Tan

Teck Wah, President of the Singapore General Employees

Union,  prevented the truck from leaving by using  two

vans to block it. Tan Teck Wah ordered the workers  to

do  such things, and to sneer at the police. Later on,

Fong  Swee Suan arrived and persuaded the workers  not

to insult the police. In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



end  the police had to move the two vans away in order

to   let   the  military  truck  leave  the  Company's

compound.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from this we can really see, and

this  speech of his can clearly prove, that the recent

picketing  by the strikers has always been done  in  a

peaceful way. If these trade union leaders had  wanted

to  create confusion, then they could very easily have

created unhappy incidents in such a case. We can  also

come to another conclusion like this. If Mr Fong Swee

Suan, who has been alleged by the Government as having

close  connections  with  the  Communists,  wants   to

achieve the so-called pro-Communist purpose, then  why

should  he  persuade the workers on strike  to  picket

peacefully? [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Member for

Delta that if she wants to intervene, she should stand

up,  and  I am sure the Member for Choa Chu Kang  will

give way to a Lady.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  at  that  time Mr Fong Swee Suan  had  wanted  to

achieve  his political aims, then he could have  asked

Tan  Teck Wah and the strikers to have an incident and

come  in conflict with the police. Why should Mr Fong

Swee  Suan  persuade the leaders of  the  strikers  to

carry out peaceful picketing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from this we can see that if we

blame all the present Singapore industrial disputes as

tactics  by the Communists to achieve their  political

purpose  and  treat  them in  such  a  way,  then  the

Government should bear the consequences for doing  so.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, at the same time, the  Government,

through  this  amendment, have clearly  told  us  what

their  future policy will be in relation to these  so-called  pro-Communist trade unions. The object of  the

Government is not to carry out their past promises  to

unite  the workers, but to label those who shout these

slogans as pro-Communists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very regrettable to hear

that  the  P.A.P. today could have said  such  things.

This  goes  to prove that they are not really  working

for  the  interest  of the workers.  They  are  really

working  for their political interest and to break  up

the  workers'  organisations and their  unity.  But  I

believe  these  workers'  organisations  will  not  he

weakened by Government's smear of pro-Communist or pro-Communist activities, because all along they have been

used  to  such smears being levelled at their  leaders

and their organisations. Therefore, this amendment  of

the  P.A.P. is only presaging what they will do in the

future to deal with genuine trade unions and to  shirk

their  responsibility to this Assembly. Therefore,  we

are here to expose their true face.



<br><br>4.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, Communist tactics the world over are

basically  similar. In their struggle for  power,  the

Communists   invariably  resort  to   exploiting   the

grievances  and  dissatisfaction  of  the  workers  by

posing  as  their  champions, and,  having  won  their

confidence,  to  deceive  and  lead  them  to  violent

collision  with the State. The purpose is  obvious  to

everybody.  That is to stir up hatred against  legally

constituted  authority if it  stands  in  the  way  of

Communist   expansion.  Bearing  this  in  mind,   Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  can understand why  in  any  trade

dispute involving the pro-Communist unions, the normal

peaceful   means  of  negotiation,  conciliation   and

arbitration  are ignored in favour of  direct  action,

more often than not followed by violence. What is  the

result? Misery and suffering to the workers and  their

families  for  the meagre increase in  wages,  if  any

indeed,  if normal peaceful methods were adopted,  the

workers  could gain very much more than direct  action

without  a  great loss and sacrifice  to  the  workers

especially  when there is a pro-labour  Government  in

office.  But  why  do  the pro-Communists  prefer  the

violent  form  of  class struggle to  peaceful  means,

especially if they are made available



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



by  a  pro-labour Government, such as the P.A.P.?  The

answer  is that violent industrial action by the  pro-Communists   is  preferred  because  it   serves   two

purposes.  Firstly,  it  provides  a  recruiting   and

training  ground for pro-Communist cadres. Only  those

cadres  who have been thus steeled in the crucible  of

struggle are acceptable to the Communists. The  second

purpose is that the resulting suffering and misery  of

the  workers as a result of violent direct action will

leave  them  embittered and, by skilful  manipulation,

deceit and false propaganda, the bitterness and hatred

and  suffering  of  the  workers  could  be  exploited

against the State. Of course, the pro-Communists would

not  tell  the  workers that these are  their  genuine

purposes of an avoidable strike. Instead, they seek to

divert the workers' attention by claiming that violent

class struggle is inevitable and exhort the workers to

sacrifice in the violent struggle so as to raise their

political consciousness. Having understood the purpose

of  agitating workers to strike for political ends  we

should  not  be  surprised if  the  pro-Communists  in

Singapore in the last few months have refused to  make

use  of  the  normal channel of peaceful  methods  for

settling  trade disputes and preferred violent  direct

action  which resulted, in many cases, in more  losses

than  gains,  as, for instance, the Ford Motor  strike

and the Shaw Brothers strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion is therefore obvious. The sudden

mounting  of industrial unrest in the last few  months

since  the open break with the pro-Communists in  July

1961  was  more  for political purposes  to  frustrate

merger  and  Malaysia than for the economic betterment

of  the  workers. That also explains why prior to  the

open  break there were relatively few strikes, and  in

most cases peaceful. But after July 1961, there was  a

sudden  increase  of strikes by pro-Communist  unions,

and  in  most  cases violent ones without first  going

through  the  normal channel of peaceful  negotiation.

conciliation and arbitration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when peace is disturbed and

violence and disorder take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



place,  the  police, as guardians of peace and  order,

must  step in to ensure that the life and security  of

the  people are not threatened and the people  can  go

about  in  their  daily pursuit of  earning  a  living

without  danger. This duty of the police unfortunately

conflicts  with  the  aims of  the  pro-Communists  in

mounting strikes for political purposes, and  that  is

the  reason why the police, the disciplined arm of the

State,  must necessarily come under heavy fire of  the

pro-Communists,  be  they in Singapore  or  elsewhere.

Similarly, the laws of the State are another important

target of attack and hatred to the pro-Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I table a copy of the Suara

Kesatuan,  a fortnightly publication of the  Singapore

General  Employees  Union, issue  No.  13  dated  31st

December,  1961. There is no need for  me  to  explain

that  the Singapore General Employees Union is a  pro-Communist union. The picture in this issue illustrates

my  point. The picture on the front page is a  cartoon

of  the Government in the form of a human being  whose

right  hand  held a rifle and the left hand  a  police

baton, and with his right foot armed with laws and his

left foot disciplinary rules, crushing a worker on the

ground.  Is  there anything which speaks more  vividly

the pro-Communist thinking than this cartoon that they

depict  the  police  and  the law  as  instruments  of

oppression  against  the workers, and,  therefore,  as

objects  of resentment and hatred that must  be  swept

aside so that the pro-Communists could have a free run

in   carrying  out  their  intimidation  and  violence

against  those  who  oppose them? All  other  pictures

published  in the front page were specially  taken  to

show  the  police in the act of maintaining peace  and

order  in  all the strike-bound areas where  the  pro-Communist   unions  were  involved.   The   impression

intended  to he conveyed is quite clear to  everybody.

It  is  that the police is an instrument of oppression

against  the  workers, and because the police  is  the

disciplined arm of the State in the maintenance of law

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



order,  therefore,  the  P.A.P.  Government  is  anti-worker. Mr Speaker, Sir, from the speech made by  the

Member for Queenstown, it is obvious to everybody that

the Barisan Sosialis is a Communist front organisation

Out to discredit the legally constituted Government to

further  its anti-nationalist cause. In a colonial  or

semi-colonial   State,  the  police  is   particularly

vulnerable  to  attack  for being  the  instrument  of

oppression.  And  the attack made by  the  Member  for

Queenstown  on  the  police  force  and  the  law   is

therefore  no  surprise, because nothing  could  evoke

public sympathy more than a physical clash between the

police  and the workers and the students. If therefore

the  pro-Communists  in  the  Barisan  Sosialis  could

deceive  the innocent workers through their agents  in

the  unions and manipulate them into a clash with  the

police, then a classic situation will develop with the

Government  being accused of using Fascist methods  on

the one hand and the poor workers as victims of brutal

violence.  In  that  kind  of  situation,   the   pro-Communists  hope that they can whip up resentment  and

hatred amongst the workers and the public against  the

elected Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allegations have been made by the

Member   for   Queenstown  that  the   police   force,

previously   trained  to  oppress  the  students   and

workers,  have been increasingly used by  the  present

Government  against  students and workers,  especially

English-speaking  workers  of  the   Business   Houses

Employees'  Union.  The  Member  for  Queenstown  also

alleged  that  the  police have  been  used  to  break

strikes  and to protect new workers and employers.  If

the  Member  for Queenstown is not speaking  with  his

tongue in his cheek, then he is just repeating  a  set

speech  given  to  him by his masters  like  a  parrot

without  consulting  his own conscience.  Whether  the

police was really trained to oppress the students  and

workers in the past, that is no responsibility of  the

P.A.P. Government. But no sensible person is going  to

take  this fantastic allegation seriously. That I  can

assure.  Although no worker in his right  senses  will

believe that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. Government is against workers, nevertheless, it

is   just   as  well  to  disillusion  the   infantile

politicians in the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we first came to power, we

made  it  a point to re-orientate the outlook  of  the

police. The police were told that they were the public

servants  of the people whose duty it was to safeguard

the  life  and  property  of  the  people.  They  were

however,  to  deal  firmly  with  criminals  and  law-breakers.  In  their dealings with  the  people,  they

should   be  polite  and  tactful.  Their  duties   as

guardians   of  the  people's  economic   and   social

institutions in a self-governing State become all  the

more  heavy than before. The people were told  of  the

role  of  the police and were asked to cooperate  with

them in the maintenance of law and order. Towards this

end,   political  courses  were  arranged  for  police

officers.  Meetings were held where  police  meet  the

people  and  have their role in society  clarified.  I

remember  many  Assemblymen of  the  Barisan  Sosialis

organised  these meetings between the police  and  the

people.  Nobody can fail to see that there  is  a  new

spirit  being instilled into the police.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  Assemblymen were the first to make full  use

of  the  new  spirit of the police until a  difference

over the issue of merger and Malaysia developed in the

Party, culminating in the open break between the  pro-Communists  and  their stooges and  the  non-Communist

P.A.P.  There was not a squeak about Government  using

the  police to oppress the workers. Indeed the efforts

of  the police to be friendly with the workers and  on

the  side  of  the  people  were  appreciated  and  on

occasions  compliments were made  by  the  13  Barisan

Sosialis  Assemblymen opposite. As  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Health and  Law  cited

yesterday,  police protection was even sought  by  the

Singapore  General Employees Union  to  protect  their

members. However, when the open break came, what other

better  means  to  discredit the Government  than  the

classic  Communist target of mounting  hatred  against

the  police and anything connected with the  machinery

of  the  law  and  order which hampers  the  Communist

objective of creating violence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



and   disorder?  The  P.A.P. which  has  consistently

adopted a pro-labour policy could not have been  anti-labour  overnight.  The police has  always  adopted  a

neutral  and impartial attitude in strikes. I wish  to

quote  a  statement issued by the Government  on  15th

January,  1960, showing the attitude of the Government

towards  strikes. A statement was issued  after  there

was  some indication that the police might be made use

of  by  employers or employees in furtherance of their

cause. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Some unscrupulous employers are trying to get the

police involved in industrial disputes with a view  to

creating  illwill  between workers and  police.  In  a

recent case an employer invited a union official for a

discussion at his office and then surreptitiously rang

up  the  police  alleging intimidation  by  the  union

official.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police are duty bound when complaints are

received to make investigations on the spot. But where

the  complaints are frivolous or malicious, the police

are brought into contempt and ridicule and not the ill-intentioned complainant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of the police is to protect and safeguard

the  interests  of the people and maintain  peace  and

good order. The police give orders or take measures to

safeguard  the  interests of the people  and  so  such

orders must be obeyed. The authority of the State must

be  obeyed. The rights and wrongs of the decisions  of

the police are a matter to be argued subsequently in a

calmer  atmosphere before the proper authorities.  For

this  reason,  the  Government  is  prepared  to  deal

sternly with employers who through malice and mischief

seek  to  turn  the  workers against  the  police  and

thereby  to interfere with the Government's instrument

of authority.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this clearly showed how pro-labour

the Government was. Far from the police being used  to

break strikes, the Government even went out of its way

to   dissuade  new  workers  from  being  engaged   by

employers during a `strike although the employers  had

a right to do so. In fact, the police always make it a

point  to consult labour officers and to get a  labour

officer  to explain to the strikers the laws governing

picketing.  But  were  all these  pro-labour  measures

appreciated  by the pro-Communists in the unions?  No.

The  pro-Communist elements in the Singapore  Business

Houses   Employees'  Union  exploited  the  pro-labour

policy  of  Government  to their  own  advantage.  The

impartial  and  friendly attitude of  the  police  was

interpreted to be a sign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



of  weakness, to be exploited to the maximum advantage

for the Communist cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, much as I should like to cite

examples  of the tact and restraint exercised  by  the

police in cases of strikes recently, however, I cannot

do  so  as  most  of the cases are still  sub  judice.

Nevertheless,  the  cases cited by  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Labour yesterday  showed

that  in  every case the police had shown considerable

restraint and tact in the face of intense provocation,

ranging  from jeers and boos to obscene abuse  by  the

pro-Communist  officials. The police  intervened  only

when  violence and disorder resulted or threatened  to

result and that only after repeated warnings had  been

given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the allegations that the police had singled

out  the English-speaking white-collar workers in  the

Singapore   Business  Houses  Employees'   Union   for

attention,  the answer is obvious. The  time  has  not

come  yet for the pro-Communists to mount a final  and

concerted  assault against merger and  Malaysia.  They

are  still  hoping  against hope that  a  miracle  may

happen  to  delay  the  inevitable  reunification   of

Singapore and the Federation. Besides, they think that

the   white-collar  English-speaking  workers  in  the

S.B.H.E.U. are not traditionally connected  with  pro-Communist  activities  and a  little  flexing  of  the

muscles in this field is not likely to receive as much

attention as they would in the traditionally Communist

hot  houses in the S.G.E.U. and its affiliates and the

Rural  Residents' Association and the Country People's

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations have also been made of police using

force  on  students,  and the  Member  for  Queenstown

specially mentioned Chinese school students. Everybody

knows  that  far  from using the  police  against  the

students, the Government went out of its way to ensure

that  no  police were used in the last student boycott

of  the Secondary IV Examination. This, however,  does

not  prevent the pro-Communists from repeating blatant

lies against the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the speech of the Member for

Queenstown revealed the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



classic  tactic of the pro-Communists in  using  their

agents and stooges in the trade unions to deceive  and

egg  on  the  innocent workers to  go  on  strike  for

political purposes and to use illegal methods  in  the

strike, hoping thereby to provoke a clash between  the

police and the workers so that they could exploit  the

sufferings  of  the workers to whip up hatred  against

constituted  authority.  The  Prime  Minister   warned

against  the  mounting of industrial  unrest  by  pro-Communists  in August 1961 when the open  break  came,

and we can look forward in the near future to more  of

these  violent political strikes mounted by  the  pro-Communists  on  the  back of the innocent  workers  in

their  losing battle against the inevitable historical

process  towards  reunification of Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to waste too much of my time in

replying to this man. I suggest that he read  some  of

the speeches his master, the Prime Minister, made when

he  was in the Opposition. I refer to Volume 2 - this is

the   speech  made  by  the  Prime  Minister  on   5th

September, 1956 - column 78. It is in the middle of  the

we have this lack of industrialisation.'



<br><br>I  am  quite certain that if the Minister for  Finance

will take the trouble to read all the speeches made by

the Prime Minister when he was in the Opposition prior

to May 1959, when he was the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



legal  adviser to about 47 trade unions in  Singapore,

he  will find a lot more quotations than this to  show

that  if there is a lack of industrialisation,  it  is

not  because there are Communist agitators, it is  not

because there are militant trade unionists and  it  is

not because there are militant trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure many of us can remember that only

recently in the Straits Times there was an extract  of

a  report  from  a  London newspaper  giving  us  some

statistics about the strikes in Western industrialised

countries  including  Japan. If  I  am  not  mistaken,

according  to  the extract, America  has  the  highest

number  of  strikes.  Sir, I think  the  Minister  for

Finance  will  not be foolish enough to  suggest  that

there is a lack of industrialisation in America. I  am

sure  he would become the worst enemy of the Americans

if  he ever did venture to suggest that. Japan and the

United  Kingdom - countries  that  are  supposed  to  be

progressive  in  the  field of  industrialisation - have

militant  trade  unionists. In  Japan,  the  Communist

Party is recognised and Communist Party officials  are

in  key positions in trade unions, and yet there is no

lack of industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, once again we have in Singapore

people  in  responsible positions taking up the  stand

that  industrial  disputes  are  generated  by  a  few

disgruntled people. Of course, they term these  people

Communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Are they not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> For the information of the Minister for

Culture  and others, I am quite prepared to say  quite

categorically that they are not Communists. Sir, today

the  term "Communist" is being used to refer to  every

Tom,  Dick and Harry who is not a stooge of the P.A.P.

The  P.A.P. thesis is that industrial  disputes  take

place  only because there are Communists. All  others,

with  the  exception of the P.A.P., go about  creating

industrial disputes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one should have thought that this rather

pigheaded  attitude  should have died  long  ago,  but

evidently that is not the case. These people  seem  to

cling to the childish notion that industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



disputes are in themselves evil things and  the

result  of the activities of evil men. Therefore,  the

solution they put forward is to put a stop to militant

trade unionism; dig a big grave and bury all these so-called  Communists  and there will  be  no  industrial

disputes. Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I  wish  to

make  it quite clear that trade disputes will continue

to  arise  irrespective of what the Minister for  Home

Affairs, or the Minister for Internal Security of  the

Federation of Malaya who, incidentally, I gather, will

be   commissioned  to  solve  industrial  disputes  in

Singapore after the P.A.P. merger, may do in terms  of

eliminating   militant  trade   unionism   and   trade

unionists. Sir, this is so because industrial disputes

are  the results of the conflicts between workers  and

employers   in   the  process  of  production.   These

conflicts arise because of the failure to reach mutual

agreement  on  problems  relating  to  conditions   of

employment. In other words, an industrial  dispute  is

the   expression  of  the  economic  struggle  between

workers and capitalists. Sir, workers came into  being

the  very first day capitalist appeared and industrial

disputes   will  continue  so  long   as   there   are

capitalists  and workers, so long as employer/employee

relations  exist.  If  we are to have  a  constructive

debate, then let us not forget this truth just for the

purposes of temporary expediency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will be only too happy if any of the

Government  Ministers  can stand  up  honestly,  touch

their  hearts and perhaps put the other  hand  on  the

Bible  and  give  an assurance that in  operating  the

system of private enterprise there will be no strikes,

assuming  that there will be no Communists. Give  them

the  opportunity of arresting everybody who they think

is a Communist and putting them behind bars. Give them

a  situation  without the presence  of  the  so-called

Communists.  See  if  they  can  still  stand  up  and

honestly  give  an  assurance that there  will  be  no

strikes.  I say I will be much obliged and I  am  sure

all  trade  unions  and trade unionists  and  all  the

workers in Singapore will appreciate it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these trade unions that are termed pro-Communist - mind you, Sir, pro-Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



trade unions in Singapore mean every union -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> S.A.T.U.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - other than the Singapore Bank Employees

Union,  the  Singapore Insurance  Companies  Employees

Union, the Singapore Traction Company Employees Union,

the Singapore Printing Employees Union [Interruption].

You have only a few. I still have one small finger  in

my  hand.  And  the  Manual and  Mercantile  Employees

Union - five or six, other than -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The A.U.P.E.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - the A.U.P.E., a union that is definitely

not  Communist  because the Secretary-General  of  the

Union  is  the P.A.P. Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Culture. Other than these unions,  every

other  union is pro-Communist. These unions  that  are

termed  pro-Communist are all in favour of  industrial

peace.  Sir, we are in favour of employing  reasonable

steps.  We are in favour of doing everything  that  is

possible  and is non-Communist to maintain  industrial

peace  with  justice. But we must know and understand,

first  of  all, the concept of industrial  peace  with

justice   as  is  propagated  by  the  Government   of

today - the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no illusions as to what the Member for

Cairnhill  means by industrial peace with justice.  We

saw  a demonstration of his form of justice during the

years  1955 to 1959, and his version of justice is  no

justice  at all for the workers; and the rejection  of

his  anti-worker policies was very categorical in  the

general  elections in May 1959 and I do  not  have  to

elaborate that here. The people have not forgotten the

type   of   law  and  order  the  previous  Government

maintained.  Sir, nearly three years of P.A.P. labour

policies  in  practice  has shown,  unfortunately  and

regrettably,  very  little difference.  We  doubt  the

integrity  of this Government. Therefore, we  are  not

going  to give them a blank cheque and allow them  the

right  to  take reasonable steps against the so-called

Communist agitators and the so-called Communist  trade

unions.   Because,  First  of  all,  when   they   say

reasonable steps,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



we  know  they do not mean reasonable steps. Secondly,

when  they  say they are going to take action  against

the Communist, as I have said earlier, it means taking

action  against  all unions other  than  five  or  six

unions which happen to have P.A.P. personnel in  their

leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both the previous Government and the present

P.A.P. Government used the police on striking workers.

Is  `hat what they term "reasonable steps"? The P.A.P.

Government  authorised police action in disputes  like

Sassoon's. That was early in 1960 when we were all  in

the P.A.P.; all because they were unable to understand

the  aspirations of the workers. They used the  police

in  disputes  like  the Singapore Glass  Factory,  the

G.E.C.,   the   City   Council,  Robinson's,   Shaw's,

Guthries,  etc. - just to mention a few. And  in  recent

cases  they  have  used this Communist  excuse.  These

police  acts have all been defended by the  Government

Ministers  as reasonable, because they say  they  were

used against professional Communist agitators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis do not consider

police   action   against   pickets   as   reasonable.

Unwarranted  use  of  the  police  force  on  helpless

workers cannot be termed reasonable by any stretch  of

the imagination.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Were they beaten up or something?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The P.A.P. Government, soon after losing

the  support of the workers, adopted a ferocious anti-worker  attitude. We saw how this so-called pro-Labour

Government was prepared to use the police and military

forces against the workers. The scene of police action

during  the City Council strike is still vivid in  our

minds. We saw how the whole city was transformed  into

a  military  camp, all for the sake of fostering  upon

the   Government  daily-rated  workers  a  Government-sponsored  union. Unlike the previous Government,  the

P.A.P. was more vicious, and they used force  against

the   English-educated  clerks  and  salesgirls.  Sir,

history  was created in the Robinson strike by  clerks

and salesgirls



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



being carted away like cattle in Black Marias.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to spend some time touching in some

detail  on the strike at Robinson's. We have seen  how

the  Minister for Health and Law (the former  Minister

for  Labour and Law) and the Minister for Home Affairs

spent some time saying how in the Robinson strike, the

so-called  Communist  agitators  were  agitating   the

workers.  I  had  this advantage over  the  Government

Ministers - when  they were perhaps safely  confined  to

some  cool  rooms and perhaps were just  reading  from

time  to  time  reports  of  what  was  happening   in

Robinson's - that I was there. First of all,  there  was

this  charge that the so-called Communists  obstructed

the  entrance to the Robinson premises.  I  was  there

from  about 10 o'clock. There were my colleagues.  Mr

Dominic Puthucheary was there from about 8 o'clock  in

the  morning.  It  is true that at 8 o'clock  all  the

strikers  went  and  sat on the steps:  the  Company's

doors  were  closed  and nobody could  go  in  without

walking  over  the  strikers.  But  when  Mr  Dominic

Puthucheary went there, he told the strikers to  clear

the passage, and the passage was cleared. At 9 o'clock

when  the  Company's officials came in, there  was  no

obstruction.  They  all  walked  into  the   Company's

premises. At 10 o'clock or so when the police arrived,

people  like Mr A. T. Rajah and other' senior  Police

officers all walked into the Company's premises.  When

I  went  there,  all  these  people  were  inside  the

.Company's  premises.  And  I  was  told   that   then

management  of the Company agreed that  there  was  no

obstruction, and yet Mr A. T. Rajah -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> T. T. Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> A. T. Rajah, the police officer who was in

charge  of operations there, said he had to clear  all

the   strikers,  irrespective  of  whether  they  were

obstructing or not, irrespective of the fact that they

were  all  sitting aside with a wide open space  given

for  anyone to enter the premises. Sir, the  Company's

officials in my presence persuaded this police officer

and  other police officers not to remove the strikers.

They  said,  "As  far as we are  concerned,  we  have

access to our premises. We don't care.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



They can sit there. We want to carry on talks with the

union immediately so that we could solve the dispute."

I  spoke to this police officer, Mr A. T. Rajah,  and

he  made  a telephone call, obviously to his political

boss. When he came back, he said, "Sorry, Mr Barn,  I

can't  do  anything.  I  have  orders  to  clear   the

strikers." Sir, under our Trade Disputes Ordinance,  a

striker  is arrested for obstruction if, in the  first

place,  he  forcibly prevents Company  officials  from

going  into the premises. There was no such  incident.

No  company  official up to date has made  his  report

saying that he was stopped. If a worker prevents a non-striker from going into the premises, then it is  also

classified  as  obstruction. But  there  was  no  such

incident.  There was nobody who wanted to go  to  work

who  was stopped. No one up to date has made a  report

saying  that he was forcibly stopped from  going  into

the premises. If a customer wanted to go in and if the

strikers  had  prevented him,  then  that  would  have

constituted  obstruction. There was no such  case.  If

the  Company's  officials had wanted to  remove  their

goods  from  the  premises, and if  the  strikers  had

forcibly prevented them from removing them, then  that

could  have been obstruction. There was no such  case.

Sir,  there  was  no  case of  any  complaint  of  any

obstruction,  and  yet the police arrested  everybody.

The  former Minister for Labour, i.e, the Minister for

Health  and Law, who obviously was not there - I am  not

sure  whether  he  was Minister  for  Labour  at  that

time - said yesterday:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the case of the Robinson strike, there was

genuine provocation by the employer.'



<br><br>That is true. The Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But Mr Dominic Puthucheary and company never

intended  to take the dispute to the Labour  Ministry.

Many   people  saw  Dominic  Puthucheary  urging   the

strikers to be arrested when the police were called on

to  the scene. Charges of obstruction against a number

of strikers were eventually withdrawn.'



<br><br>Sir,  he  said,  "urging the strikers".  This  is  the

Straits  Times  of today - "urging the  strikers  to  be

arrested".



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Point of information, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> When that strike occurred, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  remember  I was covering the  duties  of  the

Minister for Finance, who was then away. I was in  his

office at about half-past eleven in the morning when I

got  a  telephone call from A.S.P. Rajah  saying  that

this  was  the  strike position -  that  the  men  were

crowding round the main entrance and he could not  get

entry into the premises. He said he wanted a clearance

from  me  as' to what his duties should be. I said  to

him   that  if  they  were  physically  blocking   the

entrance,  then  it  would be his  duty  as  a  police

officer to clear a passage so that people could get in

and out of the premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not in my cool room. I had

left  my  office in my car and went round the premises

of  Robinson  &  Co, that morning on  my  way  to  the

Minister for Finance's office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is a pity the Minister could say it

only  now.  The fact is that there was no  case  of  a

report  for  obstruction. That is the point.  And  the

Company  said,  "Look, don't remove my  strikers.  Let

them  squat  where  they want to, so  long  as  we  as

officials of the Company have access to the premises."



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a further point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am sure the Minister will

have - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - his time to reply. In the Robinson

incident,  the  Prime Minister committed  contempt  by

talking  over Radio Singapore. In fact, a very  prompt

statement  was issued immediately after  the  Robinson

incident, and to keep our mouths shut, all the workers

were  arrested, and 34 out of the 200 were charged  in

court. So we could not comment on the Robinson strike.

If  there  had been no case pending, then there  would

have  been  a motion of censure on the Government  for

their acts at the Robinson strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to go into this any more than is

necessary. All that I want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



to  say  is  this:  there was no case  of  obstruction

because  there was no case and there was no report  of

obstruction  made.  So  the police  arrested  everyone

present.  Sir,  this  was  supposed  to  have  been  a

Communist strike. And the police came with their Black

Marias and Riot Squad with about 500 men from the Riot

Squad  to handle about 200 workers, most of whom  were

young  girls  and Christian girls. They  were  singing

"Onward, Christian Soldiers", when the police arrived.

Sir,  when they were being arrested, we saw  that  the

police  were  using  force.  We  thought  it  was  not

necessary  because if the workers were to be  arrested

for  an offence which they had not committed, we  were

quite  prepared  to tell the workers, "Get  yourselves

arrested.  If  the police were to arrest  you  for  an

offence  which  you have not committed,  then  do  not

resist  arrest." And we knew very well that  if  there

had  been  resistance on the part of the  workers,  we

would  have been playing right into the hands  of  the

Government  and given them the opportunity of  picking

up  the  strikers.  Therefore, all  that  Mr  Dominic

Puthucheary  told  the workers  was.  "Do  not  resist

arrest."  First of all, they arrested 34 people;  took

them   to  the  Central  Police  Station,  took   down

particulars  and released them. The 34 came  back  and

squatted on the same place. The police then found that

it  would  be embarrassing to arrest them in  batches,

take  them  to  the police station, and  then  release

them.,  because they would come back and squat on  the

same  place.  So they said, "Pack up the  whole  lot."

They  arrested  over 200 workers and union  officials,

took them to the Central Police Station, and held them

there  until one o'clock, when we knew very well  that

all   that  was  required  was  to  take  down   their

particulars and let them go. But they kept them  until

one o'clock. I remember the Commissioner of Police was

in  the  Central Police Station and I did have a  chat

with  him.  I told him that, in my opinion - and  I  was

advised by counsel - that all that was required  was  to

take down their particulars and let them go.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



He  said  it would take a whole day to take  down  the

particulars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we knew that their purpose was to prevent the

workers   from  going  back  to  Robinson's.  Somehow,

perhaps   because  of  the  threat  I  made   to   the

Commissioner of Police that if the workers were  going

to  be  detained longer than necessary, then we  would

make  sure  that we would take up the matter  further,

the  workers were released. And this time it took them

less than one hour to take down the particulars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to make briefly is that when

these  workers  went  back to  Robinson's,  they  were

prevented  from  picketing. We  were  supposed  to  be

Communists, or supposed to be people who were creating

trouble.  The workers went hack. Why should Government

deny  them  the  right to picket?  Sir,  picketing  is

guaranteed  to  the  workers under  the  laws  of  the

country,    laws   made   by   so-called    democratic

governments.  These  are so-called  democratic  rights

given to the workers. Yet these workers were prevented

from picketing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken some time over this because this is an

example  of the truth in all these so-called Communist

disputes that take place.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suspend this sitting. I will take the

Chair again at 5.35 p.m.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> And so, Mr Speaker. Sir, that was the

Robinson strike, a strike called by a legitimate trade

union;  a strike which involved legitimate workers:  a

strike  which, in the words of the Minister for Health

and  Law,  had a legitimate cause; and yet,  Sir,  the

Government's  criticism of the strike  was  completely

unsympathetic. All that they could think of saying was

that this was a strike called by Communist agitators



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



to bring about disorder. Mr Speaker. Sir, we say that

law and order on the industrial front brought about at

the expense of the legitimate claims of the workers is

deplorable. Industrial peace is not for the  exclusive

protection  of  vested interests.  Law  and  order  to

advance  the interests of the employers but to neglect

the  economic advance of the workers is unjust to  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the P.A.P. Government, through its

stooges,  is  concentrating all  its  efforts  on  the

English-educated section of the working class. This is

because  it  has  completely lost the support  of  the

industrial workers who were the backbone of the Party,

who were the mass base of the good old P.A.P. Now they

are compelled to look for support in other directions.

When  the P.A.P. came to power through the backing  of

the industrial workers, its leadership became arrogant

and  began to insult and humiliate with vengeance  the

English-speaking  section of our population.  Sir,  it

went to such lengths that Mr Lim Ching Siong, who  is

today  accused  of being the most important  Communist

cadre,  had  to tell his colleague, Mr  Woodhull,  to

write an open letter to the Prime Minister to cut  out

all this anti-English-educated talk. Sir, it took some

time  for them to realise their mistake. But when they

lost  the  support of the industrial  workers  through

their  foolish  anti-labour  policies,  they  switched

their line and began to woo the very same people  they

had  insulted and humiliated. The P.A.P. was naive  to

believe  that the English-educated would support  them

in  spite  of  the  past insults. Sir,  this  was  the

measure  of respect the P.A.P. showed to this  section

of  the  population. But to the dismay of  the  P.A.P.

leadership,  they  found the English-speaking  workers

organising   themselves  along   militant   lines   in

independent unions like the Singapore Business  Houses

Employees  Union. Then the Government started  a  two-prong attack on the English-educated workers, singling

out  the Singapore Business Houses Employees Union  as

their  main  target. They had to cook up a reason  for

this  attack.  They could not say that  the  Singapore

Business Houses Employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



Union was a good union and a powerful union that stood

to  safeguard  the  interest of  the  English-educated

commercial workers. They could not say that this was a

union that did not want to be controlled by the P.A.P.,

and  therefore, they must attack it. They had to  cook

up  a reason that would give an apparent justification

for  the  attack,  and  what better  reason  than  the

Communist  bogey?  So  the Singapore  Business  Houses

Employees  Union today is supposed to be  a  Communist

front organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may state here that the Singapore Business

Houses  Employees Union was formed in 1954. The  first

time   anybody  ever  accused  this  union  of   being

Communist  was  just about the time  of  the  Robinson

strike  last  year. Sir, those of us who  are  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis  and  who are  associated  with  the

Business  Houses Employees Union were associated  with

this  Union long before the break with the  P.A.P.  We

were associated with this Union as early as 1960.  Yet

neither the Prime Minister nor anyone of the Ministers

ever   said   that   this  was   a   Communist   front

organisation. Even the Member for Cairnhill, a  former

Chief Minister, during 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1958

never  ever  said  that  this was  a  Communist  front

organisation. Today, the Government of the  P.A.P. is

directing its attack on the Singapore Business  Houses

Employees Union, by, on the one hand, persecuting the

Union  with the whole State machinery and by,  on  the

other,  enticing  its membership  into  the  Singapore

Manual  and Mercantile Workers Union, a union that  is

managed  by P.A.P. stooges and backed to the  hilt  by

the  State machinery, a union whose sole purpose seems

to  be  to split the trade union movement and  thereby

weaken the strength of the commercial workers. Sir, in

strikes  called  by  the  Singapore  Business   Houses

Employees Union, police actions have been very severe.

The  political wing of the Labour Ministry is  hostile

towards  this union. The Press and the radio are  used

against  this union. Even the English Petir, organ  of

the P.A.P. which recently made its reappearance after a

long



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



absence,  has devoted an editoral against this  union.

Sir,  it  is  interesting to examine why this  is  so.

Yesterday the Minister for Health and Law said, as  is

reported in the Straits Times of today:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Twenty-five of the SATU strikes involved expatriate

firms,  while  only  six strikes called  by  the  non-aligned group involved such firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also revealed that the majority (24) of the SATU strikes were called by the Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, either the Minister did not know the facts or he was deliberately making an inaccurate statement. I was

saying that the Business Houses Employees' Union was a

union  organised in 1954. The Minister says that  last

year  the  majority of the strikes were in  expatriate

firms,  24  of  the  25 were called by  the  Singapore

Business  Houses  Employees' Union.  Ever  since  this

union  was formed, it has called only 19 strikes.  The

first strike took place in August 1959. Sir, I do  not

see the purpose of going to this extent of fabricating

the truth -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow that expression

"fabricating the truth" said of a speech of  a  Member

of  this Assembly. It is equivalent to saying it is  a

lie. Will the Member please withdraw that expression?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I withdraw that, Sir, but I do not

understand, as I have said, why they want to go to

this extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is noticed that in the speeches of the

Ministers, the Prime Minister, the Minister  for  Home

Affairs, there has been a concentrated attack  on  the

Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union.  Sir,  you

will recall that one of that accusations was that this

union  was only asking for flat increases in  salaries

and  was not asking for a salary structure. The reason

they  gave was that the Communists did not like salary

structures  because salary structures  stabilised  the

position. Let me briefly say what this union has  done

and  what  it stands for, and also explain why  salary

scales  are not embodied in all its claims.  First  of

all, I must say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



that  during the past one year, this union has entered

into  something like 50 collective agreements with  50

employers, providing for salary increases ranging from

$40  to  $120  per month over a period of  two  years.

Everybody recognises that in the commercial field  the

achievements of this union have been tremendous. Never

in  this  sector has there been in the  past  a  union

which  has  achieved so much in so short a  time.  Mr

Speakers. Sir, just to give a clearer picture,  I  say

that  since 1954, up to about the middle of last year,

definitely up to the end of 1960, there was  not  even

one single agreement signed by this union. This was at

a  time  when  this union was not branded  as  a  pro-Communist  union, when the union was  run  perhaps  by

people  who never understood the employers  they  were

dealing with. It was only after the union realised the

need   to  organise'  along  militant  lines  to  call

strikes, if necessary, that this achievement has  been

brought  about.  It  is ridiculous  to  say  that  the

leadership of this union, which is alleged to be  pro-Communist,  does not look after the interests  of  the

workers.  More  than 5,000 workers have  benefited  by

the collective agreements that I have just mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And salary scales, Sir? The Prime Minister was

quite categorical when he said the Communists did  not

like  salary scales. Sir,I have never before heard  a

sillier  statement than this. I know the situation  as

it exists in the commercial world. I did say yesterday

that  the  people who were against salary scales  were

the   employers.  The  Prime  Minister's  logic   must

necessarily  mean that the employers  are  Communists,

and  I  am  sure an employer who chooses to be  honest

will  bear  me  out  on  this.  I  have  had  personal

experience of being told by employers that they do not

want  salary scales. I do not want to go into details and  quote every single example. I will just quote one

example  to  start with. I am sure government  Members

can  check the truth of it. Nestle's (Malaya) Products

Ltd. The claims were negotiated for six months by  the

Business  Houses.  Employees' Union and  I  personally

spent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



two  months negotiating with the employer on a  salary

scale. At the end of the two months, he said "No".  He

said  "no"  after agreeing in principle  to  a  salary

structure,  after  agreeing to a salary  structure  as

such,  after  agreeing to the ladders  in  the  salary

structure and before final confirmation. The reason he

gave  was that employers in the commercial world  felt

that a salary structure would take away the incentives

that  were  necessary for the workers. The  employers'

arguments are that if we have a salary structure  like

the  one in the bank where there is no bar, where  one

starts  from  the minimum and every year goes  up  the

ladder  right  up to the maximum without any  stoppage

whatsoever,  then  incentives do  not  exist  for  the

workers.  The  commercial firms have the  practice  of

giving  increments on the basis of merit.  Sir,  as  a

unionist  we disagree with this. We disagree with  the

employer.  We  feel there must be a salary  structure,

but  we realise, as practical people, that if we press

on  with  the call for a salary structure, we will  be

having a lot more strikes than we have at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a time when employers whose workers

were  members of the Business Houses Employees'  Union

refused to negotiate on wage increases. They said wage

increases  were at their discretion.  It  took  a  few

strikes  to  drum  sense  into  the  heads  of   these

employers,  and I am sure, I have no doubt whatsoever,

that if we want to force the business houses employers

to  accept a salary structure, we will have to call  a

number  of  strikes in the first place. What  are  the

Government trying to do? Do they want us to call  more

strikes  so that they can come here and say  Communist

agitators are calling strikes? Sir, to the best of  my

knowledge,  there is no trade union in Singapore  that

has anything against a salary structure. If what I say

is  doubted, I ask Government Members, as I asked them

yesterday, to get in touch with the employers. Mr  J.

J.  Rattray,  Industrial  Adviser  to  the  Employers'

Federation,  has  had  several  discussions  with   my

colleagues  and  me, and I am quite sure  if  the  man

chooses to tell the truth, he will confirm



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



what  I say. Sir, this is just another example of  the

extent to which the Government are prepared to go just

to make their Communist smear stick. In their haste to

do  this,  they  do not consider the validity  of  the

argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also touched on the Ford strike that has just ended. He again said this was a strike which was called by the Communists, not for the benefit of the Ford workers, but simply because the Communists wanted to agitate the trouble. He also said how the results did not favour the workers. He said yesterday that they only got six cents per day. This again is a P.A.P. bluff. It is an inaccurate

statement.  Surely,  responsible men  like  the  Prime

Minister  should  assess the facts first,  unless,  of

course,  he  thinks all the people  in  Singapore  are

fools and he can bluff them and get away with it. Sir,

the  agreement  signed by the union for  Ford  workers

provides for a rise of six cents per hour as from  the

1st  of March, 1962. As from the 1st of January, 1963,

another  five  cents per hour. It works out  for  this

year  at 52.8 cents per day, and for 1963, 96.8  cents

per day additional increase on the workers' pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, the average has been 88 cents per

hour.  In  1962, the wages would be pushed  up  to  94

cents per hour, and in 1963 they would be pushed up to

99 cents per hour. Also, as a result of the agreement,

the  workers are expected to work only 42½  hours  but

they  are  paid for 49 hours and they work a  five-day

week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister said that that was a

Communist  strike.  I believe he also  said  that  the

Communist do not normally refer these disputes to  the

Labour  Ministry for conciliation. I wonder if  he  is

aware  that the Ford negotiations were carried out  in

the  Labour Ministry soon after the strike. Sir, I  am

going into some detail on this again because I want to

expose this Communist bluff that is being put forward.

Once  and  for  all,  let us see to  what  extent  the

Government  will go in attempting to make  this  smear

stick. Everybody knows - once the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



for Finance told me - that Ford is internationally known

to  be  a bad employer. I am sure we have all read  of

the Ford strikes in Canada and the United Kingdom. The

Minister  for Finance himself told us that Ford  is  a

bad  employer.  There  have been three  strikes  since

1957.   In  1957,  there  were  dismissals  and  union

officials were victimised - there was a strike, in 1960,

there  was a strike because of retrenchments. In 1961,

the  last  strike  took place because  the  management

wanted  to negotiate on salary increases only  subject

to  the employees agreeing to produce 14 cars per day.

This  was  nonsense.  No union worth  its  salt  would

accept  such a situation in the context of an industry

like Ford where hitherto the pay has been on the basis

of a time rate. The union was quite right - as I am sure

Members  on the other side of the House will accept - if

the employer wants to relate any further increases  in

the  salary to production. That was the primary  cause

of  the  strike.  The Prime Minister  made  it  appear

yesterday  that the Ford workers were all dissatisfied

and  that  they  were on strike for  three  months - 110

days - all  for  the sake of helping the  Communists  to

make propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have told the Government Members before - and I

say  this  again - in the first place, if they  want  to

know how the Ford workers feel about the strike, I say

they   feel  "jollified"  because  they  have  got   a

substantial   increase  in  their   salaries   and   a

substantial improvement in their conditions  of  work.

This could not have been brought about if not for  the

strike.  If  they  do not believe this,  they  are  at

liberty - they have the whole State machinery - and they

are  in  a  position  to go and interview  every  Ford

worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not have to go through the process of

calling a strike and having to combat with the  police

force  to  discredit the Government. I have said  this

before.  We  are  satisfied that  the  Government  are

sufficiently discredited. We do not have to go through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



this  motion.  The  truth  of  the  statement  can  be

checked - hold general elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why do you not resign?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is as simple as that. Sir, I do not

want  to throw challenges, but what I am saying  quite

simply  is  this.  We do not have to  go  through  the

process of strikes to prove that the Government  is  a

bad Government because this has been proved abundantly

clear.  If  the Government doubt that statement,  they

are always welcome to check the truth or otherwise  of

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government now is creating the Communist

bogey. This is like the old P.A.P. gramophone record - a

record  that has a tiny little hole in the groove  and

it   goes  on  the  same  groove  repeating  the  same

tune - Communist,   Communist,   Communist... Sir,    they

attempt to attribute all industrial actions to  a  few

individuals   who  are  termed  Communists   or   pro-Communists.  The P.A.P. desperadoes are  deliberately

misleading the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today strikes are being called not just by unions

that  the  Government chooses to describe as Communist

trade  unions, but I am sure we are all aware of  some

of  the  recent strikes. I wish I can list down  every

single  strike  that took place and show  which  union

called  a strike and explain the cause of the  strike,

but  I cannot do this because I may have to go on till

midnight. I am quite sure that you, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

will  not allow me to do that. Therefore, I will  just

try  and  quote a few examples. Let us take  the  City

Council   strike  called  by  the  Public  Daily-Rated

Employees  Unions Federation. Their basic  grouse  was

against  the  Government's  intention  to  foster  the

A.U.P.E. against the wishes of the  majority  of  the

Government  daily-rated workers. This was sufficiently

proved by a secret ballot held by the Government after

the  strike  was  over where the A.U.P.E. suffered  a

humiliating  defeat. No amount of  cry  Communism  can

deceive  our  workers as to the  real  cause  of  this

strike.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis had nothing

whatsoever to do with the strike.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You had a conversation with

Rajendra.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I used to tell the Minister for Culture

that  as  far as we are concerned we have the guts  to

say  that this is a strike called by us and defend the

strike  on  the merits of it. We do not want  to  take

credit for which we are not due. All that happened was

that  Mr  Rajendra, who has been for quite some  time

associated with the City Council Federation of  Labour

Unions  and  the  Public Daily-Rated Employees  Unions

Federation, was at the premises of this union in  Race

Course Road. [Interruption]. There is nothing to laugh

about  this. The Minister for Education knows next  to

nothing  of what is going on on the industrial  front.

Mr  Rajendra  is  the Secretary  of  the  Staff  Side

Council.  Sir,  I  am  not holding  a  brief  for  Mr

Rajendra.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> For S.A.T.U.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not here to defend him. But let us

examine the facts. I do not want to be as foolish  as

the  Minister for Culture to throw accusations. It  is

simple.  All you have to do is to say, "Mr Lim  Ching

Siong is a Communist. He is associated with so and  so

who  is  in  S.A.T.U. That person is a  Communist  and

therefore S.A.T.U. is Communist. Therefore, all  those

people  who  associate themselves with  S.A.T.U. must

necessarily be Communists." Sir, a five-year old child

can  repeat  this. It does not take  brains  from  the

Government Bench to cook up a story like this. But let

us see the facts. The day Mr Rajendra was in the City

Council Unions Federation premises there was a meeting

of  Government unions scheduled, and he was  there  to

get  information about the strike and to report to his

unions  in  the  Government service - a very  legitimate

act.  Sir,  here  was  a dispute involving  Government

workers, and if the Government unions wanted to have a

meeting  to discuss the City Council strike I  do  not

see anything



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



wrong in that. Anyway, this is what I was told by  Mr

Rajendra   after   the   Prime  Minister   made   this

accusation.  While  Mr  Rajendra  was  there  in  the

premises,  the  officials of  the  Public  Daily-Rated

Employees  Union asked him whether he  knew  to  which

union certain workers who were manning the lorries and

who   were  breaking  the  strike  belonged  to.   Mr

Rajendra,  who did not know very much of the situation

in  the  non-Government sector, phoned  the  Singapore

General  Employees  Union  in  Middle  Road,  got  Mr

Dominic  Puthucheary and asked him, "Do  you  know  to

which  unions  these workers belong to?"  Mr  Dominic

Puthucheary said, "They belong to the Singapore Manual

and  Mercantile  Employees Union, a  union  led  by  a

Government  man, a union that is used quite  naturally

to  break  a  strike which is against the interest  of

another  Government union, the A.U.P.E." That was  all

that  happened. A mountain was made out of a molehill.

Sir,  the  telephones were tapped. The Special  Branch

takes  the liberty of tapping the telephones of  trade

unions. Even the telephones of the Presidents of  some

trade unions are tapped.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, and Assemblymen too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> And Assemblymen, Sir. I wonder whether we

can  talk  about it at a later date. That  is  exactly

what  happened. And because the telephones were tapped

and  because  the  Government received  their  reports

saying  that  on such and such a day Mr Rajendra  was

seen  in the premises and that at such and such a time

he  phoned Mr Dominic Puthucheary, a big story  of  a

Communist plot was cooked up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I tell the Government to at least try and be

honest.  They can disagree with us. They can say  that

they  disagree with our policies, that  they  want  to

fight  us  in  our policies. We are quite prepared  to

face them and fight them anywhere they choose. But let

us  conduct  this fight at least with the  decency  of

being  honest. They know very well, Sir, that none  of

us  has anything to do with this strike. But they want

to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



it big. They knew that this was a big strike, and they

wanted to cover up their mistakes. They knew they were

caught because of their attempt to foster a Government

sponsored union - a strike of 10,000 workers took  place

affecting  the  essential services of the  country - and

they built up this smear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a little later I shall deal with the figures

that were juggled yesterday by the Prime Minister, the

Minister for Labour - sorry, the Minister for Health and

Law.  I  only know the Minister for Health and Law  as

the  Minister for Labour, and every time I look at him

I still think that he is the Minister for Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He knows a great deal about you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, it is very disturbing for me,

especially  to notice that the Minister  for  Labour's

seat is always vacant. I do not know whether -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Member

is fair in passing a remark of that nature, because he

knows why the Minister for Labour is absent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Quite honestly, I do not know why the

Minister  is absent. If I had known, I would not  have

said a thing like that. Anyway, Sir, I shall privately

ask  the  Government Ministers why  the  Minister  for

Labour is not here. But, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister for Labour has been

given permission of absence by the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am much obliged. Sir, before I deal with

the  figures that were juggled yesterday, I just  want

to  go  through  a  list of a few of the  unions  that

called  for  strikes. We remember  that  the  A.U.P.E.

sometime  back  served  a  strike  ultimatum  on   the

Government. Although there was no strike, nevertheless

the A.U.P.E. served a strike ultimatum. I believe they

served  it  twice: once in connection with some  issue

affecting  the  firemen,  and  the  other  one   quite

recently. We all know that the Secretary-General



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



of  the A.U.P.E. is the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Culture, an eternal P.A.P. henchman. Sir,

does  the  Government propose to say that this  strike

threat was also the machinations of the Communists? Or

does the Government propose to say that the P.A.P. is

creating industrial unrest?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure we are also aware that a few months ago

the  workers  of the Bank of America went  on  strike.

Following  that, the employees of the  Chartered  Bank

went  on  strike. Then the employees of  the  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation went on strike. All  these

workers  are members of the Singapore Bank  Employees'

Union.  Mr Devan Nair and the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister  for Culture are  advisers  to  this

Union.  Does  the Government propose to say  that  all

these  strikes  were caused by Communist machinations?

Some  insurance  company  workers  recently  went   on

strike.  They  are members of the Singapore  Insurance

Companies Employees Union. This Union again is led  by

P.A.P. men.  The  Singapore  Manual  and  Mercantile

Workers  Union  have  merrily  been  calling  numerous

strikes  in  recent  months with Government  blessing.

Everybody knows that T. V. Gomez, Secretary General of

this  Union, is an obedient P.A.P. stooge.  Mr  Devan

Nair is the adviser to this Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone of us knows that strikes have been

called;  strikes are being called today, not  just  by

unions  that  are termed pro-Communist and  Communist.

But  the  speeches of the Ministers - and now with  this

amendment moved - give one the impression that  all  the

strikes in Singapore are due to the Communists.  There

is   this  talk  of  mounting  of  industrial  unrest.

Yesterday   we   had  figures  being  used   to   show

justification  for  their  allegation  that  there  is

mounting  of  industrial unrest. Sir,I  do  not  deny

there   is  industrial  unrest;  there  is  industrial

dissatisfaction. I shall go into the reasons why  this

is  so  in a short while. But let us just examine  the

figures that have been played with, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a Monthly Digest of Statistics - Vol. 1,

No.  1, January 1962 - and I am sure the Government will

not doubt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



these figures. Unlike the Minister, I do not have  the

facilities  of  getting a whole list  of  up  to  date

strikes.  But  let  us  just  briefly  examine   these

figures.  First of all, let us take the man-days  lost

for   one-whole  year  1961.  According  to  page  26,

industrial   stoppages   by   major   industries: 1961,

410,891, as compared with 152,006 for 1960. Sir, so  a

big  show  was  made yesterday. 1960,  150,000;  1961,

410,000 - mounting of industrial unrest. You will  note,

Sir,  that out of these 410,891 man-days lost for that

year,  274,849 man-days were as a result of the strike

affecting electricity, gas and water. In other  words,

this relates to the strike called by the Public Daily-Rated  Employees Unions Federation. I am sure some  of

us  can  remember that towards the end  of  last  year

there  was  a one-day strike called by the Army  Civil

Service  Union which is a union with which we have  no

connections  whatsoever, a union which  has  not  been

named by the Government Ministers as a Communist-front

union.  For all I know, maybe after this they may  say

that  this  union also is a Communist front union.  So

far  they have said nothing. As a result of this  one-day strike, Sir, there was a loss of about 17,000 man-days.  This  was in the month of November  1961.  This

union membership is about 17,000. So roughly speaking,

Sir, 17,000 man-days were lost as a result of the Army

Civil Service Union strike, plus 274,849 man-days lost

as  a  result of the City Council strike.  That  makes

291,849  man-days lost for last year - no, I  am  sorry,

Sir;  if  I  may go over it step by step  to  make  it

clearer. [Interruption] I am quite certain, Sir,  that

I  am  better  than the Prime Minister in numbers.  In

fact, when he was juggling with the figures yesterday,

I  thought I should tell him that I would at any  time

like  to have him in my class if I ever should go back

to  teaching, and pull him by the ear and tell him  to

do his figures properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may just go through it stage by stage. 274,849

man-days  were lost as a result of the strike  of  the

Public  Daily-Rated  Employees. 17,000  man-days  were

lost in the Army strike. That gives a total of 291,849

man-days.  You  deduct  291  from  291,849,  and  that

resulting figure from 410,089, and we get something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



like  119,000. Sir, 119,000 compares favourably

with 152,000 in 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just one more comparison. The Government has

been  naming  the Singapore Business Houses  Employees

Union and the Singapore General Employees Union as the

two   important  Communist  front  organisations.  The

members  of  these  unions  are  mostly  employed   in

manufacturing industries and commercial houses. If  we

look  at  the Government statistics for 1961, we  find

that  in  the manufacturing industry there  were  only

71,580 man-days lost as against 129,894 man-days  lost

in  1960 - a  definite reduction. Let us take  commerce.

Commerce  includes  not  just  the  S.G.E.U. and  the

S.B.H.E.U. but  also unions like the  Singapore  Bank

Employees  Union and the Singapore Insurance Companies

Employees  Union.  The statistics  for  commerce  show

19,840.  Even if we add the man-days lost for commerce

and  manufacturing, it is yet lower than the  man-days

lost in the manufacturing industry in 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was also one comparison given by the

Prime  Minister  yesterday in  respect  of  August  to

December  or so, last year. I have calculated,  in  so

far  as man-days are concerned - that nearly 80 per cent

or so of the man-days lost during this period were due

to  the City Council strike and the Army Civil Service

Union strike. Therefore, to suggest that the so-called

Communists  and pro-Communists are mounting industrial

unrest  is, to say the least, malicious. The nakedness

of  this  untruth  is quite easily exposed.  In  their

eagerness  to  brand  their  political  opponents   as

Communists  and  thereby prepare for  repression,  the

P.A.P. leaders are making inaccurate statements.  They

are not telling the people the truth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, on a

point of elucidation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have stated publicly

without  privilege that the Member  for  Thomson,  Mr

Woodhull  are the four pro-Communists in the  Business

Houses Employees Union engineering all these things on

behalf of -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not elucidation. I think

the   Member  for  Thomson  is  on  a  different  tack

entirely.  The Prime Minister will have an opportunity

of speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to draw

your  attention to the allegation made by  the  Member

for   Thomson,   that  all  these  are  reckless   and

inaccurate  statements. I invite  him  to  take  legal

remedies for those inaccurate and reckless statements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I just tell the Prime Minister this, Sir.

I do not have -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Scared!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I do not have the facilities that the

Prime Minister has to employ - I am speaking for myself,

Sir - and that is high-powered lawyers. I tell him  this

quite  bluntly and straight. Let him take me to  court

and  prove that I am a pro-Communist cadre. I am quite

prepared to go to court and face anybody who  can  try

and  prove that I am a pro-Communist cadre. It is  not

my  business  to  go  and waste my time  taking  legal

action against the Prime Minister. My quarrel with the

Prime  Minister is essentially a political quarrel.  I

am quite prepared to take him to the people in Tanjong

Pagar to pass judgment. Let him choose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying that the Prime Minister and other

Government  Ministers were not telling the people  the

truth  in  their  eagerness to brand  their  political

opponents  as  Communists. Sir, I tell them  that  the

increasing  industrial unrest is not the  creation  of

political opponents of the P.A.P. Sir, if there is  an

increase  in  the  number  of  strikes,  it  is  clear

evidence that there is increasing discontent among the

workers,  be  they  members of the  unions  which  are

P.A.P. led or otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Increasing discontent after

Anson!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> As far as we are concerned, we stand with

all  workers  irrespective of which trade  union  they

belong  to. Sir, unlike the P.A.P. leadership,  we  do

not go and condemn their actions. I tell this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



to   the  Prime  Minister.  This  discontent  is   not

something  that has just come about after  Anson.  The

Prime  Minister  knows very well that ever  since  the

P.A.P.  assumed  office, I have been  telling  him  that

there is increasing discontent among the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Political discontent among the

workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Prime Minister, if he chooses to be

honest,  will  at  least  confirm  what  I  said.   My

disagreement  with him on the sort  of  labour  policy

that the Government has pursued after the election  is

well  known  to  many  people  in  the  P.A.P.  I  had

criticised the Government's labour policy long  before

the Anson by-election or the Hong Lim by-election. And

they  know it well. I am sure the Prime Minister  will

very  vividly recall one incident affecting  the  Hume

Industries  workers. The Singapore  General  Employees

Union  submitted  a  wage  claim  in  respect  of  the

industrial   workers.  Mr  Dominic  Puthucheary,   my

friend, was negotiating. The employer said, "I  cannot

give  even  a five-cent rise. If I have to  give  five

cents, I have to close down the company." This was  in

1960, long before Anson and long before Hong Lim.  The

union  knew the financial position of the company.  So

they just pressed on with their claim. There was a go-slow.  The  employer  went to a sympathetic  man,  the

Minister for Finance, and produced I do not know  what

figures  and  papers.  But somehow  the  Minister  for

Finance believed the employer's story and went to  the

Prime  Minister.  And  the Prime Minister  called  Mr

Dominic  Puthucheary to his office. "Dom, you withdraw

the claim."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Was the Member present?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of explanation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Was the Member present?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I was not present.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You were not present.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was not present, but I am sure the Prime

Minister  can take me to task if I am making  a  wrong

statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I will.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Prime Minister knows full well that

subsequently  we had discussions on this together.  He

had  discussions with me and Mr Dominic  Puthucheary.

We are quite prepared to go to court and swear on oath

that  this is true [Laughter]. This is not a  laughing

matter. Sir. Once upon a time, the Prime Minister  was

very  fond of saying this. "You go to court and  swear

on oath." I am quite prepared to go to court and swear

on oath.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Swear on oath that you are not a

Communist or pro-Communist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Anyway, Mr Puthucheary was told to

withdraw  the claim. He refused. Then he was  told  to

accept something like 30 cents. He refused. These were

the days when we were in the

P.A.P.  Sir, I remember very clearly the day  when  we

discussed  with the Prime Minister. And we criticised

the  Prime Minister's action very severely. To cut the

whole  story short. At the end of it all, the  workers

had  a  wage increase ranging from 70 cents to  $1.50.

And  Hume Industries has not closed down. It is  still

prospering,  and  only recently, sometime  last  month

actually,  a  new agreement was signed giving  a  wage

increase for the clerical workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have the ridiculous talk about the

mounting  industrial unrest and the need to  curb  it.

But  no effort is made to examine the causes of  these

disputes  and the circumstances in which  they  arise.

Instead,  we  have people in responsible positions  in

Government falling into the same temptation  of  their

colonial  and pro-colonial predecessors, and regarding

these disputes with hostility. Let me state simply and

clearly  that  disputes  flare  up  for  a  number  of

reasons,  the  foremost  of  which  is  the  sense  of

oppression and injustice felt by our working people in

Singapore. Anyone who pretends to champion the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



cause of all these strikers must, first of all, get it

into his head that there are definite grievances among

the  workers  and that strikes take place not  because

workers are unreasonable. It is no use for any  Member

of  this House to come here and cry "Communism". It is

useless  to  suggest  that there are  strikes  because

there are professional agitators at work. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  crying  "Communism" is not going  to  solve  any

problem, though it may be used by the Government as an

excuse  to  carry out repression. Sir, the  Government

cannot   remove  the  sense  of  grievance  by  crying

"Communism". The people of Singapore have  heard  this

cry of wolf once too often. It is a futile exercise to

try  the childish gimmick of crying "Communism".  Sir,

those  who  profess concern for the  increase  in  the

number of strikes must be objective in their analysis.

Sir,  strikes do not take place out of the  blue.  The

strike  is  the ultimate weapon in the  hands  of  the

workers.  And  the  workers do not use  this  to  play

marbles with. Strikes demand sacrifices on the part of

the  workers. If there are workers prepared to sit  it

out,  to  go  on strike indefinitely, then there  must

necessarily be very legitimate grievances.  I  thought

that  the people in power would understand this rather

simple  fact. Sir, when we were in the P.A.P., in  the

days  when  it  was fighting the previous  Government,

there seemed to be some appreciation of this fact. But

once the P.A.P. leaders came to power, they seemed  to

overlook this fact very easily. The taste of power  is

a  terrible thing. It makes one forget one's own past,

forget  even  the hopes and aspirations  of  the  very

people who brought the Government to power. I need not

repeat  the old dictum about the corrupting  influence

of  power. It is such a stark truth and we have it  in

evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is making every attempt to

attribute industrial disputes to the machinations of a

few    individuals,   and   these   individuals    are

conveniently labelled Communists. Sir, the  Government

is merely playing politics. It is trying to coerce the

trade union movement and, in so doing, it is plugging



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



the same line, resorting to the same measures  in espousing

the  same  philosophy  of   the   previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government's hostility to the unions is evident.

Its attempt to connect industrial disputes with its own bid for survival

is equally evident.  The old  colonial cry of Communist wolf is being

made time and  again. Sir, industrial disputes that emerge as  a result

of dissatisfaction among the working people are now   being  viewed

with  a  blatant  hostility.  Mr Speaker,  Sir, let me tell these rather

wild  men  in power  that they cannot remove the sense of  grievance

unless they remove the causes of the grievance. Let me tell  these

men that they cannot use the trade  union movement as the scapegoat for

their various repressive actions. Let me also warn them that they will

only  be increasing  the  sense  of dissatisfaction  among  the working

people  if  they  seek  to  throttle   their expression of grievances.

Sir, they cannot destroy the trade  union  movement by putting  a

few  individuals behind  bars.  Sir, if it has not been made  plain

to them before, then let it be made plain now. Industrial dissatisfaction

there certainly is. It is not  because of the machinations of a few

individuals. It is unless to  sit  in this House and pray for industrial

peace. Industrial peace will not drop from heaven like manna. To

achieve industrial peace and stability  calls  for the  co-operation

of workers and employers alike.  The prerequisite for this,

however, is political stability provided by a strong and stable government

which  will be  unbiased in industrial relations. Sir, to  imagine that

by  curtailing  the freedom  of  expression  and activity  of

trade unions, one would achieve  anything would  only  be  folly

amounting to lunacy.  Sir,  one cannot cure anything by treating

the symptoms.  It  is the  disease  that needs treatment.

The  first  step, therefore, is to make the right diagnosis.

Today  the Government   simply   attempts   to   attribute

the manifestations  of industrial dissatisfaction  to  the

Communist bogey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us examine and see what has gone wrong, so that we understand in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



proper  perspective  the  present  situation  on   the industrial front.

It was primarily on the strength  of the  trade union movement that

the P.A.P. was  brought into office. With the advent of the P.A.P.

Government, there  was  political stability. Employers  ceased  to play

politics;   workers  and  their   unions   made determined  efforts to

negotiate peaceful  settlements and  used the conciliation machinery

of the Government with  confidence.  There was, in  fact,

unprecedented peace  on  the industrial front. There was

industrial peace. But this was short-lived. The beginning of 1960 showed

a  change  in the situation. The  power  crazy Prime  Minister,  who had,

prior to the  1959  general elections,  identified himself with  the

trade  union movement,  with  the emotions and  sentiments  of  the workers,

and  who  finally  achieved  power,   became crazier  and  crazier with

power. He  wanted  to  curb everybody's influence. He wanted to make sure

that  he was  in  a  position  of power  for  life.  He  wanted everyone

else  to  be responsible for  his  unpopular measures.  In short, he wanted

others to do the  dirty job  for  him. He saw in the trade union movement

the solidarity of the workers. It was a solidarity that he did not

approve of, because he feared the strength  of the working class movement,

for he knew full well that this  was  a constant threat to his personal

ambitions which  were  contrary to the interest of  the  working people.

[Interruption] Therefore, he set about  trying to  undermine  it.

Sir,  I  can  jeer  "Running  dogs barking."  I  do  not  want to  take  more  time  than necessary -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Chair is getting a bit tired.

Was that expression "running dogs barking" meant  to refer to a Member

of this House? If it  was, then he must withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, if I may make an explanation -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I just wish to know whether

that expression was meant to refer to a Member of this House. If it was,

the Member must withdraw it without explanation.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I am quite prepared to withdraw it. But what I

was about to say was that the term "running dog" is not used for

dogs with four legs -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not want any explanation. The

Chair has considered the expression offensive and it must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I withdraw, Sir,I remember the Prime Minister once

put his dream picture to me. The S.P.A., as far as he was concerned,

was finished. The British, to  his mind, would remain in the background

and would not  do  a  thing except if the Left-wing got  out  of hand.

If the trade unionists made too much noise,  the British,  according

to him would  not  sit  back  and watch.  So  he  saw  himself in  a

rather  favourable position.  There was nothing to worry about  from

the Right.  As  far  as the workers and the working  class movement

were concerned, they could not go  very  far for fear of British

reprisals. To his mind, he was  an indispensable figure. The Right

had to accept him. The Left  had  to  work with him. He thought he

could  do anything  and get away with it. He saw the opportunity to

curb the power of the trade unions, and to curb the influence  of

the  workers in the affairs  of  State. Aside from reintroducing

the P.P.S.O. and carrying out other severe measures, he compelled

trade unionists to identify themselves with all his acts, hoping

thereby that they would incur the wrath and the displeasure of the

working people of Singapore. Privately, he talked tough  with us,

but publicly he allowed the impression of  unity.  He  went  further

and openly  ignored  the election  pledges.  Union  leaders  working

with  the Government  were not even consulted over  legislation. We

ourselves pressed for consultation in the hope and belief  that

we must make the Government  a  success. Instead,   our   desire

and  sincerity   were   being unashamedly abused by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Industrial Relations Ordinance was first

introduced, there was some consternation  among trade  unionists.

The whole purpose of this  Ordinance in its original form was designed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



to silence the workers and their trade unions. There  was

hardly any prior consultation  with  trade unions  and trade

unionists who were working with  the Government. We had to force

the Government  to  listen to  our  representations. Again I am

sure  the  Prime Minister will recall that I was quite prepared to

come to  this House, sit on the Government side and  oppose the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance if  it  had  been pushed  through.

This was in early 1960,  long  before Anson,  Hong Lim and long

before the time  when  there ever  was  this  talk  of  merger.

Sir,  many  of  my colleagues in the trade union movement felt

the  same way, not because we were Communist cadres, but because

we  had  all  along  believed  that  the  trade  union movement

must be organised on an independent basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Culture  will  remember  the  May  Day celebrations  in

1960. People who  are  now  in  the Barisan Sosialis had to

move a resolution for adoption at the May Day meeting, a resolution

that stressed the independence of the trade union movement. People

like the   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for Culture

and Mr Devan Nair were hesitant.  These  are facts  and  I am sure

anyone who chooses to be  honest cannot deny them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is this talk of Communists mounting industrial unrest and controlling trade unions. Sir, we had to stomach quite a lot when we were with the Government, At times, our patience was tried. As for example, when the police forcibly evicted peaceful strikers at Sassoon & Co, in early 1960. That again was before the Anson and Hong Lim by-elections and before this merger. As trade unionists we, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (there was only one man who was absent and that was Mr Devan Nair; he was at home on that day)

went  down  to  the  police  station  and  immediately

protested  forcefully  in a statement  issued  to  the

Press. Sir, the next thing that happened to us was  we

were called up to the office of the Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



and  rebuked for criticising the Government.  Sir,  we

were  prepared to tell the Government then at the time

when  we were in the P.A.P. openly and publicly if  we

disagreed  with  their  labour  policies.  The  former

Minister for Labour knows this to be a fact. In fact, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Minister can have his time to say,

Sir. But I want to refresh the Minister's memory. I am

sure  he is able to recall discussions he has had with

Mr  Woodhull, with me, with Mr Devan Nair  and  with

the   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Culture  on this Sassoon incident. If I may  just  say

this.  Mr Woodhull phoned the Minister for Labour  in

his  residence that night before we issued a statement





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of information?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is the parliamentary practice that

if  a  Member  thinks he is being misrepresented,  the

Member  speaking generally gives way so  long  as  the

Member  who asks for intervention does not abuse  that

courtesy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is not that I do not want to give way

to  him, Sir, but the only problem is I do not want to

take  more time than is necessary to finish my speech.

But if the Minister really has something important  to

say, let us hear him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson

did not know that before the men decided to sit in the

office in the Sassoon strike, they had come to see me.

I  had asked Dominic Puthucheary to see me and he  had

assured  me that though the situation was tense,  they

would  all go home that night. I waited in the  office

till 5.30 p.m., met him personally and he gave me that

personal assurance. Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



that very same night I was not in my residence but was

working  at Crawford, and I got a telephone call  from

Mr  Kandasamy  asking me to go to the Central  Police

Station immediately. I said, "For what?" He said there

was  an  incident and the men in Sassoon  &  Co, were

involved in a clash with the police and some  of  them

were injured. I said to Mr Kandasamy that if the  men

were  injured, they should be brought to  the  General

Hospital. Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Woodhull then  got  on

to  the  phone. He was not satisfied with what  I  had

said  to Mr Kandasamy. He spoke to me personally.  He

said, "Byrne, will you come to the Central Station? We

need  you  because if you come here, you  can  lead  a

demonstration against the police." I said,  "Woodhull,

I have nothing to do with a thing like that." Now that

is not known to the Member for Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am sure the Minister for Health and Law

must now feel happier. Sir, all that I was saying  was

that  we condemn the use of the police on the striking

workers.  We condemned it when we were in  the  P.A.P.

just  as we condemn it now. That is the point  that  I

want  to  make, it is not Communist propaganda  if  we

condemn  a government for using the police in a  trade

dispute. Subsequent to the Sassoon strike, as a result

of     the    discussions    with    the    Government

Minister - particularly the Prime Minister - we  got  them

to  tell  the  police  to stop  interfering  in  trade

disputes.  I  believe the Minister  for  Home  Affairs

instructed   the  police  to  keep  away  from   trade

disputes. But today, all that is forgotten.  Today  we

not  only  have  police officers merrily  intervening.

There  was  a ruling that no police officer should  be

within  50  yards  of  a  trade  dispute.  Now  police

officers  mingle with the strikers. They  carry  tape-recorders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I am sure the Minister for Health

will  have ample opportunity to say whatever he  wants

to  say. If he wants to deny this, he is at liberty to

do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Surely there

should not be a misrepresentation of facts.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order.

[Interruption]  Order. There should  be  no  frivolity

when  the  Speaker  is on his feet. The  Minister  for

Health  will no doubt make a note of that and  correct

any misrepresentation there is. Mr Bani.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, if the Minister feels that I am not

telling the truth, he has always recourse, but  unlike

him I go around and I know full well what happens.  At

least,  Sir,  when  I  was in the  P.A.P.  I  had  the

privilege  of being somewhat respected by  the  police

but -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Member for

Thomson  that if he goes on in this way, the Minister

for  Health  will  be  provoked to  intervene  again?

Perhaps he can carry on with his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The point I wanted to make was that today

police  intervention in trade disputes is an every-day

occurrence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to where we were, those of us in the

trade union movement were deliberately being placed in

an  awkward  position. We were not being consulted  on

Government  actions and legislative measures;  but  by

our  association with the Government we were  supposed

to  bear  the  brunt  of  responsibility.  It  was   a

situation where I would say the Prime Minister  called

the  tune  and we were supposed to play the piper.  We

worked with the Government because we believed that we

would see through a rather difficult situation and  it

was  in the interest of the workers to show moderation

and  restraint and pay full attention to the  economic

facts  of  our existence in Singapore. We  were  quite

prepared   to  shoulder  responsibility,  though   the

political sense displayed by most of the Ministers was

of grave concern to us. In fact, they had no political

sense and no respect for the workers who brought  them

to  power.  The Minister for Culture and the  Minister

for  Finance are two clear examples. The Minister  for

Finance, not long after he became



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



Minister,  once  told  me,  in  the  presence  of  Mr

Woodhull  in the C.P.A. Room, that he would  bust  the

unions  if it was necessary. It was on the eve of  his

departure    to    London   for    financial    talks.

[Interruption]. The Minister for Culture  knows  I  am

quoting  the  Minister for Finance  correctly  because

this  is not the first time I have quoted him. I  have

quoted  him  as having said this before in  the  Prime

Minister's  Office at a meeting when the Minister  for

Culture himself was present. He made it quite clear to

a number of us that if there was no P.A.P., then there

was  no  T.U.C.  He was trying to intimidate  us  into

giving  our  unqualified support to  some  stupid  and

blind  measures  that  the  Government  had  in  mind.

[Interruption]. Sir, the T.U.C. functioned from  early

1960  but  the Communist talk is only now. I am  going

back  briefly into the past purely to show the reasons

why  they  have to talk about the Communists today.  I

have said earlier on - I was specific when I was talking

about  the  Business Houses Employees Union - that  they

could  not attack the Business Houses Employees  Union

because it is doing good work and it has drawn  up  50

agreements providing for wage increases. They  had  to

have  an excuse. What excuse could they think  of  for

attacking  the  trade union leaders?  They  could  not

possibly say, "Mr Lim Ching Siong is a young handsome

man who is loved by the workers because he: stands for

the  workers."  They had to cook  up  some  reason  or

other.  Today  the one way they hope  to  fight  their

political  opponents is to brand them as  Communists - a

ready-made excuse which has been used by the  previous

Government  at  least to the extent  of  carrying  out

repression.  I have no doubt the P.A.P. Government  is

quite prepared to use it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had reasons to be gravely concerned at the

attempts  of the Government to muzzle the trade  union

movement  when  we were in the P.A.P. Nevertheless  in

the  overall interest of co-operation, we  were  quite

prepared  to  tolerate  a  number  of  things,  hoping

eventually to get the Government to rethink and change

its  ways. When the T.U.C. was constituted, we allowed

some rather obedient servants of the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



Minister  not  just to take charge but even  to  throw

their weight about. We were aware of a growing working

class  discontent. We were aware of the need  to  take

immediate  steps  to  unify the trade  unions  in  the

interest  of industrial peace and stability.  We  have

told the Government Ministers this ever since. After a

great  deal  of  haggling, the Trade  Union  Bill  was

introduced.  It  was  debated  and  passed   by   this

Assembly.  We  all  know  what  has  happened  to  it.

Overnight, there was a reversal of Government  policy.

The  registration of four federations of trade  unions

was cancelled. The Trade Union Bill was not allowed to

become  law. The P.A.P., before they came  to  office,

had  pledged  to  unify the trade union  movement.  We

repeatedly  pressed for the unification of  the  trade

union  movement, for only with unification could there

be   order,  discipline  and  fairness  in  industrial

relations.  Sir, I am not suggesting that tomorrow  if

they  bring in the Trade Union Bill and have a  stooge

central  organisation which is not  representative  of

the  trade  unions, and attempt to unify by bulldozing

the unions they will get industrial peace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> What I am saying is that if the Government

are genuine in wanting industrial peace and stability,

let them be fair and reasonable; let them stop playing

politics;    register   and   recognise   a    central

organisation of trade unions that is representative of

the  trade union movement, that would have the respect

of  the  trade unions and the workers, that  would  be

able to influence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



individual  unions in industrial relations that  would

supervise the unification of the trade union  movement

and  try to bring about order in the industrial front.

Sir, only with unification could collective bargaining

processes  be put on the level of stability  and  good

sense.  This seems to have been obvious to the  P.A.P.

during the elections, but once in the saddle after the

elections,  other considerations came to operate.  For

the  sake  of being in power, the P.A.P. leaders  were

prepared  to promise quite a bit for the workers,  but

once  they came to power, their opportunism was  amply

demonstrated. Today they go about their business  with

the noise and vulgarity of turncoats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of all the things that happened in the

days  when  we  were in the P.A.P., we  supported  the

Government  in  the hope of getting  them  to  rectify

themselves.  But in spite of all this,  there  was  no

unification of the trade union movement in  sight.  We

had  been  taken for a jolly good ride. When the  time

came  to  test the Government's honesty, we  saw  very

clearly  that unification was out of the  question  as

far  as the P.A.P. was concerned. As we all know,  the

T.U.C. was  dissolved and I do  not  know  why  today

contradictory statements are being made. I am sure  we

are  all  in a position to remember the news  item  we

read  on  26th  July,  1961 - "BYRNE  TO  DISSOLVE  THE

T.U.C.: KANDASAMY TO ORGANISE NEW SET UP: FUNDS WILL

GO  TO AFFILIATED UNIONS". Sir, this is supposed to be

a democratic Government. You will remember that we are

supposed  to  be  Communists, the people  who  do  not

believe in democratic institutions and who are working

to  wreck  the democratic system. Here is a Government

which self-profess to be democratic, and what do  they

do,  Sir? The Minister for Labour and Law, Mr  K.  M.

Byrne,  acting on a request from the T.U.C. Secretary-General,

Mr  G.  Kandasamy, also  arranged  for  the

registration of trade unions, to distribute the T.U.C.

funds  to  all affiliated unions, and noted  that  Mr

Kandasamy  and  a  number of  his  colleagues  are  to

organise a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



National   Trade  Union  Centre  on  a  non-Communist,

national,  democratic,  socialist  basis,   and   also

dissolve   the   T.U.C.  Sir,   in   this   democratic

Government,  we  see  a P.A.P. man  going  to  another

P.A.P. man  and saying, "Please dissolve the  T.U.C."

The T.U.C. had a Secretariat. There was no meeting  of

the  Secretariat. The T.U.C. had an Executive Council.

There was no meeting of the Executive Council. It  had

delegates.  Under the constitution of the T.U.C.,  the

dissolution  of the T.U.C. must be authorised  by  the

delegates    concerned.   There   was   no   delegates

conference,   no   Executive   Council   meeting,   no

Secretariat meeting. All that they had to do  was  for

Mr Kandasamy, the Secretary-General of the T.U.C., to

tell  the  Minister for Labour and Law, "Dissolve  the

T.U.C.," and the T.U.C. was dissolved. I suggest  that

the  decision  to  dissolve was taken  by  the  P.A.P.

Central   Executive  Committee.  Who  wants  to   play

politics in the trade union movement?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why did they dissolve the T.U.C.?

Was it because there were Communist agitators? Was  it

because there were people who were termed evil men, or

was  it because they did not have a majority? They did

not  have  a majority of men who would be prepared  to

make  the  T.U.C. a  subsidiary organisation  of  the

P.A.P.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we stood for an independent

trade union movement then. We stand for an independent

trade union movement now. I am told some of the unions

are concerned as to what has happened to the funds  of

the  T.U.C.  The  Minister then  said  that  he  would

redistribute the funds to the affiliated unions. But I

understand that to date nothing has been done. We know

the reason why the P.A.P. Government does not want  to

see  a central body of trade unions, for it knows that

such  a  workers' organisation could not be controlled

by the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the train of events has made clear the loss of

confidence  in  the Government within the  P.A.P. and

outside  it,  and  the Government's hostility  to  the

unions has become complete. As I have said, it  is  no

use coming here and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



trying   to  make  suggestions  that  there  will   be

industrial  peace. The first thing that the Government

ought to have is the respect of the workers. For  only

then  can  it be in a position of prestige to maintain

industrial peace. But this is certainly not the  case.

The  Government knows full well what I say to be true.

In  1959,  immediately  after the  general  elections,

there  was  industrial peace; as I have said  earlier,

unprecedented  industrial peace. I  am  sure,  as  the

Prime  Minister  has said, we have 300  Communists  in

Singapore. These 300 Communists were also in Singapore

in  1959, May, June, July, August, September, October,

November  and December. Early 1960 strikes  increased,

as  the  Government statistics quite clearly  show.  I

believe that in 1960 there were very many more strikes

than   in   1959  because  the  workers  were  getting

disillusioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government having completely lost the

support  of  the workers is now using the Ministry  of

Labour  and  other Government machinery to  break  and

discredit  trade  unions  and trade  union  leadership

which  are not prepared to toe the P.A.P. line. Today,

arbitrary   Government  intervention   in   legitimate

disputes of the workers is an everyday occurrence. The

Government  show  bias against  the  majority  of  the

unions  which are unions not under the control of  the

P.A.P.  The best thing the Government can  do  in  the

circumstances is to resign. But since they do not wish

to  do that, the only sane thing for them to do is  to

let the unions and the employers work things out among

themselves. There is a far better prospect of peace if

employers and unionists could iron things out  between

themselves;  if  the Labour Ministry ceases  to  be  a

P.A.P. instrument - it strikes me  sometimes  that  the

Labour Ministry is the only branch of the P.A.P. left

ticking.  I  think it is necessary to  warn  employers

that  the  Government of today may well have a  vested

interest in industrial unrest. The sensible thing  for

them  to  do is to be realistic and come to a  lasting

settlement  with the employees. We do  not  trust  the

Government  to  act in a responsible manner.  We  know

that all this talk of Communist agitators and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



Communist  unions is merely to carry out a  repression

of political forces that are against the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. came into office with a special

recommendation, lt had the support of the workers  and

their trade unions, and was therefore in a position to

make  the  slogan  "industrial peace with  justice"  a

meaningful one. But the power crazy Prime Minister was

too smug once he became Prime Minister. He saw himself

in  an  indispensable role and wanted  to  ensure  his

position  in  that role. Today, the P.A.P. Government,

by  their  own actions, have lost the support  of  the

workers  who brought it to power. In fact,  they  have

incurred  the anger and hostility of the workers.  The

Labour  Front came into office on a militant Left-wing

platform and ended up a totally reactionary force. The

P.A.P. has travelled the same trodden route, and  has

common  ground  with  its old  opponents  now  in  the

S.P.A., and so they both talk in the same terms.  They

both  talk  of  the Communist threat.  Sir,  the  same

policies  that  were rejected by the  people  are  now

being  put into force. Mr Speaker, Sir, I need hardly

state  the outcome of the anti-worker policies of  the

Government. I have no doubt that at the end of it all,

all  this cry of Communism can only mean the graveyard

for the P.A.P.

Minister for Finance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> For the best part of the day the

Member for Thomson spent a great deal of time -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> G. G. Thomson, is it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - saying what a terrible Government

this  is - police brutality. He used the  phrase  "using

the  police".  He never told you what was  the  police

used  for. The impression left behind is that we  used

the  police to beat up workers and arrest them. If  we

were  really against the workers and trade  unionists,

there would be empty Benches here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> You have not got the guts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Cairnhill can tell

you  that  there  are ways and means  of  doing  these

things.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> At least the Member for

Cairnhill had the guts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> A little bit more, and many of them

would have had more nervous twitches than they have at

the moment. So, Sir, all this long rigmarole, implying

police  brutality,  using the police,  the  P.A.P. is

doing  this  and that - let me first say  that  if  the

Barisan  Sosialis and the Communists who run them  can

get one single picture of actual police brutality,  of

police   beating  up  workers,  I  think  the  General

Employees  Union would be prepared to pay  $50,000  to

publish  just one such picture. I have looked  through

their  publications and those of the  S.G.E.U.,  Suara

Kesatuan. They have been publishing pictures  intended

to   convey  to  the  workers  the  extent  of  police

brutality, Government brutality. I refer to the  issue

of 3lst December, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In Chinese?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In Chinese, Sir. Unlike the

gentleman there, I can even read Chinese without being

able  to  understand a word of it. To  that  extent  I

emulate the Member for Queenstown. In this publication

there  are six pictures intended to convey how  brutal

and  how  wicked this P.A.P. Government is. The  first

picture   shows  two  gentlemen  looking   through   a

window - police brutality. The second picture shows  two

policemen   talking   to  another  gentleman -   police

brutality. The third shows three policemen, with hands

folded, watching six



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



other    gentlemen,   obviously   conversing -   police

brutality.  The  fourth picture shows  four  policemen

just  facing the camera - police brutality, using police

action.  The  fifth  is a very bad photograph  but  it

shows  the  back of a policeman - police brutality.  The

only  picture where it shows police brutality  is  the

sixth  picture, which is a cartoon that  they  had  to

draw.  That  is the only picture they can  produce  of

police brutality. It shows a policeman with a club and

a  rifle stamping on what looks like a worker. That is

the only instance of police brutality that the Barisan

Sosialis  could  produce and the Communists,  who  run

them,  can  produce. That is police brutality  out  of

their imagination.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have noticed the Minister for

Culture pointing at the opposite Benches, and  I  have

not  stopped  him until now. I think  he  is  probably

overdoing it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Probably the pointing finger could

be used on some occasion outside the Assembly. So that

is  all  they  could produce of police brutality.  You

have  a lot of words, pen portraits, fairy tales,  but

not a single iota of evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Thomson, in order to build up

his  myth  of  an oppressive Government  beating  down

workers and to produce evidence of that, spent a great

deal of time talking about what he called the historic

Robinson  strike.  This  is  his  evidence  of  police

brutality,   Sir.  So  I  looked  up   some   of   the

photographs,  both in the Chinese  Press  and  in  the

English  Press,  to  check up on  any  evidence  of  a

bloodstained  worker, of a worker being dragged  about

with his arm twisted and so on. All I could find which

could  come something near to the use of violence  was

on  the  front  page  of  the Straits  Times  of  12th

September.  It  shows a picture of a gentleman  called

Foo  Yong  Fong  who,  I understand,  can  also  write

because the Member for Queenstown read a very polished

piece of prose by Mr Foo Yong Fong, obviously with  a

view to impressing upon the workers of Singapore that,

apart   from  rather  strange  habits  like   pressing

cigarette buts into people -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understand that particular

case is sub judice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Apart from other accomplishments, he

could also write in excellent language. Sir, the  only

evidence  I could find was a picture here [Indicating]

of two policemen trying to hold back Mr Foo Yong Fong

who was trying to get into a Black Maria. Evidence  of

police brutality! Here is a gentleman who is so afraid

of  the  police that he is struggling to  get  into  a

Black  Maria.  That is the nearest one  I  could  come

across of the use of any kind of violence on the  part

of  the leader of the workers. The first picture shows

the  police  holding arms to allow  the  workers,  the

terrified  workers, the workers who were going  to  be

beaten  up by the police, oppressed by the Government,

to  give them a chance to get into the Black Maria  in

an  orderly  fashion.  There is another  picture  here

[Indicating]  showing salesgirls and women  clerks  of

Robinson  walking  out  of  the  store,  laughing  and

smiling, into a waiting police van. Evidence of police

brutality  and  oppression! Sir, in  a  country  where

there  are  no  strikes - the strike  problem  has  been

solved by the People's Democracy which they admired so

much - if there is any suggestion that a police van  is

anywhere  around the vicinity, it is an  occasion  for

considerable alarm, and perhaps there would be a hasty

exit  by the back door. But here, under the oppressive

rule  of  the P.A.P., salesgirls and striking  workers

were smiling as they walked into the van. Not only did

they  walk into the van with great enthusiasm but  the

police  had to keep control, saying, "You can  get  in

there,  but,  please  two at a time."  These  are  the

evidence of police brutality!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, the Member for Thomson spent a

great  deal  of  time quoting instances  of  what  had

happened:  "The  police  were used.  The  police  were

used." In other words, what were the police used  for?

Obviously in this case to help strikers to get into  a

police van in an orderly way. In the same issue of the

Straits  Times  of  13th September,  1961,  after  the

strike  was  over,  we heard a great  deal  about  the

terrible things the Government did and the police did.

This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



is one portion of the report. Dr Lee Siew Choh said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All reports clearly indicate that the strike at

Robinson was peaceful from the outset. In fact,  there

was  a great deal of friendliness between the strikers

and the police officers who were placed on duty.'



<br><br>And  yet  the Member for Thomson spent, I think,  the

best  part of an hour on this historic Robinson strike

where the brutal police, the terrible Government,  was

oppressing  the workers. And there was the Member  for

Queenstown, the Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis - at

that time I do not think the Barisan Sosialis had  yet

been  formed - saying that there was a  great  deal  of

friendliness between the strikers and police officers.

How  is  it that the police who were going to beat  up

and oppress the workers could be friendly with them?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Would you allow me to explain,

Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I wanted to say that there was a

lot of friendliness between the police and the workers

until  the  police were ordered by the  Government  to

take action against the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I have already indicated what

happened  after that. The police were helping  smiling

girls  to  get into the police van where they insisted

on  going.  If  we had stopped them from going, there

would  have  been another statement to say how  brutal

this  Government  was because it prevented  salesgirls

who  were on strike from getting into the police  van.

Either way it would have been wrong. But whatever  you

might  say,  Sir - and I think the Member for Queenstown

was  quite right - either way the police officers  were

friendly. They were helping the salesgirls who  wanted

to  go to the police station and to get a free ride at

the  tax-payers' expense; though it is quite improper,

Sir,  to  ride in a Black Maria without lawful reason.

But the P.A.P. Government is always obliging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Committing trespass!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Lest it should be thought that we

were  oppressing the workers by refusing to allow them

to get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



a  free  ride  in  the Black Maria, we suggested  that

perhaps  the  police should indulge their  fancy.  All

this business of the Robinson strike is an attempt  to

suggest  that  when  they used the  words  "using  the

police", any implication that we were using the police

to  heat up the workers is obviously not true.  If  it

had  been  true,  there would have  been  a  few  more

illegal  posters of the photograph all over the  city.

All  they  could do, as I have said, was  to  draw  a

cartoon  suggesting that the police had used  violence

and intimidation. That is a measure of the accuracy of

many of the statements by the Barisan Sosialis. I  can

understand what happened, because, just to be fair  to

the  Barisan Sosialis, obviously when the  Member  for

Queenstown has nobody prompting him, he is a  cornered

man. He was with the P.A.P., so he spoke honestly.  On

the   same  day  there  was  another  meeting  of  the

Preparatory  Committee  of  the  S.A.T.U.  Nobody  had

phoned  him up and told him what the line was, because

at  that  meeting  there  were  denunciations  of  the

police.  Obviously if the reporter had  gone  there  a

couple of hours later, the Member for Queenstown would

have  given a different version. As we know,  Sir,  in

this Assembly very often he takes the wrong line, much

to the consternation of many of his colleagues outside

this  Assembly. I do not think any of the workers  are

very  much  taken in by the Barisan Sosialis'  attempt

during  the  last nine months to build up  hatred  and

indignation against the Government. So today they  are

put  in  a  position  of saying, "We  are  really  not

interested in strikes."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Member for Thomson did not know how to

end  up  his  peroration. So he decided that  we,  the

Government,  have  a  vested  interest  in   promoting

industrial  unrest.  This is the first  time  we  have

heard  it.  Obviously the whole thing has misfired.  I

shall  show later the whole purpose of this industrial

unrest  which  the  Barisan Sosialis  have  generated.

There  are  two different types of industrial  unrest.

There   is   industrial  unrest   based   on   genuine

discontent.  There  have been  many  strikes  by  non-Communist-controlled unions, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  Government  has in no way  suggested  for  one

moment  that  those strikes are Communist  strikes  or

Communist-controlled  strikes.  There  was  the   City

Council  strike. Nobody ever said that  those  strikes

were Communist-controlled or Communist-inspired. There

was  the  Army Civil Service Union strike.  A  lot  of

individual  firms  had strikes. But  we  must  make  a

distinction  between  strikes  by  leaders   who   are

interested  in promoting the economic welfare  of  the

workers  and  the Communists who are  using  them  for

political ends. As I shall show later on, the  Barisan

Sosialis  are not interested in promoting the  welfare

of   the  workers,  but  in  promoting  the  cause  of

Communism.  It  is  very interesting  that  throughout

yesterday  and today, Members of the Barisan  Sosialis

kept   on   saying,   "Communist  bogey";   "so-called

Communists";  "Communist smear". But they  never  said

one  word which would dispose of our allegation -  deny

that  they are Communists; deny that the men  who  run

the   Barisan  Sosialis  or  some  of  them  are   not

Communists. They never denied that. That fits in  with

the Communist strategy, Sir. According to the textbook

manual,  Lenin says, a good Communist must be prepared

to  lie  to  cover up the fact that he is a Communist.

That is part of the Communist technique.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You never read the statement of

the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In fact, Sir, a few days ago, the

Member  for  Nee Soon, in the course of  an  argument,

said,  "I am not a Communist." I say very good. It  is

the  first time I have heard a Barisan Sosialis Member

saying categorically that he is not a Communist.  Then

I  asked, "Would you therefore be prepared to tell the

people  of  Singapore - the Government is  prepared  to

give  you  radio time to go on the air - 'Why  I  oppose

Communism. Why I reject Communism.'?" First he  said,

"Yes." Then he said, "No. I will consider it." Then he

said, "Please write to me." I have written to him  two

or three days ago, and not a peep out of him. Whatever

they might say - they might say smear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



and  so on, which they do say - they have not said,  "We

are  not Communists. If you say we are Communists,  we

are  prepared to come and repudiate it." Better still,

come out and say why you are not a Communist. That  is

the  most  convincing way to say I am not a Communist,

and  say,  "These  are the reasons  why  I  am  not  a

Communist." If any Member of the Barisan Sosialis  can

say  that  publicly - come out anywhere, write  in  any

newspaper,  talk  over  the  radio,  "Why   I   reject

Communism," then we will believe him. But I  can  give

an  assurance,  Sir, that not a single Member  of  the

Barisan Sosialis or the men who run the Party will  be

prepared  to accept this open invitation to  come  and

talk over the radio, saying. "Why we reject Communism.

Why  we  think Communism is unsuitable for Singapore."

It  is quite clear that they are getting more and more

uncomfortable over this motion, because the essence of

Communist strategy, as I shall read out from extracts,

from  the  big  Lenin -  these are  the  small  Lenins -telling  how it is necessary for Communists to conceal

their  identity when working in unions  and  political

Parties. And these are men who are learning the  task.

A  good Communist would not use these tactics, saying,

"It  is a smear". He would say, "I am not a Communist.

I   am  prepared  even  to  swear  that  I  am  not  a

Communist." He is prepared to argue. A good  Communist

should  be  able  to  do  that.  But  these  are  only

tenderfoots. So, therefore, they have been reduced for

the  time being to saying, "Oh, it is all a smear.  It

is a bogey."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me therefore start off with the whole thesis of

our  argument about the industrial strife. Some of the 13  Assemblymen will get an opportunity  to  reply  to

this.  There are two categories of industrial  unrest.

One of them springs from the genuine discontent of the

workers motivated by the desire to improve their  lot.

To  that  extent, the Government has never in any  way

made  any attempt to hamper them in so far as they  go

about  their  business of carrying out the  industrial

dispute   against   employers   in   a   lawful    and

constitutional manner. In fact, the Government has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



often  gone  out  of its way to assist  them.  But

where   we  know  that  the  Communist  industrial

dispute   has  not  the  slightest  intention   of

increasing the living standard of the workers  but

has other objectives, to that extent we single  it

out.  The Member for Thomson kept on saying,  "Oh,

the  Government is smearing trade unionists,"  and

so  on. We are not smearing trade unionists,  Sir.

We  are  smearing certain trade unionists whom  we

have  named.  One of them is the Secretary-General

of   the  Barisan  Sosialis,  a  prominent   trade

unionist   who,   we  have  said   repeatedly   in

statements outside and inside the Assembly, is  an

open  front  Communist  leader.  The  Member   for

Queenstown kept on saying, "Oh, this is a  bogey,"

and that we were imagining things. All right, Sir.

Is  this imagination? This is from the Battle  For

Merger,  about which hook a lot of questions  were

asked.  So I can understand why this hook  becomes

more  and  more embarrassing because  there  is  a

document  here  by Mr Lim Ching  Siong,  part  of

which reads as follows [Page 120]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must forever remember: We have already sworn

before  the  Red  flag  and old  Stalin.  We  must

resolutely   uphold   the   interests    of    the

Organisation   at   all  times   and   under   all

circumstances.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogey, Sir? Old Stalin and Red flag. Is it a

bogey, imagination, a forgery? He is placed behind

the  Barisan Sosialis and the trade union movement

associated  with  the Barisan Sosialis.  Communist

bogey? Denial? We would have laughed, if they said

it  was a forgery. There is no denial. All we  had

was  "a smear"; not that it is false; not that  it

is  a forgery; it is a smear; it is a bogey. Then,

remember,  Sir, not so many years  ago,  when  the

Member  for  Cairnhill was in the saddle,  certain

gentlemen -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Why call them gentleman?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - comrades were suddenly

accused in those days of being pro-Communists  and

Communists.  They used to say it was a  smear  and

they  still  say it is a smear. Sir, may  I  quote

also from the Battle For Merger documents,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



which certainly show that far from Communism being

a   bogey  and  a  smear  and  a  figment  of  our

imagination, these gentlemen are conscious of  the

fact  that  the  Communists are here.  This  is  a

statement signed by Woodhull, Fong Swee Suan,  Lim

Ching Siong, Devan Nair and Chan Chiaw Thor:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"It was not the might of British arms which

defeated the armed revolt led by the M.C.P....".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot imagine British arms fighting a

bogey;  eight  years, nine years,  they  obviously

fought an organisation which exists. In fact,  the

truth  must  be  told. The M.C.P. is  the  oldest

political   Party  in  Malaya.  Has  it   vanished

overnight?  Are  we  imagining  things?  Here  are

Messrs. Woodhull, Fong Swee Suan, Lim Ching Siong,

Devan  Nair  and Chan Chiaw Thor talking  of  real

things  that  exist.  Again in  another  statement

called  "The  Road to Socialism in an  Independent

Malaya":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No sane person can claim today that the M.C.P.

revolt  is  directed  against British  Imperialist

domination of Malaya.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were they talking of a bogey directed against

British  imperialism? A figment of the imagination

being  directed against the British  imperialists?

Or  was  it  something real? Another statement  by

James  Puthucheary  who now says  all  this  is  a

smear. In fact, he says he is not quite sure there

are  Communists, and yet he has written a  letter.

Sir, this is the hard cover edition, page 196, in

which (just the relevant part of the sentence)  he

says:

`...I broke with my political friends in 1951,...'.



<br><br>Lest  we  should  be in doubt  as  to  who  these

political friends are, he goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Though I had rejected some of what were

considered  basic  tenets,  and  was  critical  of

Communist regimentation...'.



<br><br>Sir,  I cannot imagine Mr James Puthucheary being

regimented. A figment of the imagination. Then  he

goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`My return from Communism ...'.



<br><br>And yet he used to say it was a smear. He says  it

does not exist and the Members opposite today  say

the same thing - "It is a smear. Communism does not

exist." A figment of their imagination.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



Maybe  one day they will be writing documents  for  us

saying "My return from Communism".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, before we start discussing the problem of

industrial unrest, it is necessary to start  with  the

basic  reality  that  Communism is  a  movement  which

exists  with specific aims and purposes, and  that  in

this  industrial unrest, it is a big  factor  and  the

Barisan  Sosialis  are  one  of  the  factors  in  the

Communist  conspiracy in Singapore and Malaya  and  in

Malaysia. If you start off with the assumption that it

is  all  a  smear,  a figment of the imagination,  the

whole  thing becomes meaningless. The hard  facts  are

there.  The gentlemen who know this admit and  concede

that   these  are  the  realities  of  the   political

situation.  So  once we work on that basis,  then  all

this  business about the Government being  brutal  and

oppressing  the workers becomes clear.  Why  they  are

saying  this  and  why  they are fomenting  industrial

unrest  is  because,  as  a  Communist  Party  and   a

Communist  group, they are doing the things which  are

expected  of  them  as Communists.  Their  brutalising

techniques  are things which are expected of  them  as

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my purpose to start from the realities, the

facts, that the Barisan Sosialis is a Communist  front

organisation being manipulated for Communist ends, and

that all the stories we have heard are explainable  if

this basic reality is accepted. Sir, nobody who is  of

sound mind - and that includes the Barisan Sosialis - will

deny that there is mounting industrial unrest and that

it  is on a scale to warrant concern by this Assembly.

Even  the Member for Anson, who argued that there  was

no  cause  for  alarm  because he loved  strikes,  was

nevertheless  constrained to move an amendment  asking

the  Government to take all possible steps  to  ensure

industrial  peace with justice. Even  he  accepts  the

fact,  whatever the reason, that there  is  industrial

unrest.  Sir,  insofar  as the  Member  for  Cairnhill

confined himself to facts to show that there has  been

an  abnormal increase of strikes in recent months,  he

was  being  objective. However, when  dealing  with  a

politician of the calibre



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



and  experience of the Member for Cairnhill, one  must

be  a  little bit wary of some of the not  so  helpful

suggestions  he occasionally offers to the Government.

He  professed  to offer us buckets of water  yesterday

and  today  to  help put out the fires  of  industrial

unrest, but occasionally I noticed he was slipping  in

buckets of kerosene. In fact, one of the great sources

of   disappointment  for  the  pro-Communists  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis  and in their  unions  is  that  the

Government  has not tried to dampen industrial  unrest

by pouring buckets of kerosene -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Pouring oil on troubled waters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What has been and is annoying the

pro-Communists is that the Government  has  not  sided

with the employers as they say we do; that it has,  in

fact,  not  sided with employers to bust  up  strikes,

including  political  strikes  fomented  by  the  pro-Communists,  or persecute labour leaders  or  use  the

police  to  beat  up  strikers.  We  have  denied  the

Communists  opportunities  for  sparking  off  violent

clashes  between  workers  and  police.  We  have  not

behaved in the way that Communist manuals say that  an

anti-worker government should behave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the ordinary worker even when on

strike  does  not  resort to  violence  unless  he  is

provoked into it either by a blundering government  or

unless  he  has a violent and abiding hatred  for  the

government. None of these factors are present  at  the

moment.  That  is  why though the pro-Communists  have

tried  their level best to convert legitimate workers'

grievances  into  a violent political assault  against

the  Government, they have not been able to make  much

headway. The ordinary worker is ready to go on  strike

to  get  better conditions and where he has done  this

purely   to   get   better  working  conditions,   the

Government  has either offered to help him settle  the

dispute;  or  even  where he has  been  manoeuvred  by

Communist  politicians  into  carrying  on  with   the

strike,  the  Government has not interfered  with  his

right to strike peacefully -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is a convenient time

to  suspend. I propose to suspend until 9 p.m. I  will

take this Chair again at 9 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 9.00 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Member of the Barisan

Sosialis  kept  on  repeating that the  Government  is

trying to criticise workers for going on strike. As  I

have said, there is a distinction between workers  who

go  on  strike  wholly and primarily to improve  their

conditions  of work, and strikes organised by  certain

leaders  for the purpose of furthering Communist  ends

and  Communist objectives. We concede to  workers  who

are  willing to go on strike to get better  conditions

of  pay,  and where they have done this the Government

has either offered to help settle the dispute or, even

where   they   have  been  manoeuvred   by   Communist

politicians  into carrying on with a strike,  has  not

interfered   with   the  workers'  right   to   strike

peacefully. Therefore, the Communist myth of a wicked,

oppressive,  brutal  and  anti-worker  Government   is

difficult to sustain. This being the case, the Barisan

Sosialis  leaders  and  the trade  union  leaders  are

reduced  to  merely  creating  imaginary  pictures  of

violence  and brutality on the part of the Government.

Sir,  the mere presence of the police near the pickets

to  ensure that peace and order are maintained is,  in

the  Barisan  Sosialis  propaganda,  transformed  into

Fascist oppression by the police. Any and every  wordy

altercation between the police and the workers,  which

often  happens  during a strike, is distorted  by  the

Barisan   Sosialis   propagandists   into   a   bloody

oppression and persecution of the working class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this sort of fabrication can only serve to

puzzle  the workers who may have seen with  their  own

eyes  that these instances of brutality were  no  more

than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



the  usual incidents where the police are called  upon

to ensure the preservation of peace and order during a

strike.  Because the police have not resorted to  acts

of  violence and brutality against workers on  strike,

it  has  become  necessary for the  pro-Communists  in

S.A.T.U. to   resort  to  acts   of   violence   and

intimidation  against  the  workers.  The  motive   is

obvious.   By  carrying  out  acts  of  violence   and

intimidation themselves, the Communists know that they

will be inviting intervention by the police who have a

duty  to  see  that law and order are  preserved.  But

since the police have refused to be provoked into acts

of  violence,  the  Communists themselves  indulge  in

displays  of violence against the workers in order  to

attract  their  attention and genially  to  create  an

impression  that industrial violence is  taking  place

and  that  the Government and the police  are  somehow

responsible   for   such   incidents.   So   such   an

intervention  could then be presented as  evidence  of

police violence and intimidation. However, it is quite

clear  from  the agitation of the Member  for  Thomson

that   these   fairy  tales  about  intimidation   and

oppression by the State have so far failed to cut  any

ice  with  the  workers. So the Barisan  Sosialis  are

reduced to merely uttering the refrain that the P.A.P.

Government  is  anti-worker,  Pro-capitalist  and   is

working  hand  in glove with Japanese capitalists,  as

the  Member  for Queenstown alleged, that the  workers

are groaning under the reactionary heel of the P.A.P.,

and  that  they  live in fear of P.A.P. brutality  and

oppression. Sir, it is quite clear that not  even  the

Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen really believe all  this.

If  we  are  what they say we are, then not  a  single

Barisan  Sosialis Assemblyman will be in this  Chamber

to  make tongue-in-cheek allegations of this sort.  If

we  are really anti-worker and pro-employer, if we are

really  determined  to  use  violence  and  oppression

against the workers, then I can assure you, Sir,  that

there  will not be a single strike in Singapore today.

May  I  suggest  to  the Barisan  Sosialis  that  even

falsehoods,  to  be  effective,  must  at   least   be

plausible.  They cannot convince the people  that  the

P.A.P. is  an  enemy  of the  workers  and  is  using

violence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



against them when, in fact, it is the Barisan Sosialis

strong-arm  men who have to intimidate fellow  workers

and   do  violence  to  other  workers.  That  is  the

situation.  There is not a single instance,  and  they

cannot produce a single instance, where the Government

has used unlawful violence or unjust force against the

workers. But the Barisan Sosialis leaders have had  to

use violence to intimidate the workers into supporting

them.  In  fact,  the Member for Thomson,  who  always

plays  about with half-truths, said that an  editorial

of  the  Petir  attacked the workers of the  Singapore

Business  Houses Employees Union. If he had  read  the

editorial, he would have discovered that it was not an

attack  against the workers of the Singapore  Business

Houses  Employees Union but against the pro-Communists

who  are  manipulating  the white-collar  workers  for

Communist ends. In fact, the editorial gave an account

of  the  rally  that  the  Singapore  Business  Houses

Employees  Union organised under the cloak  that  they

were calling a mass meeting to explain the problems of

the  commercial  workers in Singapore.  That  was  the

pretext  given to entice workers to come to this  mass

rally. But, in fact, what happened was that on the day

of  the meeting numerous buses were parked outside the

various  business houses, and as the workers came  out

they were shepherded by the stewards who told them  to

go  into  the  buses because they had to  go  to  this

meeting.  So  they were dragooned into going  to  this

mass  rally where it became clear to the workers,  who

had  gone there expecting to hear something about  the

problems of the white-collar workers - the meeting  did

not  start until well past the schedule time; then  at

seven,  there  was a long harangue all  about  merger,

Malaysia  and so on - that there was nothing  about  the

problems  of the white-collar workers. At about  seven

o'clock, the Chairman of the meeting said, "Well,  our

Muslim brothers are here and it is the Puasa month. So

those  who want to go and break their fast may leave."

So  the  hail  became spectacularly empty because  the

Muslims and the non-Muslims made a bolt for the  door.

There were little altercations. A number of ladies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



said, "Well, I have come to this meeting to hear about

the  problems of the white-collar workers.  I  have  a

child  who  has not been fed and I have  been  sitting

here  at  this meeting listening to merger.  Malaysia,

and so on."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This editorial was intended to show the typical

Communist strategy: first you urged people into  buses

and  made  quite  sure  that nobody  escaped  at  five

o'clock. The buses were waiting there; gentlemen  were

looking  around and everyone was given a card so  that

they  knew  who  came  and who did  not  come  to  the

meeting.  Then  at  seven o'clock, the  people  became

hungry. Everybody wanted to break the fast - Muslims and

non-Muslims.  The hail was half-empty. Mr  Bani,  who

was  supposed to be the last speaker, appealed to  the

members,  "Please, it will not be a long speech,"  and

the  meeting closed earlier than expected. This  is  a

typical strategy of the pro-Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the Member for Thomson said that the

editorial  was attacking the workers in the  Singapore

Business  House  Employees  Union,  he  was  obviously

stating a falsehood. But the attack was on the way the

Communists  are  trying  to dragoon  the  white-collar

workers to their revolutionary machine. I do not think

they  are  getting very far with it. That is  why  you

notice that the Member for Thomson today spent a great

deal  of  his  time making a speech intended  for  the

white-collar  workers.  He said.  "We  are  reasonable

chaps.  It  is  the  Government  which  has  a  vested

interest  in starting strikes and industrial  strife."

By  and  large, the white-collar workers are beginning

to realise that they might welcome assistance from the

Barisan Sosialis insofar as they manage to get  better

conditions  of  work.  We are  not  denying  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis  have not done that.  But  they  are

doing  that only as an inducement and a bribe  to  see

that  the  white-collar workers are hitched  on  to  a

revolutionary chariot which everybody knows is set  on

a  course  where  the  end of the  line  is  a  cliff.

Everybody knows that, even the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they talk of the P.A.P. Government being

anti-worker and being repressive, nobody believes  it.

How genuine are the Barisan Sosialis leaders when they

say  all these things about the P.A.P, being an  anti-worker  Government? Again in the Petir of  17th  June,

1961, Mr S. Woodhull wrote an article. This was about

nine  months ago. Sir, Mr Woodhull is something of  a

pundit  in  the  Barisan Sosialis, and echoes  of  his

literary  style  from time to time  emanate  from  the

mouth  of  the Member for Queenstown. The  article  is

entitled  "Two  Years of Concrete  Progress".  It  was

published  in June last year, just before  the  split,

and  the  progress,  I can assure you,  Sir,  did  not

relate  to  the progress of Mr Woodhull  but  to  the

progress  which  he claimed the P.A.P. Government  had

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what Mr Woodhull, now the script writer

for  the Barisan Sosialis, had to say about the labour

policies   of   the   P.A.P.  Government   which   his

mouthpiece,  the Member for Queenstown, now  denounces

as   anti-worker,  as  having  done  nothing  for  the

workers.  Let me quote from a rather lengthy  article -   obviously  we had made -a lot of progress  during  the

two  years, so it took him four pages, 12 columns,  to

set  down our achievements. But I shall not weary  the

House with all of it but take some extracts in so  far

as they relate to our labour policies. This is what he

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As a reflection of the new spirit that now obtains

in  the  trade union front, considerable  changes  and

improvements  of working conditions have been  brought

about since the P.A.P, came into office.'



<br><br>Yet  the  same  script  writer gets  the  Member  for

Queenstown  to  say  that nothing has  been  achieved.

Workers  have  suffered under the  P.A.P.  Government.

Here  is  Mr  Woodhull saying on  the  contrary  that

"considerable  changes  and  improvements  of  working

conditions  have been brought about since  the  P.A.P.

came into office." He says that one union has drawn up

over  300  agreements concerning  improved  wages  and

other working conditions in the last 18 months. That



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



was  something  like one agreement  every  three  days

during the past two succeeding years.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> They must have been

working overtime.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They were not only working overtime,

but obviously working all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This historic change [not just a change, Sir, but a

historic change] in the industrial situation has  been

made possible because government has made it clear  to

employers that they will have to respect the rights of

trade unions.'



<br><br>This was written nine months ago-two months before the

break occurred between the non-Communists and the pro-Communists in the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again Sir, we have heard a lot about the P.A.P.

victimising  the  workers,  pushing  them  around,  no

sympathy  for  the  workers,  lost  contact  with  the

workers  - you  have heard all that, Sir. Mr  Woodhull

had this to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The days of victimisation of trade unionists and

workers  are  over.  The law is now being  effectively

implemented and workers are having the full benefit of

it  all.  As a result of the effective application  of

the  law, workers have received $l,628,670.47  due  to

them.'



<br><br>Now,  Sir, you will note that Mr Woodhull was such  a

stickler  for accuracy that he worked it  out  to  the

last 47 cents. I cannot say of the script which he now

writes  for  the  Member  for  Queenstown  as  regards

accuracy  of  facts.  But  in  this  case  there   was

$1,628,670.47  cents. These were the things  that  the

workers  got in addition as a result of the  effective

application of the law during the past two years.  Yet

again, Sir, Mr Woodhull wrote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister for Labour and Law had informed the

Chinese  bus  companies  that  they  could  no  longer

exploit the workers and, as a result of this, $700,000

was  paid to the members of the Singapore Bus  Workers

Union. These are only a few examples of how Government

has actively helped improve the bargaining position of

hundreds of unions.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as he said, these are only a few examples. We

gave  him  four  pages due to lack of space,  and  due

regard  for  the  modesty of the Government  no  doubt

prevented   Mr   Woodhull  from  specifying   further

examples  of the concrete progress that had been  made

by  the  P.A.P. during its two years of office.  Then,

Sir, like a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



good  non-Communist democrat, he  sums  up  the  whole

thing  in  two very punchy slogans - it is all in  black

type, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Gone are the days of repression of trade union

activity.'



<br><br>Yet  we hear the Barisan Sosialis Members saying  how

we  are  oppressing the workers. As far back as  June,

which  is  less than a year ago, there was nothing  of

that  kind. "Gone are the days of repression of  trade

union activity." And still further, a second slogan:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Trade unions have achieved a new dignity under a

new Government.'



<br><br>Sir,  I  do  not  know what Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  think of Mr Woodhull. Obviously there  must

be  two  Mr  Woodhull. The problem that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  have is to decide which is the  genuine  Mr

Woodhull  that  they have to live with;  the  one  who

wrote  this or the one who writes some of the speeches

that  Members of the Barisan Sosialis utter from  time

to  time. Mr Woodhull was either lying here or he was

lying in the speeches that are often read out in  this

Chamber.  I do not know, but would they say  that  Mr

Woodhull, the real revolutionary, a man of the people,

wrote this for $1,100 as Political Secretary, or is he

writing other speeches for far less pay for the cause?

That  is  the  problem that the Barisan Sosialis  must

decide  for themselves: which is the real Mr Woodhull

who  is speaking the truth? Or has he got two tongues

in his cheek?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the one hand, we are told that we are

oppressors of the workers; we are terrible people;  we

have  no  contact with the workers. And  here  is  Mr

Woodhull,  who is not only a prominent member  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  but I understand  he  now  conducts

political classes for Barisan Sosialis cadres  in  the

trade unions, especially in the English-speaking trade

unions.  Sir,  is  he  a searcher  for  truth?  Is  he

conducting  the same type of classes,  of  writing  or

speaking with his tongue in his cheek as he did  here,

or  is  he, since he left the P.A.P. no longer a  non-Communist  socialist? Or has he, therefore,  taken  to

the ethics of the Communist techniques, which say that

it  is necessary for a good revolutionary sometimes to

conceal his ideas and, if necessary, sacrifice  truth,

i.e., it may be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



necessary for him to speak falsehoods? So this is  one

of the problems that the Barisan Sosialis will have to

decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, I notice that the Member

for Thomson and a few others took great care to fasten

their  attack  on one of their former colleagues.  Mr

Devan Nair. In fact, some rather scathing remarks were

made  suggesting that Mr Devan Nair is a phoney trade

unionist, that he also was one of the chaps who joined

in  to  oppress the workers. Let me contrast him  with

Mr  Woodhull,  who wrote this when he  was  Political

Secretary  drawing $1,100. As for Mr Devan Nair,  let

us  tell  them  that he was offered the  same  job  as

Political Secretary, carrying a salary of $1,100.  And

very  early on i.e, a few months later, having  worked

with  the gentleman who now says that he is a  phoney,

he  said,  "I  am afraid lots of things are  going  to

happen. So it is better for me not to accept this  job

because  when  I signed the statement  saying  that  I

really believed in non-Communist socialism for Malaya,

I  was  sincere about it. And there will come  a  time

when  those  who  signed  that  statement  with  their

tongues in their cheeks would smear me." So he decided

to  quit  the  job to take on a job as a  teacher  for

$530.  That  is  his salary today. He is  now  in  the

Council  for  Adult Education, and he is  getting  far

less  than many of the Junior Officers connected  with

the  Adult Education Board. He was a far-sighted  man.

He  knew  that  if he had stayed on, they  would  have

smeared  him.  Today they cannot smear  him,  but  Mr

Woodhull, Mr Lim Ching Siong, Mr Fong Swee Suan, and

Mr  James  Puthucheary, cannot say either  that  they

were  working  as  paid hacks for the  Government  for

$1,100  each  and  were sincerely carrying  out  their

duties,  or  they  were  working  for  the  Government

because  they  believed in the things that  they  said

they believed. Therefore, Sir, let them not query  the

sincerity of people who have nothing to be ashamed of.

Mr Devan Nair draws $530 a month and has been drawing

that  for the last two years, and yet he wrote  things

which  he  believed in. Whether Mr Woodhull  and  his

friends can say the same thing is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



different  matter. I do not want to weary  the  House,

Sir.  Even Mr Lint Ching Siong and Mr Fong Swee Suan

have   made  similar  speeches  praising  and   giving

credentials  to the Government for the  way  in  which

they have stood on the side of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these testimonials from Mr Woodhull, Mr

Fong  and Mr Lim, there is yet another reason why  no

worker  believes the Barisan Sosialis charge  that  we

are now oppressing the workers and have joined up with

the capitalists. The simple reason is that none of  us

on  this side of the House are capitalists. We own  no

shares or enterprises or factories. So what capitalist

interests  are  we out to protect? So on  every  count

there  is  not  a  shred of evidence  to  sustain  the

Communist  myth that we are anti-worker.  We  are  not

capitalists   ourselves  or  in   the   pay   of   any

capitalists. We have not beaten up workers, or  broken

up  strikes  or  persecuted  workers.  And  until  the

political  break less than a year ago, Sir,  Mr  Lim,

Mr  Woodhull  and the rest who are  now  bearing  the

Barisan  Sosialis  chop, were openly proclaiming  that

this   was   a   pro-workers'  Government.  Therefore,

when - that  is the problem - did we cease to  be  a  pro-workers'  Government?  As far as  the  evidence  goes,

obviously in June last year we were all right. We were

on the side of the workers. So when did we cease to be

on the side of the workers? If you look at the facts,

Sir,  the time is roughly after the Anson by-election.

So  what  happened?  As far as we know,  we  have  not

changed   our  policy.  There  have  been  no  drastic

changes.  So what happened between June and  September

to  convert  us  from  a  pro-Workers'  Government,  a

Government  which is on the side of the workers,  into

one  which has now become Fascist, pro-capitalist  and

anti-worker? I suggest that the reasons are political.

The  reasons have to do with our decision to  get  the

Communists  to declare their stand on merger.  It  was

since   then  that  the  Communists  in  the   Barisan

Sosialis -  in  fact, Sir, I think  the  term  "Barisan

Sosialis" is a deception. Nobody believes the  Barisan

Sosialis. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



is a better thing for them to change the name and call

themselves  Barisan  Communists. Everytime  they  keep

talking  of socialism, socialism, socialism, everybody

knows  that  they  mean Communism.  Probably  all  the

troubles  that  they  have landed themselves  in  were

because they started with a false name, a false  chop,

and  false credentials. Because of that, they  are  in

extreme difficulties today. The reason why they are no

longer pro-worker socialists, progressives, arises out

of  political differences, more immediately  over  the

question of merger and Malaysia. It is because of that

that they have hit back at the Government through  the

use of the industrial weapon. The Barisan Sosialis are

committed to fomenting strikes in order to further the

political  aim  of the pro-Communists who  direct  the

Party  and in accordance with the Communist technique.

The  immediate  political aim is to  halt  merger  and

Malaysia.  Merger and Malaysia may  be  good  for  the

people, but it does not suit the immediate interest of

the Communists, and it must therefore be sabotaged and

destroyed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we accept the proposition that the Barisan

Sosialis and the unionists who work for them are  open

front  Communist stooges, then the recent  tactics  in

the  field  of labour becomes clear and necessary.  We

can  see  why they are fomenting strikes  and  we  can

discern  the techniques they use to trap workers  into

unwittingly supporting Communist objectives.  What  is

most  interesting  is that the pro-Communists  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis are not even able to apply Communist

techniques   or   manipulate  with   imagination   and

originality.  That is their tragedy.  These  Communist

manipulators    have    applied    these    techniques

mechanically and blindly, and that is why  today  they

are up to their necks in difficulty. These are the bar-room  Lenins  and  they  have the  mental  agility  of

trained parrots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine some of the recent antics of these

pocket  Lenins. One thing that has been made clear  by

the  speeches of my colleagues is that all the strikes

led  by the Barisan Sosialis and the little Lenins  in

S.A.T.U. have political motivations: that is to bring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



about  the downfall of the Government and stop merger.

You  will  notice, Sir, that this political  objective

was  exemplified by the Member for Thomson who, up  to

the  end  of  a  long speech, came to  the  inevitable

conclusion that the Government should resign  and  let

us  have a national election. It is quite clear,  Sir,

because the other tactics have failed. The use of  the

industrial  weapon  to bring down the  Government  has

failed   and,  therefore,  now  they  repeat,  "Please

resign; please resign."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no accident that this outburst of industrial

unrest  started in July or August when the  Communists

discovered  to  their horror that  merger  was  now  a

practical  proposition. The little  Lenins,  with  and

without beards, have since August been talking  boldly

and  confidently of the October Revolution which  they

had  to  postpone  to November and  then  postpone  to

December,   and   which  they   have   now   postponed

indefinitely.  I  am  not denying  that  many  of  the

workers  whom they persuaded to go on strike may  have

done  so  because they had genuine economic grievances

which  they  believed  that the pro-Communist  Barisan

Sosialis  1eaders were out to resolve.  The  truth  is

that  the Barisan Communists were interested first  in

the  political objective, that is, to bring  down  the

Government, and only incidentally, or not at  all,  in

the  economic grievances of the workers. This fits  in

with  the  Leninist dogma that a good  Communist  must

look  upon  unions  primarily  as  the  tool  of   the

Communist Party. That is the basic tenet and belief of

all  good Communists: that a good Communist must  look

upon  unions as primarily a tool of the Party. Let  me

quote from Lenin himself. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The task of bourgeois policy [that is, the policy

of  non-Communist trade union leaders and so on] is to

assist the economic struggle of the proletariat.'



<br><br>That  is  what Lenin says. Non-Communist leaders  are

interested in assisting the economic struggle  of  the

proletariat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The task of the Communist is to make the economic

struggle assist the Communist movement'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



So,    Sir,   Lenin   condemned   bourgeois   policy.

"Bourgeois" is a term of abuse as far as the Communist

is  concerned.  Bourgeois  policy,  he  said - the  non-Communist  unions - is  to  assist  the  worker  to  get

economic gain. The task of the Communists - the  Barisan

Sosialis - I  am  translating for  their  clarification,

Sir - is  to  make  the  economic  struggle  assist  the

Communist  movement. If we examine many of the  things

which  seem inexplicable in recent industrial activity

here,  we can understand why the Barisan Sosialis  are

doing  things  which, from the point of  view  of  the

unionists  who  are  interested primarily  in  getting

benefits  for the workers, seem inexplicable,  because

the  Leninist technique says that the economic benefit

of  the  workers is unimportant. It is secondary.  The

primary  objective is a political one, to  assist  the

Communist  movement. Yet again, Sir, there is  another

quotation. This was something which was said by  Lenin

in one of his less sober moments. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For a Communist, the economic struggles serve as a

base  for  the  organisation  of  the  workers  in   a

revolutionary party, the consolidation and development

of  their  class  in  the struggle against  the  whole

capitalist order.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what it means is that the economic struggle

should  be  used not to advance the interests  of  the

workers  but  to  help  in  the  organisation  of  the

revolutionary  worker  and in  the  consolidation  and

development   of  the  class  struggle   against   the

capitalist order. Again Lenin speaking:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If you regard the economic struggle as something

self-sufficient   then  in   it   there   is   nothing

socialist.'



<br><br>So  if you are only interested in the interest of the

worker, then you are not a good socialist and you  are

not  a  good  Communist. You are not  a  good  Barisan

Sosialis!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister name the source of

the quotation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This is from a book called, "Lenin

on  trade  unions", which is an anthology  of  Lenin's

writings by Thomas Taylor Hemon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to know

whether you can buy this book on the market.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member took the words out of my

mouth. That is exactly what I was going to ask. It  is

whether  the book is easily available in the  Assembly

Library, or the National Library or any other library.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, not only is it available here,

but  I think it came to me through the courtesy of the

United  States  Information Service. Moreover,  it  is

published  by the Columbia University Press.  My  only

regret is that it has not been translated into Chinese

so that the gentleman (the Member for Moulmein), whose

constituency I go to every fortnight, could share with

me  some  of the delightful things that Lenin said  of

how the Barisan Sosialis should be conducted and, even

more  important,  how the Communist Party  should  use

stooges without their knowing that they have been made

stooges   of.  So  if  the  Member  for  Moulmein   is

interested, I could give him the address and he  could

have  a  look  at the copy without any fear  that  the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs would ask  inquisitioning

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is quite clear from this book that a good

Communist  should  not be interested  as  far  as  the

workers'  interests  and improvements  are  concerned.

They  are  secondary.  The  most  important  thing  is

whether  it  promotes the Communist cause.  If  it  is

necessary  to  sacrifice the interests of  workers  to

promote  the  Communist cause, then the  interests  of

workers must be sacrificed. If workers must suffer  to

promote the Communist cause, then workers must suffer.

That  is  a  good  Communist  technique.  The  Barisan

Sosialis have not denied that they are Communists. All

they have said is that it is a smear. That is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



different  thing.  They  are therefore  following  the

Communist  strategy, but with this  difference,  i.e.,

not as intelligently and as imaginatively as Lenin did

for different circumstances. So, increasing the living

standard   of  workers  and  solving  their   economic

problems is only incidental at best to the major task,

which   is  the  major  political  objective  of   the

Communists.  When  he meets a trade  dispute,  a  good

Communist  does  not  suffer by asking,  "Is  there  a

genuine  economic grievance to be resolved?"  That  is

not the first question he asks. A good Communist asks,

"How  can I exploit the economic grievance to  further

the Communist revolution?" That is the first question.

If  it  is  not  in  the  interest  of  the  Communist

revolution  to  resolve  the  economic  grievances  of

workers  and  to  win  them  more  money  and   better

conditions,  then it is the duty of the  Communist  to

see that the conditions of workers grow worse in order

to  increase their revolutionary ardour. That is again

part of the essential dogma of a good Communist. If it

is in the interest of Communism for workers to be both

discontented and suffer more than necessary,  then  it

is for the good Communist to create those conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I again quote from Lenin on trade unions. This

is a quotation from him at page 108:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot and will not "in every way" promote the

improvement of the situation of workers under existing

conditions.We struggle only for such an improvement of

the  situation  of the workers as will increase  their

ability to lead the class struggle,' -



<br><br>that  is  not to increase their standard  of  living.

"We  only fight for these things if they will increase

the ability to lead the class struggle.":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`that is, under which an improvement of the

situation  is  not  connected  with  a  corruption  of

political consciousness...'.



<br><br>If  a  Communist finds that by giving them  a  higher

standard of living their political consciousness  will

be  corrupted, then a good Communist will say, "Better

keep this. Do not improve their living standard."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will again quote Lenin:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We also struggle for reform but only in a Communist

manner,  only in a revolutionary manner do we struggle

for reform.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reducing all this Marxist jargon to simple

language, what Lenin is saying -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You are a Leninist, are you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He is your God. You worship him. Do

not  utter blasphemy. I am just warning the Member for

Thomson  that this is a gentleman who is  revered  but

who,  unfortunately, the little Lenins or  the  pocket

Lenins cannot emulate him, and that is why they are -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I have never in this House or

elsewhere quoted extracts from Marxist/Leninist

writings. In fact, I have never, for a moment, ever

suggested that I am a Marxist/Leninist. I am sure we

can all remember the Minister for Culture quoting Marx

and Lenin time and again. Sir, from a simple and

logical point of view, he must be a bigger Communist

than anyone of us in Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, there is a saying that Satan

must  know  how  to quote the scripture  and  to  that

extent - [Interruption] Yes, Sir. Just like the Jesuits.

I  have  known Jesuits who do not believe in evolution

for obvious reasons. But one thing I have seen is that

many  gentlemen  who  claim to  be  evolutionists  are

completely  floored  because the  Jesuits  read  books

which they think they should not read. Similarly, Sir

-  I am sorry the Member for Thomson has missed what I

have  said  earlier. One of the essentials of  a  good

Communist -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is for you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - is to conceal his identity. The best

way  to  conceal  his  identity  is  to  disclaim  any

knowledge  of  Lenin. So to that extent,  Sir,  I  can

assure the Member for Thomson that Lenin would be very

pleased to hear him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



say  that he knows nothing about Lenin. We who are not

Leninists  can  quote  Lenin freely  without  fear  or

favour  of being accused of being Leninists. I  notice

that the Member for Thomson did not accuse me of being

a  Leninist. He only thought it strange that I  should

be quoting the scriptures to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a few more quotations coming which I

think  you  will find very interesting and the  Member

for Thomson will find very enlightening. Lenin himself

enjoins a good Communist not to be interested  in  the

welfare of workers. That is secondary. The first thing

is:  Is  it  useful  for  the  revolution?  If  it  is

necessary  to  keep the worker happy and contented  to

further  the revolution, please do so. But  if  it  is

necessary to keep the workers depressed and miserable,

please  do  so.  That is the simple  approach  of  the

Leninist.  So  what  Lenin  is  saying  is  that   the

Communist must riot fight to so improve the conditions

of  workers that they are no longer dissatisfied  with

things.  That is the meaning of the earlier quotation.

In  fact, it goes on to say that prolonged prosperity,

prolonged   satisfaction,  to   quote   Lenin,   "only

demoralises  the workers". The Barisan  Sosialis  know

the  technique  and many of the things, starting  with

Ford factory and so on. You begin to see daylight.  Do

not  get the workers completely satisfied. Do not give

him everything he wants. If he is satisfied, he is not

interested  in  revolution.  In  ther  words,  Sir,  a

decrease in the misery of the workers hinders progress

towards  the revolution. The Communist theory is  that

workers  can never be happy and can never get  justice

in any but a Communist society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will have noticed, Sir, that in many of their

speeches,  they  say you can never  solve  the  strike

problem in a capitalist society. You must go to  basic

causes. Again, what are the basic causes? How  do  you

solve it? I know, Sir, in the fatherland -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Au hon. Member: Where is that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - of the revolution there are no

strikes.  The  strike situation has been  solved.  You

cannot  strike. And the theory is that in a  Communist

country, a worker who strikes is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



striking against himself because the State belongs  to

him.  He  is  the State. Very good theology  and  good

metaphysics.  But, unfortunately, a  couple  of  years

ago,  the  workers  of  Poland, a  Communist  country,

decided  to go on strike. That threw all the Communist

theoreticians  into confusion because they  could  not

explain how these terrible Polish workers could strike

against  themselves. The truth is that we  agree  that

there  is  no  final solution to the  strike  problem.

There  will always be a conflict of interests  between

the worker and the employer, whether that employer  is

a  State or a private individual. We have a Government

service.  Technically we are a nationalised Government

and  all  its  enterprises are  owned  by  the  people

collectively  and yet the workers go on  strike.  They

can   go  on  strike  in  a  non-Communist  democratic

society. But in the kind of society that some  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis leaders have in mind, you cannot  go

on  strike.  Therefore,  there  are  no  strikes  and,

therefore, they solve the problem of strikes.  So  you

see,  Sir,  they  must work on that basis.  They  must

drive  home  the fact that in any except  a  Communist

society  there  can be no solution to the  problem  of

conflict between labour and capital.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You make a good Communist preacher.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I know the Member

for  Thomson  gets  extremely agitated  when  he  sees

another  non-Communist talking intelligent  Communism.

The trouble with the Barisan Sosialis, as I have said,

is  that  they  are tenderfoot Communists,  tenderfoot

Leninists - [Interruption].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a young schoolboy, one of my uncles (just

to  stress  a point) gave me a chemical set and  said,

"If  you  take this little chemical and mix with  that

chemical and light a fire, there will be a red  glow."

But  somehow something went wrong. There was not a red

glow. There was a red explosion. That is precisely the

situation  in  which the second-class  Leninists  find

themselves today because they are applying a technique

which is all right in Czarist Russia,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



where  you had a brutal government, where you  had  to

work  underground,  where Lenin said  because  of  the

situation  in  Russia,  it  was  necessary  for  every

Communist  Party to have a legal organisation  and  an

illegal  organisation. You must have  an  organisation

which  was  legal and another one which  was  illegal.

There is no Czarist Russia here, but still Members  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis  are a legal  organisation  and

somebody else carries on an illegal organisation which

operates  the  Barisan Sosialis. Therefore,  they  get

into  difficulties.  Therefore,  they  all  say,  "No.

Communism  is a smear." We say, "Well what  about  all

these  documents?" "Oh, that is a smear too." So,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, let us therefore go on to  explain  why

they  are  behaving in this way - the usual things  that

they  do.  First  they say they are fighting  for  the

workers - many of their workers wallop the workers. They

say  they  are  fighting to improve  the  lot  of  the

workers - lots  of  chaps  get unemployed.  In  fact,  I

understand one of them was an unemployed member of the

Singapore General Employees' Union who absconded  with

$4,500. So these are the little difficulties that come

about when you operate a Leninist chemical set without

exactly knowing the right formula.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the stresses laid is that a Leninist is

a   good  Communist.  A  good  Barisan  Sosialis  must

deliberately  create  strikes, violence  and  distress

among  the  workers.  The point  has  been  repeatedly

stressed by Lenin. Here again I' quote from "Lenin  on

Unions", page 31, and this is what he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The spontaneous development of the labour movement

[that  is,  in their jargon, "spontaneous development"

means   unions   that  are  not  controlled   by   the

Communists;  anything that is not  controlled  by  the

Communists becomes spontaneous development]  leads  to

it becoming subordinated to bourgeois ideology.'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> What does it mean?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I will explain it later. Obviously

the  Member for Thomson is a really good Leninist.  He

Thomson  is a labour leader, a trade unionist who  has

been  carrying out these operations, and yet he  says,

"I  do not know what it is all about." Anyway, Sir, as

we  go along, I am quite sure that not only will  this

become  clear but I will also send him a  copy  of  my

speech at the expense of the Ministry of Culture. This

is what Lenin said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The spontaneous development of the labour movement

leads   to   it  becoming  subordinated  to  bourgeois

ideology  .for  the spontaneous labour movement  [that

is,  a labour movement which is not controlled by  the

Barisan  Sosialis  or  by  the  Communists]  is  trade

unionism  and  trade  unionism means  the  ideological

enslavement of the workers to the bourgeoisie.'



<br><br>So  trade  unions  which are not  controlled  by  the

Communists  is  an enslavement of the workers  to  the

bourgeois  ideology. Sir, we begin to  understand  why

any  unionist who is not associated with  the  Barisan

Sosialis  and pro-Communists becomes the oppressor  of

the  workers,  a  capitalist stooge, a running  dog -

sorry, Sir, I am not applying this term to anybody  in

this House - because according to the Leninist technique

any  trade union which is not under the control of the

Communists  becomes  mere  trade  unionism  and   must

eventually lead to the ideological enslavement of  the

workers to the bourgeoisie.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Hence our task [that is, the task of the Communists

and the Barisan Sosialis] is to combat spontaneity, to

divert   the  labour  movement  from  its  spontaneous

unionist   strivings  [that  is,  striving  for   pure

economic gain] to go under the wing of the bourgeoisie

and  to  bring  it  under  the wing  of  revolutionary

Communism.'.



<br><br>Therefore, it is the duty of any good Communist  when

he  sees  workers developing trade unions and fighting

for  better  wages and so on to condemn it  as  wrong.

That  means that we could improve our lot under a non-Communist society. Therefore we must divert  it  among

other ends to create revolutionary Communism. In other

words,  it  is the task of the Communists to  organise

and  use  trade unions not to improve the lot  of  the

worker  but  to punish him through strikes  and  other

forms of labour agitation that bear no hope for him in

any  but  a  Communist society, and  that  in  a  non-Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



society  the lot of the worker must be an increase  in

misery, repression and continual strife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to another aspect of the Communist

technique - the role of strike in labour agitation.  The

non-Communist unionist's strike is a weapon  to  bring

pressure  on  employers  to get  concessions  for  the

worker.  That  is how a non-Communist  trade  unionist

sees the strike weapon. The strike weapon is something

which he uses against employers to get concessions for

the  workers. But it is not so with the Communist. The

winning  of concession is only incidental  as  I  have

shown,  Sir,  from  my earlier quotation.  By  winning

concessions  the Communists hope - this is  their  real

objective - to  enlist the support of  workers  for  the

Communists in their major political objective, because

to  the Communists a strike is the training ground for

revolutionary violence, for building up  hatred  among

the workers against the Government, the police and all

instruments  associated  with  the  authority  of  the

State.  That  is  the real political  objective  of  a

strike.  Now we can see why speaker after  speaker  in

the  Barisan  Sosialis  spent a  great  deal  of  time

elaborating on the violent brutality of the police. It

is  necessary for them, through a strike, to create in

the  workers  who  are  not  politically  conscious  a

dislike  and  hatred for the police and  for  all  the

authority  of  the  State.  Therefore,  this   becomes

revolutionary  training.  Now,  Sir,   we   begin   to

understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis say, "We are not Communists. We

do not know what Communists are. That is a bogey." But

whether  they are or they are not, they are doing  the

things  that  a Communist should do, though  they  are

doing it badly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me again quote Lenin:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every strike concentrates all the attention and all

the  efforts  of  the workers first  on  one  then  on

another   evil  from  which  the  working   class   is

suffering.'



<br><br>Therefore,  they  have  to tell  about  the  terrible

Government, the terrible police and the sufferings  of

the workers. Lenin goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every strike gives rise to a discussion of these

evils  and  helps  the workers to  appraise  them,  to

understand when the oppression of the capitalist comes

in.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



That is the objective of a strike. Therefore, when  a

Communist  unionist  starts  a  strike,  he   is   not

interested in using the strike to settle a dispute but

to  instil  revolutionary  fervour  and  revolutionary

hatred  for  the State, the Government and the  police

among the workers. That is the objective. You can  see

why  strikes are prolonged when they could be settled.

Why  is it necessary to create scuffles and why is  it

necessary to put up banners charging the State and the

Government  as  being  brutal and oppressive?  Because

that is the real objective of a strike weapon - to build

up revolutionary fervour and hatred among the workers.

In fact, Lenin further enjoined the Communists, and  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...to use every strike, every manifestation of

economic  oppression    for the widest  socialist  and

revolutionary propaganda.'.



<br><br>That  is the objective again. He did not say, to  use

every   strike  to  cow  the  capitalist  into  making

concessions. He said



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...to use every strike, every manifestation of

economic  oppression  .for the  widest  socialist  and

revolutionary propaganda.'.



<br><br>He further declared:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All sundry manifestations of police tyranny [I think

that  strikes a chord in the .Member for Thomson]  and

autocratic  outrage, besides the evils connected  with

the economic struggle are equally widely applicable as

a means of drawing in the masses.'.



<br><br>You  must  use  strikes to instil in  the  workers  a

hatred  for the police, the Government and so on,  but

not  to  settle disputes with the employers.  That  is

incidental.  If  you decide on anything,  then  it  is

suitable.  These are roughly the agitating  techniques

recommended  in the Communist manuals  and  which  the

Barisan  Sosialis - being  only second-class  Leninists - carry  out  with  ineptitude. This accounts  for  the

general  air of depression that occasionally  descends

upon them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You are a first-class Leninist, are you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, if we analyse some of the

techniques used by the pro-Communist Barisan  Sosialis

in  the strikes they organised in Singapore, you  will

discover - I   am  sorry  that  I  said   "second-class

Leninists"; I withdraw the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



term-that it was the third-class Leninists who  tried

to apply these techniques.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Why do you not pass me some of those

books?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, I think the Member for Thomson

was  not  here because his colleague, the  Member  for

Moulmein, was most interested and most agitated as  to

whether  he  can get a copy of this "Lenin on  Unions"

and  whether it is all right, and I have given him  an

assurance that it is all right because I got it myself

from the U.S.I.S.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You should have borrowed it from Mao Tse-tung.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> And it is published by one of the

respectable   Universities  the  Columbia   University

Press.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Where is it sold?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is not sold. You can borrow it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There seems to be an exchange of

pleasantries across the Floor. Shall we  carry  on?  I

think  the  Member for Thomson was a bit worried  with

interjections from the Opposition Benches but  now  he

himself is guilty of interjecting too often.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, if the techniques that the

third-class  Leninists used have not been  successful,

it  is  not  because Lenin had been wrong  but  it  is

because  the people on the Government side  have  also

read  Lenin  perhaps a little more intelligently  than

the   half-baked   revolutionaries  in   the   Barisan

Sosialis.  They  have  a  propensity  to  follow   the

Communist   manuals  mechanically,  hut  we   in   the

Government  are  fortunate in that we  can  anticipate

what they will do in a given situation. This is how, I

am  told, big game-hunters trap animals. Knowing their

propensities  and  weaknesses under given  conditions,

they are then trapped accordingly. This has an obvious

moral  which  I think Members of the Barisan  Sosialis

will no doubt appreciate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a thought has struck me. The Member for Thomson

is  becoming  increasingly agitated as  to  why  I  am

quoting  Lenin,  my reading Lenin and what  particular

book of Lenin I am reading.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



It  is quite clear that he has an inkling that we  are

always  anticipating  his or his Party's  moves  many,

many weeks before they actually begin to move and,  to

that  extent, they have been getting into greater  and

greater difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not agitated. I am just trying to

follow you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Therefore, Sir, I do not want to go

further  and anticipate things to come for the Barisan

Sosialis, because we can see not only weeks ahead  but

months  ahead.  But  if they look a  little  bit  less

buoyant  and  a little more bewildered it  is  because

things  have not quite worked out as the good Leninist

book said it would.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know why the Barisan Sosialis started these

strikes.  They  were  political  strikes  intended  to

thwart merger. Well, they have not thwarted merger and

there  were  a lot of strikes on their hands - strikes,

as  it were, all dressed up and no place to go. But if

the  little Lenins, with or without whiskers, had read

Lenin  properly,  they  would have  learnt  that  they

cannot  start  a revolution unless the  conditions  as

laid down by Lenin for a revolution are right. Anyway,

it  is  not my purpose to teach little Lenins  how  to

suck  eggs because I am quite sure they too  can  read

Lenin in their own way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know why the Barisan Sosialis leaders have

refused  to  have things like social security  schemes

and  proper wage scales; to settle strikes peacefully,

to   use   the   conciliation  machinery,  arbitration

procedure, and so on. My quotation earlier has made it

quite  clear. Lenin said that the first thing you  ask

is  not  how  to  solve the economic problems  of  the

workers  but  how to use their economic grievances  to

further   the  revolution.  These  are  two  different

approaches to the labour problems, and that is why  in

the  case  of Singapore there are what they  call  the

conditions  for  a revolution but these  are  not  yet

ripe. They would not start a revolution or attempt  to

start  a  revolution,  and the whole  thing  has  gone

haywire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know now why the Barisan Sosialis have been

trying to precipitate clashes between strikers and the

police: why they have been trying to build a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



myth of police violence and intimidation of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know why, as in the case of the Ford and

Shaw   strikes,   they  have  refused   to   use   the

conciliation  machinery [Interruption]. You  will  get

all the facts - I am sorry, Sir. The Member for Thomson

has  given  a version - we call it the Barisan Sosialis'

authorised version - of the Ford strike; but we will  be

giving a revised version of the same incident -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Authorised version.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He counts up to only the fingers of

his  hands, but our trade union leaders count not only

up  to  the fingers of both hands but also both  feet,

and  therefore are more accurate in figures  than  the

Member for Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Ford negotiations were held in the

Labour Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> All the facts will come out in due

course,  and  the  Member for Thomson  will  have  the

privilege  of  having  a quick consultation  with  his

colleagues outside this Chamber before the Member  for

Queenstown is allowed to give his reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a strike, from the point of view of the

Communist,  is a training ground for Communist  cadres

and  for the sparking off of violence. If workers  can

be  maimed and suffer loss of lives, then they can  be

mobilised  for  a  revolutionary  overthrow  of   non-Communist  leaders.  And that  has  been  the  purpose

during  the last nine months - to provoke the Government

into  staging  clashes with the police  so  that  they

could  get martyrs. If you will remember, Sir,  during

the  Hock Lee riots when I was with a newspaper, there

were  clashes between students and the police where  a

youth  was  badly  injured,  in  fact,  almost  dying.

Instead  of  taking him to the hospital,  a  group  of

them, who obviously were trying to make Capital out of

the  incident,  carried the body of the dying  student

all  the way to one of the Chinese newspapers here and

the  boy died. They had a martyr. The next day at  the

big  funeral, I think the then Chief Minister, who  is

now the Member for Anson, sent a big wreath,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



and  as an act of demonstration they pulled the wreath

aside.  But  they  had  a  martyr,  a  dead  boy,  and

throughout the last nine months the Communists who run

the  Barisan  Sosialis have been  trying  to  get  the

Government  to provide them with martyrs.  The  latest

disappointment  and the greatest  anger  that  we  are

causing  them, so far as we are concerned, is that  we

have  not  provided them with martyrs and,  therefore,

some  of  the  leaders or the strong-arm  men  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis have been trying to  create  martyrs

among  other  workers  who  have  been  annoying   and

intimidating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we also know why the Barisan Sosialis leaders

deliberately led Ford workers into a strike where they

got  the  worst  of the bargain. It  was  a  political

strike which they bungled. The workers lost more  than

they  were likely to gain. Maybe the Barisan  Sosialis

can   divert   the  resentment  of  the   workers   by

suggesting,  "Well, even if you had a bad bargain,  it

is not the fault of the Barisan Sosialis. Here we have

the oppressors of the poor, the capitalists, and a bad

Government." Just to leave some resentment.  In  fact,

by  the time this debate is over, the whole thing will

be  twisted as, "There you are. This proves that in  a

non-Communist society, there can be no justice for the

workers."  Therefore, it is necessary in  every  trade

dispute    to    leave   behind   some   measure    of

dissatisfaction to convince the workers that there can

be  no  workers' paradise except as laid down  in  the

good  book and, as you are likely to find in Communist

countries,  where there are no strikes  because  there

cannot be any strikes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Is something wrong with you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> However, let me tell the Leninist

tenderfoots  in the Barisan Sosialis that the  workers

of  Singapore  are  not  all that  dumb,  nor  is  the

Government  all that dumb. It is not the  business  of

this  Government  to save the little  Lenins  who,  of

their  own accord, are getting into deeper and  deeper

waters. But to the best of its ability, the Government

will  ensure that these political adventurers  do  not

lead the innocent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



workers of Singapore into deep waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers of Singapore are already becoming aware

of  what  the  Barisan  Sosialis and  their  Communist

cohorts   are   really  up  to.  They   are   becoming

increasingly    resentful   of   the   violence    and

intimidation  that the desperate men  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis'  S.A.T.U. have been forced  to  use  against

workers,  of  the loss of employment  to  hundreds  of

people  by ineptly handled labour disputes, by  forced

collections  to finance strikes which  have  got  them

nowhere. People are also becoming aware that the  real

objective of the desperate Communists is not to better

the  life  of the workers but to make life  worse  for

them  so  as to mount a revolution on the misery  they

have   created.  The  Communists  hope  to   frustrate

industrial  development  and expansion  because  these

would enable the non-Communist Government to provide a

better   life  for  the  workers  in  a  non-Communist

society.  The increasing resistance the Communists  in

the  Barisan Sosialis are meeting from the workers  is

proof that the Barisan's one star - there is only  one

star - is on the wane. The day is not far off  when  it

is more likely that the Barisan Sosialis Members would

be  seeing  stars than to be holding their star  aloft

and leading it towards victory.



<br><br>10.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

originally I did not intend to speak on this question,

but  as one who has worked in a union as a responsible

official, and as one who has worked with the  workers,

and  since the Government intend to amend this motion - the  amendment proposed by the Government  is  very

malicious - I am therefore compelled to say something

on this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government attribute all the industrial unrest

to  those unions which are not going to toe the P.A.P.

line  and  which are branded as pro-Communist  unions.

The  Government say all this industrial unrest is  the

result  of pro-Communist union activities in order  to

destroy those unions which do not kowtow to the P.A.P.

Government.  Through  this  amendment  the  Government

intend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



to deal with those unions which are really working for

the benefit of the workers. There are many reasons for

industrial  unrest. For example, political instability

is  one.  So to put the blame of industrial unrest  on

the  Communists is not fair. The Government intend  to

make  use of this tactic to create the impression that

all  these troubles are agitated by the Communists and

they  should  be responsible for it. But in  Singapore

the  Communist  Party is an illegal Party.  Therefore,

the  Communists are not able to defend themselves.  So

the Government intend to shirk their responsibility by

saying  that  all these troubles are  created  by  the

Communists  in order to divert the people's  attention

from  the Government's failure, and to cover  up  many

bad  things which they have done. The Government  hope

to  convince  the people that all these troubles  have

been  created by the Communists. The Communist  Party,

being  an  illegal Party, could not come out into  the

open  to  defend itself. In the past the Lim Yew  Hock

Government  also  accused  certain  people  of   being

Communists.  So now you do not have to  laugh  at  it.

This  is proof that what I say is true. The day before

yesterday, the Member for Anson in this Assembly  also

touched on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain speakers said that strikes had also taken

place  in  non-Communist countries. But  here  we  can

quote  something  from  the P.A.P. speeches  made  by

P.A.P.  Ministers.  The Minister for  Health  and  Law

perhaps  was somewhat honest in saying those words.  I

am  now  quoting from the Sin Chew Jit  Poh  of  today

(local page 5). The Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Industrial unrest was not peculiar to Singapore. It

was  a  feature of industrialised countries throughout

the world. In England, civil servants, the traditional

moderates  in  trade unionism, were now in  the  front

line  of  an  industrial battle because the Government

had   rejected  wage  claims  to  offset  inflationary

pressures and adverse balance of payments.'



<br><br>This  was said by the Minister for Health and Law.  He

also  knows  something about labour problems.  I  have

been working with him, so I know he is somewhat like a

great  man, and I know that it was uttered in  honesty

and sincerity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



So   it  is  unfair  for  the  P.A.P. to  say   that

industrial  unrest  is  all the  result  of  Communist

agitation.  We  cannot say that as long  as  there  is

industrial  unrest  whipped up by  non-P.A.P. unions,

these people must all be Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present issue is very clear. It is that the

Government  are  indifferent to the  establishment  of

industrial peace. What they are actually interested in

is  how  they  can  deal  with such  people  as  their

political opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a few days back, the Government brought

up  the National Referendum Bill and talked about  the

blank  votes  which were in support of the Government,

saying  that those votes, even with the drawing  of  a

tortoise  On  them were also votes for the Government.

That  is  to say, they want all things that are  good.

For  example, the claims of A.U.P.E., the union of the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture,

are good. They are all right. So A.U.P.E. can go ahead

and  carry on, because he himself is the leader of the

union.   You  just  cannot  say  that  this  is   also

Communist.  You  will make yourself a  laughing-stock.

For example, regarding the vote with the drawing of  a

tortoise  on it, you say, "If you do not  want  it,  I

want it myself." If you want a turtle drawn on a blank

vote, then the vote will go to the Government as well.

But  all the bad things, such as strikes not conducted

by  the  P.A.P. members or P.A.P. union leaders,  must

have  been done by the Communists. All the strikes  of

the  P.A.P.-led unions will always result  in  success

and  wage  increases.  That  is  to  say,  on  certain

conditions;  if you get some benefit out of  the  wage

increase,  you  must  make some  contribution  to  the

unions.  That is the condition imposed by  the  P.A.P.

unions.  All those which do not belong to  this  group

must be Communists. That is their argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the present P.A.P. Government are

very  clever  at playing tricks. They are  trying  all

sorts  of  means to prolong their political  life.  So

they  will  use all means to smear all the others  who

are   against  the  P.A.P.  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   the

Government  know full well that there are many  unions

which are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



supporting  the P.A.P. Government. In  order  to  deal

with  such  unions,  the  Government  hope  to  create

confusion and  to give them trouble. It is the aim  of

the  Government to be successful in this  manner,  but

they  just  cannot succeed. For example, the  one-time

Labour  Front  Government had various  experiences  in

dealing  with unions which were opposed to them.  That

is,  they  tried  to put all the blame  of  industrial

unrest on the unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I am trying to say is that

union  leaders  do  not  resort to  industrial  action

unnecessarily, because if they do, then they will only

be giving the Government an opportunity to smear them.

The Government are supporting all the P.A.P.-dominated

unions  at  the expense of the non-P.A.P. unions.  In

this  manner, the P.A.P. hope that they can hand  over

the  true  unionists  into the hands  of  the  Federal

Government  after  their phoney merger.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I  would like to tell my friends in  the  P.A.P.

that  smears, compulsion and oppression  will  be  met

with greater resistance. We can see clearly that since

1958  there have been many people who have been trying

to  work  for  the interest of the workers  hut  these

people  have  either been branded communists  or  pro-Communist

cadres.   Because  of   this   smear   and

allegation, many people have been put into gaol.  Even

those  who are truly fighting for the interest of  the

workers  are  still  remaining in gaol.  These  people

number  about  20. Many unions have been  closed  down

because of the Communist label. In spite of all  this,

the  people and the workers are not afraid. The  trade

union  movement is going on all the same. We  can  see

from this that to go through the process of oppression

and smear is useless. It is futile to do this thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, everybody knows that to get

industrialisation in Singapore, we must not only  have

the co-operation of the workers themselves but we must

also  get  co-operation from other parties  concerned.

Only  with  this co-operation can there be   industrial

peace and industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



development  in Singapore. If there are fewer  strikes

in  Singapore,  the capitalists will,  of  course,  be

happier.   But   the  question  of   whether   foreign

capitalists will come to invest in Singapore does  not

solely  depend on the number of strikes in  Singapore.

The  main  thing  will be whether there  is  political

stability in Singapore. If the political situation  is

not  certain,  then foreign capitalists will  hesitate

before  they  come  to invest in  Singapore.  But  the

present  P.A.P.  Government  are  not  trying  to   do

anything  about  the creation of political  stability.

Instead  they  talk  of Communists  everywhere.  As  a

result   of  this  cry  of  Communism,  everybody   in

Singapore  seems  to be suffering from  the  Communist

phobia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now we have seen how the Minister for Culture

talked a great deal about Leninism and Communism: this

is  Communist and that is Communist, and everything is

Communist.  According to the arguments put forward  by

the   P.A.P.,   you  have  Communists  everywhere   in

Singapore. They seem to say that Singapore has  become

a  Communist State. Now this behaviour of theirs  will

certainly  not  induce foreign investors  to  come  to

Singapore. In fact, it will frighten them away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us say you are a foreign

capitalist, with the intention to invest in  Singapore

by  setting  up  factories.  But  when  you  hear  the

Government shouting Communists here, Communists there,

and  that all the unions are Communist-dominated,  and

you  think of the necessity of getting workers to work

in  your  factories, you will think twice  before  you

come to invest in Singapore. There are so many workers

in  Singapore under so many unions, but they say  that

only  those unions under the leadership of  Mr  Devan

Nair and Mr Kandasamy are non-Communist. How can  you

believe  that  so  many unions in  Singapore  are  all

Communist and only those under these persons are  non-Communist?  So  because  of  this  cry  of  Communism,

foreign capitalists will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



not  dare to come and invest in Singapore, and because

of   the  absence  of  investment  in  Singapore,  the

Government  will put the blame on the  Communists  and

say  it  is all because of the Communists that foreign

investors  have been frightened away.  In  fact,  they

themselves  are  guilty  of frightening  away  foreign

investment.  The Government themselves have  to  admit

that  they  are  guilty  of frightening  away  foreign

investment, and not the Communists. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

the  Government  are now branding all  the  non-P.A.P.

unions  as Communist unions. But this tactic of theirs

will not frighten the workers of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been the question of a Common Market

between Singapore and the Federation. In the course of

two  years,  the  Government of  Singapore  have  been

negotiating  with  the Federation  Government  on  the

question of a Common Market, but so far there has been

no  result.  So  we  will say that before  the  Common

Market can come into existence, this Common Market  is

also one of the factors that have to be considered  by

foreign  investors because they are not  sure  whether

there  is  going  to  be  any  Common  Market  between

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. From  this  we

can  see that the question of a Common Market has been

talked  about for over two years without any  success.

In  spite of all this, the P.A.P. Government  keep  on

bragging about merger and the benefits they can derive

therefrom.  How  can you say that  merger  will  bring

great  benefits  to the people of Singapore  when  the

simple  question of a Common Market cannot be  solved?

From  my personal point of view, the people are  quite

right  in saying that the P.A.P. are selling out their

interests by merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been a worker myself and,

as  a  worker, I am not in a position to talk a  great

deal  like  the Prime Minister who can argue,  by  all

sorts   of   reasoning,  that  Federal  citizens   and

Singapore  citizens  are the  same  and  that  Federal

nationality -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope the hon. Member is not

embarking now on a debate on merger. We are  still  on

the motion before us. We are not discussing merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

must  thank you for your advice. I was just drawing  a

sort  of analogy from the question of merger but I  am

leaving  it at that now. What I was trying to  say  is

that,  as  a  worker,  I am not  able  to  speak  with

eloquence like the Minister for Culture who brings  .a

great  deal of arguments into h-is speech so  that  he

can  turn black into white. I very much appreciate his

intelligence  in being able to do such  a  thing.  But

what  I  will  say  here  is that,  from  my  personal

experience,  the present P.A.P. are only  putting  the

whole  blame  of  industrial unrest on  the  so-called

Communist  and pro-Communist unions. I will  say  that

this attitude of the P.A.P. is really ridiculous.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  believe that not everybody  in  the

P.A.P. is  as clever and intelligent as the  Minister

for  Culture and the Minister for Finance. Many people

in the P.A.P. still have a sense of righteousness, and

I  believe  there  will  come a  day  when  they  will

discover  this  kind of people in the  P.A.P. itself.

That is to say, at the present moment, some people  in

the  P.A.P. are  being misled by a few  leaders  into

believing  that all the strikes have been agitated  by

the  Communist and the pro-Communist elements. But one

day  they  will come to discover that they  have  been

misled  by  their  leaders  into  believing  so.   For

example,  the  former Labour Minister said,  with  all

sincerity, that there were strikes everywhere  in  the

world  and they were not peculiar to Singapore  alone.

In this respect, I will say he is really a man of good

conscience -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is true I have said that, but I have

said very much more than that also.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. I agree that the

Minister  has said something about other  things  too,

and  I  am  quite  appreciative of  his  arguments.  I

believe  the workers will discover in due course  that

the  minority leadership of the P.A.P. will  gradually

resort  to  the tactics employed by the Lim  Yew  Hock

Government,  and the people will discover  the  P.A.P.

leadership  for  what  they are.  If  there  are  some

workers  with  a  sense  of righteousness,  they  will

awaken  to  the fact that the present Government  will

fall,  as the Lim Yew Hock Government did fall,  in  a

very dishonourable manner. It is not a question of our

remaining  in  office as Members of the Assembly.  The

main  thing  is that after our term of office  in  the

Assembly, we  can go about everywhere  with  a  clear

conscience and get the applause and the support of the

people, instead of getting criticism from them. But if

these  leaders  were to go and meet  the  people,  the

people would say, "Oh, these are the people who at one

time  sent my husband and my children to gaol."  Under

these  circumstances, some of the P.A.P. leaders  will

not discover the wrong they are doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell Members of this House that the

Government should not take advantage of this amendment

and this motion against the interests of the people in

Singapore. If they do, then the days of the P.A.P. are

numbered. In fact, if the P.A.P. should take advantage

of  this  motion to deal with the people of Singapore,

then  they  will be doomed. The P.A.P. must  not  say,

"Oh,  since there are people jumping into the  sea  to

commit suicide, we must follow them as well." If  they

persist in this way, they will perish in the end.



<br><br>10.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every

time   the  Member  for  Cairnhill  speaks  on  labour

matters, he constantly prefaces his remarks that he is

a  trade unionist. He also expresses profound sympathy

for  the workers. Sir, perhaps the House is not  aware

that  the  Member for Cairnhill was the President  of

the Clerical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



and  Administrative  Workers Union,  the  trustees  of

which  were Mr G. H. Kiat, the proprietor  of  G.  H.

Kiat  and Company, a capitalist and an adviser to  the

Chung  Khiaw  Bank,  and  Mr  Lim  Chuan  Geok,   the

proprietor   of   a   firm  of  auctioneers,   another

capitalist.  The  activities  that  went  on  in   the

Clerical   and  Administrative  Workers   Union   were

confined to mahjong, jackpot, skittles and card games.

Indeed.  Sir, the Member for Cairnhill should  preface

his  remarks by saying that he was the president of  a

gambling den and not a trade unionist. But his remarks

do  not  bear  sufficient importance. The workers  now

have  no faith in him, and they do not have any regard

for what he says on these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Barisan Sosialis is another matter. The

Member for Upper Serangoon yesterday stated that there

were strikes in the U.S.A., the U.K. and India. We  do

not  deny  that  at  all. Indeed  that  was  what  the

Minister  for Health and Law stated. But we  also  say

that the only countries where there are no strikes are

the  Communist and Fascist countries like  China,  the

U.S.S.R. and Portugal. The Member for Upper Serangoon

further said that Government Members claimed that  all

strikes were Communist inspired. He argued that  since

Government Members had said that, and those  were  his

words,  therefore, the strikes called by the A.U.P.E.,

the  Bank  Employees' Union, the Singapore Manual  and

Mercantile   Workers'  Union,  were   also   Communist

inspired.  Either the Member for Upper  Serangoon  was

not   listening   attentively  to  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for  Labour,  or  he  was

deliberately    misrepresenting   the    facts.    The

Parliamentary  Secretary reported that there  were  69

strikes  which were called by the Communist-controlled

trade  unions, and 24 strikes were called by the  non-Communist  unions. It is true that the  A.U.P.E.,  the

Bank  Employees' Union and the Manual  and  Mercantile

Workers'  Union have called strikes. But these  unions

were  also  willing  to  accept  arbitration  in   the

Industrial  Arbitration Court. That is the difference,

Sir. The Communist-controlled unions, however,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



always avoid arbitration unless they are compelled  to

go to arbitration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain in detail two strikes called by the

S.A.T.U. unions in order to illustrate how  the  pro-Communist  trade  unionists  ruthlessly  exploit   the

workers to mount up discontent and tension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore General Employees Union called out the

workers  in Shaw's cinemas on strike in support  of  a

claim for arrears of overtime. The strike lasted  from

21st December, 1961, to 1st February, 1962 - a total  of

33 days. 419 workers were involved and 14,036 man-days

were lost as a result of the strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner for Labour recommended that the

dispute  be  referred to the Labour Court. The  Labour

Court   is  the  machinery  provided  in  the   Labour

Ordinance to adjudicate upon matters involving  rights

provided by the labour legislation. Many other  unions

have  appeared in the Labour Court and they  have  had

arrears of overtime amounting to thousands of dollars.

But  the Singapore General Employees Union refused  to

refer the matter to the Labour Court. At the end of 33

days  of  strike, when the workers had lost  33  days'

wages,  the  dispute  has now  been  referred  to  the

Industrial Arbitration Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson and the Member for Choa Chu

Kang spoke on the Ford strike, but they always kept on

saying   how   successful  the  union   was   in   the

negotiations and that it had obtained - according to the

Member  for  Thomson - 52 cents per  day  increase,  42½

hours per week and a five-day week. Anyone who did not

know the background would have been impressed by this.

Let me explain to the House what really happened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Motor Workshops Employees Union, one

of  the  unions of the S.A.T.U. group, called out  the

industrial workers of the Ford Motor Company on strike

on 21st November, 1961. Though the strike may have had

legitimate  economic grievances, the Barisan  Sosialis

commissars  had intended this strike as a  prelude  to

the   November   revolution  which   they   had   been

proclaiming in order to bring down



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



the  Government. The strike lasted 110  days  and  the

workers  resumed work on 10th March, 1962. Before  the

strike took place, the union did not make any specific

claims regarding wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the strike, the company offered to increase

the  hourly wages from 88 cents per hour to  93  cents

per hour for 1962, an increase of 5 cents per hour per

man  in  1962  and it also offered to increase  to  98

cents  per hour, an increase of 5 cents per  hour  per

man in 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this, to one who is not familiar with trade

union negotiations, may sound a bit confusing. Perhaps

I  had  better  explain this in  greater  detail.  The

industrial  workers, on an average, were receiving  88

cents  per  hour.  The  Ford Company  is  an  American

company  which  employs all hourly-rated  people.  The

Company before the strike offered an increase of  five

cents  per man per hour for 1962 and another  increase

of  five  cents per hour per man for 1963.  The  union

refused  and  the workers were out on strike  for  110

days.  During the 110-day strike, each worker lost  an

average  of $7.90 per day and a total of $576 for  the

whole  period of the strike, that is, 73 working days.

Though  the  strike lasted 110 days, the working  days

were 73 days and the total wages lost amounted to $576

per  man. By this time the Barisan Sosialis commissars

had   come  to  the  conclusion  that  their  November

revolution had turned out to be a flop and  there  was

no  point in continuing the Ford strike; so they spent

some anxious moments begging the employers to come  to

any  settlement  because  many  workers  had  come  to

realise  by then that they had been made dupes  of  by

the  Barisan Sosialis political agitators.  After  110

days of strike, the union agreed on an increase of six

cents per hour. This is the increase of six cents  the

Member  for  Choa Chu Kang and the Member for  Thomson

tried  to  explain as a victory! Sir, let  me  repeat:

before the strike, the company had already offered  an

increase of five cents. At the end of the strike,  the

union agreed on six cents. They have been telling  the

workers that they got this increase of six cents after

110 days of strike. What this really means in terms



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



of  hard  cash  is that after 110 days of  strike  the

union  has  obtained one cent increase per worker  per

hour.  With  this  one  cent increase  over  what  was

offered  before the strike, each worker will  have  to

work  five  days a week for 28 years  before  he  can

recoup  the $576 that he has lost in wages during  the

strike.  He will have to work for 28 years  before  he

can  make up the lost wages. This is the great victory

of  the  Ford Motor Workshop Union - General  Secretary,

Mr  Low Pen; negotiator, Mr Fong Swee Suan! By  that

time, the General Secretary of the union, Mr Low Pen,

and  the gentleman who negotiated this agreement,  Mr

Fong  Swee  Suan,  a  leading member  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis, will be comfortably earning old age  pension

from    the    Government - no   doubt   a    democratic

Government - while the workers will still be  struggling

to make up the losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the strike, the workers were receiving an

annual  bonus of 20 working days' wages subject  to  a

deduction  of about ten per cent of a day's  wage  for

every  day of unauthorised absence. I notice that  the

Member  for  Thomson did not touch on the  subject  of

bonus.  The  company  offered to  increase  it  to  30

working  days'  wages subject to a  deduction  of  two

days' wages for every (lay of unauthorised absence. In

other   words,   if  a  worker  was  not   guilty   of

absenteeism - he could be on sick leave or  on  vacation

but not unauthorised absence - during the year, he would

have  received  under the company's offer  30  working

days'  wages  as  bonus. This was offered  before  the

strike. The union - one of the principal unions of  the

S.A.T.U. group - led by Messrs. Fong Swee Suan  and  Low

Peng refused this. After 110 days of strike, the union

agreed  to  an annual bonus of 24 working days'  wages

subject to a deduction of ten per cent of a day's wage

for  every  day  of  unauthorised absence.  What  this

really  amounted to was that after 110 days of strike,

they  lost  six days of what the company  had  already

offered,  which  was  a  ten-day  increase,  and  they

obtained four days. In other words, before the strike,

the workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



were  getting  20 working days' wages as bonus.  After

110  days of strike, the union reached an agreement - we

are  told a very successful agreement - of a four  days'

bonus.  As I have said earlier, Sir, each worker  lost

about  $576  in  wages. He has now gained  four  days'

wages as additional bonus. Putting it in another form,

each  worker  will  have to work 18 years  before  his

additional bonus of four days' wages makes up for  the

loss  he has suffered. This is the great victory, Sir!

The  victory is that the worker will have to  work  18

years before he can make up the loss he has suffered!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To obtain the increase of one cent and four days'

wages  as  bonus, the union has accepted the company's

"Personal  Conduct  Rules" as part of  the  agreement.

This was not mentioned by the Member for Thomson. This

is  very  interesting.  There are  27  rules  and  any

employee  committing  any of these  offences  will  be

subject  to  disciplinary  action  even  amounting  to

dismissal.  No  other  union  in  Singapore  has  been

subject  to  such  conditions and this  is  the  great

victory  it has obtained after 110 days of  strike!  I

shall  refer  only to five of these rules to  indicate

the  types  of rules which have been accepted  by  the

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 3 - using abusive language. A worker can be

subject to dismissal for using abusive language.  Sir,

even  the  Member  for Cairnhill  will  say  that  the

language   in  a  factory  is  not  the  language   of

Parliament.  If  a  worker in the  Ford  factory  uses

abusive language, he will be subject to dismissal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 5 - running in any building. If there is a

fire  in  the factory, a worker should not run because

he will be  dismissed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 9 - smoking in restricted areas or lavatories.

You  should  not  smoke  in  lavatories  in  the  Ford

Company. This is the agreement the union agreed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 26 - Sitting in Company cars and trucks during

rest  period. During rest periods you should not  sit,

and this is a company that assembles cars. There are a

lot of old trucks but he must not be seated there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 27 - Obscenity. I imagine, Sir, the Managing

Director  of Ford Co, must belong to that strange  sex

who  does  not smoke, drink, and use abusive language,

and   all  that  sinful,  and  he  has  imposed  these

conditions on factory workers in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mr Fong Swee Suan, after 110 days of strike and

after  the  Union  obtained a  one-cent  increase,  an

increase of four days' wages as bonus, agreed  not  to

use  abusive language in the factory. The  Member  for

Queenstown  said that their unions fought  to  improve

the  standard of living of the workers. If the results

obtained in the Ford Co, strike by Mr Fong Swee  Suan

is  the  way  that the Barisan Sosialis  improves  the

standard of living of the workers, then, Sir, God help

the  workers, because they will have to work  over  25

years to enjoy the benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the industrial workers were out on strike, the

clerical  workers  who are members  of  the  Singapore

Business  Houses Employees Union stayed out from  21st

November, 1961, to 29th September, 1961. I wonder  who

is  going  to pay for the loss of salaries  that  they

have suffered during that period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the clerks stayed out, I am told that the

S.B.H.E.U, sent a letter to the Ford Co, claiming that

their  members - these  are their  words - "their  members

have  expressed their fears and will not  be  able  to

work."  This  is  a  letter  written  by  the  General

Secretary  of the Singapore Business Houses  Employees

Union  writing to explain to the Factory  Manager  why

the   clerical  workers  who  were  members   of   the

S.B.H.E.U. would  not be able to attend  work,  while

there  was a strike organised by one of the unions  in

the   S.A.T.U. group  itself.  The  S.A.T.U. leaders

frightened  their own members by their  actions.  Then

they  could  no  longer control them  and  turned  the

clerical  workers  into  strike  breakers.   On   29th

December,  1961, while the strike was  still  on,  the

clerical  workers  were instructed  by  the  union  to

return  to  work. After the strike was over, belatedly

they  came  crawling  into the Industrial  Arbitration

Court for a decision on their claims



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



for  the clerical workers, which they could have  done

long before the strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are good strikes and bad strikes. There

are  good  strikes that are won, and  there  are  good

strikes  that are lost. The Ford strike was lost,  and

no amount of speeches by the Members for Choa Chu Kang

and  Thomson is going to deceive the workers that that

strike  was lost, and they went crawling back  to  the

Factory under the conditions laid down by the Factory.

The  strike  was  lost because the leaders  asked  the

workers  to  sacrifice themselves and they  themselves

were not prepared to make the same sacrifice - a loss of

110  days  of wages, a loss which will take  years  to

make  up. This could have been avoided except for  the

political policy of the union's pro-Communist  leaders

to  avoid the Arbitration Court so that the Government

would not get credit for its policy of justice for the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy of Singapore was denied the production

for which Singapore workers would have been paid wages

which foreign workers enjoyed. If those cars that were

sold  during  the  110  days  had  been  assembled  in

Singapore,  the  workers would have  been  paid  wages

which   these  foreign  and  alien  Workers  who   had

assembled them had gained during that time. The effect

on  the economy which the S.A.T.U. leaders pretend  to

consider  is  a  mockery. They  want  to  depress  the

economy for their political ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us explode the myth that these are trade union

leaders  genuinely interested in the  welfare  of  the

workers.  They  are,  as the history  of  this  strike

shows, dragging on a strike for political purposes.  I

contend,  Sir,  that  if  the  S.A.T.U. leaders   had

followed  the practices in our own laws,  the  workers

would  have  been spared this sacrifice. They  had  to

accept the restrictive measures imposed on them by the

Company,  which  are unprecedented in Singapore - 27  of

them.  The  S.A.T.U. leaders accepted the restrictions

because  they  wanted to increase the  misery  of  the

workers for political ends.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



What  are  the  benefits  obtained  after  all  their

strikes? The Labour Report shows that the lowest wages

earned  by workers in Singapore are by workers led  by

S.A.T.U. unions   where  daily-rated   workers   are

maintained as casual workers year after year. Not only

do  these  workers get less than $3 per day  but  they

never know how many days of work they will have  in  a

month.   The  workers  in  the  rubber  industry   are

represented  by the Singapore General Employees  Union

and the Singapore Rubber Employees Union. The wages in

this   industry  have  persisted  with  little  change

throughout the period of prosperity of this industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.A.T.U. unions do not want to go to arbitration

because they have to hide the low level of wages which

they  have agreed with some local employers. The court

proceedings  will show the actual wage levels  of  the

workers led by the S.A.T.U. group. The S.A.T.U. group

of  unions are not fighting to improve the standard of

living  of  the workers. They want the workers  to  be

dissatisfied, bring them out on prolonged strikes, and

at the end, no benefits. All that S.A.T.U. strives for

is dissatisfaction, misery and tension in order to use

the workers for the political ends of the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a matter of pride that Singapore has the

best  labour  legislation in South-East  Asia,  and  I

challenge  Members of the Barisan Sosialis  to  refute

this  and show proof of any country in Southeast  Asia

which  has  better labour legislation than  Singapore.

There   is   no  other  country  in  Asia  which   has

legislation   similar  to  our  Industrial   Relations

Ordinance  which gives the force of law  to  certified

agreements  and  an arbitration system  that  provides

justice  and fair play. Our legislation could be  used

to the maximum benefit for the workers if only the pro-Communist trade union leaders in the Barisan  Sosialis

wanted genuinely to better the lives of the workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  Government  had changed its  attitude  to  the

worker.  He instanced four strikes in which he claimed

that  the P.A.P. Government deliberately brought  out

the police to mishandle the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first strike that he mentioned was the Sassoon

strike.  In that strike there was trouble between  the

Secretary  of the Branch of the Business Houses  Union

and  the  employer. There was very bad feeling between

the  manager  of  that  firm and  the  Secretary,  and

tension  was mounting. The matter was brought  to  the

Ministry   and   after  a  lot  of   discussion,   the

Parliamentary  Secretary persuaded the men  that  they

should  not  under  any circumstances  resort  to  any

violence,  or do anything that would put them  in  the

wrong. When tension was mounting, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

remember  remaining in the office right  up  to  about

half-past  five  or  six in the evening,  and  Dominic

Puthucheary  came to see me at my request and  assured

me  that  though  there was a lot of  tension  in  the

office  there  would be no trouble but  that  the  men

would quietly go home. Later that night I went to  the

Crawford  Branch and was working there when I received

a  telephone call from Mr Kandasamy saying that there

was  trouble between the workers of Sassoon &  Company

and  the Police and that the men had been injured. And

he  asked  me to go to the Central Police Station  and

see  things  for  myself. I told  Mr  Kandasamy  that

before I left office -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister ought to

refer to Mr Kandasamy as the Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I beg your pardon, the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture. I told him that

I   had   received  an  assurance  from  Mr   Dominic

Puthucheary  that  there  would  be  no  trouble  that

evening;  he  had assured me that the men  were  going

home peacefully; that they would leave the office. And

I  expressed great surprise that they could have  been

hurt,  in view of that assurance, and even if  it  was

true  that they had been hurt, I said I was  the  last

man  who  could  be of any assistance. All  that  they

could do was to make a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



police  report and bring them to the General  Hospital

for  treatment. Immediately after that,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  Mr Woodhull rang me up at the Crawford  Branch.

He  asked me to come and see for myself. He said  that

the  men were rolling in pain. He said, "You come.  We

could  lead  a demonstration against the  police.  You

come  with us to the Central Police Station. You  come

with us to the General Hospital and we can make a song

and a dance about it." He said we should have a go  at

the  police.  That was the situation  as  far  as  the

Sassoon strike was concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next morning I made inquiries.

I  found  that,  in fact, after the assurance  Dominic

Puthucheary  had given me, the men remained  in  their

office and took possession of it. The police had to be

sent  for and they were evicted as trespassers because

they  had  no  business to be in the office  of  their

employer after regular office hours. Now, is  it  fair

for the Member for Thomson to say that the police were

brought in by the Government to injure the strikers in

that particular wage dispute?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member also mentioned the

Glass  Factory  strike. There  was  trouble  there.  A

strike position developed. I had reports that the main

entrance  to the factory was barred. The men  had  put

benches at the main entrance. The management could not

have free access to their own factory. On that report,

I  took  action. I asked Mr Lim Ching Siong  to  come

with  me to see for himself. He refused positively  to

come, saying that he had another engagement. But I was

able  to  get  Mr  Fong  Swee  Suan,  Mr  Bani,  Mr

Woodhull,  Mr Dominic Puthucheary and Mr  Kandasamy,

to  go  with  me to the factory gate. When we  arrived

there,  we  found benches right across  the  entrance.

Nobody  could get in or out of that factory. I  called

the  attention of the party with whom I  was  to  this

obstruction  at  this  main gate.  Mr  Woodhull  said

nothing. He would say nothing, Mr Speaker. But I  was

able  to persuade Mr Fong to speak to the men and  to

tell them that that was wrong. So we spoke to the  men

and the position was explained to them, and those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



benches  were  later removed. That was a strike  which

lasted for a very long time. The upshot was this,  Mr

Speaker.  Many of the Malay workers insisted on  going

back  to work. They were being kept out by the Chinese

picketers.  They came to see me in the  Ministry,  and

they  asked me to open a special register for them.  I

opened  a special register. They gave me their  names,

their   identity  card  numbers  and  put  their   own

signatures on to a long list, saying that they  wanted

to go back to work, but that they were being kept out.

Eventually  I had a meeting with them. I explained  to

them that if they did that, then they would be strike-breaking. They said never mind, the responsibility was

theirs.  They wanted to go back to work but they  were

prevented  from  doing so by the other  strikers.  Now

police  assistance had to be rendered  to  them.  Then

there  was a fight naturally. There was resistance  by

the  strikers  who  did not want to  allow  the  Malay

workers to go to the factory, and something had to  be

done about it. Eventually with the help of the police,

these  Malays were able to get back to the factory  to

work.  When they were in, Mr Speaker, other  strikers

laid siege to that factory, so that those men were not

able  to get out. They had to be supplied. Their  food

had  to  be brought in to them. Both Mr Woodhull  and

Mr  Fong Swee Suan realised that the men were  acting

unfairly  in this strike, and it was through the  help

of Mr Fong Swee Suan that the Secretary of the Branch

union was removed from his office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson patted

himself on the back and patted members of his group on

the  back for the good work that they have been  doing

for  the  Singapore Business Houses Employees'  Union.

Mr  Woodhull  had  for a long time  been  interesting

himself  in  the affairs of the clerical employees  in

the  commerical world. He first got an entry into  the

Mansfield Employees Union. I remember his coming in to

tell  me that things were being very badly managed  in

the  Business Houses Union. There were people who were

pretending to be advisers of the Business Houses Union

who were, in fact, agents of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



employers  in that union, and they were betraying  the

cause  of  the workers. He told me that it  was  about

time that he moved in. So I suspected then that he was

trying to penetrate that union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1960, I was invited by the Business

Houses  Union  to their annual Christmas gathering  at

the  Victoria Memorial Hall. I got there  rather  late

that   night.   I  saw  at  the  main  table   Dominic

Puthucheary, the Member for Thomson, and Kum Siew Yee.

There  was  a dance on, and in the course  of  it  the

music  was  stopped. Then Mr Dominic Puthucheary  and

the  Member  for  Thomson got  on  to  the  stage  and

harangued  the crowd. They were dressed in shirts  and

trousers.  But  I noticed that Mr Kum  Siew  Yee  was

fully  clothed.  He had his coat on, a  nice  tie  and

fully  dressed for the occasion. I have known Mr  Kum

Siew  Yee for a very long time. In fact, when we  were

engaged in the non-pensionable expatriation pay fight,

he  helped  to organise the teachers for  us  in  that

fight. I have known that he had been indoctrinated  by

Mr   Devan  Nair,  who  had  fed  him  with   Marxist

literature  and  he was his tutor and mentor.  I  have

also  known  that a great change has  come  about  Mr

Devan Nair. He once was a Communist, but he had broken

with  the Communists. But at the time that I spoke  to

Mr  Kum Siew Yee, I knew that he was a Communist, and

that  he  had not broken off his connections with  the

Communists. So I said to him, "Kum, what are you doing

here?" He said, "You know, Kenny, I really do not like

all  this. You know we are dealing with this  English-educated lot. I have got to put up with it." There was

a  girl who was scantily clad. She was doing the hula-hula. He said, "Look at all this. I have got to put up

with this. I wanted a demonstration. I wanted a rally.

I  want to organise them. But here we have got to make

allowance  for all this. I have got to sit around  and

see  all  this  go  on."  Woodhull  was  not  at  that

Christmas gathering. It was then that I knew that, for

the first time, Woodhull had planted his agent in that

union.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before all this, and shortly after

we  became  the Government, I remember the leaders  of

the  Business Houses Union coming to see me and asking

me  to  help  them  to get a wage agreement  with  the

Federation  of Employers. They brought to me  a  draft

agreement and asked me if I would assist them to chair

meetings between them and the Federation of Employers.

I  did  so  on two or three occasions. Those men  were

asking  for  four  things. The first thing  that  they

wanted  was a gratuity scheme for the people who  were

serving the commercial houses for many years and  were

retiring  from  the  service. Some of  these  business

firms did give retirement benefits to their employees.

There  were  many  others  which  gave  no  retirement

benefits to their employees. And the delegation wanted

a  uniform  system  of retirement benefits.  That  was

their first claim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their next claim was that there should be proper

redundancy  agreements drawn up  in  cases  where  the

staff were laid off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their third claim was for bonus payments. The

employers had always contended that a bonus was an ex-gratia  payment, in the sense that when  profits  were

good,  a  bonus was paid. If there was no  profit,  no

bonus  was  paid. Whereas the union contended,  and  I

think with justice, that it had been a traditional way

of  employment here where employers treated a bonus as

some sort of a deferred payment in the sense that if a

man works for, say, a lower rate of wage, the employer

would  agree to pay him 13 months' pay for 12  months'

work  or 14 months' pay for 12 months' work. That  was

their contention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fourth claim was for wage scales. They were

very  tired of leaving all this to the good  sense  of

the employer to award his employees a wage increase on

merit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were their four claims which they regarded as

fundamental. I chaired meetings between them  and  the

Federation  of  Employers but we could  not  make  any

headway. The employers would not give in. It  is  true

what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



Member for Thomson said. They would have nothing to do

with a wage scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because we knew all this, we had

meanwhile  done something to bring in new  legislation

so   that  we  could  provide  machinery  whereby   an

independent  tribunal  could order  that  an  employer

introduces a salary scale where he has refused  to  do

so  and  that provision is written into the Industrial

Relations Ordinance. Later, Mr Speaker, Sir,  in  the

early  months  of  1960,  the  Business  Houses  Union

attempted  to  get agreements with three  firms.  They

were  Nestle's Products, United Engineers and the East

Asiatic   Company.  At  the  time   that   they   were

negotiating with the union, the employers,  it  was  I

think  just  after the New Year, started paying  merit

increments. That meant some employees got increases in

pay, others got no increases in pay. Mr Woodhull, who

was  in control of this union, came to see me and said

that  this was very unfair. "We want a wage scale,  we

have  been  asking them to give us a wage scale.  They

refuse  it and they pay merit increments in this  way.

Some  get  an  increase in the New  Year;  others  get

nothing."  So  I  said  to Mr  Woodhull,  "Would  you

promise  me one thing? I am prepared to help  you."  I

know  that he was negotiating these agreements at  the

time. "Would you provide for them? Would you insist on

writing into those agreements that the employer  would

be  restricted to paying only a wage scale and nothing

beyond  it? Demand wage scales and say that there  can

be  no  payments other than those provided for in  the

wage scale. Go ahead. Put that in; demand that it goes

in. If the employer refuses to put it in, I am telling

you  here that I am prepared to refer that dispute  to

the Arbitration Court. You make the demand, please. If

it  is  refused,  then  the dispute  will  go  to  the

Arbitration Court." Mr Speaker, Sir, for two or three

months  I  kept  calling him regularly on  the  phone.

"What  about it, Woodhull? Have you made the  demand?"

He put me off with one pretext after another.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did nothing. Mr Speaker, Sir, I heard that he

had  quietly  signed an agreement  with  the  employer

which  provided  for no salary scale; just  increases.

"This year we get $10, next year we get $15," that was

the  sort of game he was playing. He signed agreements

making  no provision for a salary scale, and  quietly.

Everybody got his $10 increase or $15 increase for the

year,  $15  increase for the next year, and those  who

got   the   merit  increments  pocketed  those   merit

increments as well. Is that not selling out the white-collar worker? What is the use of their coming to this

Legislative  Assembly now and saying  that  they  have

tried  very  hard  with the employers  to  get  salary

scales  for  the clerical workers, but conditions  are

entirely  different  and it is a  different  industry.

They  spoke  of Mr Rattray and said that Mr  Rattray

also  confirmed that it is a different  industry.  The

employers  cannot give anybody any salary  scales.  We

were  offering  them  every  assistance  so  that  the

clerical worker could get a salary scale. Now they say

that  they  have championed the cause  of  the  white-collar  worker. Where is the truth in all  that?  What

protection have the men got? They do not have a salary

scale;   they   have  no  retirement  benefits.   Some

agreements  provide for bonus, not all, and  very  few

provide  for  redundancy  agreements.  Where  is   the

service they have rendered to the clerical workers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the very same time that all

this  was  going  on, the Singapore General  Employees

Union  was able to negotiate long-term agreements  for

messengers  of a bank. I know of an agreement  entered

into  between  the Chung Khiaw Bank and the  Singapore

General  Employees' Union which provides for a 21-year

scale  with  increments at the minimum beginning  from

about  $160 up to a maximum of $319 a month, a 21-year

scale  for  messengers. And yet  the  Business  Houses

Employees'  Union  said  they could  not  negotiate  a

salary  scale  for the clerical workers. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, all this was done, I would say, with deliberate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



intent.  Here we were honestly and sincerely  offering

them  every  help so that they could get  the  workers

salary   scales   and   here  was   Woodhull   evading

responsibility  on  one  pretext  after  another.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the intent is this, that they want these

workers to be ever beholden to them. They do not  want

to  see  anybody who is satisfied and contented.  They

want the workers as soon as the agreement expires,  to

come hack to them so that they can negotiate again and

again  and  be in control of these men for  all  time.

That is their purpose for refusing to negotiate for  a

salary  scale for clerical workers. So that it  is  no

use  of  time  Member for Thomson now coming  to  this

Legislative   Assembly  and  making   all   sorts   of

accusations against the Government which he  knows  to

be  completely  untrue. It is no  use  his  trying  to

pretend that the Government has been anti-worker, that

the Government has been bullying the workers. He knows

all that is not true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to industrial relations, it is true that we

introduced  the Industrial Relations Bill without  any

consultation with the unions. We also did not  consult

the  employers. We thought that it would be  necessary

for  us to introduce that legislation and then receive

representations.  As  a result of the  representations

received from Messrs. Woodhull, Lim Ching Siong,  Fong

Swee Suan and the group which was known as the 10 Tall

Men, we put in the 50 amendments that were referred to

by  the  Member for Cairnhill. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

original  Bill  provided  for automatic  reference  to

arbitration where an issue was deadlocked. They talked

vehemently about it, particularly Mr Woodhull. Surely

that was a denial of the worker's right to strike.  In

a democracy all workers must, in the last resort, have

that  right. At the most, they were prepared to  leave

it  to  the  discretion of the Minister.  But  if  the

Minister  considered  that the dispute  should  go  to

arbitration, well, he could put it to arbitration.  We

were prepared to be reasonable with them. We knew that

situations can arise where it will be necessary for  a

union to strike. Take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



the  case  of  the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation

dispute. In that case, there was no dispute over wages

and  conditions  of  service. It  was  just  that  the

management were being cussed. They were trying to deal

with  individual  employees behind  the  back  of  the

union. The union protested and said, "Do not do  that.

It  is unfair that you should do that. Treat with us.

You  have  treated  with us. Since  you  have  made  a

mistake  - we know that you have made a mistake  - if

you will just formally apologise to us and give us  an

undertaking  that you will not treat us like  this  in

future,  we  will  call  it a day.  We  will  take  no

action." They just ignored them, with the result  that

the  men  went  on  strike. We  recognised  that  such

situations could occur and it was for that reason that

we  were prepared, us the Government, to take out that

provision  from  the  Bill  which  provided   for   an

automatic   reference  of  every  dispute   that   was

deadlocked  to the Industrial Arbitration  Court.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that Bill was passed. It was enacted  in

this   House  with  the  complete  approval  of  these

gentlemen.  I  had  many  meetings  with  them.  Every

amendment  that they put to us was considered  on  its

merits  and  properly  discussed,  and  when  it   was

eventually  brought to this House,  it  was  with  the

absolute consent of all these gentlemen. As soon as we

introduced  that  Bill, they started sidetracking  it.

They had no intention of ever using its provisions.  I

was  offering  it to them in the case of the  clerical

employees. I told Woodhull, "Do not be afraid  of  the

employers.  I am prepared to put it to the Arbitration

Court.  If  you  have  the  guts  to  write  into  the

agreement  that  you want it to be provided  that  the

employers shall pay their employees the salaries  that

are provided for in a scale, and if they refuse to  do

it,  then the dispute will go to arbitration  and  you

could  get  an award on that." He was not  willing  to

play.  Why was he not willing to play? Because he  had

the  intention  of being completely dishonourable  and

dishonest about this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have dealt fairly with them

right through. They will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



never  bring any dispute to the Labour Ministry.  They

go  off  on their own. The House heard what the Member

for  Thomson  said, that he preferred to  bring  these

disputes to Mr Booker. He was happy to bring them  to

Mr  Booker.  He  challenged me. He  said,  "There  is

nothing to prevent us from doing it. Show us where  it

is  provided  in  the  Bill that  we  cannot  see  Mr

Booker."  They were the ones who asked us to keep  the

lawyers out when we passed the Bill. They wanted us to

keep  the  lawyers out. They said it  was  unfair.  If

lawyers  were  allowed  to come  into  all  this,  the

employers  would  be able to engage  the  best  talent

available.  They  would then be at a disadvantage.  It

was  they who made those representations to us. It was

because  of  them that we had to get the lawyers  out.

Yet  the  Member for Thomson - what did he say? - said  he

preferred to go and deal with Mr Booker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have watched them for over a

long  period and we are quite satisfied that they have

not the slightest intention of ever wanting to use the

provisions  of that Bill. They have also  referred  to

the  Trade Unions Ordinance. They said that we enacted

a piece of legislation and that we subsequently backed

down;  that  we let the unions down; that we  let  the

workers   down.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that   Ordinance

provided for what is known as the unification  of  the

trade union movement. In that Ordinance it is provided

that a union can only be registered if it comes within

one  of the 19 categories that are provided for in the

Schedule. It does not mean to say that there  must  be

only  19 unions, but that the union must be in one  of

those categories -

<div align="center"><b>OCCASION OF UNIVERSITY WEEK</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I received a letter on 14th  March,

1962,  from  Nanyang University students addressed  to

all  Members in this House. This letter requested that

all  those  people's representatives with a  sense  of

responsibility should question the Government  on  the

reasons for refusing to issue a permit for a series of

academic  publications to the students'  organisations

under the Printing Presses Ordinance. It also referred

to the smear made in the statement by the Minister for

Home  Affairs on the students' union. I have therefore

risen to say something on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some people may ridicule me by

saying that when I was Parliamentary Secretary I spoke

for  the  Government, but that when I am now  no  more

with  the  Government  I  speak  for  those  who   are

dissatisfied with the Government, and that therefore I

am  an  opportunist.  Well, I do  not  wish  to  argue

against  this kind of criticism which may be  levelled

against  me.  The question whether I am an opportunist

or not can best be decided by facts as time goes on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come back to the main issue. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  from what I read in the Press of the open letter

from the Nanyang University Students' Union and of the

statements  by  the  union and the Minister  for  Home

Affairs, I got the feeling that it was the union which

was   reasonable.  Every  year  the  union  takes  the

opportunity of the University Convocation in March  to

hold  a  University  Week, recreational  and  cultural

concerts,  exhibitions  and academic  forums,  and  to

publish  books on academic topics. This  practice  has

become  a  very  good  tradition of  the  students  in

Nanyang University. The University Students' Union has

decided  to  issue  books on Natural  Science,  Social

Science,  Arts,  Political Studies  and  other  topics

concerning Malayan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



History  and Geography during University Week.  It  is

doing  this  in  order to promote studies  within  the

University  itself and to show to the  people  outside

- especially  those  in  society - what  the  University

students  have  achieved  in  the  field  of  academic

studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of last year, it sent an application to

the  Minister for Home Affairs for a permit under  the

Printing   Presses   Ordinance   for   a   series   of

publications,  but  the Government insisted  that  the

application  should  come from the Vice-Chancellor  of

the University. The Minister for Home Affairs wrote  a

letter  officially on 19th February to  the  Students'

Union  stating  that the Government  had  refused  its

application for a permit. No explanation was given  in

the  letter of the Minister for Home Affairs as to why

it  was insisted that the application should come from

the  Vice-Chancellor  instead of  from  the  Students'

Union.  The  Students' Union was set  up  as  a  legal

organisation  under the Nanyang University  Ordinance.

It  has  statutory  status and  the  capacity  to  act

independently. In this connection, the Vice-Chancellor

of  the  Nanyang University has informed the Students'

Union  that  he  would  not  be  responsible  for  the

publications. In fact, the legal adviser to the union,

Mr  David  Marshall, wrote to the Minister  for  Home

Affairs requesting the Government to respect the legal

position of the union and not to delay the issue of  a

permit.  But  the  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  still

refused  to issue a permit to the Students' Union  and

no explanation was given for the refusal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University Week is just around the corner and the

students  are very anxious about the whole  thing.  On

22nd February, they issued a Press statement making  a

report  of  what  had  taken  place.  They  also  sent

representatives to see the Minister for Home  Affairs.

Unfortunately, he did not grant them an interview.  On

2nd  March,  the  Ministry of' Home Affairs  issued  a

Press statement alleging that the Students' Union  was

unreasonable  in  its  attitude,  that  it   was   the

intention of the union to produce propaganda  material

against the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



Government, and that therefore it could be  seen  from

all this that the so-called academic publications were

in fact publications with political ends in view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Nanyang University Students'

Union  has  experienced  many  difficulties  in   this

matter,  and  it has been wronged. So  those  who  are

interested  in the university education  of  Singapore

should  not  take an indifferent view of this  matter.

The  students do not understand why they cannot get  a

permit under the Printing Presses Ordinance for  their

publications. They also do not understand why in  1960

the  union  was  successful in its application  for  a

similar  permit for its publications,  but  that  this

year's  application was not approved and that  it  has

instead invited a smearing attack from the Government.

They do not understand why there is this difference in

these two years. Can we say that it is a bad intention

on the part of time students to publish books in order

to  show how much they have achieved in their studies?

Does  it  mean  that  the  getting  of  economic   and

financial support and winning the sympathy of  members

of  the  public should be interpreted by the  Minister

for  Home Affairs as non-academic political ends? Does

it  also  mean that before Nanyang University can  see

eye   to  eye  with  the  Gwee  Ah  Leng  Report,  the

Government  does not wish to see the students  of  the

University making individual improvements?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University education is a very important factor in

giving  an  impetus  to  social  progress.  University

undergraduates  should have freedom in their  studies,

including   studies   on   political   problems.   The

Government should allow University students to express

all  forms  of  political views and philosophies.  The

Ministry  of Education, together with the Ministry  of

Culture, can influence the students of tile University

through arguments but time Government should not  make

use  of  an  order  from the Ministry  of  Culture  to

suppress  the views of the students. They  should  not

try to curtail the freedom of speech of the students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are no longer living in a

medieval  age when those who went against  traditional

thinking were oppressed. We must give encouragement to

young  people to develop new thinking and  accept  the

challenge  of new thoughts. It is only by  doing  this

that  we are able to make social progress. I hope that

the Minister for Home Affairs will correct his present

attitude in dealing with this question and rectify his

mistake   accordingly.  I  appeal  to   the   Minister

concerned  to  approve immediately the application  of

the Nanyang University Students Union for a permit. We

also hope that he will in a just manner try to get the

support of the Nanyang University students.



<br><br>00.17 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

just now the Member for Upper Serangoon said that  the

Government's  act  in refusing the application  for  a

permit  by  the  Students Union  was  to  curtail  the

academic  freedom of publication of the  students.  If

this  allegation  can  stand,  then  why  should   the

Government  want the Vice-Chancellor to  send  in  the

application?  This  means that the Government  had  no

intention  to  refuse the application of the  Students

Union to issue its publications. What we wanted was to

get  the  Vice-Chancellor to be responsible for  these

publications, because we were of the opinion  that  if

the    Vice-Chancellor   was   responsible   for   the

application  for  the  publications,  then  everything

should be all right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government will definitely not

interfere  with  genuine  academic  freedom  and   the

freedom  to publish, unless some people want  to  make

use of academic freedom and the opportunity to publish

books  for  political  ends. We have  records  of  the

activities  of  the applicant and the members  of  the

editorial board. From these records we have reason  to

believe that they may carry out anti-national and anti-people propaganda in their publications. Now, if  they

say  that  there is no academic freedom of publication

in  Nanyang  University, then we will tell  them  that

since its inception there have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



altogether   been   16  societies  of   the   students

registered  under the Societies Ordinance. Because  of

the shortage of time, I would not like to list all the

societies' names, but just want to mention a few. They

are   the  Political  Science  Society,  the  Dramatic

Research  Society, the Chinese Language and Literature

Research  Society, the History and Geography  Society,

and  so on. I only mention a few to save time. If they

say  that there is no academic freedom, how is it that

there have been 31 different types of publications  by

the   Nanyang  student  bodies  permitted  under   the

Printing  Presses Ordinance? Because  of  shortage  of

time,  I  would  not  like  to  mention  all  the   31

publications. I will mention only a few. They are  the

University  Tribune, the University Youth,  the  Suloh

Nantah  and  Political Science.  The  registration  of

these  16 student societies has been allowed, and  the

31  publications  by  these  16  societies  have  been

approved  by  the Government also. All the  University

academic  forums and debates conducted by the students

have not been interfered with in any form. From the 31

publications,  we  can  see  many  articles  and   the

Government has not interfered with them at  all.  This

goes  to  show  that  there  is  academic  freedom  of

publication  in the University. As a matter  of  fact,

there   are   many  publications  by  the   University

students,  such  as  the  University  Tribune,   which

contain  articles outside the scope of  the  so-called

academic studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the 26th issue of the University

Tribune,  in celebration of Women's Day, has published

with  superficial changes an article by a person known

as  Yu Tze Niu with the title of "The Women's Movement

in  Singapore and Malaya in Retrospect and  Prospect".

This  article  has  been  written  on  the  lines   of

Communist arguments based on a similar article by  Lie

Kiu,  a  member of M.C.P. Because of the  shortage  of

time,  I  would  just like to quote a short  paragraph

from  this article to compare with Lie Kiu's  to  show

its true nature. The paragraph reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The women's movement in Malaya started roughly

after 1925. At that time Malaya was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



in  the  midst of a world economic crisis because  the

capitalists  were  trying  all  out  to  exploit   the

colonies:  and being in a colonial Malay a, women  had

to  suffer  from the exploitation by the colonialists.

So there was a common objective to combat and struggle

against  the  exploitation  and  suppression  of   the

imperialists  in our country for women's  emancipation

and national emancipation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a paragraph in Lie Kiu's article in

commemoration  of Women's Day. This was  contained  in

Vol.  I of `The New Women's Monthly' published on  8th

March,  1946,  in  which  it was  stated  that:  `Tile

Overseas  Chinese Women's Movement in  Malaya  started

after 1925. At that time Malaya was in the grip  of  a

world   economic   crisis  and  all   the   time   the

imperialists  were  trying to take  advantage  of  the

colonies, particularly of women, ...' and so on, and  the

rest also about the same. So we can see that these two

articles  were  quite similar. The only difference  is

that  in  the  Communist magazine the words  "Overseas

Chinese" were mentioned, but in the Nanyang University

Tribune  they have thought fit to leave out this  term

because  it  is  already out of place at  the  present

time.  From  this  also we can see  clearly  that  the

M.C.P. is  a  Party which owes its  allegiance  to  a

foreign country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, there are many other articles of a

Communist  nature.  In  fact,  these  articles  are  a

reprint  with  a changed appearance of some  Communist

articles.  For  example, in March 1961  there  was  an

article  published in the Political  Science  entitled

"The  New  Spirit of Seeking Concord while Maintaining

Differences", written by an underground worker of  the

M.C.P. named  Lim Hock Khoon. Does it not  mean  that

there  is  academic  freedom and freedom  of  academic

publications? What they are trying to get is Communist

academic  freedom. Mr Speaker, Sir, we are  under  no

obligation  to protect this kind of academic  freedom.

As  a  matter  of fact, the behaviour of  the  Nanyang

University Students Union is an insult and an  affront

to  the  true sense of academic freedom. They call  it

academic pursuit, when in fact it is not so. They  are

just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



making  use  of time terms "academic freedom"  through

students'   publications  to   carry   out   Communist

propaganda   work.  They  themselves  are   short   of

inspiration  and  so  they have to  copy  from  banned

Communist   magazines  and  articles.  The   fact   is

undeniable, though they may say it is a smear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon has brought up this

question.  We  are  aware of  his  intention.  He  has

brought it up in order to raise his personal prestige,

because  when  he  was  in the  P.A.P. he  was  quite

arrogant,  and because of his behaviour  he  lost  the

confidence of many people. This is a common fact among

the students in Nanyang University. If he should refer

to  a  criticism written then by Ign Hsentan  then  he

will  know  about all these things. He himself  was  a

member   of   an  underground  Communist  organisation

before.  So he would like to see propaganda  work  for

Communism  carried cut under the pretext  of  academic

freedom  in  order  to restore his personal  prestige.

Perhaps  he  will say that I am saying  this  just  to

smear  him. Now, perhaps he says this is a smear,  how

is  it  that when this House was debating the question

of  Malaysia,  the  Minister for National  Development

openly  accused him of being an open front  worker  of

the  Communists, and at that time he  dared  not  deny

it'?  Because he knew if he did he would be confronted

with many irrefutable facts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order'?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Yes, because the Minister has

made a personal attack against me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order at all. It

is only a waste of time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): So, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  to  put  everything in a nutshell,  the  Working

Committee of the Nanyang University Students Union, in

applying for a permit to the Ministry of Home Affairs,

mentioned  that  these journals will contain  articles

concerning the political events in Malaya between 1945

and 1960 and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



educational  economic and political  problems  of  the

three   territories  in  North  Borneo.  Because   the

applicant  himself and other members on the  editorial

board have carried out certain activities in the past,

we  can well expect what these publications will be up

to,  and  it is because of this that we made a request

that the Vice-Chancellor should be responsible for the

journals  because  we  believed  that  if  the   Vice-Chancellor    was    prepared    to    shoulder    the

responsibility, then perhaps these journals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



would  not  be  made  use of for  political  ends  and

propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been pro posed at Twelve o'clock

midnight  on  20th March, 1962, and the debate  having

continued for half an hour, Mr Speaker adjourned  the

Assembly  without  Question  put,  pursuant   to   the

Standing Order.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at half-past Twelve o'clock a.m.</div>
