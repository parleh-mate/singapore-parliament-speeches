<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Training)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  in view of the recent announcement to  increase

with  effect  from  January 2004 the monthly  levy  on  a

single-skilled worker from $30 to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



$320 in an effort to encourage construction companies  to

upgrade  the skills of their workers, whether  there  are

any  specific interim measures the Ministry will take  to

help  facilitate  and  ease the  burden  of  construction

companies in retraining their workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the construction industry is  the  largest

employer  of foreign workers in Singapore.  Although  the

vast  majority  possess  a  trade  skill,  this  has  not

translated  into improvements in Singapore's construction

productivity.  Thus, the Government had introduced multi-skilling  and  enhanced  the skills  criteria  for  lower

foreign worker levy.  This is to raise the overall  skill

level  of  the foreign construction workforce and  reduce

the  industry's reliance on low-skilled workers.   Multi-skilled workers can be deployed for a wider range of jobs

at  a  construction  site.   This  will  result  in  more

efficient manpower utilisation and higher productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry and the BCA are mindful of the

impact  the changes may have on the industry.   Only  new

foreign workers recruited after 1st January 2004 have  to

meet the new skills criteria to be eligible for the lower

levy.   Existing workers have a transition period of  two

years  until 1st January 2005 to re-qualify for the lower

levy.  They will continue to be eligible for the low levy

(currently  at  $30 per month) until this date,  ie,  1st

January  2005.  So, most ongoing contracts would  not  be

affected.   With the long transition period,  contractors

would   also   have  sufficient  time  to  adjust   their

operations and factor the changes in their tenders.  They

should  also  have sufficient lead-time  to  train  their

workers  to  acquire a second skill during  this  period.

Contracts  of  a longer duration that could  be  severely

affected  will be considered on a case-by-case  basis  by

BCA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following these changes, contractors should not

continue   to  recruit  low  skill  foreign  construction

workers.   The sensible thing is to make greater  efforts

to  recruit better-skilled and more experienced  workers.

Business-wise, this is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



better  than recruiting low-skilled workers to be trained

in  Singapore.   While  such multi-skilled  workers  will

expect  higher  wages,  the lower levy  and  productivity

gains will more than offset any higher wage cost.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, in view of this

change, will the Ministry continue to reduce the Man Year

Entitlement  (MYE) as recommended by the Construction  21

Committee every year?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

yes.   Over  the longer term, we will still move  towards

tightening  the  allocation  of  non-traditional   source

workers   under  the  Man  Year  Entitlement  scheme   to

contractors.  But in view of the slew of changes that has

been introduced this year, we have decided that, for this

year,  we  will suspend any further revision of  the  Man

Year  Entitlement scheme.  But, starting from next  year,

we  will  review the situation and if, in fact, there  is

still  room for further reduction, which we believe  that

there  would  be, then we will carry on  to  achieve  the

target  set  by  Construction 21, which is  to  half  the

dependency  on  foreign  construction  workers  within  a

certain timeframe or faster, if we can achieve it.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  thank  you for allowing me to start this  important

and landmark Budget Debate for FY 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is different from the norm in the

past  years.   It  contains Government's  strategies  and

plans  over  the  longer term based on its  response  and

general  acceptance  of the Economic  Review  Committee's

Report.   At  the same time, as a standard practice,  the

Budget  Statement  spelt  out the Government's  immediate

fiscal  and monetary plans, tax changes and action  plans

for  the new financial year.  This two-pronged long  term

and  short  term discourse of the Government's strategies

and plans does require some re-orientation to readers and

observers,  trying  to  understand  better  this   year's

Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the same vein as the Budget announcement, I

shall  also  structure my comments on this year's  Budget

into two sections, covering first the ERC Report and then

the FY 2003 Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the ERC Report. This is a monumental

exercise involving about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



1,000 persons directly involved in sub-committees and

working groups over a period of one year.  I liken this

exercise to 1,000 cooks labouring together to create a

Singaporean favourite dish, eg, the char kway teow, with

DPM Lee as our chief cook.  Now, this dish is cooked and

being served to the people.  What are the responses and

reactions so far?  Are the people satisfied? I believe

the verdict is, like all recipes, it cannot cater to all

tastes.  Some like it, some do not.  And some do not

care!  So, not everybody can be fully satisfied. Some

want extra hot, some like it sweet.  Everybody wants more

goodies in it, but no one wants it bitter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have said that the final ERC Report is

not exciting. Nothing new or phenomenal has resulted from

it.   There  is  no  grand vision.  Where  are  the  bold

measures?   Generally, no excitement.  I  have  to  admit

that I tend to share some of these sentiments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on balance, I wish to point out that the

ERC  Report has accomplished  its mission very well.   No

one  should  belittle the profound effort,  the  numerous

valid  recommendations and the vital conclusions  of  the

ERC   Report.   One  thousand  of  the  best  minds,  top

managers, businessmen and political leaders had, in great

earnestness, reviewed all the major economic and economic-related  policies that literally left no stones unturned.

It is also correct that those stones that are found to be

all right are put back  -  no need to change for change's

sake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The involvement of the large number of people has

served   the   purpose   of   bringing   together   wider

participation  of many people in charting the  future  of

Singapore.   The  Report  has  been  most  comprehensive,

covering every economic and related issue.  I support, in

principle, all the recommended policy changes with regard

to  taxation,  CPF, manufacturing and service  industries

development, human capital and others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, allow me to spell out my specific

comments  regarding certain recommendations  in  the  ERC

Report.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, concern on depressing wages and land values.

A main thrust that appears to come across strongly in the

ERC  Report is that, henceforth, the Government wants  to

keep  the factors of production, ie. land, rentals, wages

and  other  operating costs low.  This is a well-intended

objective.  I have no quarrel with that.  But I  wish  to

remark that we cannot artificially hold down prices.   We

do  wish  to hold down increases in Government rates  and

fees,  wherever possible, but many costs, such as  wages,

land  and  rentals, are dictated by the market,  and  the

general  affluence  of  the people.   Every  year,  every

employee  wants to see an increase in his take-home  pay,

so  as  to at least match or better inflation and  rising

costs  of  expenses.  They want to see  improving  living

standards  for themselves and their families.   How  then

can we intentionally hold down prices?   Moreover, it  is

not correct to artificially press down values.  Do we not

recognise  that  we cannot compete with our  neighbouring

countries,  especially against China and India  based  on

low production cost?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder what happened to the previously much

promoted policy of going for higher technology and higher

value  added products, and to promote our brain  services

sector.  Not much has been said in the ERC Report on this

aspect.   Is it an understood issue or is it deliberately

de-emphasised in the Report?  If it is intentional, it is

useful to explain why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, concern on deflation. In line with my doubt

on  the  wisdom of focusing on depressing  the  costs  of

production, and therefore depressing values, I also  have

a  worry on the underlying deflationary effects of such a

policy.   It is therefore timely that I read in a  report

warning    about   "Overshooting   deflation    threatens

Singapore" in the Business Times on Saturday,  8th  March

2003,  in  a  study  by the US investment  bank,  Goldman

Sachs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the report, Goldman Sachs forewarned that, in

recent years since the Asian financial crisis, there have

been a series of negative shocks which add up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



to  the  largest  deflationary demand  shock  the  modern

Singapore  economy has ever faced.  Some of  the  factors

cited are :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 12% deterioration in terms of trade since 1996,

ie, after the Asian financial crisis;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Rise in regional political risk premium and

lower direct investment to the region;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Emergence of competition from China; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Restructuring of Government-linked companies

involving lay-offs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add to the above list that there is also the

uncertainty  in the domestic sector with the recent  high

profile  lay-offs in the Government  sector  -   of   PSA

Corporation  and HDB.  So, I am indeed very fearful  that

if  it  is  the professed intention of the Government  to

keep  wages  and land values low, it will further  dampen

the  already  depressed mood of the  people,  leading  to

lower  domestic  spending  which,  in  turn,  will  cause

domestic  demand to spiral downwards into a  deflationary

loop.   I strongly urge the Government to look into  this

concern of threat of deflation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, changing mindset to promote entrepreneurship.

Another  key  thrust  of the ERC  Report  is  to  promote

entrepreneurship,  so as to cultivate an  entrepreneurial

nation.  One of the three main tenets of the Report is to

remake  Singapore  into "a creative  and  entrepreneurial

nation  willing to take risks to create fresh  businesses

and  blaze  new paths to success".  I like this principle

and  I  fully support it.  However, I feel that  this  is

easier  said  than done.  It requires substantial  effort

and  total  commitment  from all.   Our  people  and  our

children  are too used to being led, guided and spoon-fed

by  the  Government.  We have to break  out  of  the  old

mould.   We  need  a fundamental mindset  change,  to  be

creative and take initiative.  But can we?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote an observation that shows that we have

an arduous task to change

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



the  people's  mindset, though we must.   Someone  called

this  the  No U-Turn Syndrome (or "NUTS", in short).   In

the US, the general traffic rule is that a driver can  do

U-turns along any road unless specifically prohibited  by

No  U-turn  signs.   In Singapore,  it  is  the  reverse.

Motorists   are   not  allowed  to  do   U-turns   unless

specifically permitted at locations where permitted signs

are  shown.   That  means that they cannot  do  anything,

unless  the authorities say "yes".  This mindset of  NUTS

(or   No   U-Turn  Syndrome)  is  so  ingrained  in   our

Singaporean mentality that we do not dare to do  anything

unless we get a "yes" from the Government.  How then  can

we promote initiative and creativity?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite another traffic rule example. In the

US,  where  traffic  is right hand drive,  motorists  are

allowed to turn right at all signalised junctions on  red

light,  provided the traffic is clear; and  unless  there

are  signs  prohibiting  this  right  turning.   But,  in

Singapore, it is again the reverse.  We cannot turn  left

at  signalised junctions on red.  However,  a  few  years

ago, LTA allowed the rule of "Turn Left On Red" or "TLOR"

at  some minor roads.  The shocking thing is that I  have

seen  with my own eyes, motorists who dare not make  left

turns  on  red, even though there are signages permitting

it,  and  the  traffic is clear!  This is the Singaporean

mentality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to get our people to be more

entrepreneurial.   I  believe  the  Government,  being  a

caring parent, must learn how to "let go".  We should cut

down  on rules and red tapes.  We have to give the people

their  choices to make.  We have to get out of the  habit

of  planning every minuscule matter for our people.  Give

them more avenues to express themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on GST, in view of the budget deficit and the

estimated  $650  million cost for  deferment  of  1%  GST

increase   for  one  year,  I  support  the  Government's

intention  to proceed to implement the second  instalment

of  the next 1% increase in GST in January 2004.   It  is

prudent  not  to incur higher deficit due to insufficient

revenue  collections  if  the GST  increase  is  deferred

further.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF, I agree with the recommendation to defer the

restoration of the balance 4% CPF for another two  years.

This  will  enable companies to save on  lower  operating

costs  and better able to sustain their viability  during

this  depressed business environment.  However, I do want

to voice my concern for those workers most affected, such

as  those  in  the older age group of 50  years  old  and

above.   This  age  group will not  have  their  CPF  cut

restored,  and will have to contribute more to their  CPF

Special  and Medisave accounts.  The lowering of the  CPF

salary ceiling from $6,000 to $5,000 will also mean  that

they  will  receive less contribution to their  CPF  from

their employers.  Then, they will have to face the double

blow  of  higher expenses due to the further increase  in

GST  totalling 2%, and, of course, general living expense

increases  which  are inevitable.  Therefore,  the  lower

income  group and the higher age group will  continue  to

need  support  from the Government in the  form  of  S&CC

rebates, rental and utility rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the next step for the ERC. As I said

earlier,  the  ERC Report is very wide and comprehensive.

What  I find lacking are the specific recommendations  on

the  implementation details to achieve the stated  plans.

I  can concede that it will be too thick to spell out the

actual implementation plans for every recommendation.  It

is,  therefore,  left  to  the  relevant  Ministries  and

agencies to follow through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report states that the Ministry of Trade and

Industry   (MTI)   will  co-ordinate  the  follow-through

actions.  Whilst I do not doubt the capability of MTI  to

undertake this task, I do wish to voice out aloud why  it

is  not  deemed important enough for this  matter  to  be

monitored  henceforth by the Prime Minister's Office,  or

the  Deputy  Prime Minister's Office.  I  feel  that  the

overseeing  body  should be either PMO,  or  by  the  DPM

himself.  In any case, he is the Chairman of the ERC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rationale for high level monitoring is similar

to  the  new Ministerial Committee on Services.  I  fully

support  the  formation of this Ministerial Committee  on

Services to oversee the development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



of   major  new  services,  such  as  health,  media  and

education.  The reason is that the work crosses over many

Ministries  with  inter-ministerial  issues.   Similarly,

most  of  the  ERC recommendations cut across Ministries.

Therefore,  a  supra-Ministerial person  being  in-charge

should spur smoother and speedier implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to move on to the policies

and  measures announced in the Budget for FY 2003.  As  I

have said earlier, the difficulty with this year's Budget

debate  is that we have to shift our orientation  between

the  long  term issues spelt out in the ERC  Report,  and

then  re-focus  back  to the short term  matters  in  the

Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be one reason why the reception to the

ERC  Report has been lukewarm, as some attention  of  the

public  has  been diverted to short-term impact  measures

announced in the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on focus on short term issues and threats. We

know  that  the  ERC Report is a very important  landmark

document.   It  spells out fully the total blueprint  for

Singapore's future survival.  However, the general public

is  more  focused  on  their immediate  problems.   Their

immediate  concerns are unemployment, firstly;  then  the

uncertainty  of  domestic economic recovery,  diminishing

asset  values, the looming threat of war in Iraq and  the

fall-outs  of  war,  the  unclear US  economic  recovery,

terrorism, threats of China and India, quarrels with  our

nearest  neighbour Malaysia, and the unclear  geo-politic

development  in  Indonesia.  Looking  through  this  long

list,  there  is  indeed reason for our  people  to  feel

deeply  worried.  Many are experiencing a sense  of  loss

and   despondency.    The  road   ahead   is   hazy   and

directionless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning back to the Budget for FY 2003, the

Budget  will see a deficit of $900 million.  This is  the

third  year  of  deficit in a row.  It  is  a  cause  for

concern on Government's principle of budget prudence.  We

have budget deficit for three years in a row.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I can accept the announcement that

there  will be no corporate and personal income tax  cuts

and  no income tax rebate for FY 2003.  To make such cuts

now will mean that there will be a larger budget deficit.

However,  I  would  urge the Minister  for  Finance  that

should  good times return next year, please do not forget

to  reward  the hardworking tax-paying people  by  giving

them some income tax rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the world and domestic

economies remain poor for a few years, I wonder how would

the  Government meet its stated intention to  cut  direct

taxes  to  20% by 2005, without incurring further  budget

deficits or introducing higher GST increase.  The  latter

move, of course, will be very unpopular.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although we have a deficit budget

for the new year, there is also a disappointment that the

new  Budget  is not stimulative enough for  the  domestic

economy.   I do admit that I seem to be speaking  with  a

forked  tongue.  Just a moment ago, I expressed  concerns

about  a continuing budget deficit, and now I seem to  be

urging  the Government to spend more to create  a  higher

budget deficit to stimulate the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. Although we said that Singapore has

incurred  three years of deficits, on closer examination,

the  deficits are still very small.  In FY 2001, a  total

deficit  of  about $2.8 billion was incurred.   This  was

about  10% of the total Government revenue for that year.

This deficit was high but it was needed to stimulate  the

economy  against a recession then.  Last  year's  deficit

for FY 2002 has been revised and estimated to be a modest

$0.1  billion or $100 million, versus the original figure

of  $0.9 billion, or $900 million.  So, FY 2002 is nearly

a balanced budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for FY 2003, the estimated deficit is $0.9

billion.   This  is  only  3% of the  total  Government's

operating  revenue collections for the new year amounting

to  $29.6  billion.  For the sake of getting our  economy

out  of the rut, and to give a booster to the people  and

business confidence, I would advocate a higher deficit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



for this new financial year.  I believe we can afford it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, it is thought that a deficit budget is

expansionary.  I would like to point out that this is not

necessarily  true.  It depends, to a major extent,  where

the  budget  funds  are  allocated.   If  funds  are  not

earmarked  for expansionary projects, like infrastructure

and  growth,  but to longer term projects like  education

and  social  targets, then a deficit budget  may  not  be

expansionary.   This year's budget may be in  a  deficit,

but   I   am  not  sure  whether  it  is  a  sufficiently

expansionary budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make matters worse, we understand that the

Government   has   directed  Ministries   to   cut   down

expenditures  on  projects and various  spending.   Would

this  instruction of the Ministry of Finance be  counter-expansionary?  We are beginning to hear feedback from the

private  sector  companies that they are receiving  fewer

contracts  from the Government.  If this  trend  were  to

continue,  would  it not aggravate an  already  depressed

economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Finance

whether  this  year's  Budget  is  indeed  a  stimulative

budget.   What  are  the  measures  to  kick  start   the

sputtering  domestic  economy?   Where  are  the   engine

boosters?   We do not have tax cuts, no pump priming  was

mentioned,   and   no   announcement   about   additional

infrastructure  spending.   So,  how  are  we  going   to

stimulate the economy to grow?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to what I call the "crutch mentality",

there is another dichotomy that I wish to raise.  This is

with regard to the continuation of the use of rebates and

welfare benefits to help the lower income group and  less

privileged  to overcome the various higher  indirect  tax

burdens  such  as  GST increase and the  higher  cost  of

living  expenses.  I am afraid that the long term use  of

rebates,  reliefs  and benefits will  lead  to  a  crutch

mentality of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, we have to gradually wean the less able

segment  of  the  people to take care of  themselves  and

become less

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



dependent on welfare and financial aid.  The same applies

to  the  young.   This  contention is  in  line  with  my

previous  point  that  to build a  truly  entrepreneurial

nation, the people have to learn to be less dependent  on

the   Government,  before  we  can  truly  create  a  new

entrepreneurial and vibrant nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message must be made clear - the Government will

help  you  today,  but you must learn  to  take  care  of

yourself tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are living in very uncertain

times.   The sense of despondency is actually worse  this

year  compared  to last year.  I recall that  during  the

budget  debate last year, my Backbench colleagues  and  I

had  already  warned about this sense of doom  and  gloom

prevailing  in Singapore then.  With higher unemployment,

announcements of layoffs, and fear of the looming war  in

Iraq,  the general sense of despondency is higher  today.

There  is a general sense of haplessness as many  factors

are totally outside our control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to boost the confidence of the people. This

is  a priority task.  Our people have to first understand

and  get  used to a future where double digit growth  and

continuing tax cuts, more NSS and ERS shares will not  be

easy   to   come   by.   We  have  to  re-orientate   our

expectations   of  growth.   We  have  to  accept   that,

henceforth, each incremental achievement requires greater

effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, sometimes, I cannot help but have the feeling

that we do tend to over-plan in Singapore.  I recall that

we  had  in the past the Vision 1999, The Next  Lap  and,

more  recently, the Singapore 21 Plan.  We also  had  the

Economic Committee in 1985.  It seems like deja  vu.   No

wonder there is muted enthusiasm to this ERC Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do wish to commend the Government for

launching  and completing the Economic Review Committee's

Report.   The people have been held in suspense,  pending

the  release of the ERC Report.  Now that the ERC Report,

as well as the Budget, is announced, we should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



move  on.   The Government has laid down the clear  long-term  goals.   The new fiscal and monetary policies  have

been spelt out.  The new directions have been set.  It is

time to get on with the business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whatever is happening around us

currently in the world, Singapore has to find its  place.

We  cannot foresee and plan ahead for everything.  If  we

can  be  nimble and creative, we shall always be able  to

find  our place in this world.  The Government must  show

strong  leadership in difficult times.  The  people  must

respond and shoulder its share of the burden.  Let us put

on  our  hard  hats and boots and take up  the  changkol.

Together,  let us start ploughing, to re-build  a  better

future for our children as best as we can.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you  for allowing me to join in the debate.   Sir,

today,  I  would like to talk on three points.  First  of

all,  my assessment of the Budget - what it achieved  and

what  it failed to achieve and what more could have  been

done.    Second,   I  would  like  to  comment   on   the

implementation of the ERC recommendations and, finally, I

will  touch on the issue of entrepreneurship and  what  I

feel  will  be the strategies needed to be successful  in

this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My assessment of the Budget, as I listened to the

Finance Minister delivering it, was that it seemed to  be

a  balanced  budget, addressing both the short  term  and

immediate issues as well as the longer term issues needed

to  address  the restructuring of the Singapore  economy.

As I analysed the Budget further, I actually saw very few

new  initiatives to make this Budget exciting  enough  to

catch the attention of long-term investors.  But before I

touch on this point, I would like to square off some very

obvious   things   that,   in  my   opinion,   were   the

disappointments of this Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, this Budget did not address the

concerns  of the middle group of Singaporeans.  While  we

did take care of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



the   lower  income  Singaporeans  through  the   various

rebates,  it did nothing to assure the biggest  group  of

Singaporeans  who  may have more assets  than  the  lower

income Singaporeans, but who, in the short term, have the

same concerns which worry them and, that is, the loss  of

jobs and the short-term financial help that they can  get

from  the  Government.  I feel that the  Minister  should

have  done  much more to assure Singaporeans  that  their

problems will be addressed in times of difficulties.  The

Minister  should have put in place a temporary scheme  to

make cash accessible to such Singaporeans, for example, a

1%  tax reduction could have helped these people in tough

times and these are the people who are paying tax and who

may have lost their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is the budget deficit, in my

opinion,  is hardly a deficit.  It seems to me  that  the

Minister tried very hard to end up with a deficit  budget

by  making huge special transfers in the three  areas  of

ERS,  Lifelong Learning Fund and Medical Endowment  Fund.

Similarly, I do not see how the year 2003 Budget will end

up in a deficit.  Again, we are making special transfers,

and we are forecasting a lower NII and we did not seem to

have  fully  accounted for the 1% GST  increase  and  the

special  income coming by way of more COEs expected.   So

if  we  had  spent a bit more in trying to help companies

and  individuals  in difficulties, perhaps  that  deficit

would have been a welcomed deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what about the long term cost competitiveness of

Singapore?  Has the Minister missed out looking  at  this

serious  recommendation, made not only by  the  ERC,  but

also  by  the many, many committees before the ERC,  like

the   SME21,   the   T21  and  the  Cost  Competitiveness

Committee?   I  feel  that the Minister  again  lost  the

golden  opportunity  to address once  and  for  all  this

critical issue that is sinking the Singapore economy.   I

am   really  disappointed  at  the  seemingly  short-term

thinking  of the Government, especially on this important

area  of  cost competitiveness.  And why do I  say  short

term?    The  measures  like  temporary  rental  rebates,

temporary property tax rebates

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



and   temporary   CPF  cuts  do  nothing  in   instilling

confidence  among  longer  term investors  that,  indeed,

Singapore  will  still remain competitive  not  only  two

years  from now, but also 10 years or 20 years from  now.

In  fact,  the  current  approach just  drives  investors

harder  to  move  out faster while they  can,  while  the

rebates  are  still in place.  As a serious  investor,  I

know that I have to worry that in six months, rentals and

property tax will go up again and that the CPF will again

go  up in two years.  The thought process will surely  be

to  encourage  companies to prepare to  move  out  before

costs  once  again increase when the regime of  temporary

rebates and temporary increases run out and go back to  a

steady state of higher costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all the efforts of all the committees I

mentioned  will  not  go in vain  and  I  hope  that  the

Government  will overcome this inertia and  get  down  to

addressing the cost issue seriously.  The ideas  are  all

there - differential land pricing, structural changes  in

the   wage   system,  levies,  fees,  charges  from   the

Government and utilities, logistics and telecommunication

charges.   We have enough data to show that Singapore  is

not competitive in all these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the issue of implementation of the ERC. We

all  know  that  many Singaporeans were involved  in  the

above  process  of  deriving the ERC recommendations.   I

must  admit  that  there was some skepticism  among  some

people involved in the process and a comment which summed

up the feeling went like this:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been asked to give my feedback many, many

times before for so many years.  What is the point?   The

Government  does not listen and does not  believe  in  us

anyway."



Sir,  this  is  a true quote coming from a few  prominent

Singaporeans.  To convince them, the argument that all of

us  who were involved in this process was that, this time

round,  the Government has realised that there is a  need

to  change  for the survival of Singapore and  everyone's

input  was  needed.  The outcome has been a lot  of  hard

work by many, and the many recommendations to remake  the

Singapore economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the whole, the recommendations have been

bold  and  will make a big difference, there are  certain

areas  which  could have been better dealt with.   First,

the  impression that we have is: are we really  re-tuning

or  refining  the economy?  We were promised  that  there

were  no  sacred  cows and that no stones  will  be  left

unturned in this whole exercise.  The outcome in a number

of  areas,  which I felt could have made an  even  bigger

difference,  was  not  changed.   The  ERC   could   have

exercised  greater will power to make bolder  changes  in

certain areas.  Unfortunately, the impression many people

have  is that all we have done is once again to just make

tweaks  in  certain  areas  when  we  should  have   made

fundamental  changes  to turn things  around.   When  the

whole exercise started, we talked about the remaking  and

restructuring of our economy.  It now appears more like a

refining  and re-tuning exercise in certain areas.   Yes,

we  did  pick the stones and place them back in the  same

place  or  in  some  other place.  We missed  the  golden

opportunity to make much needed changes to the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me back up my argument with a few examples.

First  of all, the tax system.  We have been touting  the

tax changes as a major structural change, but as far as I

can  see,  there was no real change in the  system.   The

real  big change happened when the Government implemented

the   GST   system,  I  believe,  in   1994.    The   ERC

recommendations merely reaffirmed the 1994  changes.   So

the  ERC's recommendation of a reduction of personal  and

corporate  tax rate was long overdue anyway.   It  should

have come down drastically the day we implemented the GST

changes.   The  tax  changes, in  my  opinion,  were  not

radical enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is that of the CPF. It is

becoming  a habit now to tweak the CPF rate in  times  of

crisis.   While I am not against this to help us  in  the

short  term, this does not give us comfort that  we  have

gotten  to the root cause of the problem and that we  are

just  addressing  the symptoms.  Is it  not  sufficiently

clear that we have a structural problem with the CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



system?   We  should  have worked  on  a  more  permanent

solution, perhaps a lower contribution from employers and

compensated by alternated retirement and medical schemes.

Had  we  made bolder changes, we may never have to fiddle

with the CPF contributions now and then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final example is one of land prices, and in

this  topic,  I tend to defer from Mr Leong.   I  believe

that  the  high cost of property, particularly industrial

land,  is  a big issue.  To me, this is one of  the  most

serious  structural problems, other than the  wage  which

directly     affects     Singapore's     competitiveness,

particularly in areas of manufacturing.  So while we  may

talk  about  moving  low value-added  activities  outside

Singapore and trying to bring in more high-tech and  high

value-added activities in Singapore, the problem  is  the

image that we have created for ourselves is that we are a

place  where business activity is going to cost companies

a  lot of money.  It is a high-cost country.  And I  have

personally  visited a customer about three weeks  ago  in

the US, trying to bring in what I thought was a high-tech

activity  into Singapore, and the answer I got from  them

was  "We will probably not be coming into Singapore.  But

if  you can promise to do it in China or some other  low-cost  countries for me, I will move my high-tech activity

there."  The problem we suffer is that the image that  we

have created for ourselves is one of a high-cost country.

So we really need to fix this problem once and for all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is on the implementation of the ERC

Report's  recommendations and roadmap.  All of us  agreed

that the ERC exercise was a key and necessary initiative.

But,  in  my  opinion, we reacted a bit too late.   There

were  already a few signals that we could have picked  up

had  we been more attentive.  We could have reacted  much

earlier.   The  few  signals were  the  bursting  of  the

property bubble in 1996, the Asian financial crisis,  the

emergence  of China and India and the flow of  FDIs  into

China.   These are all new things.  We could have reacted

earlier.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But anyway, now that we have identified so many

initiatives, including some considered taboo in the past,

we  should now roll up our sleeves and start implementing

them  quickly, a point that Mr Leong made  earlier.   The

ERC  should not end up as an academic exercise.  Too many

important people have set aside their valuable time to be

involved and we cannot risk disappointing them and  again

failing  to  implement  the  recommendations  decisively.

More  importantly, we cannot risk failing  the  Singapore

economy.  The reason I am bringing this up is because, in

the  past, we have undergone similar exercises  with  the

likes  of  the  S21, SME21, Retail 21 and the  many  '21'

initiatives.  For some of these exercises, we were big on

plans,  but  short  on  actions.   We  risk  losing   the

confidence  of the key stakeholders of Singapore,  should

we   fail   in  the  implementation.    The   number   of

recommendations is overwhelming and, if not handled  well

and  not  implemented systematically, we could  lose  the

intended impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I read in the papers recently about

Singapore  climbing up one notch among the most expensive

cities  in  the  world compared to the  year  before,  we

actually became more expensive and not less expensive  by

one  notch.  My heart sank simply because it goes to show

that  we  have not moved fast enough in our restructuring

exercise.   The  second concern I have is  that,  in  our

attempt  to  restructure, are we doing this in isolation?

We should, in fact, be aware of the fact that there is  a

rapidly  changing environment around us.  Our  neighbours

are  also  contemplating the same thing as  us.   We  are

working with a moving target.  We want to lower the  cost

of  doing business, so do our neighbours.  We want to  be

the  Life  Sciences Hub in Singapore, so do  cities  like

Xian, Hyderabad, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot over-emphasise the need for speed. I

believe  it  is not only the ideas which will define  our

success,  but more importantly, our ability to  implement

these  ideas  and our ability to implement  them  swiftly

which  will  determine  how  successful  we  will  be  in

transforming our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



economy.  So let us not get too complacent but get moving

faster than what we are doing right now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of a non-starter and a failed attempt

which  comes  to  mind is the NatSteel  divestment  saga,

which  dragged on for so long.  The inability to  make  a

judgement to take a certain amount of loss, has  resulted

in  the  sloppy execution, in my opinion, of the NatSteel

divestment.  It is clear that Temasek failed  to  realise

this  to  be  a  short term loss but a  long  term  gain.

Because  it has to answer to the people of Singapore,  it

therefore has to err on the safe side by taking  a  kiasu

approach in ensuring the best possible value because they

have  to  answer to all of us.  Therefore,  this  is  the

cause  of Government getting involved in business in  the

first   place.   In  the  process,  we  lost  a   greater

opportunity  of  setting an excellent example  of  a  GLC

divestment  done successfully for the long-term  good  of

the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to see an implementation

roadmap  and  an implementation committee, like  what  Mr

Leong suggested, with the responsibility of ensuring that

recommendations are implemented the way we intended  them

to  be,  and  with  the speed necessary  to  achieve  the

intended impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be good for this implementation committee to

share its results regularly by publishing a scorecard for

all of us to see.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final topic I would like to touch upon is

entrepreneurship.  Having been so used  to  developing  a

corporate-based  economy in the last 30 years,  the  real

question  we have to ask is: are we willing  and  are  we

ready  to  make  the transformation to an entrepreneurial

economy?  And I think this is the most difficult question

for us to answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two key elements for us to succeed.

Firstly,  understanding  what  it  takes  to  create   an

entrepreneurial economy and, secondly, the lessons learnt

from our successes with the multi-national companies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, understanding what it takes to create

an   entrepreneurial  economy.   This  is   the   biggest

challenge and the most difficult one to overcome.  Unless

and until we resolve this issue, we will never be able to

transform our economy.  The challenge, therefore, for the

Government  and the Minister for Entrepreneurship  is  to

make a sincere pledge to lead this transformation of  our

economy  and, then, to understand what is needed to  make

this transformation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first challenge, therefore, is that of a mindset

change.    Yes,  it  is  difficult  to  attract   foreign

companies to invest and set up shop in Singapore, but  it

is  even  more  difficult for our  economic  agencies  to

visualise how a start-up or a non-entity - someone who is

trying to do a start-up - can one day evolve into a world-class  company based in Singapore.  So, it  is  therefore

compelling to still take the relatively easy way  out  of

continuing to deal with a corporate-based economy  -  the

tried and tested model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfortunate fact is that I feel the Government

is still unsure or half-hearted about putting in place an

entrepreneurial  economy.  Why is this  so?   If  we  ask

anyone  of the Government economic agencies or the  civil

servants who are driving this initiative, we cannot  help

but  conclude that they are still programmed to bring  in

foreign  MNCs.  The sad thing is that many are  sceptical

about  the ability of our local entrepreneurs to make  it

big.  I say this from my own personal experience and from

direct feedback from would-be entrepreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue on entrepreneurship is lessons

learnt  from  our successes with MNCs.   If  the  mindset

change  can  be achieved, then I feel that the  next  few

steps  needed to succeed in transforming our economy  and

of  encouraging more entrepreneurs to set up their  bases

in Singapore would be much easier.  We can learn from our

successes in the economic development of Singapore in the

first  30  years,  which have been in attracting  foreign

direct  investments,  multinational  companies,  and   in

establishing bigger companies, ie, the Government-linked

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



companies  here.  We can then apply them as we  focus  on

building an entrepreneurial economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three main lessons to be learned from

building  a corporate economy.  They are, first, creating

a   conducive  environment;  second,  putting  in   place

incentive  schemes;  and last, but  not  least,  a  hand-holding of multinational companies from cradle to  grave.

What  I am about to say may seem obvious, but I feel that

we have not fully understood the root causes and have not

addressed  and learnt from these lessons, and to  address

the   issues  on  how  we  can  successfully  create  our

entrepreneurial economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, on creating a conducive environment

for MNCs to set up base, why were we successful?  Because

the    Government    had   developed    an    appropriate

infrastructure,   offered  cheap  land,   removed   other

obstacles that may have existed and made it easy for MNCs

to  decide  to  start  up  operations  here.   Rules  and

regulations  were  tailor-made for MNCs  and  for  bigger

companies.   Many of the MNCs and GLCs had direct  access

to  top  civil  servants and Ministers, and this  allowed

them  to resolve issues faster.  The lesson here is  that

the  rules  made for bigger companies will not  work  for

start-ups and for smaller companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on incentives and financing schemes made

for bigger companies.  To complement the setting up of  a

conducive environment, the economic development  agencies

developed a slew of incentive schemes, Government  grants

and tax breaks, again tailor-made for MNCs and for bigger

companies.  The lesson here is that while it is easy  for

big companies to apply and utilise the incentive schemes,

the  smaller companies find it terribly difficult  to  do

the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, hand-holding of MNCs from cradle to grave.

This,  in  my opinion, is the most significant initiative

implemented  here  that  made MNCs  most  comfortable  in

setting  up  bases in Singapore.  Kudos to  the  EDB  for

this.  We created a one-stop

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



agency which hand-held MNCs coming into Singapore,  right

from  the  time that we were courting, through  the  time

that they started operations in Singapore, up to the time

that  we  encouraged them to leave for places like  Batam

and Suzhou.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dealt with EDB on many occasions - while

working  in a multi-national company as well  as  when  I

went to start up my own local companies - I thought I had

a  good feel of how they operate.  I must confess that  I

really  understood  EDB  only  after  reading  its   book

published  recently called Heartwork.  It is an excellent

book.  After reading it, I understood why EDB did what it

did,  and became even more convinced that EDB will  never

be able to handle and help local start-ups.  I would like

to  say that the EDB has done an excellent job all  these

years but, having understood the charter and the mode  of

operation, especially after reading the book, I  realised

that  it is unfair and impossible for them to effectively

support  local companies.  Let me share one example  from

the book to illustrate the mindset with which it operated

in helping bigger companies coming into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the book, what I read was, when Apple

computers  wanted to set up a factory in  Singapore  many

years  ago, EDB went the full mile, did all the work  for

Apple in fitting up the whole factory.  In fact, it  went

even  further than that.  An officer was allocated  on  a

full-time basis to become the project manager for setting

up   of  the  factory.   The  American  manager  who  was

responsible for setting up the Apple factory in Singapore

did not have to be personally here in Singapore while the

facilities  were  being set up.   That  is  what  I  call

service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anyone in this House give me an example of a

similar  service for our local companies?  I do not  know

of  any.   The  reality is that most local companies  are

left on their own to fight their own battles and to clear

the many obstacles themselves.  At times, I dare say that

the  bureaucracy works against them.  The lesson here  is

that had we not had EDB to champion the cause of MNCs, we

may not have developed such a vibrant economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



Champion agencies can do wonders because of the influence

they  have in clearing these obstacles.  So, how  can  we

apply these lessons?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let us create a conducive environment by

making  a  review  of rules - which is happening,  and  I

think  the  rules  should not just be reviewed  but  also

revamped  - this time round, by putting smaller companies

and start-ups centre-stage when we develop these rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, of course, is to revisit all the incentive

schemes and tailor them to suit start-ups and SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we really need an EDB-style organisation, a

one-stop  agency for SMEs and start-ups.  Today,  we  see

too  many  agencies  claiming to champion  the  SMEs  and

entrepreneurs, but my experience with them is  such  that

none  is  able to provide the comprehensive service  that

EDB  does for MNCs.  Many things, in fact, fall into  the

crack for entrepreneurs and smaller companies.  We need a

champion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to build a vibrant financing environment,

such  as the ones that exist in entrepreneurial economies

in the USA, Taiwan and Israel.  I will elaborate on these

during the Committee of Supply debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the budget is just one of the

many levers to address the current situation that we  are

in.   The  current crisis is different from the  previous

predicaments, although we may use the same terminology to

describe  them.  We have been using the same old  formula

to  address these new predicaments.  The context  of  the

problem  has  changed.  And it will continue  to  change,

because  we  live in a world where change is a  constant.

As  a  result, each crisis will become more complex  than

the  previous one.  We have to adopt newer measures,  and

the  speed  of  implementation  is  essential  for  their

success.  This year's budget is being hailed as a  budget

in  transition.  My opinion is that we need to get out of

this  transition quickly.  We have been in the transition

mode  for  quite  some time.  We need  to  arrive  at  an

economic  model that we want very quickly.  We have  been

planning for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



quite some time.  The planning phase is over.  It is  now

time  to execute and implement bold measures.  We  cannot

be  half-hearted in our endeavours.  We need to be  clear

in thought and be decisive in action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the belief that the Minister will implement

swiftly these new measures, I support this motion.

<br>11.52 am

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Deputy  Prime Minister and Finance Minister announced  my

appointment   as   Minister  of  State   in   charge   of

entrepreneurship, I have been inundated with emails  from

the  public.   There have been many suggestions  on  what

needs to be done to further the cause of entrepreneurship

in Singapore.  I will take these and those that are being

raised  in  this House in the course of this debate  into

serious  consideration.  Some of these I will  answer  in

the  Committee of Supply, and others I may  need  to  get

back  to Members later, as it may require further thought

on my part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever it is, I see this sudden deluge of

advice  as a big positive, as it means that there  is  an

increasing  constituency in our  society  to  embrace  an

entrepreneurial, go-getting culture, where  opportunities

are  seized and risks taken to create something different

in  whatever  we do.  In fact, some email writers,  after

sending me one advice after another, told me that, for  a

suitable  fee, this arrangement could be made  permanent!

So, I think that there are good grounds for hope that  we

will   indeed   successfully  foster  an  entrepreneurial

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us be clear right from the outset that we

are  not here trying to manufacture entrepreneurs - that,

I  think,  is  not possible - but rather  to  create  the

enabling conditions for entrepreneurs to emerge and grow.

This is an important role for the Government to play, and

this  is not, as some had suggested, unique to Singapore,

the  so-called "nanny state", but undertaken actively  by

many  others,  including the United States,  Ireland  and

Taiwan.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Silicon Valley types might be dismissive of any

role for the Government, but the fact is that one of  the

key  reasons for the Valley's success has been  the  huge

federal defence spendings in the high-tech sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, as customer, as against being a

direct player in the market, is one of the most important

roles that it can play to promote entrepreneurship.   The

Government should outsource its requirements whenever the

market  can  provide them, rather than produce  them  in-house.   By  doing  so, it creates new opportunities  for

entrepreneurs  and  space for innovation.   This  is  the

basis  of the ERC Yellow Pages rule, which the Government

has accepted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the most far-reaching of the ERC

recommendations,  as  it  envisions  a  world  where  the

boundary  between  the  State and the  market  shifts  in

favour  of the market.  Its criticality lies in the  fact

that,  by  giving institutional expression to  a  market-driven  public policy stance, it will change the  way  in

which  bureaucrats interact with private players  in  the

economic  sphere.  Consequently, just as  the  Government

wants  Singaporeans to be risk-takers, it should  set  an

example  by  being  willing not  just  to  oursource  its

requirements,   but  to  take  a  chance   by   accepting

innovative solutions from private firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the Government on the operating

culture  cannot  be over-emphasised, as its  interactions

with  Singaporeans affect the way in which people behave.

This  was why I had argued that to shift mindsets,  which

is our paramount challenge, the Government should set its

default  key  at "Yes" rather than "No" in  its  dealings

with business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want Singaporeans to reach for a new frontier,

to  establish leadership in unknown future markets,  then

regulating them by what is known is not the way to go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also means that the Government would need to

gradually scale back its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



role  in the lives of Singaporeans to allow greater  room

for  entrepreneurship to develop.  I say  "gradually"  as

this   has  to  be  well-calibrated,  so  that  even   as

Singaporeans  have  greater  freedom,  the  corresponding

greater responsibility that comes with it is done without

upsetting the social cohesion that is underpinned by  the

safety nets in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to make this cultural shift to a more

entrepreneurial society, our education system  is  vital.

In this, things are underway, and our schools are seeking

to  create a more open, innovative and creative  learning

culture.  Some schools have also introduced programmes to

expose  their  students  to the  world  of  business  and

entrepreneurship.     The    ERC     sub-committee     on

Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation (EISC)  that  I

chair had suggested that we take it further by making  it

compulsory  that every child be asked to  do  a  business

project, in the same way that they do science projects in

schools.  The aim here is not, as some critics have said,

that  the  Government is trying to fix  this  problem  by

teaching "entrepreneurship", much in the same way that if

we need more engineers, we simply produce more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, it is to imbue in our young a different

worldview.  It is not a world where everything must  have

its  place and nothing left to chance.  In such a  world,

there can be little out-of-the-box thinking.  Nor is it a

world  where we wipe off every speck of dust and, in  the

process, we may well be getting rid of stardust as  well.

Rather,  we  want our young to grow up in a  world  where

they  are  comfortable  with diversity  and  where  their

opportunities  are  limited not by the prevailing  wisdom

and  strictures  of the day, but by the extent  of  their

imagination.  Whether they become entrepreneurs  or  not,

will  depend on their own choices, but we would have done

our part by widening their career horizons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides culture, cutting red-tape, and better access

to  finance  are  also important enabling conditions  for

enterprise development.

We  need  to  aggressively cut red-tape.  It may  be  one

licence requirement for one agency but, when we add

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



them  all up, we may have death by a thousand cuts.  This

was why the EISC had suggested that rules and regulations

be  date-stamped.  Having sunset clauses will ensure that

there  is  a mandatory periodic review of regulations  to

ensure  their relevance.  We are glad that the Government

has  accepted  the  spirit  of  this  recommendation   by

mandating   a  thorough  house-cleaning  of   rules   and

regulations of all Ministries every five years.   In  the

meantime, if there are any rules and regulations that are

stifling  businesses, entrepreneurs can and should  bring

this up to the Pro-Enterprise Panel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to capital is another area, which is often

cited  by  entrepreneurs as key not just  to  starting  a

business  but for it to grow.  We want as many  modes  as

possible,   so   that  there  is   a   market   for   the

commercialisation of ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here the entrepreneurs also tell me that we

should not throw money at the problem.  I have had  quite

a   number   of  suggestions  that  recommend  that   the

Government give money freely to Singaporeans who want  to

start  a  business.  It is like having an ATM machine  in

which when you key in the word "entrepreneurs", out comes

a stash of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These successful businessmen tell me that we should

not  do  the work for entrepreneurs.  Yes, a spectrum  of

risk capital is vital for entrepreneurship and we want to

promote and develop that to support them.  However,  they

stressed  that people must work for this.   Because  only

when  people  work for it, is it clear that  they  really

believe in it, and that they are really committed to make

it  successful.   That, which is given  free,  is  seldom

valued in life. This is why I think it is important  that

for  most  of  our  Government  financing  schemes  that,

whenever  possible, there should be some form  of  market

validation  before funds are disbursed as the bureaucrats

running  them  are often in no position to  evaluate  the

viability of the business propositions.  The people,  who

criticised  this view, often tell me in the  same  breath

that  bureaucrats  have no idea about business  and  that

they  are  the  best people when it comes to  giving  out

money to business.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point worth emphasising here is that the role of

Government in promoting entrepreneurship is not to ensure

that  entrepreneurs  are successful  but  to  create  the

conditions that enable them to be successful.  This is  a

crucial difference that must be borne in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this then is the roadmap towards a

more  entrepreneurial society. We will know when we  have

succeeded  when  Singaporeans increasingly  look  to  the

market  rather  than  the  Government  in  making   their

decisions.   However, there are no silver  bullets  here.

This  may  discomfit some Singaporeans who  are  used  to

"instant  trees".  In fact, critics of the ERC have  been

disappointed  that  there have  been  no  dramatic  magic

formula  unveiled in its Report to ease the anxieties  in

the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, there is much in the Report that gives us hope

for  a  better future.  At its core is a transformational

vision  of the economy - of a people intimately connected

to  a  wider world, infused with the spirit of enterprise

and   where   abilities  and  talents   are   recognised,

celebrated  and  rewarded. These,  in  essence,  are  our

ambitions for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not how well we plan that will

determine whether we reach this destination.  But how  we

adapt and adjust as circumstances change that will decide

our  future.  And in this, one of our greatest  strengths

as  a  Government  and  a people has  been  that  we  are

perpetual  worriers,  never complacent.   This  manifests

itself  in a willingness to anticipate and face  problems

squarely, take difficult decisions and a pervading  sense

of  urgency  that  there  is no  permanent  advantage  in

whatever  we  do in a rapidly changing environment.   The

year-long  ERC  process is a testament  to  this  and  it

underlines  that we are not wedded to our past  successes

and  are  open to views and fresh ideas from outside  the

public sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not a public relations exercise but a serious

attempt  at remaking the Singapore economy.  In the  EISC

that   Mr  Inderjit  Singh  sat  on,  many  of  the   key

recommendations, such as the Yellow

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



Pages  rule and mandatory periodic review of rules,  have

been  accepted and implemented.  In fact, in the area  of

greater  access  to  finance for  SMEs,  MTI  is  looking

towards  how best to implement the recommendations  of  a

committee  chaired  by Mr Singh.  We thank  him  for  his

initiative.   It  also  underscores  the  seriousness  of

purpose on the Government's part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence is key to our continued economic growth.

Members  may want to bear that in mind.  Because  of  the

trust reposed on them as Members of this House, what they

say   will   have   a  bearing  on  the   confidence   of

Singaporeans.    May  I  suggest  that  this   trust   be

discharged, in what Mr Yeo Guat Kwang said in the Straits

Times  today, by the exercise of leadership to give  hope

rather  than  to accentuate the anxieties of Singaporeans

at this difficult time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I read a very bearish view on Singapore.

When the analyst was asked whether there was any area  of

strength  that he could see Singapore developing  to  get

out  of what he saw as a secular decline, he replied,  "I

cannot think of any."  He had just been to China and  was

spooked by this vast and rapidly, emerging economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if this is so, we might as well

fold  up  the  tent and give up.  But this  is  nonsense.

Yes, China poses serious challenges to not just Singapore

but  the  region.   But  as any  first  year  student  of

international trade will tell you, even if China  has  an

absolute advantage in everything, it will still buy  from

Singapore, as what matters is the comparative rather than

absolute advantage of the two countries in the goods  and

services  that they produce.  In other words,  there  are

opportunities.   It is what we make  of  them.   That  he

cannot see any future for Singapore is not that there  is

none, but a failure of his imagination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we should not feel handicapped by our lack of

land  mass  and natural resources.  Countries like  Japan

and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



Nordic states have turned their national constraints into

enduring  strengths.  To illustrate, the lack  of  living

and  working  space has driven Japan to the  frontier  of

technology in miniaturisation.  Similarly, the  difficult

terrain  in  the  Nordic countries has  spurred  them  to

develop  great  strengths  in  communications  and  power

transmission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a knowledge-based economy, it is sometimes not

nature's endowment, but nature's deprivation that  drives

an economy's competencies and comparative advantages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, we have never accepted that size is

destiny.  We  are  one  of  the world's  leading  trading

nations despite having a very small population. We are  a

major petrochemical hub despite having no oil of our own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economist magazine has long credited us with

inventing   the   MNC   export-led  model   of   economic

development.  This allowed us a headstart in accelerating

our  industrialisation and linked us  rapidly  to  first-world   technologies,  expertise   and   markets.    Many

developing  countries had earlier rejected this  strategy

as   a  new  form  of  colonialism  but  they  had  since

assiduously followed us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are always many reasons why we

think we cannot do certain things because we do not  have

the  size.   But  that  by itself  may  be  the  spur  to

creativity,  to  force  us to think  beyond  our  current

circumstances and leverage our advantages in a  different

way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was and I believe still is the spirit that

characterises us as a people.  We have it in us not  just

to  ride  the current difficulties but to build a  better

future for our children and ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As William Jennings Bryan put it, "Destiny is not a

matter of chance.  It is a matter of choice.  It is not a

thing  to  be  waited  for, for  it  is  a  thing  to  be

achieved."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, before I go

on  to my speech, can I just ask the Minister of State to

clarify  certain things?  I am speaking as an Opposition.

If  we want to create an entrepreneurial spirit, we  must

create  conditions.   I do not know  whether  or  not  he

realises  it but, to the bureaucracy, there seems  to  be

two sides. Either you are on the side of the ruling party

or on the side of the Opposition. Whenever the Opposition

people  try to apply for a permit, they seem  to  be  put

last  in  the  queue.   If  a  person,  who  is  in   the

Opposition, wants to do business in Singapore, he will be

treated the same as a political Opposition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim, do you want to answer that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> If Mr Chiam could give

specific examples, we will look into it.  But as a matter

of    principle,   when   it   comes   to   building   an

entrepreneurial society for business people  to  operate,

there should be a level playing field.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, your speech, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Well, I am glad to hear that.

As  far as our constituency is concerned, there are  many

examples.  Whenever we apply for a permit to use a field,

it will take a long time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, we are talking about

entrepreneurship here, not fields.  Please carry on  with

your speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> In time to come, this can be

related to commercial activities. I am talking about  the

experiences  that I know for sure. If  I,  Mr  Chiam  See

Tong,  am going into business, will I be put last in  the

queue  for  any  permits?   Will  such  a  thing  happen?

Because  there is a feeling that if a person  is  in  the

Opposition, he may be victimised by the Government.   Can

the Minister of State clarify on this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, I thought the answer has been

given.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> I will not give specific

examples to answer him.  But I will be surprised if  that

is  the case because there are Opposition Members who are

in business and who have been successful in business.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed with your speech, Mr

Chiam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Much obliged. I am thankful to

the  Minister of State for the assurance that whether  or

not  you  are  in the Opposition, as far as the  business

environment is concerned, there shall be a level  playing

field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the unemployment figures are perhaps the worst

Singapore  has  ever seen since the oil crisis  in  1973.

There  are about 4.2% or about 84,000 workers out of  job

in  Singapore today.  Some economists are saying that the

unemployment situation may even get worse by the  end  of

the  year,  to  4.8%  or even 5%, about  100,000  of  our

workforce would be out of job by the year-end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad employment situation is evident at my weekly

meet-the-people  session.  In the past, when  times  were

bad  in  1985, 1991, 1997 and 1998, there were  talks  of

unemployment  but at that point of time, I  did  not  get

residents coming to see me at the meet-the-people session

to  ask  for jobs.  But these days are different.  Almost

every  week, there is at least one resident who comes  to

see me to fix for him/her a job.  The worst is that these

days,  residents  who ask for jobs are  not  just  manual

workers.  University graduates are also looking for jobs.

Only last week, a lady in her mid-40s, a Business Studies

graduate  from England came to ask for a job.   It  looks

like the Government must make creation of jobs one of its

urgent  priorities.  Yet, this year's  Budget  is  not  a

stimulating  one.  There are no indications to  push  the

economy forward.  The Budget does not address or to  spur

consumer and business spending and expand the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, we see that the Government is

rather complacent when MAERSK Sealand Shipping Line moved

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



its  operations  to  the  neighbouring  port  of  Tanjung

Pelapas.   The  PSA did not seem to see  our  neigbouring

port  as a dangerous threat but, obviously, it does  now.

The  PSA  Corporation has trimmed its  workforce.   As  a

result,  800 port workers were retrenched.  We also  hear

of massive retrenchments at the HDB and also at Chartered

Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited, which is the world's

third   largest  chip  foundry.  Chartered  Semiconductor

Manufacturing  Limited  is  a  listed  company  of  which

Government-owned Singapore Technologies holds 60.5%.  The

retrenchment  of about 500 jobs, or 14% of its  worldwide

workforce,   at   Chartered  Semiconductor  Manufacturing

Limited is due to the closure of an old wafer plant  this

month.  These rates of retrenchments perhaps mark the end

of  the  iron ricebowl in the PSA Corporation  and  other

Government-related   companies.   Business   people   are

calling   this   phenomenon  "the   Singapore   squeeze",

resulting  in  job  losses  and  affecting  the  island's

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must understand that our job losses at

home  is  due  to the harsh business environment  in  the

neigbouring   countries,  the  region   and   in   China.

Singapore's businesses are being squeezed by competition,

especially  from  China.  Singapore  must  find  its  new

niches in business and the bio-technology industries that

are  now  being  encouraged and developed  in  Singapore.

However, it is going to take time to develop.  Meanwhile,

Singapore  must  lower the cost of doing  business  here.

Businessmen are disappointed that the personal income tax

and  corporate  tax rates are not cut  by  at  least  1%.

Lower  corporate tax rate and lower personal  income  tax

rates  would have encouraged MNCs and foreign talents  to

remain in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also appear that the middle income

Singaporeans  are not benefiting from this  Budget.   The

Report of the Economic Review Committee does not seem  to

highlight  much on promotion of education and healthcare.

The  people  of Singapore have attained a high  level  of

education and Singapore should exploit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



its   know-how  in  education  and  make  Singapore   the

education  hub of the region.  The Government  must  make

sure  that  the  people who are engaged in the  education

industry in Singapore have the highest quality of honesty

and  integrity  and  not be allowed  to  exploit  foreign

students.   Instead  of giving good value  in  education,

some  of  our  private schools are, in  fact,  misleading

foreign students.  A Chinese student came to see me as  a

Member  of  Parliament.  She complained  that  a  private

school in Singapore has cheated her of $3,600.  She  paid

that  sum  of  money  so that she can pursue  an  English

course,  but  the  private school made her  sign  a  hire

purchase agreement to buy only a few textbooks and a  few

brochures.   The hire purchase agreement did not  include

the English lessons she was entitled to.  In the end, the

foreign  Chinese  student  failed  to  study  English  in

Singapore.   If Singapore is to build a good name  as  an

education  centre,  then the Ministry of  Education  must

make  sure  that  private schools here in  Singapore  are

properly  regulated and supervised and they do  not  give

Singapore  a  bad  name  in the region  as  an  education

centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, most of our best and brightest

students  chose to study medicine.  Therefore,  our  best

brains  go  to  take up medicine.  Accordingly,  I  would

imagine  we  must  produce  the  best  doctors  and  best

surgeons that we can possibly produce.  Singapore  should

exploit  this  great  talent pool of  healthcare  givers.

Singapore should have, by virtue of having such  a  great

pool of medical talent, become the medical centre of this

region.   But I hear that because of our high cost,  even

much  of  our  medical business is being  taken  away  by

Malaysia.   As  regards medical cost,  I  hear  that  the

medical cost in Singapore is exorbitant compared to those

in  Malaysia.   I have heard of a story of two  brothers,

both  suffering from heart diseases.  One had  his  heart

problem  treated  in Singapore and the Singapore  surgeon

charged  him S$40,000.  The other brother had less  money

and  found  his  way to Malaysia and had a similar  heart

problem  treated  in  Kuala Lumpur.   He  paid  only  the

equivalent of S$500 in Malaysia.  Both patients

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



recovered  from  their heart operations and  subsequently

both  had normal lives.  The question one naturally  asks

is:  how  can  a similar operation be carried  out  at  a

fraction  of  the  cost in Malaysia?   The  treatment  in

Malaysia was as good as that of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cite another instance where I have personal

knowledge.   I know of a private hospital in Johor  Bahru

which charges only RM280 or about S$131 for treatment  of

one-time  kidney dialysis.  The Johor Bahru  hospital  is

purely  run  on a commercial basis and is not subsidised.

On  the part of Singapore, the National Kidney Foundation

(NKF)  clinics here are subsidised and charge one  kidney

dialysis treatment at about S$400, about 3 times that  is

charged  in the Johor Bahru private hospital.   I  wonder

why  there  should be such a great disparity  in  medical

cost between Singapore and Malaysia.  There is definitely

a   big  difference  in  cost  of  medical  treatment  in

Singapore and in Malaysia.  The medical cost in  Malaysia

is very much lower than those in Singapore.  I would like

the  Singapore  Government to investigate  why  Singapore

doctors are charging so much more for their services than

those  of  their counterparts in Malaysia.  Could  it  be

that  our Singapore doctors are paying very high rentals?

If  that  is so, then I would recommend that the HDB  and

the Government work out special schemes whereby Singapore

medical practitioners can benefit lower rentals and those

savings can be passed to their patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area I would like to mention is the

creative  industry.  Under this particular  section,  the

report   of  the  ERC  gives  only  7  short  paragraphs.

Although  the entertainment and film industries  are  big

businesses  in other countries, in the case of Singapore,

it  is particularly weak in this respect.  We do not have

any  film  industry of any sort to speak of.   Yet  other

countries,  particularly America, are  making  very  good

money  out  of  the film industry.  On Singapore's  part,

since we do not have such an industry, we have to buy all

our  films  from  abroad,  thus  losing  massive  foreign

exchange dollars in buying films to fill our television

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logically, Singapore should be building a creative

industry.  Singapore has no natural resources, except its

people,  and  for creative industry, all  they  need  are

people  who are entrepreneurial and creative.   It  looks

like Singaporeans have to learn to be entrepreneurial and

creative  so that hopefully we can build a film  industry

of  our own.  A film industry is important for Singapore,

not  because it would make money for Singapore but,  more

importantly,  it  can  build  for  Singapore  a  cultural

identity.

<br>12.20 pm

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Perhaps I can

start off where Mr Chiam left off.  I agree entirely with

Mr  Chiam that we can certainly do with a few more of the

creative industries.  But he highlighted two things  with

which  I thought perhaps are not entirely accurate.   The

suggestion appears to be that the Government has not made

job  creation one of its priorities.  When I last  looked

at  the  budget,  there  was a  $500  million  retraining

programme  in  there.   If that is  not  a  priority  for

creating  jobs,  I  do  not know  what  is.   There  were

measures to attract foreign investments, there were  also

measures not to tax foreign income.  All of that is aimed

at  creating jobs.  So I do not think it is entirely fair

to say that job creation is not a priority.  I think that

it is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second statement that was made was that the

Government  does  not  seem  to  promote  education   and

healthcare.   As  I  remember it,  we  spent  three  days

debating on a White Paper on Education, three days' worth

of  very serious consideration on the quality and content

of  education in Singapore, and I think that it cannot be

disputed  that our Government does concentrate a  lot  on

education.   The  example cited was of a Chinese  student

who  had  received  rather poor treatment  in  a  private

institution.  But the Government does not run the private

institution.  That is something that has to be  taken  up

at  the  level  of  the educational institution  that  is

providing  the service.  The Government cannot  do  every

single  thing,  and that really brings  me  to  the  main

thrust of my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



comments  on  the Budget, which is that it is  all  about

taking responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of comments have been floated up that this

Budget does not go far enough, it does not do enough  for

entrepreneurs, it does not do enough for  SMEs,  it  does

not  do enough for this group of people or that group  of

people.  My response is that this Budget is what we  make

of  it.  It will succeed or it will fail depending on the

amount of effort that each one of us personally puts into

it.   Unlike our neighbours who surround us,  we  do  not

have  huge amounts of natural resources, we do  not  have

huge  tracts of land, we do not have minerals, we do  not

have  agriculture.  The one thing we have is our  people.

People  make all the difference in these times,  and  the

critical factor is attitude, and the mental attitude that

we have to have is taking responsibility and ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans do this. Many of them go about in

life taking responsibilities for themselves and for their

work  and business.  But increasingly, over the years,  I

have  noticed a trend that seems to have crept  into  our

national psyche and consciousness, which is this trend of

wanting to place responsibility elsewhere.  An example is

the  recent MRT accident.  After the accident where there

was a car on the MRT line, and the train had crashed into

it,  I  noticed a couple of letters in the Straits  Times

saying:  Why has the LTA not built stronger fences?   Why

have  they  not  done  something  to  prevent  this  from

happening?   And  my response is:  Is that  not  a  wrong

question?  The right question must surely be:  what is  a

23-year old driver of a Mercedes Benz doing in the middle

of  a MRT track?  Surely that must be the right question.

What  on earth was he doing?  How was he driving to  land

up  there?   Surely  that is the  area  that  one  should

concentrate  on, rather than saying that:   you  must  be

protected against something like this.  It is a  question

of  responsibility.  This idea of looking  elsewhere  for

protection against something that is going to  happen  is

not  a  good  one.   You cannot buffer  people  from  the

vicissitudes of life.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



Life is tough.  That is one of the things that we have to

deal  with,  and Government cannot protect everybody  all

the  time, from every possible adversity that might  come

up.   It is very much a question of what each of us makes

of the circumstances that we find ourselves in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was very young, my mum took me to

see a movie called "Born Free".  Some of you may remember

it.   This naturalist had adopted this lioness cub, Elsa,

and  they raised her in the house as a pet.  They  patted

her.   They gave her milk.  She had food every day.   She

slept  in their bed.  She played with them, and she  grew

up  to be a very inept young lioness because she did  not

know  how  to hunt.  One day, the time came  for  her  to

return  to the wild and there was no other way to  do  it

except  to  reintroduce her to the wild  by  leaving  her

there.  And she was really upset because she had no  idea

what  to do, no idea what to hunt.  She kept coming back,

looking  for food.  She found a male lion, and  those  of

you  who are familiar with the habits of lions will  know

that  the male lion does not hunt, the lioness has to  go

out  and  bring  him  food.  So, he found  this  lioness,

fairly  young, attractive looking, who was pretty useless

at  the job because she could not bring back the kill, so

that did not work out either.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had a long hard time out in the wilderness and

suffered quite a bit before she eventually learned how to

fend  for  herself and how to hunt and how to  kill,  and

eventually had her own family, which she raised.  And, it

is  like  that  with Singaporeans, because  we  had  been

buffered from a lot of things.  We were a lion city.   We

come   from  immigrant  stocks.   We  still  have   those

instincts  to  hunt, but some of them have  been  blunted

over  the  years  simply because we  have  had  a  fairly

comfortable life.  I do not think that the instincts  are

gone.   I just think that if we are put in an environment

where  we have to use those instincts they will  come  to

the  fore.  So, being a good entrepreneur does  not  mean

that you succeed because of the Government.  The mark  of

a   really  good  entrepreneur  is  to  succeed   despite

Government.  That is what a good entrepreneur is.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice also recently that SPH or Times Periodicals

has  come up with these awards:  Woman of the Year; Young

Woman  Achiever.   Woman of the Year  Award  was  won  by

Olivia Lum.  The Young Woman Achiever was Elim Chew.   In

their  acceptance speeches, two things stood  out.   What

they  had  in common, both of them, was strong  religious

faith,  and  a gung-ho attitude.  I also notice  that  in

Olivia's case, her school results were good.  Elim in her

acceptance speech, said that she was always bordering  on

not doing very well and her school results were not good.

But  they  are both today in a position where  they  have

made  something  for  themselves and the  common  factor,

apart  from  the  fact  that they are  young  female  and

single, is that they have really good attitude.  They are

go-getters and they are gung-ho.  And that is the sort of

thing   that  we need in Singapore today.   That  is  the

attitude that will make this Budget work or not work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a second wrong question that has been

asked,  which  is: where are the goodies in this  Budget?

In  a time like this, one does not look for goodies.   It

is really time to batten down the hatches and get to work

in  terms  of  stimulating our  economy  and  making  the

opportunities for ourselves.  The goodies, as I  see  it,

have  come  in  an  indirect form   -   the  measures  to

stimulate  business,  the rebates,  eg,  on  service  and

conservancy charges, the deferment of the GST  - that  is

a  pretty  large  goody; you just do  not  see  it  in  a

tangible form, but it is a very big goody  -  the  budget

for retraining.  This Budget is all about what we make of

ourselves  and  the  ability to stay  relevant  in  these

times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small group of Singaporeans who really

need  this  help, but there is a very large  majority  of

Singaporeans who can help themselves, and the  difference

is  what you make of it.  One example is a lady who  came

to  see  me at my meet-the-people session.  She has  been

doing  low-skilled jobs.  Her husband had  just  recently

been  retrenched.  She wanted to try and get a job  as  a

cashier and she found that she could not, because she did

not have IT skills.  In today's environment,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



anybody  who wants to work as a cashier will have  to  be

able to use a computer.  She is going to be faced with  a

choice.   She has got a choice of not learning IT  skills

and  she  will always remain low-skilled and, eventually,

marginalised and irrelevant, or she can go ahead and make

that  choice  to  learn  basic IT  and,  eventually,  get

herself  a job.  But that choice is hers and hers  alone.

The Government cannot make that choice for her.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goodies this year did not come in the form of a

sweet dessert.  For Members  who are familiar with Indian

food, they may know of a dessert called ghulab jamun.  It

is  the most absolutely divine dessert.  It is made  from

milk  powder.   It is made into little balls  and  soaked

overnight  in  golden syrup.  It is absolutely  wonderful

and  it  is  like  an  instant sugar injection,  and  one

probably gets an instant cardiac arrest after eating it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget did not come in the form of a

bowl of ghulab jamun.  It came in the form of a plate  of

fresh fruit with a handful of vitamins, Omega 3 and Omega

6 oils and a bunch of antioxidants.  It does not taste as

good but it is a whole lot better for the system.  So, it

is just a question of what we make of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my next topic. International

Women's   Day  was  on  8th  March  2003.    Every   time

International  Women's Day comes around,  there  is  this

discussion of women's issues and the question  of  gender

equality  crops up.  There is one area in which Singapore

women  do  not  have  equality with Singapore  men.   For

various  reasons, we have lagged behind, though it  seems

the gap is narrowing.  As far as I am concerned, this  is

one  area  where we should remain firmly unequal  and  we

should stay far behind the men where we belong, and  this

is  in  the area of cigarette smoking.  I firmly  support

the  increased excise duty on cigarettes and the decision

to tax cigarettes by sticks instead of weight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted with concern the fact that although the

proportion  of smokers in Singapore dropped from  18%  in

1992 to 14% in 2001, the percentage of young

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



female smokers aged 18-24 increased from 2.8% to 8.2%  in

the  same period.  This is a danger signal because  those

who  start  at  a very young age find it harder  to  quit

later  on in life.  And if this trend continues, then  in

the  next 15-30 years, there is going to be a substantial

increase in smoking-related health costs among the  young

women who are picking up the habit now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigarette smoking was initially adopted by men in

developed  countries  in the West followed  by  women  in

those  countries.   It  then  spread  to  the  developing

countries including Asia.  And the relatively low use  of

tobacco  by  women as opposed to men is  not  because  of

better  health awareness.  It is attributable  to  social

and  cultural traditions and, in the past, the fact  that

women  had less money to spend.  The trouble is that  now

they  do  have more money to spend.  More are picking  up

the habit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons seem to be the same as that for young

men,  which is curiosity, peer pressure, need to  relieve

stress,   desire  to  impress  friends,  and  to  relieve

boredom.   For  women  -  for young girls  especially   - they  think it keeps them slim.  The problem is that this

does  not  seem  to  be balanced by an awareness  of  the

dangers of it.   The dangers are well known.  Lung cancer

is the most obvious risk.  That used to be a rare disease

in  the  early decades of the 20th century.  But  by  the

1950s,  it was a leading cause of cancer death among  men

in developed countries.  Now, it is also becoming a cause

of death among women.  And what is little known about the

fact  of  lung cancer is that what you really die  of  is

suffocation.  You die because you cannot breathe.  It  is

a  horrible way to go, and smoking leads to that.   There

is   also   risk   linked   to  pregnancy,   infertility,

cardiovascular disease, stroke, haemorrhage and on top of

all  that, you get wrinkles as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A World Health Organisation report noted that the

sad fact is this.  If women smoke like men, they will die

like men.  It is not a good way to go.  And, frankly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



speaking,  I think that it is a very good thing  that  we

have  raised the tax of cigarettes.  What does this  have

to  do  with the Budget, you may ask?  It has an indirect

impact  in  that it actually saves on medical and  health

costs.   That is the benefit that we will see maybe  only

in  15-30 years.  But the Ministry of Health today has to

deal  with  medical  and  health costs  of  dealing  with

diseases arising from practices that people adopted 15 or

30  years ago.  Studies have shown that smokers are  very

responsible to fiscal measures and I think that  the  tax

increase on cigarettes is a very good move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,

for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to start by saying that I think the

Finance  Minister has strived to come  out  with  what  I

think is a very prudent and balanced Budget in a time  of

great  challenge.   I  say "balanced"  because  there  is

clearly   an   attempt  to  reconcile   some   short-term

imperatives  with the longer-term competitive  challenges

that Singapore faces.  I say "prudent" because it is also

trying to position Singapore for the long haul and trying

to  educate Singaporeans on the need, and all this whilst

we have a modest deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think many people have commented that this

Budget  lacks the silver bullet, lacks the path  breaking

recommendations which are going to deliver us to the  new

land  of  opportunity and prosperity.   I  think  it  was

Aristotle who said excellence is a habit.  And I think we

should  be  in the habit of looking for consistent,  good

budgets and policies which will get us to our final goal,

and  not  look for the magic bullet, because sometimes  a

magic  bullet may not be so magical and it may come  back

at us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a measure of the challenges we face in this

environment today is perhaps best understood if  we  look

at  the  budget  that  was announced  by  the  Hong  Kong

government  recently as well.  Their  corporate  tax  was

increased by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



1.5%;  personal tax and property tax were also  increased

by  1%.   I  think it is going to be phased in  over  two

years.   So,  they  have  gone  up  to  171/2%  and   16%

respectively  for corporate and personal taxes.   Levies,

including the foreign maid levy, have been introduced  in

Hong Kong at the expense of the pay  of the foreign maids

in  Hong  Kong.   And  perhaps most  significant  is  the

deficit  forecast.  For the year ending March  2003,  the

forecast  is  for  a  HK$70  billion  deficit,  ie,  S$16

billion.   For the next financial year, the  forecast  is

for a HK$68 billion deficit, ie, S$15-16 billion.  In the

subsequent  two years, Antony Leung continues  to  expect

that there will be deficits in Hong Kong.  There is a lot

of  speculation about the robustness of the  peg  of  the

Hong  Kong dollar as a result of these forecast  deficits

and,  more  fundamentally, the question is:   is  this  a

structural  problem for Hong Kong or something  cyclical,

as  they assert, which they can come out of in the medium

term?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we contrast that with Singapore, although

much has been said about a third year of deficit and some

have actually asked whether this is a departure from  the

history of fiscal prudence that we have had, clearly, the

answer  is no.  And one need go no further than refer  to

the  Finance Minister's speech itself where he  made  the

assertion that fiscal prudence remains a cornerstone  and

over  a  cycle  of business, the objective  is  still  to

achieve  a  balanced, if not modest surplus, budget.   In

fact,  if we look at FY 2002, if we exclude the transfers

to  the  endowment items like the Lifelong Learning  Fund

which  is  about half a billion dollars, and the  Medical

Endowment Fund which is about $100 million, there was  in

fact a modest surplus in the last financial year of about

$1/2  billion.  And for this financial year that  we  are

now debating, the deficit is about $0.9 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, from that perspective, if we look at the

last  three years, what we have seen is that first  there

was  a deficit year; last year was somewhat of a balanced

year;  and  now we are forecasting a deficit year  again,

which really is not that alarming and which has therefore

given rise to questions as to whether Government can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



do  more to give a boost, especially when we look at  the

situation in last year's budget as well as the comparison

with Hong Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had many debates in this House against the

notion  of  deficit funding or pump priming the  economy.

Some  of  those  include the fact that ours  is  a  small

economy  which  has  a substantial reliance  on  external

demand.  And the flip side of the coin is that efforts to

boost   domestic   demand,  whether  it  is   consumption

expenditure or Government spending, will have  a  limited

impact, and we also allow for the fact that there will be

substantial leakages from our spending.  But given  that,

I  think  it would still be useful for all in this  House

and  Singaporeans  in general to better  understand  what

would be the actual quantitative impact of such elements.

Because  the  question  is:  could  we  not  afford  such

leakages or such less than complete effectiveness in pump

priming, and still consider additional spending in a time

of  some  uncertainty where a boost is  required  in  the

economy,  bearing in mind that overall  in  the  business

cycle,  we  could still achieve a surplus or  a  balanced

budget?   I  would appreciate it if the Finance  Minister

could  clarify these elements, because this is a repeated

comment  that emerges from the business sector and  other

quarters as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is certainly an air of uncertainty that

pervades  the  economy and, in general, all Singaporeans,

and there are many reasons for this which  have been well

canvassed  here   -   the  political  uncertainties,  the

looming possibility of a war in Iraq and also the general

economic outlook which is not so bright.  But I think key

developments  in recent times which have had  a  profound

impact  on  Singaporeans' sense of optimism or hope  have

been  the reorganisation that has occurred in the  public

sector  through the HDB and, to some extent, also in  the

sector  that  is  deemed to be linked to  the  Government

through  the  PSA.  Some have spoken to me and  they  see

this as a breach of an article of faith  -  the iron rice

bowl   -   the  expectation that when you  work  for  the

Government  or  a  large  organisation,  although  it  is

private but linked to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



Government, there is a certain expectation that you  will

be  cared  for or that there will be a certain  long-term

commitment to keep you employed.

Clearly,   the  recent  developments  have  fundamentally

changed  that perception.  And the question is:  has  the

Government lost touch with the plight of the average  man

in Singapore?  Put another way, for example, the question

is:   can  we cut wages?  Why must we cut jobs?  That  is

the  question that is raised time and again.  And I think

that  those who raised this question perhaps have  failed

to understand the difference between an anaesthetic and a

medicine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting cost, in my view, is really the equivalent

of  an anaesthetic in this environment.  Without a lot of

detailed information, but having looked at many companies

that  have gone through these exercises in the  last  few

years,  cost  reduction, in terms of cutting  across-the-board wages, might relieve the company's pressure on  the

bottomline  for  the  short term,  but  it  will  have  a

debilitating effect on its ability to manage its  talent,

because  we  are cutting the wages of all, regardless  of

performance.   At the same time, it does not  necessarily

address the root causes of the problems which compel  the

company to take the actions that it is taking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The causes could be many. It could be that there is

a need to reorganise to focus on core business.  It could

be  because of renewed competition which has structurally

occurred  in  recent  times  and  therefore  compelled  a

reassessment  of the whole environment.  Ultimately,  one

could  argue that there is no such thing as a  good  time

for retrenchments.  Even in the best of times, we have  a

problem.  Mr Chiam brought up examples of companies  like

CSM and so on, and I can understand that, as a Member  of

the  Opposition, he wishes to make political capital  out

of  unemployment.  But my concern is that at a time  like

this  - and I think Mr Chiam himself has said - many come

with  real  problems   -   we  need  to  give  them  real

solutions, not political rhetoric in trying to deal  with

the issues of the day.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, the starting point must be to see

why this is happening and whether there is a way to avoid

it.   Or,  if  we do it, is it just an anaesthetic  which

dulls  the  pain,  delays the inevitable  and,  when  the

inevitable  comes,  it would be far sharper  and  graver?

And  let us contemplate the cost of inaction.  If  we  do

not  do  these things, or if these companies do not  take

the action, then it could be argued that the viability of

the  whole company and its business is at stake.  And  we

are not talking about 10% or 15% of the workforce; we are

talking  about everybody.  That is a consequence that  is

far graver.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of public-sector organisations, such as

HDB,  whilst it is painful for the individuals  affected,

it  could  be  argued that it is far better to  take  the

bitter pill now, focus on the core issues, and find  ways

to help those affected through the transition, because Mr

Chiam  himself will argue later why we are raising  taxes

or why the Government is spending so much.  Measures like

these do help the public sector to become leaner and,  as

a  result, reduce the pressure on tax rates, allowing  us

to put more back into the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, there are elements in this

Budget  which give Singaporeans cause for a lot of  hope.

It  is  not  a  cause  for euphoria, and  anyone  who  is

unrealistically optimistic has to really  be  challenged.

But  I think there is a cause for measured optimism.  And

that  is  not only because of the many reasons that  have

been  discussed  in this House, including  the  intrinsic

strength  of  Singapore financially, but  also  in  other

measures in terms of our social cohesion, etc, and  other

initiatives  that  are being taken up at  quite  a  rapid

pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External opportunities through bilateral and

regional   Free   Trade   Agreements   and   multilateral

arrangements, all of these have a significant  impact  on

expanding  the  space  for  Singaporean  companies   and,

therefore, opportunities for Singaporeans.  What we might

not have today is an effective means of communicating the

value of such macro initiatives to the micro level.  Some

companies know how

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



to  use these to their advantage, but many would need  to

be helped.  And this is an area where I hope the Ministry

of  Trade and Industry and others involved in the process

would  be actively disseminating information on the  FTAs

and  trying to get businesses to understand how they  can

turn these to their advantage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major initiative that has been announced

is  this thrust and emphasis on entrepreneurship.  Again,

I  approach this with some trepidation, because it is not

as  if  entrepreneurship is the panacea for our problems.

It  is  one plank in the bridge over this difficult  time

and, if it is done well, it might indeed become - to  use

a  different analogy - the engine that will really  boost

the  rocket.  But it would be unrealistic and unwise  for

us  to  put all our bets in this one basket and say  that

this is going to be the solution to all our problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, I would also like to echo the point raised

by  the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, Ms Indranee Rajah,

because I think we do have an element of schizophrenia in

Singapore.   Entrepreneurs will, on the  one  hand,  say,

"The  Government should leave the private  sector  alone.

Let   us   charge  out  there.   Let  us  do  our  things

ourselves."  But they will also, on the other hand,  say,

"But  we  need you to help us.  We need you to  do  this,

that,  and so on" - whether it is a subsidy, a grant,  or

whatever.   To some extent, that schizophrenia  is  quite

understandable:  you want to have your cake and  eat  it,

and that is fine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the Government's perspective - and this is

where I come to the policy proposal - having appointed  a

Minister  of  State  for Entrepreneurship,  I  think  the

expectations  are  there in the market  as  to  what  the

Government  will  be  able to do to  effectively  promote

entrepreneurship  in Singapore.  Mr Raymond  Lim  made  a

very  eloquent statement on what he thinks his role  will

be and will not be, and the example of the Silicon Valley

is  a case in point.  Silicon Valley thrived, in my view,

despite   government,  although  government   expenditure

fuelled it.  But there was not the rules-bound and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



regulation-bound mentality that hamstrung Silicon Valley.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, perhaps the key role for the Minister of State

for  Entrepreneurship and the Government  in  general  in

this  area  is  to focus, primarily, on the mindset,  ie,

promote a risk-taking mindset and, secondly, to focus  on

the  environment,  so  as  to remove  impediments  whilst

reinforcing any enabling criteria or factors we  have  in

our   environment   to   promote  entrepreneurship   and,

ultimately, to have a champion for the cause.  Unless you

have a champion, this message may be lost.  We need it to

be  reiterated  time  and again,  so  that  it  resonates

everywhere in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I want to make is that having

established some positive areas where more will  be  done

and   can   be   done  for  Singaporeans  in   terms   of

opportunities, I do feel that, in the short term, perhaps

we could consider additional assistance for those who are

in  difficulty.   Most  of our measures  in  the  helping

Singaporeans aspect of this Budget are targeted at  those

who  are at the lower strata in terms of income.   It  is

right  that our resources be targeted at this  group  who

are  in greatest need.  But, like the hon. Member for Ang

Mo  Kio, Mr Inderjit Singh, I do believe that because  of

the  nature and scale of the retrenchments we are  seeing

today, there is a sandwich class of Singaporeans who  are

hurting.  By normal criteria of wealth measures, such  as

assets owned and so on, they would actually be deemed  to

be  quite well-off, but, from a cash flow point of  view,

they  are hard pressed.  The response of asking  them  to

liquidate some assets would be a lot more credible if the

market was indeed a liquid market.  But in many instances

today,  where  some  are in housing loans  with  negative

equities  and so on, this might actually be  a  difficult

scenario.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting we therefore swing to a welfare

state, with a lot of unemployment benefits and a plethora

of  other assistance schemes.  But whilst I subscribe  to

tough love - which was a point that Ms Indranee Rajah was

making in talking about us being more self-reliant - I do

think that there is a process to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



managed here.  When my daughter was learning to ride  the

bicycle, I gave her trainer wheels first.  Then, when she

was  a little bit more confident, I kinked it up, removed

the trainer wheels, held the seat, and then let her go!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we need to go through such an arduous

process in this philosophical shift.  But there is a case

to  be made for some short-term forms of assistance which

will  deliver some relief to those who have  worked  very

hard  in  Singapore  over  the  years,  but  due  to  the

circumstances shifting quite suddenly in some cases, they

are  caught in a difficult spot.  This may not require  a

large resource allocation, but perhaps more a tweaking of

existing rules in terms of how they can in fact tap their

own  resources, whether it is through CPF or other means,

such  as reverse mortgages, and special schemes for them.

And  I  do  hope  that the Government will consider  that

seriously in the next year as a means of helping those in

this sandwich class.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, last week I was in

Shanghai  for  a  seminar  to  promote  listings  on  the

Singapore  Stock Exchange.  The seminar  was  held  in  a

modern  international 5-star hotel located at the  rather

fashionable  Bund  in  Shanghai.   More  than  a  hundred

interested  parties attended, each of whom was  carefully

screened  ahead of time to ensure that they  are  serious

and profitable participants.  The hall was packed.  Those

who  attended took earnest notes and looked very  serious

about going overseas to raise their profile and, perhaps,

capital.   Perhaps, this reflects the strong vibrancy  of

the  increasingly powerful Chinese economy.  This was not

only evident in the seminar room, but was clearly visible

in  the  streets, shops and eating-places  in  the  city.

However, that was not what struck me.  What struck me was

a  conversation  I  had with a local accountant  who  was

present  at  the  seminar.  He told me that  the  Chinese

recognise  that  they  cannot go on  competing  on  cheap

labour  and land alone.  He recognised that in order  for

China to continue powering away, they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



must strive to move up the value chain and build on local

brand  names  that  are recognised internationally.   Far

from just wanting to be the back-lane sweatshops for some

other  people's inventions, they have strong  aspirations

to be the Toyotas, IBMs and Panasonics of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My conversation with the Chinese accountant made me

realise  how fast and how aggressive the Chinese  are  in

trying  to  scale the ladder of economic  development  to

become  a  developed nation, rivalling the  US  in  every

aspect.   And I shudder to think of what this  would  all

mean  to  Singapore, its economy and the  future  of  its

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is surely that the gap of

comparative  advantage that Singapore has over  competing

and emerging economies is fast eroding.  In Singapore, we

have  always prided ourselves in having a brand name that

is  instantly recognisable and respected the world  over.

We  can  always leverage on this to charge a premium  for

our  products  and services.  And it is this  brand  name

which  I  believe that will hold the key  to  our  future

survival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way forward for our country is not to take China

on  in this competition game, but to see how we can  lean

on  our unique qualities of being a well-run, hardworking

and  honest English-speaking society to ensure our future

survival.  What do I mean?  Sir, please allow me to  take

a  leaf from the humble shoemaker.  On a value chain, the

common  perception is that shoe-making and  selling  does

not quite occupy the same space as bio-medical science or

rocket   engineering   science.    Yet,   in   terms   of

profitability  and size of global reach,  there  is  huge

potential in this business.  Take Nike, for example.   No

one  would deny that Nike today is a global multinational

whose  products  can be found in almost every  nation  on

earth.  Most people would have either heard of the  brand

or  even  own a pair of Nike.  There are many people  out

there, including many young boys and girls who would give

a  limb for a pair of Nike.  They are not able to own  it

because  a  pair of Nike shoes is just too expensive  for

many.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



And  those  who can afford it will not think twice  about

paying  premium  money for it.  Yet, we  know  that  Nike

outsources  the  manufacturing  of  its  shoes   to   the

sweatshops   in   China,  Vietnam  and  Indonesia.    The

factories  that churn out these shoes for Nike  have  the

capability  of  producing similar type shoes.   The  main

difference is that they cannot put the famous swoosh mark

on it, but some other brands, like Double Flying Wheel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike and Double Flying Wheel, which do you think

will sell if they are both priced the same?  Nike is  not

in  the business of manufacturing.  They are quite  happy

to  leave  this to others.  They are in the  business  of

branding  and  selling and creating in the minds  of  the

consumers  a  certain desire of wanting to  own  and  use

their products.  By doing that, they have added much more

value  to  just  ordinary shoes.  I do not believe,  Sir,

that  a  pair of Double Flying Wheel shoes should be  any

worse off in quality than your Nike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do people choose Nike? There are numerous

reasons.  And this is not a forum for us to go into these

reasons.   However, I will just dwell on one.  I  believe

it  has  to  do with the American brand name.   There  is

somehow  a  certain cache in the minds of most  consumers

that  if the product came from America, it must be  of  a

good  quality.   For  the same reason,  we  see  in  some

advertisements  that specific mention is  often  made  of

some consumer electronic items being from Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people I have spoken to tell me that Singapore

is  not America or Japan, and that it would be impossible

for a boy from the backwaters to make it big in the city.

I  used  to think that was the case.  However,  over  the

years,  we  come across numerous examples of how a  small

and  provincial company, or even an individual, was  able

to take on the world and the world became his oyster.   I

cheered  recently, when I read of how a local Singaporean

boy  was able to build a name for himself by selling  his

line  of  clothes  in competition with  the  big  fashion

houses in Paris and New York; and is able to claim Nicole

Kidman and the late Princess Diana as his clients.   This

boy fortunately came from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



a family who is able to provide financial support for his

dreams.   Just  think,  if  he  did  not  have  such   an

opportunity,  he  would  probably  be  left  selling  his

clothes  in some run-down plaza in Orchard Road  and  the

world would have passed him by without noticing him.  And

of  course, would his clothes sell for the prices that he

is  now  selling?  Who would be the bigger loser  in  the

long run?  Singapore or the boy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must pay more attention to brand building and

brand  management.  The question is:  how?   Sir,  in  my

previous  speeches,  I  had  made  some  suggestions   on

approaches.  The first would be to strategically  acquire

or   acquire   substantial   stakes   to   enable   board

representation in companies with very strong global brand

names.  In doing so, we not only acquire global companies

that  would help contribute to our total revenue but,  if

managed, would allow Singaporeans the ability to  have  a

deeper  and  better  understanding  about  the  ways   to

international branding and marketing.  Secondly,  I  note

from the ERC Report that the proposal was made in respect

of  the setting up of an IP academy.  While I welcome the

establishment  of  such an academy, I am  just  concerned

that,  first, the approach taken by the academy may  just

be  too  academic  and may not deal  with  the  practical

difficulties   of   managing   intellectual   properties.

Secondly,  the  academy may just be  another  institution

that  is  divorced  from the reality of  industry  to  be

effective.   Given  the broad reach  of  the  subject  of

intellectual  property, I do hope that the academy  would

also  devote  much  attention to  the  subject  of  brand

building  and  brand management which, I  would  like  to

emphasise  yet  again, has not been given enough  serious

policy consideration that it deserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of being simplistic, the world of

business  is  very much about branding and selling.   The

better  you are able to market and position your products

and  services, the better it is for you to cream off more

fat for your bottom line.  Everyone can manufacture a PC,

it  is  only a question of unit cost production  to  stay

competitive.  But not everyone can create a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



Dell  or a Compaq brand name that sells around the world.

In fact, most Dell computers are manufactured and shipped

out to China; but who makes the big profits?  The Chinese

are  fast recognising the importance of the game and will

soon  play  catch up.  We, in Singapore, still  have  the

advantage  of  a name that the world trusts.   We  should

capitalise  on  it or run the risk of being  marginalised

and lose the advantage that we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note the affirmation of our Government that

manufacturing   will  continue  to  form   an   important

underpinning  of  our  economy.   I  would  support   the

affirmation,  provided that the manufacturing  activities

that  we support would allow us to take advantage of  our

comparative advantage in relation to China and the  other

emerging economies.  I would question whether or  not  we

are  better  off leaving manufacturing to the  others  in

most instances.  The logic of the globalisation argument,

as  we  are  all aware, lies in the fact that labour  and

capital  in  an  increasingly open  world  economy  would

always  gravitate  towards  places  that  are  most  cost

effective through sheer market forces.  It could well  be

that,  in many of our traditional industries, it may  not

be  more  efficient for Singapore to keep  them.   And  I

would  be  so  bold as to predict that, in  the  next  10

years,  many  of  our contract manufacturing  facilities,

including   those  that  are  presently  found   in   the

electronics sector, will eventually be relocated to China

and other places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way forward for Singapore is to consider its

comparative   advantage  rather  than   its   competitive

advantage.    Singapore's strength has  always  been  its

well-qualified English-speaking younger generation of the

post-independence people and the quality  of  its  public

service.   Additionally, the fact that it is  small  also

means  that it is nimble and could transform itself quite

easily.   Clearly, Singapore can be a leading centre  for

research   and   development  and  brand   building   and

development.   The  overall  total  licensing  market  is

estimated to be some $300 billion a year.  If Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



cannot  aspire  to clinch even 5% of that  share  of  the

market,  we  might as well give up any pretensions  about

being a global industrial nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able, Sir, to develop strong global brand

names,  we  would  be able to build up a strong  external

economy,  which  will  then  give  us  much  room  to  be

inefficient  in our domestic economy.  For  instance,  we

can  earn  enough  more  from  our  external  economy  to

consider  some form of subvention or fiscal incentive  to

encourage  the  employment of those who are  structurally

unemployed,  especially  the  middle-aged  workers.   For

them,  we do not have to measure their efficiency against

the  workers  from  countries where cheap  and  untrained

labour  exists  in  abundance.  The unit  cost  of  these

unskilled  middle-aged Singaporean workers  can  then  be

matched  more  attractively  with  the  support  of   our

Government.   This  will provide employers  here  with  a

greater  incentive to hire local employees as opposed  to

foreign employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that the Government does not always

welcome  any  suggestion of public subsidy,  in  whatever

form.   The  conventional wisdom is that  public  subsidy

robs  the  incentive  from individuals  to  work  and  to

improve  themselves.  While that may be true in  general,

there  is  no comparison when the argument is scrutinised

more  closely.   It  would be true  to  say  that  social

benefits  generally  tend to make a  person  lazy  and  a

sloth.   However, what we are speaking here is to give  a

man back his dignity by giving him work that he would not

otherwise  be  given,  but for the  intervention  of  the

state.  I know that such a policy may not satisfy in  the

longer  term  the  requirement  of  economic  efficiency.

However,  the point of the matter is that we do not  need

our  domestic economy to be efficient all the time if our

external economy is powering away strongly, such that  it

allows  us  this  option.  These structurally  unemployed

workers are still Singaporeans, and we will still have to

carry  them.   Rather than give them handouts,  which  we

have  a  duty  to do if they are truly down,  it  may  be

better to subsidise them indirectly through employment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are now at what most would consider the most

significant crossroads of our nation's history.   We  are

faced  with having to make choices that would decide  our

people's  fate.  If we take the wrong path,  the  outcome

could  well  be very different.  The one salutary  lesson

that  we  have before us is New Zealand.  Like Singapore,

New Zealand was very much at the crossroads since the mid-80s.   New  Zealand also realised the need to restructure

its economy and to raise its growth rate.  It pointed  to

the  need to boost training, promote entrepreneurship and

facilitate  new  information technologies and  strengthen

economic  fundamentals.   These  are  clear  mantras  for

growth which are easy to spout.  Yet, the reality in  the

eyes  of  many,  New Zealand has failed  to  achieve  the

results that it aims for.  This is due to a whole host of

factors, which included, among other things, the  country

backtracking on its labour reforms.  Over the years,  New

Zealand's economy has receded to such an extent  that  it

could  not now even afford to maintain a combat wing  for

its  air  force.  If you went to New Zealand  today,  you

would  not see many signs of physical wealth, which often

in  Asian  context is measured by the number of  Mercedes

Benzes on the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore does not have to go the way of New

Zealand.   Unlike  New Zealand, Singapore  has  a  strong

political will to see through the restructuring.  We will

not resile from taking politically tough decisions.  Yet,

political  will may not be enough to see us  through  our

present  difficulties.  We need to have clearer and  more

defined  markers; which brings me now to the point  about

the ERC Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While few would deny the logic of the proposals in

the ERC Report, one could arguably say that the devil  is

in  the  detail as to how the Government is going  to  go

about  its task.  The present Budget Statement has  given

us a broad indication of the steps that the Government is

going  to take.  However, it has been said that we should

perhaps  have a sharper focus.  I have earlier sought  to

define  a  more specific strategy of focusing on branding

and intellectual knowledge as part of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



strategy of building a knowledge economy as a driver  for

Singapore's  future.  More, however, can  be  done.   For

instance, we can set clear goals for the next  10  to  15

years.   It is not enough just to say that we will remake

our  economy  and make it a pretty slogan.  We  ought  to

have  specific  measurable  performance  indicators,  for

instance, looking at how many companies we want to  bring

global.  How many GLCs are going to privatise?  How  many

startups we want to nurture, facilitating the growth  and

expansion  of such businesses?  This approach  will  give

the  exercise a stronger focus, enable us to  offer  more

assistance  where assistance is needed.  Our strength  is

in  our  ability to work towards the long term, including

investment, education and training.  There is  no  reason

why the ERC Report cannot aim for such concrete outcomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us back to the question that we have

been  grappling  with  over the years.   How  far  should

Government  be involved in business?  Leaving  aside  our

usual  gripes  about the GLCs, I believe  that  there  is

still a role for Government in business.  As in the past,

our  Government should continue to provide leadership  in

strategic  areas where the private sector does  not  have

the  resources  or  the  ability to  venture  into.   Our

Government should continue to divest its holdings in  the

private  sector, businesses that can be  handled  by  our

businessmen.  However, our Government should not cease to

provide initiative in other areas where the leadership of

which would help us with the crucial need to successfully

build  up  our second economic wing.  I do hope that,  in

venturing  abroad, we would have learnt our lessons  from

the  past  and avoid making the same mistakes as  before;

not  least of which is our Government's habit of  getting

civil servants with little or no commercial experience to

drive such initiatives.  What I have advocated for  is  a

slight  departure from the yellow pages rule.  We  should

not be afraid of going into businesses that already exist

locally.  Rather, we should boldly enter into such  areas

and  add  value  by creating world-class  companies  with

world-class brand names out of opportunities that we are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all my years, I have never seen the mood on

the  ground  to be so despairing and despondent.   It  is

dispiriting for our people to wake up in the morning,  to

learn  of  hundreds  of  fellow Singaporeans  being  made

redundant by the HDB or PSA.  How many more will have  to

lose  their  jobs  before  our economy  recovers,  if  it

recovers?   How  many  more middle-aged  workers  can  we

employ  under the present climate?  In this crisis,  what

should stand out is our ability to inspire the confidence

of  our people through our leadership.  We should provide

our  people with a very clear roadmap on how we are going

to  navigate  out  of  our  present  structural  economic

problems.   Making  broad statements about  what  we  are

going  to  do is not going to add any more confidence  to

the people.  As I have said before, we should continue to

provide sharper focus on our strategies.  For me, I  know

where we should be heading.  I would say once again  that

we  should  continue to build a strong external  wing  by

investing  in  or  acquiring world-class  companies  with

world-class   brand  names,  and  leveraging   on   these

companies  to  help us build our own global brand  names.

If  we  could do that, and do that successfully, we could

then  afford  to have some inefficiency in  our  domestic

economy  by  subsidising employment for Singaporeans  who

are  not able to adapt to the employment demands  of  the

new world economic order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the comments above, I support the Budget

Statement.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  are many who have criticised the Budget for  being

"a  non-event" and "uninspiring".  In fact, one  critique

is  on  the  removal of taxation on interest income  from

savings.   One  sarcastic  remark  often  heard  is  that

Singaporeans  have no money to generate  interest  to  be

taxed  now,  given that economic conditions are  so  bad.

Even for those who have money, interest rates

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



are  so  low that the impact of the relief is negligible.

So, why introduce it now?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like many other brickbats, these comments have

missed  some  of the more salient benefits  and  measures

announced in the Budget which will have a positive impact

on   the  long-term  health  of  the  Singapore  economy.

Singaporeans  do have good reasons to be concerned  about

their  economic  prospects  and  livelihoods,  given  the

uncertainties  that surround the world  economy  and  the

political environment today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they cannot and should not just leave the

job  of  reinventing the economy to the  Government,  and

assuming that the Government will save the day,  or  will

hand  out something to them should things worsen.   There

is  a  fundamental  need  in our Singaporean  society  to

change  our  mindset to economic and social  matters  and

indeed  foster  a  greater spirit of self-reliance.   And

this is the biggest challenge before us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we band together and change the way we see

ourselves  and  do  business, be more entrepreneurial  in

many  aspects, the world is still our oyster.  There  are

grounds  to be optimistic and not miss the silver linings

contained in the Budget 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Singaporeans cannot just stick their

heads  in the sand like ostriches, and ignore the reality

of  the  weak global economic environment confronting  us

today.  We have been in a "soft spot" for over two  years

now  and,  unlike during the Asian financial crisis  some

five  years  ago, the US economy is also  in  bad  shape.

With  a structurally weakening US dollar following budget

and  external deficits in the US, our ability  to  export

ourselves  out of any economic weaknesses may be  further

compromised.   In  addition,  our  reliance  on  MNCs  to

provide stable manufacturing jobs is fast being eroded by

the cheaper competitors like India and China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many respects, Sir, whilst we strive for value-added and highly skilled jobs to move up the value curve

in job creation, or indeed to fulfill the EDB's vision to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



transform Singapore into a "Global Entrepolis",  we  have

to  be very mindful of the fact that Singapore, with  its

high  wage and land costs, will find it harder and harder

to  continue  to  be relevant economically.   The  Budget

2003's  proposals  on  putting  off  the  restoration  of

employers'  CPF contributions, and its lack of incentives

to  further stimulate demand in the property market,  may

be difficult for Singaporeans to understand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some measures which affect the pockets of the man-in-the-street are no doubt painful. They are, however,

inevitable.   Going  forward, more  radical  measures  to

address  these two cost components may still be required.

And  if  we  do not do that, when the next economic  boom

comes, Singapore may be left behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen in this light, Sir, to me, the crucial platform

that   Budget  2003  has  incorporated  from  the   ERC's

recommendations  is its emphasis on entrepreneurship  and

the  growth  of  Singapore  companies.   I  am  glad  the

Government  has  now recognised that we must  reduce  our

over-reliance    on    MNCs,   and    actively    promote

entrepreneurship,  self-reliance  and  innovation   among

Singapore companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of my GRC colleague, Mr Raymond Lim,

to  head the entrepreneurship drive is a testament to the

Government's  commitment to ensure that Singaporeans  can

be  lured out of their comfort zones, with incentives and

some  prodding on their backs.  I am confident Mr Raymond

Lim  will  do  a good job and have as many of  the  ERC's

recommendations   on  entrepreneurship   implemented   as

quickly  as possible.  However, Sir, I do not  envy  him.

He has a difficult task ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I believe that to be successful in

this  initiative to boost entrepreneurship, no amount  of

safety nets and incentives alone will be enough to  tempt

Singaporeans  out of their comfort zones.   They  are  so

used  to  the  tried and tested path of  pursuing  higher

education, jobs and stable careers.  There has  to  be  a

complete  overhaul of the different parts of  Singaporean

society, both in mindsets

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



and  aspirations and, perhaps, a slow and gradual erosion

of our kiasu and kiasi mentality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, taking a leaf from Mr Sim Wong Hoo's Chaotic

Thoughts  from the Old Millennium, Singaporeans,  by  and

large,  suffer  from "NUTS" or the "No U-Turn  Syndrome".

He points out that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the US, where there is no sign on the road, it

means  that  you can make a U-turn.  When the authorities

do  not want people to make U-turns, they put up signs to

tell  you not to make U-turns.  In Singapore, it  is  the

reverse.  When there is no sign on the road, you are  not

allowed to make U-turns.  When the authorities allow  you

to make U-turns, then they will put up a sign to give you

that right."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bottomline is that both systems serve the

same  purpose, ie, to better manage traffic.   They  look

similar, but the social repercussion is significant.  The

"no  U-turn  syndrome" has created a way of life  for  us

that is based on rules.  And, without rules, Singaporeans

cannot perform.  They are paralysed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to change our mindset. I fear that

whilst  our  budget initiatives to boost entrepreneurship

are  good, we would not realise the intentions, if  steps

are  not  taken to also address this mindset  across  all

Singaporean society.  Civil servants, for instance,  need

to  be  prepared  to make decisions that  would  be  pro-business and pro-entrepreneurs.  Civil servants must  not

assume  that the businessmen are out to cheat the  system

and   exploit  loopholes.   There  is  a   need   for   a

comprehensive  review  of internal policies  that  stymie

business  and entrepreneurs, so that the spirit  of  free

enterprise  can  be  enabled.   I  acknowledge  that  the

Ministerial Committee on Services and the initiatives  to

streamline  rules and regulations are already  in  place.

However, Sir, more needs to be done at a faster pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have long pointed out in this House that to

effectively  change the bureaucracy,  we  would  need  to

enable  more  cross-overs of private sector talents  into

the  civil  service  -  perhaps,  even  as  high  as  the

Permanent Secretary level.  After all, if the status  quo

continues,  it  could  be self-perpetuating  and  not  be

conducive and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



responsive  to  change.  Those from  the  private  sector

surely  would  be  able to bring their perspective,  from

being  on  the  other  side of the  table,  to  good  and

immediate  use, rather than trying to get civil  servants

with long-standing practices to try to stand in the shoes

of  the  private  sector - a much more onerous  task.   I

suggest  that the Government seriously look at  employing

more private sector talents into key positions within the

civil  service,  in the same way that we are  now  seeing

more  Ministers  in  Cabinet who  are  from  the  private

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also a need for more attention to be

paid to our younger workers and students in secondary and

tertiary education.  This generation should not  be  told

to  achieve  greater academic qualifications  and  skills

upgrades alone.  It is precisely this motivation that has

made many Singaporeans kiasu.  The higher the educational

certificate,  or the more paper qualifications  achieved,

the  higher the opportunity costs in leaving the  comfort

zone  from the rule-based path of JC, university,  stable

job and career growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the disappointment aired by a recent graduate

to  the Straits Times' Forum Page last week on not  being

able   to   land  a  job  after  getting  his  university

qualifications.  This is in stark contrast to the  winner

of Her World's Young Woman Entrepreneur Award, Elim Chew,

who  graduated  from the school of hard  knocks,  at  the

lower  end  of  her "O" level cohort, and  many  business

failures.   Persevering and with drive, she  now  runs  a

business of more than $10 million turnover per year.   We

would  need  to train students to inculcate in  them  the

mindset  of  risk-taking and self-reliance, so  that  the

future economy in Singapore can be bottom-up, broad-based

with depth and breadth of enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take another example of mindset change. It was

recently reported that the School of Sports Excellence to

be  set  up has a criterion to take in only students  who

are   from  the  Express  stream.   Why  do  we  restrict

ourselves to this rule?  True,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



some  of  our top sportsmen have been strong academically

as well, but there are many more equally successful, such

as  Fandi  Ahmad and Remy Ong.  Our Asian  Games  bowling

champion, Remy Ong, for instance, has even set up his own

business.   They  are both not from the  Express  stream.

There  must  be a sea change in our thinking  across-the-board,  so that flexibility in approach, daring  to  try,

and risk taking, can permeate throughout our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another measure that many would like to see

would be the freeing up of the portion of CPF beyond  the

Minimum  Sum, for use as business investment.  There  are

some  who  have substantial savings in their CPF.   These

individuals are likely to be successful in their  career,

and have substantial private savings and investments, and

insurance  or  pension  plans of  their  own.   Having  a

significant portion of their funds locked up in CPF would

be   a   disadvantage,  should  we  want   to   encourage

entrepreneurship among the more able in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to suggest that perhaps a

means  test, say, for an individual having $X of  private

investment/pension set aside already, be adopted to allow

for  the  withdrawal  of  CPF  for  business  investment.

Entrepreneurial  activity should not  be  capped  on  the

basic assumption that Singaporeans cannot think and  plan

for  themselves, and need to lock up funds in their  CPF.

Some  can  and should be given the leeway to  expand  the

depth of enterprise in our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I speak for many Singaporeans in

expressing  our concern about the state of  our  economy.

True,  pump-priming does not work that well in Singapore,

as  80  cents of a dollar pumped in is leaked out in  our

highly open economy.  The conditions in the labour market

in the private sector are still difficult, with pay cuts,

wage  freezes and retrenchments seen.  And  this  is  now

seen in the public sector, such as HDB and PSA Corp.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, Sir, it is not all doom and gloom. Many have

alluded to the problems facing Singapore today as akin to

Japan after the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



twin bubbles in their property and stock markets burst in

1992.   True,  we  are a smaller nation  and  would  find

riding  the  rough  tides of economic  ocean  tougher  at

times.  However, in our smaller size lies our flexibility

to adapt and change.  As long as Singaporeans continue to

pull  together to make the painful sacrifices, our  long-term  economic  future is in good hands.  Indeed,  unlike

Japan,  it  is  fortunate that Singaporeans  have  chosen

wisely  to have good continuous stable Government,  which

is able to implement essential policies for the long-term

good  of  Singaporeans, even if it involves some pain  in

the  near  term.  We should be proud of that, stand  tall

against the challenges we face, and I am confident  that,

with continued good Government in place, we will rise  to

the occasion again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement delivered by the

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to take part in this Budget debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget contains a clear and unequivocal

message for workers.  There has been a significant  shift

in  the labour market, and this has vast implications  on

workers.  Although manufacturing remains one of  the  two

key  engines of our economy, it is no longer the  largest

provider  of  jobs.  Most of the jobs are  found  in  the

services  sector,  but even this sector  is  not  spared.

Some  jobs  have  shifted out of the services  sector  to

lower  cost  locations.   The public  sector,  which  has

undergone  a lot of changes over the last few  years,  is

also  no  longer  a  safe  haven.   In  a  nutshell,  the

employment  market has drastically changed,  and  painful

adjustments have to be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can see these changes that are taking place

and know and understand why they are happening.  Jobs are

less  permanent  now, and shorter-term, compared  to  the

past,  and  no one can expect to retire in his first  job

any more.  But, at the same time, we must also understand

that  workers  have  families and commitments  which  are

regular, permanent and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



long-term.   Hence,  they need income stability  and  job

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we ensure that we continue to maintain a

flexible  job  market but at the same time do  not  cause

such  huge  fluctuations  in our  workers'  lives  as  to

destabilise  families and our society?   Can  we  achieve

these  twin objectives of a flexible labour market, which

means  that  more of the ups and downs would have  to  be

borne  by workers, as against their need for balance  and

stability?

Ms  Chua  Mui Hoong, in her article in the Straits  Times

dated  8th  March  2003, argued that people  should  stop

lamenting  about job losses and instead should  focus  on

how to manage job shifts.  While I agree with her on this

and the many other good points which she had made, I am a

bit  concerned about one point which she had raised.  She

had  argued  that the employment relationship  should  be

treated  as a purely commercial contract, and one  should

not look beyond that.  If we accept this argument, I fear

that  one  day,  we will even have to do away  with  core

legislation which protects workers' interest and welfare,

such  as the Employment Act or the Workmen's Compensation

Act,  as  the argument would then be that workers  should

take  care  of  these  needs through individual  contract

negotiations.  Is this a desirable development  from  our

society's  point of view?  I clearly submit  that  it  is

not,  as the fact remains that there are inequalities  in

the  labour market which cannot be completely removed  by

adopting  a  strictly commercial approach.   Hence,  some

form of legislation and system has to be put in place  to

ensure  fairness  and  to balance  the  interest  between

enterprises and workers.  I would argue, Sir,  that  this

approach  is good, not only for individuals and families,

but  also for the economy and for employers too.  Workers

who  are  more  stable  and secure  can  contribute  more

effectively  and  efficiently  to  the  company  and  our

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to make one point clear though. I am

not   suggesting   that  we  should  become   even   more

protectionist.   But  I am arguing  on  the  need  for  a

balance.  I also wish to make the point that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



as  we review and refine the present structure that is in

place  in order to achieve labour market flexibility,  we

also  need to update and refine the existing system  that

is in place to protect workers' welfare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key refinement that is sorely needed is clearly

portability of core benefits. Currently, other  than  the

CPF, the other employment benefits are rigid in two ways.

They are mostly tied to workers' present job and are  not

movable. Secondly, they also depend on a person's  length

of  service.   A  case in point is the medical  benefits,

which  are important to workers as healthcare cost  is  a

grave  concern  for  many.  But as the  Finance  Minister

correctly pointed out, once a worker moves out of a  job,

he  loses  the  benefit.   For  older  workers,  this  is

particularly hard as employers do not want to  hire  them

because of concerns over higher medical costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very happy that the Government has

accepted  the  ERC's recommendation on  portable  medical

benefits and decided to raise the tax exemption limit for

additional  Medisave  contributions from  private  sector

employees  from  1%  of an employee's monthly  salary  at

present  to a lump sum of $1,500 per employee  per  year.

But,  Sir,  I  would like to request that the  Government

consider  two refinements.  First, I would  like  to  ask

that  the  Government consider providing  incentives  for

older  workers to move into the portable medical benefits

scheme.   This is important, as they would otherwise  not

find  the  scheme  attractive  enough,  as  the  portable

medical  benefits scheme is essentially a savings  scheme

and the earlier you come on board the scheme, the better.

Hence,  for older workers, because they have fewer number

of  years  to work before retirement, they may  find  the

scheme  less  attractive.  Having any  support  from  the

Government  will  be  very  helpful  in  terms  of  extra

premiums or other incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possibility is for the Government to

consider providing different

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



scales  of  benefits  for tax exemption  for  workers  of

different age groups. For example, older workers  can  be

given  a  higher  tax  exemption  instead  of  a  blanket

exemption of $1,500 for everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would also like to ask the Government to

consider pegging the additional 1% contribution into  the

Medisave account to the median wage of our workers.  This

would  ensure  that  lower income workers  have  a  basic

floor.   Otherwise,  the contribution that  they  receive

will  not be meaningful enough to encourage them to adopt

the  portable  medical  benefits  scheme  and  would  not

provide   effective   protection.    Pegging    the    1%

contribution to the median wage is a fair and  reasonable

suggestion.   So,  I would like to ask  the  Minister  to

seriously consider this proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, along the line which I have argued earlier on

the need for refinements to our existing system to ensure

a  balance  between  flexibility and  protection,  it  is

important  that  we  continue to  strengthen  our  social

safety  net.   As the economy restructures and  jobs  are

shared,  there is a need to ensure that workers get  some

form of compensation to tide them over their unemployment

period.  While  news  reports are full  of  high  profile

cases, like the PSA and HDB where some have lamented that

the  benefits are generous, there are cases where workers

are  not  paid when the companies retrench  or  wind  up.

While there is flexibility for employers to shed workers,

we also have to ensure that employers exercise this right

fairly and in a responsible manner.  So, I call upon  the

Government to monitor the retrenchment situation  closely

to  ensure  that  employers comply  with  the  tripartite

guidelines  when dealing with excess manpower and  ensure

that workers are paid retrenchment benefits when they are

retrenched.  Under the guidelines, employers are required

to  consider  implementing a shorter workweek  and  other

measures   for   reducing  costs  before   resorting   to

retrenchments.   But there is no means of  ensuring  that

employees comply with these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two measures which I hope to seek a

response from the Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



One  possibility  of  further  strengthening  our  social

safety  net  is the setting up of a fund which  could  be

used  to pay some benefits to workers who are retrenched.

I  know that, in the past, this idea had been shot  down.

It  had not been well-received but I think there is  some

need now for us to rethink about this issue.  A key issue

here  is,  of  course, financing.  But I  would  like  to

suggest  also that when a review of the CPF is conducted,

the Government could consider setting aside a portion  of

the  CPF  into  this fund.  Also, instead of  giving  out

shares or topping up the Medisave, perhaps the Government

could consider contributing into this fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not have ready answers on this. But this

is an issue that we need to discuss and forge a consensus

on how to move ahead.  As the long-term unemployment rate

will    remain    high   with   structural   unemployment

complicating the issue, there is clearly a need to engage

in further discussions on this.  In order to prevent this

fund  from becoming a disincentive to work, there can  be

conditions  attached, such as the  maximum  that  can  be

withdrawn and the need for the retrenched worker to  make

serious efforts to find a job.  Financing, as I said,  is

a  key  issue, but I am quite confident that  if  we  can

continue to discuss, we may be able to forge a consensus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of foreign workers, Sir, I agree that

there  must  be flexibility.  I accept the argument  that

there  is no way that the 600,000 foreign workers can  be

replaced  by  the 80,000 Singaporeans who are unemployed.

To  send  back  even  10% of these foreign  workers  will

significantly  impact on our economy and  cause  loss  of

jobs  among Singaporeans if companies pull out due  to  a

shortage  of  labour or because of the  lack  of  skilled

workers.   But at the same time, I feel that there  is  a

need  for balance and for the Government to monitor  this

issue more closely.  The quotas were fixed during periods

when  unemployment amongst Singaporeans was  lower.   But

with the current high unemployment rate and the projected

long-term unemployment rate of up to 5%, these quotas may

not be sustainable.  Hence, I call upon the Government to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



review  the foreign worker quota more frequently  and  at

shorter   intervals,  depending  on  the   economic   and

employment situation, to ensure that Singaporeans are not

disadvantaged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a core element of ensuring that there is a

balance  between flexibility and protection  is  workers'

training  and skills upgrading.  I strongly  support  the

formation   of   a  statutory  board  to  undertake   the

Continuing  Education  and Training  and  job  assistance

programmes.  This is an important milestone in our effort

to  upgrade workers' skills.  The current measures on job

assistance  were developed primarily over  the  last  few

years,  arising  out of the economic downturn.   However,

structural  unemployment will be a long-term  phenomenon.

Hence,  a more coordinated and more encompassing approach

is  needed  in  dealing with workers'  training  and  job

placement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is certainly a need to establish a closer

nexus  between training and job placement.  But,  on  the

other  hand, some flexibility is necessary.  If a  worker

is  trained only if he can be placed in a job, this would

also  act  as  a  disincentive to training.   I  want  to

applaud the Government for setting aside $500 million for

the  Lifelong Learning Fund and another $37  million  for

skills upgrading efforts.  Singapore's huge investment in

education  and  skills  training  is  the  envy  of  many

countries.  Many countries aspire to educate and  reskill

their  workers as we do.  Our efforts have been cited  in

many  international publications, such as  ILO's  or  the

United  Nations'  publications, but few  countries  could

come  close  to what we have done in terms of  our  heavy

investment in our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real challenge in reskilling our workforce is

how  to  ensure that those who really need  the  training

attend training courses.  Based on anecdotal evidence  in

the  Malay community, for instance, my sense is that,  in

terms  of percentage, the better qualified ones are those

who  are more likely to undergo training.  We should have

a   more  in-depth  understanding  and  analysis  of  the

training profile of our workers so that we could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



have a more targeted and focused approach in our training

efforts.   I  hope that the statutory board charged  with

Continuing Education and Training would be able  to  deal

with this issue in a more focused and coordinated way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another aspect of balance which is necessary,

in  my  view, is to look at how to help employees balance

work  and  family.  For years, we  have  been  trying  to

increase  the  birthrate.  But we have made  very  little

progress.  Last year, despite all the incentives given to

families  to  have  more  children,  we  had  the  lowest

birthrate in 14 years.  The underlying reason is  clearly

the  inability of many dual-income families to cope  with

the  increasing demands of work and family.   Many  women

today  work  not  for  aesthetic  reasons  or  for  self-fulfillment  but  because they have to.   Women's  income

constitutes a significant percentage of the total  family

income.   Many  companies have found that  helping  their

employees  balance  work  and family  means  greater  job

satisfaction, less turnover and higher productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I call upon the Government, Sir, to give a

stronger  push to initiatives to promote work and  family

balance.   As the issues affecting the family  is  multi-faceted,  it  may  be  timely to consider  setting  up  a

National  Family  Council, akin  to  the  National  Youth

Council,  to take care of all matters pertaining  to  the

family.   The  National Family Council  can  act  as  the

coordinating  body, as well as the body to  champion  all

matters pertaining to family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to request the Government to

consider increasing the subsidy for parents who put their

children  in childcare centres.  The last time  that  the

subsidy  was  increased was some years ago  when  it  was

fixed  at $150. Since then, childcare fees have  gone  up

but the subsidy has not been reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I also call upon the Government to

pay  special  attention to the plight of  older  workers.

Ageism  is  alive  and  well and  employers  continue  to

discriminate against older workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



who are considered unproductive, slower and not adaptable

or trainable. Such stereotypes are not only demeaning but

also  untrue.   I  have met many older  workers  who  are

unhappy  that despite the efforts to upgrade  and  change

mindsets,  employers  continue  to  discriminate  against

them.  We  need to highlight and recognise best practices

among  employers.  The Ministry of Manpower  can  perhaps

work  out a scheme to recognise efforts of employers  who

have successfully integrated their older workers in their

workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the public sector. I must

say  that  there are a lot of anxieties when  the  Budget

Statement  mentioned  that there would  be  a  review  of

public   sector's  services  with  the   possibility   of

privatising some of these services. There are two  points

which  I  would  like to make.  First, in line  with  our

strong  tripartite tradition, I would like  to  urge  the

relevant  Ministries and statutory boards to consult  and

involve the unions before restructurings are carried out,

so  that  workers'  concerns can  be  addressed  and  the

restructurings  can  be properly carried  out.   In  this

regard,  I  must commend the HDB management for involving

the  union and the extensive consultations that they  had

with the union and the workers before the restructuring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, managing change effectively is critical to

ensure  that  we do not end up with a demoralised  public

sector  and to ensure that the outcomes which are desired

are  actually  achieved. Secondly, Sir, I hope  that  the

Government  will  put in place a system  to  monitor  the

quality  and  delivery of the services  which  have  been

hived  off  or may be hived off to the private sector  to

ensure that the same level of quality in good service  is

maintained.  A key reason why there is strong  opposition

to  privatisation  of  public  sector  services  in  many

countries  is  because after privatisation,  people  find

that  the  cost  of the services either went  up  or  the

quality  was  affected.  Hence, we need  to  ensure  that

whilst the objective of outsourcing services that can now

be provided by the public sector to the private sector is

cost,  this  should not result in a lower or more  costly

service

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Mr Leong Horn Kee that there are

concerns  among  the  older workers,  whether  they  have

enough  savings  in  their CPF.  I  also  agree  with  Mr

Inderjit  Singh  that there is a need to further  promote

the  monthly variable component.  I strongly support  the

Deputy  Prime Minister's call that employers should  pass

on  part of the cost-savings to deserving workers through

the variable component of wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During these difficult times, it is important that

we  continue  to  maintain the trust  and  confidence  of

workers.  If companies that are still doing well  do  not

reward  workers,  or try to exploit the current  economic

downturn,  then I am afraid that irreparable damage  will

be done, and people will be less willing to accept change

or  to  make sacrifices.  It is also important that while

we  ask  workers to tighten their belts and accept  harsh

measures  for their own future, the Government  continues

to  ensure that the cost of living does not escalate.  If

wages  do not increase, or the pace of increase  is  very

moderate,  but  healthcare, housing, transport  or  other

cost  increase, then this would cause hardship and affect

workers'  standard of living.  Hence, I urge all  service

providers,  whether public or private, to  heed  people's

anxieties   and  concerns  and  do  not  indiscriminately

increase their charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also call upon the Government to continue to

monitor  the situation of low income Singaporeans.   This

is  to ensure that they receive the assistance that  they

need.   There are help schemes that are already in  place

but we need to review these schemes from time to time, to

ensure that they are adequate and are accessible to those

who are really in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, how would I describe this year's

Budget?   To me, this year's Budget can be summed  up  in

three words - pro-growth, pro-job and pro-workers.   This

is  not  an  assessment that everyone would  agree  with.

Some  had  said  that  this is a  pro-business  and  pro-employer  Budget.   They pointed to the  many  incentives

given  to  businesses, compared to some  of  the  painful

measures for workers.  So, as a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



unionist,  why  am  I arguing that this  Budget  is  pro-worker?   Mr  Speaker, Sir, this is because  we,  in  the

labour  movement,  understand  the  realities  down   the

ground.   Ask any worker today and he will tell you  that

his  major  concern is about employment.  Those  who  are

employed  are  worried that they will  lose  their  jobs.

Those  without jobs are worried about how fast they would

secure  another one.  After the retrenchments in PSA  and

the  restructuring in HDB, many wait anxiously and  watch

out  for  signs that will tell them whether their company

is  next on the line.  There is an air of uncertainty and

general anxiety in the atmosphere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having spent more than two decades in the

labour  movement,  I  must say  that  this  is  the  most

challenging period that I have experienced.   In  such  a

climate, any measures that will help to preserve jobs  or

to  delay retrenchments are welcomed.  Any measures  that

tell us how new investments will be drawn in and new jobs

created  are  welcomed.  Will the measures  announced  in

this  Budget  guarantee that no jobs are lost?   Will  it

guarantee  that new jobs will be created to soak  up  new

entrants  to the labour market and the retrenched?   Will

it  guarantee  that  older workers will  continue  to  be

employed?   The  reality is that  no  one  can  guarantee

anything, as there are just too many imponderables.   But

then we, in the labour movement, ask ourselves whether we

would  be worse off or better off without these measures.

Sir,  if we stick steadfastly to old paradigms and rules,

will  it help the workers or make their situation  worse?

How  should we champion and articulate workers' interest?

Does  championing workers' interest mean that we have  to

take the popular line and shout slogans or do we adopt  a

more responsible attitude, analyse issues, think out  the

strategies  and  work  out the  programmes  to  help  our

workers?  We in the labour movement have decided  to  cut

the rhetoric, roll up our sleeves and get down to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's progress is in no small measure due to

this  responsible part that we have played in  protecting

workers' interest.  After much soul searching, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



agree  that, difficult though some of these ERC  measures

may be, they are necessary for the short-term as well  as

to  protect the long-term interest of workers.  At  least

with  these  measures we now stand more than  a  fighting

chance  to make a break and to recover strongly.   If  we

had stuck to our guns, we may not even have that fighting

chance.  Take the case of the 2-year CPF deferment.  Sir,

I  must  tell  you  that there was also  a  lot  of  soul

searching on our part.  Some would have preferred to wait

and  have it assessed on a yearly basis.  But at the  end

of  the  day, many of us are persuaded that  we  are  not

dealing  with normal times.  We are dealing with  unusual

times.   And  unusual  times  require  unusual  measures,

unusual ways of doing things and unusual sacrifices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are so many threats and challenges that

Singapore is faced with.  It is as if our entire  resolve

as  a  nation is being tested.  I must say that  we  have

kept  the flag flying high.  It has not been easy to  get

people  to  think  and see the long-term.   Sometimes,  I

think  that  there is a perennial disconnect between  the

Government's long-term plans and visions and  desire  for

people to think long-term and people's concern over their

short-term needs.  The challenge for Singapore really  is

how  to  bridge this perception gap so that we have  more

people  thinking on the same wave-length.  At the end  of

the  day, Sir, what will hold us together as a people and

enable  us to overcome these huge challenges that we  are

now  faced  with is the trust and confidence that  people

have in the Government.  This trust and confidence is not

something that is developed by chance or that came  about

overnight.    It   arose  because  the   Government   has

repeatedly  kept faith with the people and  delivered  on

its  promises.  I am confident that a new partnership  is

now  developing  between the Government and  the  people.

Trust and confidence is still a key consideration, but in

this  new  partnership it also requires greater ownership

and responsibility on the part of all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Budget.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



<br>2.08 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am happy to note that the Finance Minister in his 2003

Budget has taken into account many of the points made  by

the  ERC and its various sub-committees.  The ERC  Report

highlights the problems Singapore faces in the transition

towards   a   full-fledged  first  world  economy.    Its

recommendations will serve us well in the  future  as  we

strive  to  find our place in the new knowledge  era.   I

would like to congratulate members of the ERC and its sub-committees for a job well done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current gloomy scenario is a good time to take

stock, consolidate and plan for the future.  However,  we

must  not  confuse ourselves between the effects  of  the

current  downturn  and the effects of  long-term  change,

which  is brought about by globalisation, the new economy

and   Singapore's  progress  into  the  premier  economic

league.  The ERC should be commended for addressing  both

the  short-term and long-term problems.  Today,  I  would

like   to   comment   on   the  issues   of   Singapore's

competitiveness  and helping dislocated  Singaporeans  to

remain employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on competitiveness. I believe that

Government  can and should help Singapore businesses,  be

they  domestic  or international, to be competitive.   We

can  do  it  by  taking the Singapore Inc  approach.   By

"Singapore   Inc",  I  mean  Government  and   businesses

consider  each other as partners to promote a flourishing

economy.   There is greater urgency for this  now  as  we

compete   as   a  nation  in  a  globalised  environment.

Government   agencies  must  therefore   seek   ways   to

facilitate  businesses and encourage entrepreneurship  by

removing obstacles and help the implementation of new and

novel ideas.  This will require a new mindset on the part

of  the Government, in that the Government, together with

civil  servants must stand on the side of  businesses  to

help them survive and prosper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that Minister of State, Raymond Lim, has

recognised the need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



for  this  new  mindset  in his speech  earlier,  and  Mr

Inderjit Singh has also spoken on this.  It is not unlike

the  role  of EDB helping MNCs to set up their businesses

in Singapore.  Likewise, SPRING Singapore, and indeed all

Government  agencies should go all out to help businesses

in  their  thoughts and actions, be more market-friendly,

and  when an application goes against existing rules  and

regulations,  find  ways  to  justify  the  applications,

without making the rules meaningless.  Let me give one or

two simple real-life examples to illustrate my point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grassroots leader of mine operates an eating house

along Race Course Lane in the central area.  The property

next  to  his has an extension jutting out from the  main

facade.  As a good businessman, my grassroots leader  put

up  his  eating house sign above his gate away  from  his

facade, but in line with his next door extension, so that

the  visibility  of the sign would not be obstructed  and

his  business would not be affected.  Lo and  behold,  he

was  asked  to  remove the sign by the authority  because

advertisement rules in the central area require the  sign

to  be flushed with the property facade.  He appealed but

was  rejected.   I  found  this  unacceptable  and  so  I

appealed on his behalf to the Minister, arguing  that  if

the next door extension had been allowed, and had already

changed the facade of the original row of properties, why

should  the  authority insist that the eating house  sign

must  be  flushed with its own facade?  Fortunately,  the

Minister agreed and the appeal was granted.  But what  if

I  had  not  appealed?  The problem should therefore  not

have  remained unresolved in the first place.  This  will

be  the  case if the relevant Government officer believes

that he also has a duty to assist businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members another example. A construction

company  recently bought over a cement plant  to  produce

cement  for  its  own use.  One way to  make  its  cement

competitive compared to imported cement is to  lower  the

cost  of  importing the raw material.  The company  found

that  if it is allowed to unload the raw material at  the

existing Government jetty, which is being used now for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



unloading  of sand and granite, it can save substantially

on  import cost, as opposed to unloading the material  at

Jurong Port.  The company applied for permission to do it

on the grounds that the physical form of the raw material

to  be  imported  is  similar to sand  and  granite.   In

addition, if the cement plant survives, it will  continue

to  provide  jobs  and  utilise a substantial  amount  of

electric  power.   The authority, however,  rejected  its

application.  One official actually told the company that

it  should just import the cement instead of producing it

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sim Wong Hoo, therefore, hit the nail on its head

when,  according to his book "Chaotic Thoughts  From  The

Old  Millennium",  he told his customer service  officers

that  they were in fact the customers' advocates and they

had to be fighting with him for their customers' interest

rather  than  the  other  way  round.   I  believe  civil

servants must adopt the same attitude.  They must realise

that  they work for Singapore, as part of Singapore  Inc,

and  that  the businesses which they deal with are  their

allies,  as well as their customers, and not an adversary

to  be  challenged at every opportunity.  It is  commonly

perceived  that  when a civil servant is  faced  with  an

application for a new business activity, which  does  not

conform  with  some  existing rule  or  policy,  his  gut

reaction will be to simply reject the application.   This

is what Minister of State Raymond Lim earlier referred to

as  the default "No" button.  The civil servant will,  at

best,  and  in  line  with our campaign  for  a  gracious

society,  find a nice way to write the rejection  letter.

However,  it  does not solve the problem of the  business

applicant  and, worse, if the applicant has come  with  a

brilliant,   revolutionary   idea   which   can   benefit

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what should civil servants do? First and

foremost, if it has not already happened, the attitude of

just following the rules has got to change.  Yes, we must

follow rules, regulations, policies and guidelines.  They

are  needed  for good order.  However, they must  not  be

obeyed blindly.  When an application from a business with

a  new  idea comes along, civil servants ought to try  to

help it obtain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



the  approvals  it  needs.  In the new  economy,  and  if

Singapore is to remain competitive, that should be  their

duty.   This  is  how  they  can become  the  "customer's

advocates".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the application cannot be approved due to some

rule  or  policy,  the  civil servants  should  help  the

applicant find a way around the problem.  If the case  is

good  enough  and is beyond his authority to approve,  he

should  bring it up to his bosses.  He should never  wait

for  the applicant, who is his customer, to appeal to the

"higher  authorities".   Being the  advocate,  he  should

initiate the appeal on his "customer's" behalf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in our civil service system, his immediate

superior  should  welcome  such  initiative  instead   of

finding  it  bothersome.  Indeed, the immediate  superior

should  now,  in turn, become the customer's advocate  to

help   the   applicant  obtain  his   approval.    If   a

satisfactory  decision still cannot be made,  the  matter

should  progress further up the civil service  hierarchy.

As  far as possible, it should not be a matter that needs

to  be  brought  up at a meet-the-people session  and  be

resolved by MPs writing to the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, all avenues can be explored before

turning down business applications with sufficiently good

ideas.   New ideas do not come about easily.  Surely,  we

must give them due consideration before tossing them into

the bin, just because of some old rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such due process is given before rejecting

applications,   the  entrepreneur  will   at   least   be

encouraged by the experience.  He will be willing to  try

again  in  future because he can see that the  Government

and  civil  servants  are on his side,  and  not  another

obstacle to be surmounted.  Mr Speaker, Sir, this is  one

way we can encourage more entrepreneurship in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important issue affecting competitiveness is

land.   Members have spoken about it.  Land  cost  is  an

important

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



factor  of  production.   I am  glad  that  the  ERC  has

recommended  that our industrial and commercial  land  be

priced  competitively in relation with competing nations.

In  order  to  achieve this, land should  not  be  priced

according to alternative use but in accordance  with  its

direct  industry use.  Being the largest land owner,  the

Government can exert a great influence over land cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is a need to lower land cost generally,

I  understand  that  there is also a  dilemma.   If  land

prices  fall  too drastically, existing land  owners  and

lessees  will be hard hit.  Our financial system  may  be

affected  thus  worsening  our already  fragile  economy.

However,  while caution is prudent, I urge the Government

not  to "do nothing" or too little since land cost is one

major factor affecting our competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two measures announced by DPM during his Budget 2003

speech  are for a property tax rebate and rental rebates.

Unfortunately, these measures are only for six months.  I

find  this too cautious and feel that we can be far  more

generous.  Let me explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM has justified that the freeze in the restoration

of  the  employer's CPF contribution rates for a  further

two years is to give certainty to the employers, MNCs and

investors about the CPF issue.  It is intended to send  a

strong signal that we are serious in solving our problems

and  that  we  are determined to keep our  business  cost

competitive.  This is the sacrifice our workers are asked

to  make.  But when it comes to Government rebates, I  am

puzzled that the Government is only prepared to give  six

months.   Should not the Government also  make  the  same

commitment of two years on land and other costs and  send

an equally strong signal to investors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax rebate and the extension of rental

rebates,  together with the reduction of  foreign  worker

levy  and the reduction  of diesel tax, etc, should  also

be  given over a period of the same two years, instead of

only  six  months.  This will certainly send  an  equally

strong signal to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



our  workers.   Yes,  with the war looming  and  economic

uncertainties  reaching an unprecedented height,  perhaps

the  Government  should be even bolder and  increase  the

quantum of the property tax and rental rebates given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer period of two years is not as "reckless"

as  it  seems.   If the economy recovers, the  Government

will  have  more tax income and can well afford  it.   If

not,  then  these  rebates  and reduction  are  certainly

needed to lower business cost.  Heads, we win; tails,  we

also win  -  what could be better?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another threat we face is the hollowing out of some

of  our  industries and the loss of jobs.   The  ERC  has

reported   that  we  have  sufficient  industrial   land.

Therefore,  we  should  start to  consider  pricing  land

according  to industry use to hold on to even the  lower-tech  industries  through competitive  land  prices,  and

dissuade  them from migrating to low cost countries.   We

need  to do this in order to provide continued employment

for  Singaporeans who find it difficult to re-skill.   It

is better to do this than to give them social assistance.

Perhaps  in order to limit any undesirable effects,  this

measure  can  be  strictly targeted.   We  can  start  by

putting  aside only a small portion of our JTC land  bank

for  this purpose.  This is better than leaving our  land

vacant when these lower-tech companies migrate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, capital is another important factor. I agree

with the Government on various measures to encourage  the

people  to  keep  their capital or  money  in  Singapore.

Lower  direct  taxes will allow for capital regeneration.

The stable Singapore dollar policy is also beneficial  to

capital   inflows.   Elimination  of  taxes  on   profits

repatriated   from  abroad  will  also   encourage   more

Singaporeans to bring back much needed money  from  their

overseas  operations and help lift the domestic  economy.

Abolishing  taxes  on interest earned  from  deposits  in

Singapore will also encourage money to remain here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital allowances for all capital items will

also be beneficial to encourage risk-taking.  I also urge

the Government to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



allow   losses   from  an  overseas  subsidiary   to   be

consolidated  at  the group level for taxation  purposes.

This  measure will encourage our companies to go overseas

and globalise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some concern of abuse. However, the

Government is already aware of this possibility and I  am

sure  appropriate measures, like capping the  quantum  of

losses  allowable for group tax relief, or a registration

or monitoring system, can be instituted to prevent this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new knowledge economy will throw up one

undesirable  effect, ie, structural unemployment.   There

will be workers who will find it too difficult to retrain

and  reskill,  either due to their age or other  factors.

As  a modern society, we must provide some assistance  to

such  people,  not only in the form of  a  pure  monetary

handout,  but  also meaningful work so that  their  self-esteem  does  not  suffer.   My  earlier  suggestion   on

reserving some cheap land for lower-tech industries  will

help.  However, more can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Members will agree that financial help

which is tied to the performance of some meaningful  work

is far superior to a pure handout, like ERS shares.  Such

work  schemes may be difficult to implement  due  to  the

concern  that  some  unscrupulous people  may  abuse  it.

Nevertheless,  we should not be swayed  from  the  higher

intent   and   should   find  ways  to   overcome   these

difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good idea to counter structural unemployment

by  using  the  concept of "negative income  tax".   This

measure  is  better, more meaningful and  more  effective

than  the "handouts" given since the negative income  tax

is  associated with job creation.  The Government already

provides    subsidies    for   various    training    and

apprenticeship schemes.  In general, this can be  further

extended   more  widely  and  for  longer   periods,   if

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For older workers, I would like to urge the

Government  to  consider subsidising part  of  their  CPF

payments,  instead of simply instituting  a  cut  in  the

contribution rates. This achieves the intention of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



lowering  costs for employers and will also  protect  the

workers' retirement nest-egg from shrinkage.  The  amount

of Government expenditure needed is small compared to the

total expenditure.  The money spent here is better spent,

more  targeted, than simply handing out shares  or  money

across the board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I would like the Government to consider

instituting  a  "paid" community or social  work  scheme.

The  benefits of this are two-fold:  the old, chronically

sick,  underprivileged and the community will  gain  from

the  services provided and improve their quality of life;

and  the longer-term unemployed will find some meaningful

work  to  do  for  some  pocket  money.   The  newspapers

reported that one Town Council is already doing this in a

limited way by "employing" those out of work to do checks

and  inspections on common facilities so  that  a  better

level of maintenance can be achieved.  The Government can

provide  some  money  for this and other  schemes  to  be

instituted  and  expanded.  These can  include  a  social

visitor scheme for the old and the sick who are alone  at

home, or schemes such as neighbourhood watch, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the social visitor scheme, our unemployed can be

trained  to  provide visits to the old, infirm  or  sick.

These are the underprivileged who would normally be  left

alone  at  home, unable to move around easily,  and  need

help with simple errands or maybe simply a friend to talk

to.   We  can certainly improve the quality of  life  for

such  unfortunate people by taking care  of  their  basic

needs and, at the same time, provide some useful work for

those that are unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the neighbourhood watch scheme, an allowance can

be  paid  to  those  who need a job  for  their  role  in

providing  some neighbourhood watch service.  This  could

include  neighbourhood patrols or even simply  stationing

themselves  in  key  areas to deter petty  criminals  and

other offenders.  In difficult  times like this, there is

a tendency for such crimes to increase and this will be a

good counter measure.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to close with a comment

on  the  budget deficit.  I do realise that  some  of  my

earlier  recommendations need  to  be  funded.   DPM  has

already taken pains to point out that the FY 2003  Budget

will  be  the third consecutive year of budget  deficits.

However,  many have fed back that the Budget  could  have

been  more  generous.   The  projected  deficit  is  $900

million.   But during better years, we achieved surpluses

of  around  $4-$5 billion a year.  Why can the Government

not contemplate a deficit nearer such a level in what  is

notably  a  very trying and uncertain time?  The  war  on

Iraq  seems inevitable.  It may happen within days.   The

Prime Minister has advised Singaporeans to expect tougher

times  ahead in the next few months.  The outcome of  the

war  is  an  unknown.  What if it is an unfavourable  one

affecting   adversely   the   political   and    economic

environment  of the world over a longer period  of  time?

Do  we  have the assurance of the Government to introduce

another   off-Budget   package  of   measures   to   help

Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of what I have said, I support the

Budget.    However,  I  hope  that  DPM  will  give   due

consideration to my suggestions.  And I hope he will also

give  a commitment to provide further generous off-Budget

measures  to give the economy a much needed boost  should

the worst in the Iraq crisis come about.

<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  have heard many say that  this  year's

Budget  is  a non-event.  Personally, I am glad  to  note

that   the  Government  has  attempted  to  create   more

opportunities  and  a  level  playing  field   for   all,

particularly in promoting entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wish to make two observations. Firstly,

there  is  obviously  a  more  deliberate  move  by   the

Government  to encourage self-help and make  life  easier

for  the  entrepreneurs.  This is encouraging.   However,

Singaporeans  have  enjoyed  many  good  years  and   the

Government  has  been  playing  the  role  of  giver  and

provider.   Most people are used to this.  In bad  times,

such as now, I notice the emergence of two categories  of

people,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



each  with  different expectations.  The  first  category

consists  of  those who are not willing  to  lower  their

expectations  in  salary  or in  status  when  they  seek

employment.   I  have witnessed this when  I  interviewed

applicants  for  jobs in my company, and the  problem  is

real.  These people have been retrenched and yet they are

not  willing to forgo their level of material comfort and

status when they seek new employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other category consists of those who are willing

to  have a go and wish it on their own but they lack  the

knowledge  on  how  to  make a  headstart.   It  is  this

category of people that we must place more focus  on.   I

notice that many are still unaware of the incentives  and

opportunities that the Government had instituted over the

years.    This   could  be  due  to  a  lack   of   clear

communication between the Government, the people and  the

business  communities, especially the SMEs.  As  what  Mr

Inderjit  Singh said earlier, many GLCs are already  well

aware  of  the  incentives  and opportunities  available.

However,  many SMEs are not that well connected and  most

are not familiar with Government policies.  Some are also

confused by the policy changes over the years.  I propose

that   the  Government  play  a  more  active   role   in

communicating with the general public and especially  the

SMEs,  through more regular dialogue sessions.  Different

Ministries could hold separate dialogue sessions to  make

clear the opportunities that are available.  Availability

of   opportunities  is  always  the  gateway  sought   by

entrepreneurs.   Throughout  my  life,  I   have   sought

opportunities  rather  than  handouts.   Since  the  late

seventies  when  I  first  arrived  here,  Singapore  has

offered  me many opportunities to make it on my own,  and

for this I am grateful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that we moved on and adopted measures

that  are  sustainable in the long term and  create  more

opportunities  for individuals who are  willing  to  take

risks  and make it on their own.  Government should  play

strong   leadership  in  providing  opportunities.    For

example,  Mrs Yu-Foo has recently proposed an  initiative

to  allow  residents who are unemployed to  showcase  and

sell their homemade products.  The start-up cost for such

initiative

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



is very low as participants pay very low rent.  This will

allow people to be proud of self help.  I was also taught

when  I was young to be independent, instead of depending

on handouts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example. The Government, being such a big

buyer,  and the Ministries and agencies can be more  open

to  new ideas and new innovations.  And this leads me  to

touch on a second issue.  I feel that there is a need for

constant   review   of   the   Government's   rules   and

regulations, in line with changing times.  I am glad that

the  Government  has  adopted the  ERC's  recommendations

pertaining to this.  However, this calls for a change  in

mindset  amongst officers at every level  of  the  public

sector.   My experience is that most officers in the  top

management of the various Ministries and statutory boards

are  willing to make changes.  However, this is often not

so for lower rank officers.  Most are not willing to take

on  the added responsibility of making a change, even  if

it is a change for the better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As most officers are happy to religiously follow set

rules, initiative from the top management is often needed

to  institute changes in the rules and regulations.  This

is  unfortunate  as the frontline officers  and  officers

from  the middle management are often the ones in  direct

contact  with the public.  They are aware of the problems

created by some rules and regulations and they are in the

best position to recommend and facilitate changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective, perhaps each Ministry should set up

its  own  Rules  Review Committee, apart from  the  Rules

Review  Panel  proposed.   The Committee  should  include

representatives from both the public and private sectors.

The  people who have suffered under unnecessary rules and

regulations  would  be  in  the  best  position  to  make

recommendations for the better.  Officers from  different

levels within the Ministry should also be represented, as

they  are  the  ones who know best the grouses  from  the

ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is making fundamental changes to

promote entrepreneurship.  This is encouraging and  I  am

confident

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



with  these changes, we are making progressive  steps  in

the right direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, it is a

tradition  for me to attend the gathering  of  Trade  and

Merchants  Associations on the first day of  Chinese  New

Year.  I have been doing this since becoming an MP.  What

struck  me  in  this year's annual get-together  was  the

depressing  mood - a sense of hopelessness and  defeatism

that the situation in Singapore is no longer salvageable.

I  have  not felt anything like this before, to  see  our

people  discouraged  and demoralised,  on  the  verge  of

giving up.  This was not evident during the 1997 regional

financial  crisis  and  its aftermath.   Our  people  are

looking for ideas, advice and seeking answers to get  out

of  their dire straits.  We need to buoy up their spirit.

They  need to be encouraged and given hope and confidence

that  we have the resources and resolve to overcome  this

recession.  We have been able to do so in the  past.   We

shall be able to do this yet again, emerging stronger  to

take advantage when the recovery comes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When DPM Lee presented the picture and solutions in

this  year's  Budget,  they  are  realistic,  sound   and

plausible.   Yet,  they  seem to  be  at  odds  with  the

experience,  sentiments  and  feelings  of  many   people

outside  the Chamber.  The measures required are  painful

but  inevitable.  We have to take the bitter medicine  if

we  want to recover and there is no easy painless way out

of  this  recession.   Indeed, the  Budget  measures  are

broadly strategic and qualitative in nature, dealing  not

just with the immediate issues but having an eye for  the

next 15 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the intellect and the emotions is the

attitude and mindset needed to act out our choices.   Our

actions  must be based on the harsh realities before  us.

We  have  the natural human tendency to deny  we  have  a

problem  and wish that the problem would go away  without

us taking the painful medicine.  We were well aware

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



of  the  need to restructure our economy since  the  1985

recession.  We had a good run of 10 years until  we  were

hit  by the 1997 regional financial crisis.  Now we  have

to  face the harsh realities of having to deal with  both

economic restructuring and the severe downturn.  That  is

why the depressed feeling has been much more acute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps when we dealt with the 1997 financial

crisis,  we  should not have slowed down the  process  of

restructuring our economy.  We cannot afford at this time

to  delay any further to restructure our economy.  We are

aware  of  the high cost required in terms of job  losses

through  retrenchment,  pay  cuts,  and  fresh  graduates

finding  difficulties  to secure  jobs  quickly.   It  is

unfortunate  that  all the painful  measures  are  taking

place  at  the  same time and affecting  a  large  cross-section of our people.  If we are to take bold steps  now

to restructure our economy, we would be able to take full

advantage of the recovery of the global economy  when  it

comes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the marine industry is a good example of an

industry  that  went  through  the  1985  recession  with

massive  retrenchments and severe restructuring.  Looking

back,  the  actions  taken in those years  to  cut  over-capacity  saved the marine industry.  Today, the industry

has  not only survived but prospered.  The marine  sector

was  labelled a `sunset' industry.  It  has been  a  long

`sunset'  for  the marine industry after  18  years.   It

remains  a cyclical industry but the sector is  able  and

ready  to  deal  with  the cyclical  nature  of  business

because   they   have  put  in  place  a  structure   and

organisation that is resilient to cope with  the  upswing

and  downswing in the business.  It is to the  industry's

credit that it was able to absorb some of the former  PSA

employees who lost their jobs recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of us who went through the bitter

experience of the 1985 recession, we have gained valuable

lessons  on  how  to  survive and  prosper  in  a  highly

competitive business.  Businesses that are built to  last

require a stable, committed and diligent management team,

strong organisational skills, good cash management,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



not  to borrow beyond our means, be thrifty and lean, use

contract   workers,  instead  of  regular  employees,   a

flexible  wage system that pays a lower base  salary  but

with highly variable bonuses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that those Singapore

establishments that started in the 1960s and 70s and have

made  no attempt to shed, restructure or reorganise their

businesses would have inherited an organisation  that  is

flabby  with  high  cost  and  unable  to  compete  in  a

deregulated  and  highly competitive globalised  business

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read a report recently that the majority of

American  CEOs do not have any experience in managing  an

economic  downturn because they were not exposed  to  the

last  recession that happened a decade ago.  We know that

personal experience is a good teacher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fortunate that DPM Lee had gained valuable

experience  when  he  helped  tackle  the  1985  economic

recession and this has placed him in very good stead when

he  chaired the Economic Review Committee.  The  Economic

Review  Committee  Report  acts  as  the  foundation  and

cornerstone of his Budget Statement this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that in last year's FY 2002 budget, we

had managed a small deficit of $94 million, compared to a

deficit of close to $2.7 billion in the year before in FY

2001.   The smaller overall deficit was on account  of  a

better  contribution of net investment income  of  $3,800

million.  Perhaps DPM Lee can enlighten the House how the

Government  is able to achieve a three-fold  increase  in

net  investment income between the years 2001  and  2002,

jumping from $1.375 billion to $3.8 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Budget, many quarters have hoped that

the  Government  could  have been bolder  with  a  higher

budget deficit.  The FY 2003 Budget is estimated to run a

deficit  of  close to $900 million, with a net investment

income  contribution estimated at about  $3,000  million.

If  the  Government were to continue to achieve the  same

net investment income

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



of $3.8 billion, the Budget will end with a small deficit

or even a balanced budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government has remained resolute

not  to accede to the call on Government to cut corporate

taxes  further  and others who want more  expenditure  to

prop up the economy.  I agree that it is more prudent  to

take  the conservative approach.  We do not know how  the

situation  in  Iraq  will turn  out.   The  war  and  its

aftermath can play havoc to oil price increases  and  the

overall  adverse  impact  on the  global  economy.   This

Government has shown that it is prepared, as in the past,

to  take off-budget measures to prevent our economy  from

deteriorating further.  And I hope that, as Dr John  Chen

has  mentioned  earlier,  the Government  could  give  an

indication of such a possibility.  We shall have to  wait

and  see  if  all these uncertainties in the Middle  East

will pan out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In promoting manufacturing and services as the twin

engines of growth, we must recognise that we have  fallen

behind  in  our competitiveness.  Our business  cost  has

gone  up  in comparison with other emerging economies  in

the  region  and  our productivity lags behind  the  cost

increases.   We  have to quickly bring the business  cost

down   before   more   companies   get   into   financial

difficulties.   We should do our level  best  to  prevent

more  companies  from closing shop,  relocate  or  shrink

their  operations that could aggravate our  already  high

unemployment situation.

Labour  and  land are two domestic components within  our

means  to  influence  the  business  competitiveness  and

profitability.   We  have  to  bring  down  the  cost  of

industrial land, commercial properties and manpower costs

of  our  businesses.  It is a good idea to cap the salary

ceiling  for  CPF  contributions at  $5,000,  instead  of

$6,000.  The high income earners are able to manage their

own  retirement plans.  These high income earners  should

be    subjected   to   greater   variability   in   their

remuneration,   linking  their   pay   and   rewards   to

performance and profitability of the company.  This  will

set the tone to put quickly in place the flexible

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



wage  system against the seniority-based system that  has

remained unchanged for some companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the effort to promote entrepreneurship, we have

first  to develop a culture of entrepreneurship  in  this

country.  The current adverse economic situation may just

provide  the right conditions and impetus for individuals

to  be  self-employed and start up their own  businesses.

My  concern is the over-capacity situation in the  retail

sector  where  the small retailers are already  suffering

from  poor  business.   With  new  entrants,  the  retail

business  will be even more competitive and the situation

would worsen unless the economy improves and more foreign

visitors  and  expatriates  are  employed  to   work   in

Singapore.   As  HDB retailers contribute to  a  sizeable

proportion  of neighbourhood shops, there is the  urgency

to deal with HDB neighbourhood shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has an excellent reputation in our

educational  system.   It  requires  business  acumen  to

translate  the  reputation and expertise into  successful

businesses.   For many years, the Chartered  Institutions

of   United  Kingdom  collect  large  sums  annually   in

organising  examinations  for  their  courses  and  issue

certificates  qualifying  them  to  become   members   of

professional   bodies.   Singapore  has  already   gained

expertise  in a number of areas.  We should  be  able  to

conduct  our  own  examinations for  foreigners  who  are

interested   in  them  and  issue  relevant  certificates

attesting  to the standards achieved in the examinations.

If properly organised and managed, they should contribute

to making Singapore an education hub in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our top students have acquitted themselves very well

in the reputable universities in the US and UK.  They are

gifted  and would be able to fend for themselves whatever

educational system we provide.  Our challenge is to bring

an  expanded number of students in the next few levels to

an  even  higher level of achievement than currently  the

case.  Our students have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



to  be  more  well-rounded and be  imbued  with  a  wider

interest.  They should be able to handle both the Science

and  the  Humanities subjects with  ease.   There  is  an

urgent need to encourage the interest and strengthen  the

learning of humanities in schools and universities.   The

challenge  in  working and dealing  in  a  cross-cultural

context  and  issues  require  a  deep  appreciation  and

understanding  of  the  Humanities subjects,  and  cross-cultural  issues  will pose a greater  challenge  in  the

future  and our students should be prepared for it.   Our

young  who  neglect them do so at their  peril  in  later

years.   It is like the Chinese Language now.  No  parent

needs  to be persuaded on the importance of learning  the

Chinese  Language in schools today.  So I hope  that  our

schools  do  not take the short-term view in  performance

ranking  at  the  expense of the long term  good  of  our

students in the study of Arts and Humanities subjects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the biggest challenge today is to help

preserve the jobs of Singaporeans and for those  who  are

unemployed  to help them find new jobs.  This issue  will

remain  with  us  as we expect a slower  growth  for  our

economy rising in the region of 3-5%, but unemployment is

likely to stay around 3-4%.  Lifelong learning has become

more  pressing.  I am glad the Government is taking  this

very  seriously with the setting up of a statutory  board

to take care of this area.  But I like to echo many of my

colleagues  that  it  is the personal responsibility  and

self-help of the individuals that matter.  This may be  a

wake-up call to Singaporeans to take up lifelong learning

seriously  to ensure their employability.  The Government

is  in  a  good  position to draw up the information  and

resources to help Singaporeans who are in need of work to

be  trained  and help find work.  Employers  should  also

play  their  part  to  be  fair  in  the  employment  and

treatment of Singapore workers.  They should not rely  on

foreign  labour  if Singaporean workers are  prepared  to

lower  their  expectations  and  work  hard  to  earn   a

livelihood for themselves and their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy with the breadth and depth of

coverage  in  this  year's budget.  It  is  a  reassuring

Budget.  The Government is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



on   top  of  the  situation.   We  have  the  resources.

Singaporeans  must  draw out their  courage  and  not  be

deterred  by the storm we are sailing through.   We  will

indeed  reach  the safe harbour if all our hands  are  on

deck and focus on the direction we should be heading.  We

can then look forward to a better year ahead.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, our economy recorded a 2.4%

GDP  growth  in  2002. However, apart from transport  and

communication,  all other sectors did  not  perform  well

compared with year 2000.  In terms of employment,  78,000

jobs were lost (3.9% drop) compared to year 2000. Yet, at

the  same  time, unit business cost and the  unit  labour

cost were higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this difficult time, it makes our work in

stimulating   our  economy  harder  as  we  face   strong

challenges from the low cost manufacturing base of China.

It   has  been  attracting  many  investments  from   us,

particularly in the manufacturing sector.   In  2002,  we

attracted  some  $9 billion worth of investments  in  the

manufacturing  sector,  but these  were  mainly  capital-intensive industries which do not create the same  number

of  jobs to replace those that we have lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of business cost is still an important

part  of  this budget.  On one hand, we hope  to  attract

more good investments to create job opportunities. On the

other hand, we want to retain the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



existing manufacturing establishments so as not  to  lose

the jobs for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has introduced various measures to

make   it  attractive  for  the  factories  to  stay   in

Singapore,  such as rebates on property tax,  fix  petrol

tax  at  level, lower diesel tax for taxi and change  OMV

calculation.   The  cut of such indirect  taxes  at  this

moment  implies that they are significant in the cost  of

operation  in  our business. They increase  the  business

cost.  Such ad hoc tax reductions are short term measures

which   can  be  revoked  when  our  economy  has   fully

recovered, and we will go back to the original state, and

it  would  continue  to  have  an  effect  on  increasing

business  cost  in Singapore.  So, when we are  reviewing

all  these factors which would increase our business cost

in  the  long term, we should look squarely on all  their

implications because they are disturbing matters whenever

we  talk  about  the  high cost  in  doing   business  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rental cost, in the past two years, the price of

offices   and  factories  dropped  by  34.6%  and   23.7%

respectively.  Although  there  has  been  a  significant

reduction  during  the past two years, our office  rental

price is still ranked No. 18 in the world and our factory

rent  ranked 12th in the world,  slightly lower than that

of Taipei in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the rent will be decided by the balance

between supply and demand.  It is also dependent  on  the

Government  taxes levied on them.  For  example,  when  a

landlord buys a factory, he has to pay a 3% stamp fee and

another  4%  in  GST  on  the  transacted  price  of  the

property.   Then, when the owner wants to  rent  it  out,

there is also a 10% of property tax on the assessed value

paid  upfront  before  any rent is collected.  All  these

taxes contribute a significant 17% on top of the intended

rent  of  the  factory. In other words, these  Government

taxes  have caused the factory rent to go up by 17% more.

It increases the cost of business significantly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a factory or a warehouse comes under one title

deed, it would not be   possible

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



to  sub-divide the whole premises into smaller units  for

separate leases.  So, even if only a small portion of the

premises is rented out, the owner has to pay the property

tax  based  on  the assessed rental value of  the  entire

factory   or  warehouse.  This  has  caused  unfair   and

unnecessary hardship to the owner,  especially at a  time

when  the  property  market is down.  This  property  tax

aspect  would have a very serious effect on  the  overall

business cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, transport cost in Singapore is one

of  the highest in the world.  More than half of the cost

of  owning  the company's vehicles comes as a  result  of

Government  taxes.  In this year's  Budget,  the  Finance

Minister  decides to change the basis for  valuing  motor

vehicles  which  would result in a decrease  in  ARF  and

excise duty payable for most vehicles. He has also locked

in  the  duty on petrol at its present rate, so  that  it

would not go up with the likely inflation of oil prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, these measures would help to contain our

transport  cost. I think we should thoroughly review  the

various factors contributing to our high transport  cost,

so that it would not be ranked No. 1 in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these direct taxes, there is also

compliance cost which adds to our total business cost.  I

am very glad to see in this budget some mention about how

to  do  away  with  some of the repeated  or  unnecessary

compliance  costs for the businessmen.  However,  in  our

daily   lives  and  also  in  the  process  of   business

operation, in order to comply with some of the Government

regulations, the compliance cost is very heavy.   Let  me

quote three examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in a new industrial estate or agro-technology

park, if you happen to be the first to take possession of

a  factory  in  this estate, and if there is  not  enough

power  supply,  you would have to build a  substation  at

your own cost, and it will cost you some $200,000.  Those

who come in later can make use of the power

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



sub-station, free of charge.  In other words,  the  first

person  who enters the estate will have to subsidise  the

cost of the others who use the electricity supply in this

area.  I think this is very unreasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if you are a property developer and you

have  purchased a few houses which you would subsequently

demolish  and  redevelop the land by building  a  row  of

terrace  houses on it, according to the regulations,  you

would   have  to dig up the existing drain  and  build  a

wider and deeper drain in the process of building the row

of  terrace houses. Subsequently, you would have to cover

up the newly built bigger drain with sand and gravel, and

reconstruct  the  drain back to the original  state.   In

other  words, there is an existing drain.   In  order  to

comply  with  the  Government regulations,  you  have  to

broaden it and then, after completion, you have to put it

back into the original state. This is an additional cost,

which is unnecessary and a waste of time and money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it may sound ridiculous, but it is true.

There  are people complaining about the unpleasant  smell

coming  out from the farm. The farm owner was advised  by

the   authority  to  build  a  scrubber,  costing   about

$100,000.   Despite  that, the authority  was  unable  to

prescribe  an  emission  standard  or  propose  the  best

possible  technology in dealing with the  odour  problem.

So,  even  after  building the scrubber, when  there  are

further complaints, the owner would be called up, given a

summons  to go to court, and be fined as much as  $10,000

on each charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if this is to happen in our new industrial

sites,  I am sure the EDB  would take up the matter  with

JTC,  and  it  will  be resolved.  However,  the  farming

industry  comes  under  the  charge  of  AVA,   and   the

businessmen have no recourse but to resign themselves  to

fate, pay the fine and forget about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no denial that business cost is very high

in  Singapore. Apart from direct and indirect taxes,  the

compliance  cost  incurred by having to comply  with  the

various Government rules and regulations

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



has  contributed  significantly  to  the  burden  of  our

businessmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government should not accelerate its

process to reduce our direct taxes to 20% by 2005.  If we

can  find some way to cut down on the indirect taxes  and

compliance  cost  to reduce the burden of our businessmen

in the present difficult time, they can survive, and even

have  some profits in their business.  Otherwise, if they

run  into  losses  or  even have to  fold  up,  then  any

reduction in income tax will have no bearing on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should do all we can to help them so that

they  can  survive and even make some profits.   If  they

have no profit, they do not pay any taxes, so even if  it

is reduced to 20%, what is the use of it?  We should look

into   this  heavy  burden  that  is  brought  upon   our

businessmen because of the high compliance cost.  If  the

situation can be improved, all businesses, big and small,

will  find it more attractive to stay in Singapore.  They

can  be  more  competitive and can face  the  competition

posed by the low-cost localities  around us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Thank

you,  Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.  I will

be   touching   only   on  entrepreneurship,   and   more

specifically one or two aspects of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased that the Government, in the

Budget, does not see entrepreneurship as a branch of  the

economy  or  as  an industry, but as a cultural  mindset.

For Singaporeans to be entrepreneurial, there has to be a

cultural  shift, and to quote the Minister of  State  for

Trade   and  Industry,  Mr  Raymond  Lim,  earlier,   the

entrepreneurial spirit has to be one which permeates  all

walks  of  life, not only in businesses.  I do not  think

that  the entrepreneurial spirit is just about maximising

financial  profits,  but it has  to  do  with  maximising

potential of resources, lateral thinking, creativity  and

the  pursuit  of  human ideals.  These are  some  of  the

qualities  stated  by my colleague,  Ms  Indranee  Rajah,

earlier.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship is equally applicable in family

management  and  social work as it is in  businesses  and

MNCs.   I agree with the Minister of State that we cannot

manufacture entrepreneurship, but we can enable people to

be  entrepreneurs.  But we, as a society,  also  can  and

should do more.  We, as a society, need to evolve into an

entrepreneurial one.  I do not think that we  can  become

entrepreneurial after one budget debate.   Even  all  the

fiscal  measures put together in the Budget Statement  do

not  create  an  entrepreneurial society.  However,  this

Budget  recognises entrepreneurship for what it  actually

is,  elusive  though it may be, and it  decides  to  move

towards  a more entrepreneurial society.  This House  and

all Singaporeans have to look at it in the long term, and

we  shall  continue to monitor our progress as we,  as  a

society, evolve the entrepreneurial spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to my next point, Sir, on

something which is related to this elusive nature of  the

entrepreneurial  spirit.   We  have  decided  to  embrace

globalisation,  the  infocomm  technology,  and  the  new

economy.   We  have  decided to  make  our  country  more

attractive  for  investments.  We  are  taking  steps  to

lessen  impediments and increase attractiveness  for  top

business  people to invest in Singapore.  We are allowing

our  people  more leeway to explore and to express.   The

sum  total  of  all  the recommendations  in  the  recent

reports  -  whether in the review of the upper  secondary

and  pre-university education or in the ERC  -  not  only

allows  for  more peaks in our people's achievements  but

also  enables these peaks to go higher.  But not everyone

can keep up with the changes that are taking place.  Some

are   struggling   just  to  remain   relevant.    These,

juxtaposed  with  the enhancements of  peaks,  mean  that

there  will  be a widening of the social gap between  the

very top and the very bottom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I face many applications for financial help

or otherwise from genuinely hardship-stricken families, I

also  see many brand new Maseratis, Boxsters and  XJs  on

our roads.  Being a young nation, Sir, social cohesion is

pivotal  to  our  well-being.  Recent events  related  to

extremism

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



and  terrorism have caused us to worry about  our  inter-racial and inter-religious relations.  Similarly, we have

to  ensure that changes in the economic landscape do  not

over stretch our social fabric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible way to keep this gap down - and I say

this only for discussion - is by placing caps at the top.

This  House has decided that capping the top runs counter

to the efforts to attract and keep investors, and we need

investors  to  keep our economy going,  in  other  words,

taxing  our  top earners can only be done  to  a  limited

extent, an extent to be determined, among others, by  tax

regimes  in  other  countries and other  costs  of  doing

business in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way to reduce this gap is to raise the

base.   Again,  there  are  limitations  to  this.    The

Government  seeks to be a fair, not welfare  state  -  to

borrow  a quote from a very well-known book, which  I  am

sure  all  of  us have read or are reading - and  further

doling  out too much help runs counter to our  vision  to

evolve  an  entrepreneurial  culture.   But  if  our  top

earners  are  more conscious of the need to maintain  our

social cohesion and are happy to do so, then we might  be

able to raise the base without antagonising the top.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the numerous fiscal measures in the Budget

that encourage and facilitate charitable acts.  But, Sir,

like  entrepreneurship, charity is  also  driven  by  the

human  spirit.  We need to evolve the spirit of  charity,

social  consciousness and voluntarism.  Schools now  have

community involvement programmes.  We have also  recently

established a National Volunteers Centre.  These are only

two  of  many structures and programmes recently  set  up

that  would help in evolving the spirit of charity.   The

success of the programmes should not be measured only  in

terms of how many activities were conducted and how  many

people  were  reached, or even how strongly  people  feel

towards  charity and voluntarism.  Perhaps, the ideal  is

reached when our poor and socially handicapped feel  that

they are not left out, that they see

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



the rich as their partners and their helpers, and not  as

targets  of anger or envy.  This can happen when our  top

and higher income earners have evolved the genuine spirit

to help and volunteer to do charity work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can and should evolve this spirit. If we

recognise  the  need  and  are resolved  to  evolve  this

elusive  entrepreneurial culture, then, similarly,  there

is  no  reason  why  we  cannot  resolve  and  evolve   a

charitable culture.  Indeed, both must go hand in hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing  me  to  participate in this Budget  debate.   I

speak  in support of the 2003 Budget in the name  of  the

Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Finance,  Mr  Lee

Hsien Loong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate Mr Lee's pro-business Budget and his

support  for  the  long-term  vision  for  Singapore,  as

outlined by the Economic Review Committee Report.  Sir, I

agree that the Budget should create attractive conditions

to  aggressively attract foreign direct investments.   To

this  end, we have fine-tuned our tax regime to  make  it

attractive   for   both   businesses   and   individuals.

Singapore  currently has one of the most  attractive  tax

regimes in the region.  I am confident that these changes

will   attract  companies  and  talent  to  relocate   in

Singapore  and  this, in turn, will  help  to  boost  our

economy and to create more jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget also encourages Singapore companies to

look  outwards  to  new markets and, at  the  same  time,

entices  foreign  companies that have global  operations.

Companies that use Singapore as a base of operation  will

obtain tax reliefs for foreign-sourced incomes, royalties

and  service  incomes.  There is even this  deferment  of

income taxes for two years, if their overseas investments

suffer   operational   losses  for  eligible   investment

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, it is noted that these advantages

outlined in the Budget would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



not  be felt by small businesses in these hard times, and

do  not  serve  as a sufficient catalyst  to  help  small

businesses grow into regional businesses.  I am concerned

that  most  of  the business cost cuts are temporary  for

another six months.  This does not bode well for our long-term  goal  of reducing costs and attracting investments.

Government  infrastructure and services have not  seen  a

drastic  drop in cost.  For example, it has been reported

that business cost still rose by about 5% in 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cite an example, just submitting an application

to  URA  for approval of simple alteration and additional

work will cost a businessman $2,080, inclusive of 4% GST.

And  in  order  to build a development of 100,000  square

metres  of  gross  floor  area, the  cost  for  essential

written approval - not even talking about building - is a

hefty  sum  of  $350,000.  Many  of  the  architects  and

consultants  are  stating  that  these  fees  were   last

reviewed  in 2000.  They have not seen any drop for  many

years,  despite  the intense efficiency and  productivity

drives,  and use of information technology.  It  is  time

for the Government agency to review its cost of provision

of  services.  It is my view that the Government needs to

reach out to the man-in-the-street, to be more sensitive,

and to have the ability to be flexible.  As my colleague,

Dr John Chen, earlier said, the Government agency must be

its customer's advocate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite another example of the

sensitivity  and  flexibility that the Government  agency

could  help the local small businessmen.  An eating house

operator  has rented a ground floor of eight conservation

shophouses for his new eating house.  It needs to  remove

the  ground  floor  adjoining walls  of  the  shophouses.

According   to   URA  guidelines,  all  alterations   and

additional  works  for conservation  houses  need  to  be

submitted  for  approval.  This is acceptable.   However,

the  charges are now a whopping $16,640, as it is treated

as  eight  applications  for  the  removal  of  six  non-structural walls shared by the eight shophouses.   If  it

is  treated as one application, the cost would be $2,080,

inclusive of 4% GST.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would next like to talk about portable

medical benefits.  I would like to compliment the  Deputy

Prime   Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance   for   the

introduction  of  these  benefits.   We  have  had   much

discussion about our greying workers in this  House.   As

our   workforce   becomes  greyer,   they   become   more

susceptible  to  job changes and losses, whether  due  to

inappropriate skill sets or as requirements  for  workers

change,  or  in  view of the existing  structure  of  age

remuneration  pay  system.   In  response  to  an   aging

workforce,  the Budget has identified new ways  in  which

the burden of healthcare can be reduced for employers and

the ageing workforce alike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by encouraging employers to implement either

the portable medical benefits or the transferable medical

insurance  scheme,  employers will continue  to  enjoy  a

deduction of 2% of the total employees' remuneration  for

medical   expenses   incurred.   If  employers   do   not

participate in this scheme, they will enjoy only half the

amount.  Since the portable medical benefits scheme  will

involve additional contributions by the employers to  the

Medisave  accounts of the employees, the Budget has  also

stipulated  that  the  employers'  deductions   will   be

increased to $1,500 per employee per year.  The  concerns

are  that  this  lump  sum  will  become  attractive  for

employers to favour younger employees, although  I  agree

that the absolute sum is very attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for us to determine whether the

quantum  proposed  under  the portable  medical  benefits

scheme  is  able  to meet the cost of healthcare  in  our

aging workforce sufficiently.  There is a danger that the

cost  of healthcare insurance premiums could dramatically

rise  because  of  age,  which would  again  be  counter-productive.  We need to ensure that this does not  happen

during this time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to appeal for the

enjoyment  of  this  2%  deduction  limit  to  thoughtful

employers who have allowed ex-employees, in view of early

retrenchments  due to restructuring of  the  company,  to

continue  to  take advantage of the attractive  insurance

rates, because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



of  the large global-based number of employees.  One good

example  is  Exxon-Mobil, which has  done  so.   This  is

especially  important for employees aged  50s  who  would

have   to  buy  insurance  again  due  to  forced   early

retirement and, in general, they would have to pay higher

insurance rates on re-acceptance into the medical schemes

and  subject  to  medical review.   This  exemption  will

encourage  more companies and statutory boards,  such  as

PSA  and HDB - I do not know whether they have done so  - to  consider allowing their retrenched workers or  early-terminated  employees to continue to tap on the  existing

insurance benefits or schemes with the relevant insurance

companies.  This will help the affected workers  to  tide

over  their  hardship,  and not  reduce  their  insurance

protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this economic downturn, it becomes necessary

for a caring Government to help its needy citizens.  Even

a  little  assistance goes a long way for those who  have

been  affected by this economic downturn.  Sir, while  we

have  several  assistance programmes  in  place  for  the

bottom  10% of Singaporeans, my feeling is that the  help

net  is not enough for the middle income group.  Many  of

the  4-roomers have upgraded themselves during  the  boom

time  and  without proper credit guidance.  Nobody  would

have  foreseen such a long period and severe downturn  of

our  economy.  Many of such families are in need of  more

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the existing schemes offered, again by the

MCDS  and  the  CDCs, are varied, and with many  acronyms

attached to the schemes.  Residents are confused and  not

clear  of these assistance schemes and many of them  have

very  minor  differences.   I  hope  these  two  critical

agencies  could  re-package these minor  differences  and

highlight the assistance programmes to the needy  and  to

those  workers  who  are affected by early  retrenchment.

The  booklets  for  retrenched workers  provided  by  the

restructuring  companies should  include  some  of  these

financial, social and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



family assistance schemes provided by the MCDS, the  CDCs

and even the FSCs within the communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the man-in-the street is already facing a tough

time  in  this economic downturn.  We will  not  see  any

economic  recovery  anytime soon.  So,  Singaporeans  can

expect  a  rough road ahead.  In fact, our Prime Minister

has  made  it clear that he expects things to  get  worse

before  they  get  better.  And  Singaporeans  have  been

tightening their belts for quite some time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we create ample advantages for the

international  business community so that  Singapore  can

succeed in the new economy and bring in new jobs  to  the

people,  we must also provide as much assistance  to  our

local   businesses,  providing  the  local  support   and

services,  and also carry as much of the burden  for  our

needy  citizens,  many of whom have  contributed  to  our

stellar growth in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br>3.35 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for Transport and Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan): Mr Speaker, I speak in support of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is ERC-inspired. It is an

important first step to re-position our economy  for  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC is a reincarnation of the 1985 Economic

Committee, but its karma is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



different.   Almost a generation has passed  between  the

two.   The 1985 Economic Committee Report and the changes

it  launched  led to more than a decade  of  very  strong

growth  for  Singapore.  So, the question is whether  the

ERC  Report will be just as successful.  Will it too lead

to another decade of robust growth for Singapore and well-paying jobs for Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideas are out there in the ERC Report. But, as

a  friend  remarked recently, ideas are a dime  a  dozen.

The  ability  to  execute  is  what  is  worth  millions.

Whether  the  ERC  Report will lead  to  success  depends

crucially  on  our collective attitude and joint  efforts

towards restructuring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the ideas in the ERC Report are not new.

You can find them in the 1985 EC Report.  For example, my

Services  Sub-Committee's idea of  making  education  and

healthcare  services engines of our growth was  not  new.

It  was a major recommendation in 1985.  So, why are they

being recycled in 2003?  Obviously, it means that the old

recommendations were not fully exploited.  I was  in  the

Ministry  of  Trade and Industry during this  intervening

period.   I  can  testify that it was  not  for  lack  of

trying.  But the economic agencies did bump against  many

obstacles.  For example, in the case of health  services,

there  is genuine worry that if a large number of foreign

patients are here, competing with local patients for  the

attention  of  our doctors, they may drive up  healthcare

cost.   In  other  words, there is  a  trade-off  between

economic objective and social priorities.  So, unless  we

have  a forum to debate such concerns, we will remain  in

ambivalence and under-perform.  Hence, our recommendation

to  set up a Ministerial Committee on Services where such

issues  can  be  connected and  trade-offs  made.   I  am

cheered by Deputy Prime Minister Lee's decision to  chair

this  Ministerial Committee.  Many hard choices will have

to be made, going forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one major difference between 1985 and

now.   Then  we were truly way ahead of the region.   But

over the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



years, the others have caught up.  We are still ahead  in

most areas, but the gap in capabilities has narrowed.  We

have  good hospitals and good schools, good universities,

but  it is no longer sufficient to be good, as the others

have also built up good institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody pushed me this book, Good to Great by Jim

Collins.  Collins spent five years looking into why  some

companies become great but many others do not.   His  key

insight is: "Good is the enemy of great.  And that is one

of  the  key  reasons why we have so little that  becomes

great."  This is his observation:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't have great schools, principally because we

have  good  schools.The vast majority of companies  never

become  great, precisely because the vast majority become

quite good - and that is their main problem."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying Jim Collins' insight to the ERC Report, my

take  is that being good is not enough in our next  phase

of  development.   We need great institutions,  and  many

more of them, going forward.  We need to do four things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must aim high. Good is no longer good

enough.   Without the resources, critical  mass  and  low

cost structures, we will not be able to compete if we are

merely good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate this point, look at our Changi

Airport.  For four million people, we do not need and  do

not  deserve a world-class airport.  But because we  plan

it  and  we run it to serve 400 million, we have  Changi.

It  is  a  perfect  example  of  the  abundance  mindset,

focusing  on opportunities.  Had we adopted the  scarcity

mindset of focusing on constraints, Changi would  not  be

there and we will all be poorer for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, Matsushita Refrigeration Industries, the

world's   No.  2  maker  of  compressors  for   household

refrigerators,  celebrated its 30th anniversary  here  in

Singapore.   At  a  time when many companies  are  crying

their  lungs out about the challenge of manufacturing  in

Singapore,  Matsushita is expanding its activities  here.

It aims high.  It aims to make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  the world's No. 1 R&D Centre and Manufacturing

Solution  Hub.   Its  Singapore factory  is  the  largest

facility  in  the  world,  making  more  than   half   of

Matsushita's  global output.  Last week, it launched  the

world's  most efficient compressor, designed by  the  R&D

team in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Esplanade is not of the same scale as the Sydney

Opera  House,  although it is not  less  charming.   Like

Changi Airport, we built it to serve a larger hinterland.

To  attract  the  clientele, our  facilities,  especially

acoustics, have to be world-class.  Last December,  tenor

Jose  Carreras performed in our Concert Hall and  he  was

all  praise.   He said, "It's probably the  world's  best

modern  hall and one of the world's top concert halls  of

all times."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, let us move, and move faster than the

fastest  in China and elsewhere.  Those of us  who  visit

China  regularly know how fast some of the  cities  there

are  moving.   Just  look  at  broadband  connections  in

hotels.  They are now fairly common in China, but our own

hotels  here are still slow to implement it.  At the  end

of  the day, we win a race only if we can run faster than

our  competitors.  The ERC Report contains many  sensible

recommendations, but actual implementation and the  speed

of implementation is the key.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, learn from our successes and our failures.

We  need  to apply our knowledge more widely in Singapore

and  build  up new knowledge faster.  We have pockets  of

excellence.   I  may be biased, being from  MITA,  but  I

think  our  libraries  have done a  remarkable  job.   We

should  apply  what they did to other  areas.   Likewise,

NETS,  Tradenet are all remarkable successes.  We  should

apply our knowledge in cluster information integration in

other areas, for example, in healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we should especially learn from our failures.

This  follows from the need to move fast.  When you  move

fast,  you  must be prepared to make some  mistakes.   We

must then be willing to readily admit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



mistakes, change quickly and correct them.  For if we  do

not  learn  from our mistakes, we would have  wasted  our

tuition fees and, worse, repeat the mistakes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, be frugal. We should try to do more with

less.   Even as we aim high, our feet must be  firmly  on

the ground, focusing on the bottom line.  If our feet are

not  on  the  ground, we will merely be creating  bubbles

like  the  dot.commers.  And, if we  are  not  delivering

value at realistic prices, someone else would.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A CEO friend of mine had this to say about

management:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my 26 years of working life, I have seen us

jumping  from  one  management  fad  to  another.    Each

launched with great fanfare and consultants made tons  of

money  from  fees.   All the while, I stuck  with  simple

ideas of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) productivity = maximise output, minimise input;

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) quality is defined by the customers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) value = maximum perceived quality at lowest

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible cost;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the role of management is to help the frontline

staff deliver maximum value to the customers.  Everything

else is unnecessary bureaucracy."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may have over-dramatised, but I agree with his

key  message  that we should focus only  on  things  that

matter  to  customers and cut out unnecessary bureaucracy

as  an  effective way to reduce cost.  Save every  single

cent  and invest on the great stuff.  Acquire the culture

of   being   frugal.    Look  at  our  first   generation

entrepreneurs.  They are famously frugal.   And  this  is

not a uniquely Asian value.  The most successful American

companies  in modern history are ferociously  competitive

on  cost -  Intel, Microsoft, Dell, Walmart, Cisco, South

West Airline, just to name a few.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up until at least 1998, Bill Gates flew economy, not

first   class.    Walmart  employees,   including   their

executives,  share rooms when on business  trips.   These

companies  have  built  a strong corporate  culture  that

recognises and rewards employees for being frugal.   They

know that over the long haul, being cost-competitive is a

key competitive advantage.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of some natural advantages, we will

always need to be cost-competitive, not necessarily to be

the  cheapest,  but must provide the best value  for  our

customers.  My sense is that during the boom years of the

last decade, we seem to have forgotten the wisdom of  the

ancient  sage:   Ju  an  si  wei,  ju  sheng  si  gan   (

).   In victory, remember defeat.  In time of plenty,  we

should  be especially mindful of deprivation.  We  should

work  to  make  frugality a national culture  and  regain

quickly our cost competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me return to the question: will

the  ERC Report bring in another decade of strong growth?

And the answer is really in our hands.  Good is the enemy

of  great.   If we are complacent, thinking that  we  are

good  and have arrived, then success will escape us.   On

the  other  hand,  if we succumb to the current  economic

slowdown  and  wring our hands in despair,  success  will

also  escape  us.  So, Straits Times' Chua Lee  Hoong  is

right.  In her 5th March "Budget 2003" article, she hoped

that this Budget debate would generate the right buzz, by

focusing  on the big picture shift in direction  that  we

are  making.  Instead, if we wallow in self-pity and talk

ourselves into a depression, we deserve to lose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, I had the pleasant duty to give away the

Woman  of  the Year Awards to Olivia Lum and  Elim  Chew.

Several   parliamentary  colleagues  were   also   there.

Wonderful choices by the judging panel, especially  at  a

time like this.  These two ladies did not wallow in self-pity  when  they were down.  They had gone  through  very

tough  times, but they picked themselves up and succeeded

against  great  odds.   And  that  was  also  how  modern

Singapore  was  built  by  our  parents,  despite  poorer

endowment  and  more hostile neighbourhood.   Surely  our

generation  can  do  better, given better  education  and

stronger resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's Sing Singapore song, Dick Lee had

this to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look where we are, we've come so far

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there's still a long, long way to go

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all of my heart, I will care

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll play my part, I will share

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With family and friends, together we'll stand

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the end, hand in hand

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will get there"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share his optimism and his spirit of confidence.

Rain  will  not  last forever.  While  we  may  not  like

getting  wet, rain also clears the air and nourishes  new

growth.   Singapore has all the conditions  to  grow  and

flourish again when the sun comes up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I rise in support of the motion as proposed by  the

Finance Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement sends a clear signal to all

Singaporeans.  We must work together as one united people

to  face  the  new challenges in the global economy.   We

need  to  develop  a  resilient and diversified  domestic

economy, and position Singapore in the global market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's uncertain world, we must equip our people

to  be  more flexible and hardworking.  It is  a  mindset

change, which we must encourage all Singaporeans to adopt

in  order  to  have a better future.  I  agree  with  the

Finance Minister that "success ultimately depends on  the

resourcefulness and resilience of Singaporeans."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Government moves its stride to

globalise  Singapore, we must not make Singaporeans  lose

heart  that  they  are unable to cope  with  these  rapid

changes.    Incentives   and   encouragement   must    be

strategically  administered  to  develop  passion   among

Singaporeans.  For those who have difficulty coping  with

the  economy's  transition, we must lend a helping  hand.

This  includes  the  small and medium  enterprises  which

employ many Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three key aspects which the Government

should focus to make Singapore a globalised economy:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government must encourage and help all

Singaporeans to learn new skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government must help to strengthen our

firms to better cope with global competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Government must help both Singapore firms

and Singaporeans to globalise.

<br><br><i>Helping Singaporeans</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three groups of Singaporeans who require

more  help from the Government to be self-reliant.   They

are,  first, needy Singaporeans who are chronically sick,

mentally  sick or elderly; second, Singaporeans with  low

skills  or  unemployed; and, third, dual income  families

which have become single income families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last 12 months, about 9,000 residents

in  the  North West CDC district have approached the  CDC

for  job  assistance.   Although 3,000  have  managed  to

secure  jobs  through  the  CDC's  job  assistance,   job

counselling and training programmes, 6,000 residents  are

still jobless.  Despite many job-matching attempts,  many

job seekers are still unable to find suitable jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two key reasons are cited for this situation.

Firstly, the salary of jobs offered is unable to help the

job seekers to meet their living expenses; and, secondly,

the  accessibility of jobs and homes is  poor,  resulting

in  high  transportation cost for the  job  seekers.   In

addition,  many  job seekers have either  low  skills  or

irrelevant skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job seekers who are above 50 years old face greater

difficulty to return back to the job market.  The limited

number  of  job vacancies in the market further compounds

this  problem.   As  for those who have medical  history,

firms  are  not willing to employ them for  fear  of  low

productivity and high medical expenses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some dual income families also face difficulty

due  to  over  financial commitments  or  poor  financial

planning.  Many had miscalculated their sources of income

and  were  caught  off  guard by the  prolonged  economic

crisis.   In  fact, quite a number of these  Singaporeans

stay  in  4-  or  5-room HDB flats,  and  receive  lesser

utilities  and  S&C  rebates from the  Government.   Very

often, their children's needs and education are affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to propose the following measures for

the Finance Minister to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Creation of jobs. More incentives should be

offered  for firms to provide more jobs for Singaporeans.

These  include part-time jobs, flexible jobs or  contract

work.   The People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme  (PJTP)

should  be  further  enhanced  to  include  part-time  or

contract work.  We must also render more support to those

voluntary  welfare organisations which  provide  elderly,

family and medical care services in the community.   More

PJTP  programmes should be introduced in these VWOs.   In

this  way,  we can build a larger pool of healthcare  and

social  service workers to meet the future  needs  of  an

ageing population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Skills upgrading. The key ingredient to self-reliance is to have a positive and flexible mindset.

Singaporeans must have the "never say die" attitude.   We

must continually strive to improve our employable skills.

With   the   correct   attitude  and   multiple   skills,

Singaporeans  will always be employable in a  diversified

economy.   The  Government should also  let  Singaporeans

take  ownership of their own skills upgrading.  We should

introduce a "portable training benefits" scheme,  whereby

workers  can take their own initiative to attend approved

training  courses which are recognised  by  the  National

Skills  Recognition  System.  Sir, I  fully  support  the

special  transfer  of  $500  million  into  the  Lifelong

Learning  Fund.   What  is needed  is  a  more  effective

outreach to encourage Singaporeans to continually upgrade

their  skills.  The Skills Development Fund has  achieved

some success in upgrading workers through

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



firms.   We  should allow more flexibility and incentives

for Singaporeans to take initiative to learn more skills.

With  a  portable training benefit scheme,  workers  will

have more options to upgrade their skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) "Means test" and subsidy. We should review our

"means  test"  and allow more flexibility to  help  needy

Singaporeans who are chronically sick, mentally sick  and

elderly.   While  we  encourage  families  to  help   one

another,  some  working class families do  not  have  the

financial  ability  to help their parents  and  siblings.

This  is  especially  so when there  are  family  members

suffering from chronic illnesses.  The long-term  medical

expenses  will put severe strain on the families.   Thus,

the  Government should provide more social assistance  to

these  needy Singaporeans and reduce the burden of  their

family members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, no fee subsidy is provided for pre-school

education.   Families with a per capita  income  of  less

than  $700  usually  face difficulty  to  pay  for  their

children's   pre-school  education.   With  the   growing

importance  of pre-school education, I hope  the  Finance

Minister  can consider subsidising the fee for pre-school

education    in   Singapore.    To   further    encourage

Singaporeans to have more children, we should also review

the  subsidy for childcare and student care centres.  The

first  three  children should be given equal  and  higher

subsidy so as to help working parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Medifund. Sir, I support the transfer of $100

million  to  the  Medical Endowment  Fund.  The  Medifund

scheme has provided much help to many needy Singaporeans.

Those  who  have  received help are appreciative  of  the

financial  assistance, which could  sometimes  amount  to

thousands  of  dollars per case.  Based on feedback  from

the  CDC's  social  assistance services,  some  residents

would  like to urge the Government to consider  extending

the  scope  of  subsidy  for  Medifund  to  include  some

necessary  consumables for patients, such as stoma  bags,

adult diapers and special liquid diet.  These consumables

can amount to hundreds of dollars per

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



month,  which  is  usually  beyond  the  reach  of  needy

families.

<br><br><i>Helping Businesses</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the measures introduced by the

Finance  Minister to reduce business costs  and  increase

the  competitiveness of our companies.  We  must  explore

more innovative ways to encourage Singapore companies  to

be  globally  competitive.  We need to  relook  into  the

factors  of production and re-engineer our work processes

to reduce cost, improve quality and productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest three areas which the

Government can assist businesses:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Reducing business costs. More flexibility

should  be given to allow integrated and maximum  use  of

land.  Factories and businesses must be located near  our

logistics   and  transport  infrastructure  to   minimise

travelling  time  and  reduce transportation  costs.   We

should facilitate complementary mix of tenants to achieve

better  supply  chain  operations.  For  example,  anchor

tenants   of   industrial  land  should  be  given   more

flexibility   to   house  their  subsidiaries   or   sub-contractors/suppliers.   In  addition,  we  should   also

consider abolishing property tax in Singapore, especially

for  vacant  land  so  as  to  reduce  holding  cost  for

businesses and encourage property ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should provide more support to help

Singapore   firms  brand  their  products  and   services

overseas.   I  would suggest that we develop  a  one-stop

website to showcase all Singapore's products and services

in  the global market.  The portal can be the gateway for

Singapore firms to brand their products and services.  At

the  same  time, more business tie-ups could be initiated

through the web.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Upgrade skills of staff. The Government should

facilitate  the development of capabilities of  Singapore

companies  to  be globally competitive.  Except  for  the

Government agencies, private firms are usually less  keen

to send their staff for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



skills upgrading.  Sir, employers are the "best teachers"

to train workers with employable skills.  We must provide

incentives   to  encourage  employers  to   train   their

employees regularly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the recent revision of foreign worker levy, the

Government should also consider providing incentives  for

employers  who train their staff in multiple skills.   In

this  aspect, I would urge SPRING Singapore  to  be  more

proactive in encouraging employers, especially the  SMEs,

to send their staff for skills upgrading regularly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Increase business opportunities. Sir, the

reduction  of business cost cannot help firms to  survive

if  there  is  no business.  The market in  Singapore  is

small  and  saturated.  Therefore, Singapore  firms  must

search  for  new markets overseas.  Business  delegations

led  by  the Government have indeed opened up many  doors

for  our  firms.   The  Government  should  continue   to

organise  more  such delegations and facilitate  business

tie-ups   in   specific  industries  such  as   financial

services,  design  consultancy,  trading,  transport,  or

logistics services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore is a hub for almost everything

(seaport, airport, logistics, trading, info-comm, finance

and tourism).  Although the visitor arrivals to Singapore

increased  marginally  by 0.6% to 7.5  million  in  2002,

hotel  occupancy rate fell by 1.9% to 74%.  I  understand

from  the  business community that many  visitors  merely

used  Singapore  as  a  transit  or  tourist  stop  where

visitors  will only spend a few hours here.   Thereafter,

they  will  stay  at cheaper hotels in  our  neighbouring

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to address this visitor's transit

problem  and  encourage more visitors to stay  longer  in

Singapore.   The  Singapore Tourism Board should  provide

more incentives for organisations or firms to hold longer

duration  international  conventions  or  exhibitions  in

Singapore.  We should also commission event promoters

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



to bring in world-class shows, exhibitions or meetings to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a safe haven, Singapore should capitalise on its

secure environment to attract family visitors, especially

children, to have fun in Singapore.  But to achieve this,

we  need  to have better tourist attractions for children

and  families.  The Government should seriously  consider

building  a  world-class theme park, maybe a "Wonderland"

or "Dreamland for Children".  We must invest and build  a

world-class   tourism  infrastructure  to   attract   new

tourists to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed theme park should be supported by the

Government   and  be  competitively  priced  to   attract

visitors.   The Singapore Tourism Board should be  tasked

to   operate   the   park  so  as   to   achieve   better

accountability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the outsourcing of theme parks to the private

sector has failed many times in Singapore.  We should not

repeat  these mistakes but should instead have  only  one

world-class   theme  park  in  Singapore.    Spearheading

tourism will provide more business opportunities for  our

companies in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Globalising Singapore</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to propose three strategies to globalise

Singapore:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We have to focus on the quality and reliability

of our products and services;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We must build a resilient and multi-skilled

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workforce; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We must nurture a few world-class companies to serve

the global market.

<br><br><i>(i)  Quality and Reliability</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As competition gets more intense, we must

differentiate   our  products  and  services   from   our

competitors.   Singapore  is  in  a  good   position   to

capitalise on our trustworthiness to produce good quality

and reliable products and services.  We need to establish

key  benchmarks or performance indicators to measure  the

acceptance of our services and products in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



the global market.  More resources should be allocated to

brand Singapore's products and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the setting up of a Ministerial

Committee on Services.  To be a global player and tourism

hub,  we  must  adopt a total approach to provide  world-class customer service.  In business, customer service is

the  key to retaining loyal customers and attracting  new

customers.  We must make every effort to ensure that  all

customers have good experience with Singapore's  products

and  services.  One role model whom we can all follow  is

Singapore Airlines.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.10 pm

<br><br><i>(ii) Resilient and Multi-skilled Workforce</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope with the fast changing global market

conditions,  we  must have a resilient and  multi-skilled

workforce.   As businessmen are always very versatile  to

react  to  market forces, workers are often  caught  off-guard  to  adapt  to these changes.  Therefore,  we  must

instil  an  "entrepreneurial mindset" among our  workers.

Our  workers must be capable to move in tandem  with  the

market   forces  and  be  prepared  to  take   challenges

constantly.  As such, we should encourage firms to  adopt

job  rotation  practices  and provide  opportunities  for

their  employees  to  start businesses  such  as  forming

subsidiaries or business start-ups.

<br><br><i>(iii)     World-class companies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not practical to groom all Singapore companies

to  be  world-class.  We have to be selective and channel

our  limited resources to nurture a few companies,  which

are  promising.   The key support needed is  funding  for

business  ventures into the global market.  For a  start,

the Government can provide incentives for local banks  to

reduce    their   stringent   requirements   for   credit

facilities.   Many banks require personal  guarantees  or

collaterals for business loans.  As such,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



limited  funding is available for local firms  to  expand

their businesses overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government can also facilitate

public  listed  companies to raise  funds  through  share

issues  for business expansion programmes.  With adequate

capital,  Singapore firms will be able to better position

and compete in the global market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's Budget is a fair and balanced

budget.  It has the ingredients to prepare Singapore  for

the  future.   What is needed is a mindset  change  among

Singaporeans  to  be more flexible, more hardworking  and

more  resourceful.   With  the strong  support  from  our

Government,  Singapore will continue to  prosper  in  the

future.

<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  thank  you  for allowing me  to  join  in  this

debate.    My   main   focus  would   be   on   enhancing

competitiveness, thereby helping Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is presented during a time when

Singapore's economy is at a crossroad.  We are undergoing

a    structural   transformation   and   facing   greater

competition due to rapid globalisation.  Ahead of us  are

the  uncertainties prevailing in major economies and  the

possibility of war in Iraq.  This is a tough time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last couple of years, many Singaporeans are

severely affected by the economic downturn.  Many workers

have  lost  their jobs and finding it harder  to  be  re-employed.  Those in employment are very worried about job

security.   I will further elaborate on this  during  the

debate in the Committee of Supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the message of seizing opportunity in

uncertainty in Deputy Prime Minister's Budget  speech  is

timely,   given  the  current  situation.   The  measures

proposed  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and   Finance

Minister in his Budget speech to restructure our  economy

are  crucial for our economic survival.  Some of them are

painful, such as the deferment of CPF restoration, but  I

understand why they are absolutely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



necessary  for  retaining  and attracting  businesses  to

Singapore.   These  will  create  good  jobs  and  ensure

continued prosperity for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to elaborate on strengthening

competitiveness for the creation of jobs and wealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about competitiveness and flexibility,

we  should not come to the immediate conclusion that  the

only factors are wages and labour costs.  Yes, wages  and

labour costs are significant, but there are other factors

such  as land and related costs, regulatory and statutory

costs,  transportation, taxes and other  business  costs.

Let me elaborate further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, wages and labour costs. We should continue

to   maintain  labour  cost  competitiveness  and   raise

productivity.  We cannot just focus on cutting wages  and

retrenching  workers.  We have to build up  the  flexible

wage  component  in  our  wage system,  such  as  through

monthly  variable  components and variable  bonuses.   To

sustain  employability of workers, wages must be directly

linked  to  productivity improvement.   I  strongly  urge

employers  to  involve  their  employees  in  efforts  to

improve productivity for mutual benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, land and related costs. Are high land costs

and  other  factors  making Singapore uncompetitive?   We

have  to  further  explore whether the land  pricing  and

other  related costs are artificially high  in  Singapore

and not adhering to current market factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, regulatory and statutory costs. As a union

leader, I have come across concerns from businesses  that

regulatory and compliance costs on companies are high  in

Singapore.   These  have  affected  businesses  and   our

competitiveness.   Will more steps be  taken  to  address

these concerns?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister

has announced a number of measures to make it attractive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



for businesses to invest in Singapore.  At the same time,

he  has  announced  various rebates  and  reductions  for

businesses until year's end.  Would it not be  better  if

such  rebates  and  reductions are extended  for  another

three  years?   Further, why not freeze  all  other  cost

increases  at the same time for another three  years?   I

believe   all   these  suggestions  will   greatly   help

businesses in Singapore and attract new ones, which  will

result  in  the  preservation and creation  of  jobs  for

Singaporeans.   Retrenchments can be  minimised  and  not

make  the unemployment situation worse.  This will  boost

the confidence level of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancing human capital. I applaud Government's

move to set up a new statutory board under MOM to promote

adult   continuing  education  and  training.   The   new

statutory board will oversee our continuing education and

training  efforts.   The details of the  statutory  board

have not been announced, but I would like to see the  new

statutory board addressing the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Enhance the employability of older workers who have

mainly  knowledge  in job-specific or technology-specific

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Help workers make career switches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Continual learning and skills upgrading for

professionals, executives and self-employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Help the structurally unemployed gain new skills and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Manage a database of important information emerging

from  the  rapid  structural changes.  This  will  ensure

optimum investment in training and retraining, so  as  to

enhance  workers'  employability  and  help  them   adapt

quickly to changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Strengthen synergies with other important partners

such  as  EDB,  NTUC,  SNEF, and  others.   These  strong

synergies  will help identify the type of  skills  needed

for  the  jobs that new investments will bring  and  help

prepare workers through training and skills upgrading.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the concerted efforts of all partners working

in   tandem  with  the  new  statutory  board,   we   can

collectively and confidently address the issues of skills

gap, wage gap and structural unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, during this period of

uncertainty and tight budget position, the initiatives by

the  Government  to  help  Singaporeans,  especially  the

poorer  ones, must be lauded.  The measures would lighten

the  load  of Singaporeans.  Assistance such as Utilities

Save  and  additional S&C rebates will help  workers  and

Singaporeans.   The additional allocation  of  funds  for

Skills  Redevelopment Programme, Lifelong  Learning  Fund

and  Medifund  are  steps in the right direction.   Taken

together  with the earlier announcements of ERS  and  the

phased-in  introduction of GST, there is  no  doubt  that

there is help available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These various assistance schemes clearly show that

the  Government is committed to its social contract  with

the  people  of Singapore.  For the future,  I  urge  the

Government  to continue to target more help to  the  most

needy,   the   unemployed,  the  poorer  or   unfortunate

Singaporeans  and their families.  I suggest  an  opt-out

donation  mechanism  to  a  central  hardship   fund   be

explored, so that better-off Singaporeans can donate  the

shares or benefits granted by the Government to those  in

greater need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the challenges ahead of us are

formidable, one of the most difficult facing  our  nation

since independence.  In the past, we have worked together

and remained focused on our objectives.  This has led  to

continuous growth and prosperity for all of us.  This  is

the  approach  we must continue to take.  We  must  never

allow  minor  problems or even setbacks  to  distract  or

discourage us.  The greatest welfare to people  is  jobs.

And  I  strongly urge the Government to do  all  that  is

necessary  for  the  preservation and creation  of  jobs.

Policies to bring about this should be implemented fairly

and  humanely, especially to those who are affected most.

Together, let us seize the opportunity in uncertainty and

strive for a better Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  like  many of the hon.  Members  in  this

Chamber, I would like to join in the debate on the Budget

Statement  delivered  by the Deputy  Prime  Minister  and

Minister for Finance.  I hope to give my perspective  and

views  on the matter and, at the same time, give feedback

on views that I got from the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stand here before you today, I can safely say

that  I do not recall a period where the nation has faced

greater  uncertainty.  The seemingly  inevitable  war  in

Iraq and the performance of the regional and US economies

will  pose serious challenges for us.  In fact, they  are

already  affecting us.  Indeed, we are  facing  difficult

times.  The waves that we have to ride may grow in  size.

We  do  not  know.   Therefore, we can only  do  what  is

humanly possible to stay prepared and survive this period

in our nation's life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that fellow Singaporeans are very familiar

with the way the Government works.  Our approach in times

like this is almost predictable.  It is simple.  We study

the  problem at hand and we seek solutions.   Often,  the

way out is not a breeze.  It is usually painful.  But  we

go  to  our  people and work with them.   Retrospectively

speaking,  we  have been fortunate that  they  understand

when  it  is  necessary to grit our teeth  as  a  nation,

persevere and patiently wait for the storm to blow  over.

More  often  than not, the fruits of our  policy  changes

emerge after several years.  History has shown that  they

are not immediate.  It is this lag period which many find

excruciating, and no amount of explanation  will  appease

the man-in-the-street who bears the brunt of the economic

slowdown  and, on top of that, the additional  blow  from

policy changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent increase in job losses, the highest

unemployment rate since 1986, and the daily war  rhetoric

are  all  very disheartening.  As a nation, we have  also

recently  been  plagued by a series of  freak  accidents,

beginning with the Pedra

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



Branca  tragedy  and  a  few  others.   We  are  terribly

saddened  by  the  loss  of  innocent  lives  amidst  the

economic and geo-political uncertainties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Budget 2003 is really a continuation of Budget

2002,   the   global  situation  has  since   last   year

deteriorated,  and our people need more hope  than  ever.

Hope,  hope and more hope are my mantra these days.   The

belief  that  this too, like most things  in  life,  will

pass, holds true.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope it is obvious to many that Singapore

needs  to  embark  on a different path  where  individual

entrepreneurship  will  propel  the  economy  while   the

country   is  on  the  path  of  consolidation.   Private

enterprise  must be encouraged, engineered even  for  the

sake of growth.  If this is indeed the direction that  we

have  charted for Singapore, are we willing to  seriously

assist  our  start-ups in every sense of  the  word,  and

sincerely  provide  infrastructure  and  financial   aid?

Supporting  them  is  inevitably  part  of  a   conducive

environment  that we need to create.  How  do  we  create

risk  takers  when the predominant culture is  to  always

ensure certainty, back-up plans after back-up plans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the call by Dr John Chen and other Members

that  our  civil  service officers should  be  more  pro-business  and act as advocates for companies  and  start-ups, rather than just apply rules and uphold regulations.

It  will  certainly help to smoothen the flow of requests

and  applications and reduce wastage of time  and  money.

Perhaps,  Sir, the changing of mindsets is  the  greatest

challenge at hand.  I am glad that more support is  being

allocated,  and  the  Minister of  State  for  Trade  and

Industry,  Mr Raymond Lim, has eloquently spelt  out  his

vision  and mission towards this effort.  My hope is  for

him  to  listen to the industry players and stakeholders.

Very  often,  I  hear people lamenting  that  the  policy

makers  are  oblivious of happenings on the  ground  when

they  are  churning out policies, schemes and  programmes

that are supposedly intended to help the companies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the present economic

climate  and  challenges  that  face  the  country,   the

Malay/Muslim community must continue to strive along.  It

is  definitely not easy for all Singaporeans, but  it  is

also commonly known that the majority of the Malay/Muslim

workers  are  in  the lower-income and  the  lower-skills

category.    If  the  economic  slowdown  persists,   the

community will naturally be hit by retrenchments and loss

of  jobs.  But this does not mean that we should just lie

down and consider ourselves defeated.  Instead, we should

take  this  opportunity  to  improve  and  upgrade.   The

community must take these challenges and face them,  just

like all the other difficulties that they have faced  and

overcome  in  the past.  We should continue to  focus  on

education and the vision of a community of excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young and the youths of the community are doing

better.   Similarly, the Malay/Muslim  organisations  and

NGOs  have  done  quite a commendable  job  in  terms  of

providing   accessibility  to  resource  and  assistance.

However, the journey surely cannot end here.  They should

continue to work closely with the Government agencies and

other   self-help  groups  to  continue  to  uplift   the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the long run, we all agree that handouts

need  to  be reduced.  We do not intend to be  a  welfare

state.  However, having said that, addressing real  needs

is  part  of  our commitment to care for our people,  and

this  deserves our full attention.  Health cost is a real

problem  to three categories worth mentioning  here:  the

senior citizens and retirees with chronic illnesses,  the

handicapped  and the unemployed.  Not all  companies  can

afford  to  provide healthcare, post retrenchment.   Some

may, but are not motivated or required to do so.  This is

a problem and needs to be looked into seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the arts carry very little

weight to the average Singaporean.  This area of interest

is  not perceived as a serious subject.  At best,  it  is

limited to a favourite pastime.  I know many parents  who

send their children for piano or violin lessons with  the

contention

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



that the stimulation helps their children to perform well

in mathematics and science instead.  Perhaps, there is  a

neurological  link.   Credible  or  not  is  not  to   be

discussed  here,  but my point is that the  mentality  at

large  does not regard the arts very highly.  I am  often

worried  and concerned that in these difficult times  the

support  and  resources  for arts  and  culture  will  be

reduced.   However,  thankfully, our hearts  are  at  the

right  places, and the cultural achievements in 2002  are

very  encouraging.  It presents concrete steps to  change

perceptions and mould different opinions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus heartening to note that we will continue

on  our  pursuit  of  creating  a  cultural  capital  and

boosting  our arts scene and industry, as recommended  by

the  ERC.   The  economic  and social  potential  of  our

cultural capital cannot be denied, and the ERC recognises

this  fact.  I certainly believe that, as we develop  and

grow as a young country, these aspects of our development

should   not  be  neglected.   Let  us  not  choose   the

convenient  and  so-called  obvious  choice  of   cutting

expenditures in this area and, thus, bringing us back  in

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of continuous learning and upgrading

in  all  areas cannot be emphasised enough.  Our  schools

and  institutes of higher learning are intricately linked

with  our  chief engines of growth.  The formation  of  a

statutory board to focus on this area is laudable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would propose to this new

organisation   to  try  and  leverage  on  the   existing

institutions and bodies, and streamline the  schemes  and

programmes  that could further encourage and  incentivise

lifelong  learning.  Our workers are worried  that,  even

after  picking  up new skills and knowledge,  they  still

cannot  improve their chances of getting  new  jobs.   We

need  to address this concern clearly.  Beyond that,  our

tertiary  institutions must continue to  remain  relevant

and  serve  not  only the student cohorts  but  also  the

working  adults  who  yearn to upgrade  themselves.   Our

universities  need  to  be  relevant,  and   the   recent

university review was timely.  They need to work  closely

with industries and look at feedback seriously.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the kind of graduates that we are

producing  at our universities.  Can our graduates  think

for  themselves?  During the recent student dialogue with

our Senior Minister, the criticism was that the questions

were   mainly   from   foreign  students,   whereas   the

Singaporeans were often silent.  Are they simply  shy  to

ask  or  are  they complacent, contented  to  simply  sit

comfortably   and  absorb  without  doing  more   serious

thinking?  Are they independent?  Can they cope with  not

being able to find a job immediately after they graduate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, going back to the current situation that faces

the  nation, my last word on this is that we need to work

together  and help our people to get out of the doldrums.

The retrenched may actually find themselves employed in a

shorter  period, if some things are put into perspective.

Often  enough, we hear of jobs and opportunities  in  the

service industry, but they are not well regarded and thus

the  take-up  rate  is slow.  It is time  we  started  to

change  mindsets and prejudices towards jobs and  careers

in the service industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who are considering to go into this

industry, let me give this small piece of advice which  I

picked  up from a movie that I watched over the  weekend.

There was this very professional and dignified butler who

said, wisely:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To serve people takes dignity and intelligence, but

remember,  they are just people with money.  Although  we

serve  them, we are not their servants.  What we do  does

not  define who we are.  What defines us is how  we  rise

after falling."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that every Singaporean would remember this.

<br>4.28 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be applauded that in spite of a difficult

environment  and  much  pressure  to  implement  populist

measures,  the  Government has  come  out  with  a  clear

roadmap that will take us to the next lap to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



be a global, entrepreneurial and diversified economy, one

that  will  be well-positioned to take on the competition

and  challenges  posed by mega-cities around  the  world.

Rather   than  manage  just  for  the  short  term,   the

Government  has decided to take measures  to  ensure  the

long-term survival of Singapore.

In  my mind, that we would succeed to remake Singapore to

be  an  attractive  place  to  work  and  play  for  both

Singaporeans and foreigners, is without doubt.  Three and

a half decades ago, Singapore was in a worse position - a

poorer background and devoid of the many advantages  that

we  have today.  While today's competition is stiffer, we

have  also  progressed much in terms of  being  a  better

organised country with world-class infrastructure.   Just

as  the  Senior Minister of State, Mr Khaw Boon Wan,  has

said, we are a fertile ground that would be nourished  by

today's  rain.  But we are also pragmatic and  hard-nosed

enough to take the bitter medicine required at each stage

of our growth.  Nowhere else is a country's leadership so

forthright and bold enough to be upfront on the need  for

retrenchments,  that  they are a necessary  part  of  the

solution needed to meet stiffer competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchments alone are not sufficient. We need

measures to take care of the lower strata of society, and

to  prepare  them  to contribute positively  in  the  new

Singapore.   I  am  pleased that  we  would  have  a  new

statutory  board  set  up  to  look  at  retraining   and

employment opportunities and placements.  Job creation is

key.   Singapore  would  need  to  find  new  value-added

activities  that are either generated in the  country  or

attracted from abroad.  The many FTAs that have been  put

in  place  since  the last budget debate  will  certainly

help,  and  they  will give much comfort to  Singaporeans

that this Government plans and executes well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the many measures being put in place, there is

no  doubt  that  Singapore would be  well-placed  with  a

significant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



role  in  the  world  and the region.   With  first-class

infrastructure  and  value-added  manpower,  it  is   not

difficult  to  imagine  several  years  from   now   when

Singapore will have a vibrant movie industry, a hotbed of

R&D activities, that it will be an indispensable node  in

the  world of network finance and a key hub through which

tangible  and  intangible services flow  efficiently  and

seamlessly through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as we all know, everything eventually hinges on

confidence.  While we hope to be a linchpin in a thriving

Southeast Asia, it would be too hopeful to think that the

threat of terrorism would subside anytime soon.  While we

yearn  for  a peaceful world, we must not let  our  guard

down.   The  very ingredients of our success  make  us  a

choice target.  The fact that we succeed as a key cog  in

the  world machinery will make us a natural target.   So,

while  we keep a sharp eye on the fiscal position of  the

country,  it is imperative that we invest enough  in  our

homeland   security  in  order  to  deter   anyone   with

intentions  to inflict harm on our citizens and  to  dent

economic confidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear with much comfort the measures we have

undertaken  in  being  the first to  participate  in  the

container  security initiative, a key  node  in  the  so-called Green Lane.  There is also further confidence that

we  read of the gamma ray machines and the focus that are

being  brought  to  bear  at  the  new  Immigration   and

Checkpoints Authority.  However, I believe that it  would

do  us  well  to be doing even more.  We need to  further

reinforce  the  confidence of  our  people  and  external

investors.   We  must stand out from  our  neighbours  as

being  ahead  in the area of security and vigilance.   We

must  be  the  bedrock of stability in this part  of  the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking just beyond our shores, we are beginning to

develop   Bintan  and  Batam  as  part  of  our  economic

hinterland.   They feature in our FTAs.   We  should  now

extend  our  security  measures and  procedures  to  this

extended hinterland as well, so that they become part  of

our  security  eco-system.  With  greater  confidence  in

these two islands, investors would no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



doubt  be more convinced and motivated to plant the  more

labour-intensive factories there, while  using  Singapore

as their logistics and management centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For expatriates, the security of their families is

often paramount.  More so for those who make Singapore as

their  launch pad and spend most of their time travelling

in  the  region.   Peace of mind would  definitely  drive

their  choice of location.  For the investors who  decide

on  the location of their multi-million-dollar plants and

are  reliant  on  these  to  be  sole  suppliers  of  key

components    and   processed   materials,    Singapore's

commitment to homeland security to reduce even the remote

possibility of a catastrophic event would definitely be a

swing factor in their investment decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our people, especially those who have

experienced  the  lack  of civic safety  in  other  major

concentrations of population, we understand too well that

our  safe  environment cannot be taken for  granted.   We

must  draw  upon  all our resources  to  tackle  the  new

terrorist threats.  The issue of social cohesion had been

well debated during the debate on the White Paper on  the

threat of terrorism.  But I wish to add that strengthened

social  cohesion must be supported by reinforced security

infrastructure.  Terrorists, like water, seek the path of

least  resistance.   But  we are already  ahead  in  this

respect.   We  are probably one of the most IT-savvy  and

wired-up   islands  where  pockets  of  good  information

technologies  are  under  the jurisdiction  of  different

agencies  and Ministries.  The next step is to  have  all

these  agencies  connected up,  sharing  information  and

sharing  learning.  The fact that we are a  small  island

makes this task even easier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar analogy is the rationale for the setting

up of the credit bureau in the financial industry.  Prior

to  this, each bank has its own information, but this  is

not  shared.   The sharing of critical information  on  a

common platform now results in a better outcome for  all.

Today,  technology  allows  us  such  sharing  of   data,

information and experience on a broad-based basis on end,

even instantaneously.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as we have strong ministerial overview on

entrepreneurship  and services, I hope we  will  likewise

strongly consider having an overview on homeland security

on a ministerial level.  There must be a strong concerted

and  focused effort by drawing upon all the agencies that

straddle different jurisdictions and a determined  effort

at  wiring  up  and  strengthening  our  island  and  its

infrastructure.     The   mission    requires    resource

coordination, tracking, quick identification and  precise

response, often in very compressed timeframes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security agencies must be given the tools to get

this  job done and done well.  The economic agencies  and

the  security  agencies  would  debate  on  how  much  is

affordable  and  whether it would increase  the  cost  of

doing  business.  But I would contend that  security  and

efforts   to  enhance  personal  security  and   business

continuity  make good business sense for the people,  for

the Government and for the business community.  I believe

that  the people would not want us to be stingy on issues

of security.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

thank  you for allowing me to join in the debate  on  the

Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few years, as we encounter the same

issues  as  other developed economies, we will  face  the

problem  of  the lowly-educated workers who have  limited

skill  sets.   They may become our long-term  unemployed.

We   need   to  think  of  ways  to  help  them,  without

encouraging  them  to just sit back and  collect  welfare

payouts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we think of ways to encourage them to earn at

least  whatever  they can earn?  For example,  additional

help  with  school fees for an extended period  that  our

grassroots and Government agencies might offer  could  be

contingent  on  the  unemployed  head  of  the  household

accepting  at  least a job, even if after accepting  this

job the family would still need some additional financial

help,  eg,  with  education of the children.   Those  who

consistently turn down job matches that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



the  CDC  provides could then be given the least priority

for extended help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to touch on is about

encouraging  an entrepreneurial culture.  Some  of  these

unemployed  would  also be white-collar  workers.   While

individuals  may  feel unsure of becoming  entrepreneurs,

community centres or other agencies could also help  them

to  meet, after the manner of the Social Development Unit

(SDU),  so  that they can network and form syndicates  of

people with complementary skill sets and who could either

then  strike out on their own as a group or seek  venture

capital  to get jobs overseas.  Recently, in the  papers,

there was a group of people who had done just that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the SDU has arguably been successful in

getting  people to meet partners of the opposite sex,  an

organisation, eg, an Entrepreneurial Development  Unit  - to  coin a phrase - could provide opportunities for like-minded  people who happen to be professionals, or  people

who  have  marketing skills, or even people who have  had

technical training from various statutory boards, such as

PSA,  etc, to get started together to talk to each  other

and,  perhaps,  to  listen to motivational  speakers  who

themselves  have started a business, about  opportunities

elsewhere, eg, in neighbouring countries, and  those  who

share  a common vision might start a company in someone's

flat and, who knows, one day, this could be another Apple

or Microsoft.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members might ask on what basis I make these

suggestions.  I have never started a commercial  company,

but   I   have   helped  to  start  up  one  professional

association,  two  NGO  organisations  and  two   service

centres,  both  in Singapore and in the region.   In  all

these  cases,  these projects took off because,  firstly,

there  was  an  opportunity for people to  discuss  these

ideas  socially.   The people who discussed  these  ideas

believed  in  them,  believed  that  they  would  benefit

people, and decided to run with the idea over a period of

time, overcoming obstacles along the way.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kandang Kerbau Hospital in 1998, a small group of

staff   from  different  professional  disciplines   also

brainstormed, developed and patented a small device which

we  still use now for all children in KK Hospital.  I  am

sure   that   Members  of  the  House  here,   who   have

successfully  started  businesses,  would  have   similar

examples in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Singaporeans are as capable and

innovative as anyone else in the world.  We just need  to

dare  to dream, to share our dreams, and believe that  we

can achieve these dreams, if we also dare to fail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to another point - about whether we

would  be  penny wise and pound foolish in  some  of  the

things that we do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the HDB miracle of

affordable   modern  homes  for  most   Singaporeans   be

sustained?   Will  our clean and tidy  neighbourhoods  be

also  clean  and  tidy in five years'  time,  if  we  see

increasing  numbers  of citizens  with  power  and  water

supplies  cut off?  While there may be good  reasons  why

this  has to be done, it could be that these people would

eventually  live  in squalor and lack modern  sanitation,

even  within our modern HDB townships.  How can  we  help

them?   How  can  we  ensure that we will  not  get  many

ghettoes  within  our sparkling city?  Could  we  not  be

innovative and have maybe a small timer switch that would

allow  just enough electricity to run lights between  the

evening  hours  when children need to do  their  homework

and,  perhaps,  in  order to ensure  sanitation,  that  a

thimble  or  some other mechanism might be found  to  let

water  supplies be given at low-flow rates, again in  the

interest of public safety?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that Singapore Power is now a

commercial  entity,  but we should also  consider  public

health  and  decency.  It would not be  helpful  for  our

school  children  to  go  to school  spreading  lice  and

infectious  diseases that used to be  seen  only  in  the

kampungs  of old.  A dishevelled worker, unable to  bathe

for several days,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



would  also  find great difficulty convincing a  would-be

employer to employ him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

strongly  support the increase in tobacco duties.   As  a

doctor, I am convinced that smoking is clearly linked  to

cancer,  heart  disease, blockage of  blood  vessels  and

other   medical  ills.   The  downside  of   smoking   is

tremendous.  The only upside is fiduciary.  And, even so,

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I doubt that the increased  tax

revenue  could exceed the cost of increased medical  care

needs  and  social costs of smoking.  While the loopholes

in the cigarette size and length have been plugged by the

Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, I  still

hear of young people banding together to share a pack  of

cigarettes.   It  is  a difficult  loophole.   But  I  am

confident that the Minister will find a way to plug  this

one  as  well.   Perhaps, there ought to  be  a  COE  for

cigarettes!  The arguments for smokers to bear a  greater

burden  of the true social cost for smoking are  no  less

strong than the arguments for road users!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, support for tax incentives to relocate

foreign  talent.  I strongly support these moves to  make

it more financially attractive to locate talent and skill

in  Singapore,  be  they foreign or  previously  resident

Singaporeans.    Our  property  market,  retail   sector,

entertainment  sector, and even the little  neighbourhood

shops  and  eateries,  are  suffering  from  a  lack   of

clientele.   Singapore needs a certain critical  mass  to

achieve this cosmopolitan buzz, and talented people, with

their generally greater spending power, will make a great

difference  to the local economy.  Can we  also  make  it

easier  for these people to live in and perhaps  own  the

bigger   and  less  affordable  -  at  least  to  current

Singaporeans - HDB flats?  I would also say that allowing

these  people  perhaps lower tax rates may still  benefit

us,  provided that the money is kept in Singapore and not

repatriated back home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the statements by my fellow MPs to ask the

Government  to  consider to continue with rental  rebates

for  JTC  and HDB commercial tenants for a longer period.

However, like Dr John Chen, I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



would  argue that with a situation of soft demand,  where

investors  are weighing carefully the pros  and  cons  of

locating  new  investments, we should  take  an  approach

where  we would adopt fixed rates or lower rentals for  a

longer  period of two or even three years.  Our  emphasis

should  really  be  on  making  the  sale  and  making  a

prospective investor sign on the dotted line.  The effect

of  having predictable fixed costs for rentals cannot  be

under-estimated, given our generally high cost structure.

Again,  the  knock-on effects of a hollowing out  of  our

local  industrial base are tremendous.  Even if factories

will come for the next three years, they may be persuaded

to stay.  If they do not come at all, we will not get the

chance   to  renovate  their  premises,  sell  them   new

computers  and  create jobs for our workers  even  as  we

retool and remake our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I am strongly in support of the

incentives  for  uptake  of  industrial  land  with  long

leaseholds, as has been announced.  I also hope that  the

Government will also make some lands available  at  short

leaseholds  to make it more affordable for businesses  to

set  up  shop  and have a lower entry hurdle,  especially

where  they  think they can make their money  back  in  a

shorter  period  of  time.  For example,  big  electronic

factories have been known to locate and even relocate  in

very,  very short time-frames.  Nevertheless, we  benefit

when  investors do come to set up shop. At least  we  get

the chance to persuade them to stay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  this

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM and Finance Minister announced in his Budget

Statement the five long-term strategies to make Singapore

a  leading global city and immediate measures to help our

economy to recover from the recession.  He cautioned that

there  is  no safe harbour where our ship can shelter  to

rebuild  and refit before heading out to sea.   All  work

must  be  done  on  board ship while we are  sailing  and

battling the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



elements.  As more disheartening economic data from major

economies  like the US, Germany and Japan  were  released

and the acrimonious debate at the UN Security Council  on

Iraq revealed a great political divide, the elements that

our  ship is battling are fast becoming a perfect  storm.

It  does  not  make  our immediate future  prospect  look

optimistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set against this background, the 2003 Budget is a

practical  and  a  reasonable  one.   It  does  not  meet

everyone's  wish  but it gives where  it  is  needed  and

matters  most.   The $900 million deficit is  significant

after  running  a  deficit for the last  two  years.   To

address the concern that not enough has been done to help

the people who are in need as well as to help the economy

to  recover  should the economy worsen, I hope  that  the

Government  will come forward with subsequent  off-Budget

measures quickly if it becomes necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to note that the Government will

continue  to extend help to those of our fellow  citizens

who are most affected by the recession.  They deserve our

support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many in the business community, while disappointed

that  the  much anticipated corporate tax  cut  will  not

materialise  this year are, however, reassured  that  the

Government would likely reduce the current corporate  tax

from  22%  to  20%  for  the  Year  of  Assessment  2005.

However,  I  think  we should avoid the Hongkong  example

where  the  substantial budget deficit of  HK$70  billion

this  year  necessitates  an increase  in  corporate  and

personal  income tax.  Hongkong has announced an increase

of  1.5%  increase  in corporate tax  to  17.5%,  and  an

increase  of 1% in personal income tax to 16% to  support

its budget deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's commitment to continue to help

reduce  business cost, simplify its rules and  procedures

and  cut  red  tape and for the Ministries and  statutory

boards  to avoid crowding out the private sector are  all

necessary measures in the remaking of our economy.  An

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



entrepreneurial and innovative bureaucracy will also help

to  support  our businesses and entrepreneurs.   I  would

like  to suggest that there could also be greater  inter-agency  cooperation  so  that policies  and  measures  of

different  Ministries would be harmonised  and  conflicts

minimised. The business community has long viewed tax  on

foreign  income remitted into Singapore a sacred  cow  as

repeated  recommendations and suggestions  for  exemption

were  rejected. The move to exempt tax on foreign  income

remittance  is,  in  fact,  very  well-received.   It  is

significant   not  just  in  monetary  terms   but   also

symbolically  it  represents a change of  mindset  and  a

paradigm  shift.  It is a pro-business decision  and  one

that the ERC has also recommended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move to exempt domestic interest income to

individuals  derived  from  savings,  current  and  fixed

deposit  accounts is also most welcomed.   Companies  who

up  to  now  keep foreign income offshore and individuals

who  keep deposits out of Singapore for tax reasons  will

now  find no barriers in bringing them back to Singapore.

All  Singaporeans should indeed take heed of the call  to

pull together to tide over this difficult period and move

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Korea, one of the worst hit economies during

the  1997 Asian economic crisis, made an amazing recovery

and remains as one of the world's most resilient economy,

with  some of the world's most admired companies such  as

Samsung and LG.  During the 1997 crisis, South Korea  had

to  be built up by IMF with a loan of US$50 billion.   In

an  amazing recovery story, South Korean economy grew  by

9.3% in the year 2000, 3% in 2001 and 6.2% in 2002.   The

South  Korean people are hardworking. They can  endure  a

lot  of hardships.  They have a 'never say die' attitude.

They tighten their belts to support the Government during

their  crisis.  I can still remember vividly reports  and

images  in  newspapers and television on  news  of  South

Korean  women  queuing up to contribute  their  gold  and

jewellery  to  help  the economy.  I think  such  is  the

spirit  of the South Korean people and such is the spirit

that we must cultivate for our Singaporeans.  This is  an

area we must

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



build  on  -  the  resilience  of  our  economy  and  the

resilience of our people.  I think  Singaporeans can also

make  it. We can be like another South Korea.  And I look

forward  to the difficult voyage ahead with optimism  and

hope.   I  know  as  a country and as a people,  we  will

survive this perfect storm and survive well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion in the name  of

the  Minister  for  Finance. This is an  apt  and  timely

Budget.  For the 1-room to 5-room flat owners, they  will

continue to enjoy the utilities and S&C rebates.  At  the

same time, everyone will benefit from the additional $100

million paid into the Medifund account by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the business community, the Government is

granting  some  tax  rebates  and  extending  the  rental

rebates to help companies reduce their business cost  and

enhance their competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also accepting the Economic Review

Committee's     recommendations  of   the   five   strong

strategies to enable Singapore to remain competitive  and

establish itself as a leading global city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the Government has

done  so much, there are still some people who feel  that

the  Budget  is  not generous enough.  I  can  understand

their  feelings.  It is never easy for any Government  to

please  everybody.   If there is no complaint,  it  means

that  the  Government has done perfectly well, and  there

will  be  no  improvement  and  progress.  That  is   not

necessarily a good thing!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reading the Lianhe Zaobao on 1st March 2003, I

paid  particular attention to the remarks  given  by  the

NCMP  and  the  Opposition MPs.   I  feel  that  in  this

difficult  time, whether you are a Government  MP  or  an

Opposition MP, we should all try not to please the people

with  claptraps,  but  rather  contribute  feasible   and

constructive suggestions on the real issues. Do not  harp

on the same old tune and adopt a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



sentimental  pose.  Do not be carried away  just  because

someone sings some praises to you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore today, the young people are pressurised

in  their studies. They also face the gloomy prospect  of

securing  a rewarding job after graduation.  The  middle-aged  people worry about their job security, and  whether

they  can  continue to draw a regular income to  maintain

their  families.   The  older people  worry  about  their

ability  to  afford the healthcare services  provided  by

the Government, and try not to burden their children with

their  medical cost.  Today, the people's concern is  not

on  the  salaries of the Ministers and the  senior  civil

servants,  but  whether the Ministers  and  senior  civil

servants  can  help them to solve their unemployment  and

healthcare problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a labour MP, I am glad that the Government has

set  aside $500 million to establish a Lifelong  Learning

Fund  to  assist  the  workers  in  their  upgrading  and

training  programmes.   I am also  encouraged  about  the

initiation of $3.7 million for a MOM training  scheme  to

provide  assistance  to  the  unemployed  and  retrenched

Singaporeans,  so  as to equip them  with  the  necessary

skills for re-employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to commend the Government for the

setting up of a Continuing Education and Training  Centre

for adults. However, I hope that the Ministry would scout

around  for the right people with the necessary  know-how

and  experience  to manage the centre  so  that  relevant

training programmes would be rolled out to suit the needs

of  individuals,  and  to equip them  with  the  relevant

skills  for better employability. Any irrelevant training

programme  would  only result in more disappointment  and

frustration of the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, the Government should consider my

fellow  labour  MP,  Mr  Seng Han Thong's  suggestion  of

getting  the workers employed before undergoing training.

This  would  boost  their confidence and  they  would  be

better prepared to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



participate  in  the  training  programmes   to   improve

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey conducted by the National

University  of Singapore, our graduates no longer  expect

high  starting salaries upon graduation. Some 85% of  NUS

graduates  are  prepared  to  participate  in    training

programmes to upgrade their skills so as to improve their

chances  of  being  employed. This is a very  encouraging

sign!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the mature workers would also seize the

opportunity  to   upgrade their skills in  whatever  line

they  are in so as to enhance their employability.   They

should  persevere and be courageous in taking up training

programmes and learn new skills so that they can be self-reliant.   To  make  a good living they  must  depend  on

themselves rather than on others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have asked me why the NTUC has not

opposed the Government's delay in the restoration of  CPF

and  the  gradual  reduction in the CPF  salary  ceiling.

They asked why the NTUC dare not hold a demonstration  in

the  streets.   I told them that even if a  demonstration

succeeds  in  getting the Government to restore  the  CPF

contribution  to 40%, and no lowering of the  CPF  salary

ceiling, it would only succeed in making the headlines of

the   foreign   newspapers  and  our   Secretary-General,

Minister Lim Boon Heng would be hoisted as a hero.   This

would  be very thrilling and awe-inspring, but what  will

be  the  end  result?  The end result would be  that  the

companies,  owing to higher business cost and  a  heavier

burden to carry, will  retrench  more workers, and  there

will be more unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we do not want to have more workers

retrenched,  we  support the Government's action  because

that will ensure that our workers get to keep their jobs,

and  the  employers would be able to survive, to continue

looking for openings to expand their business, and  hence

create more jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, since 1965, the Malaysia media

have been regarding Singapore as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



an  "abnormal baby" abandoned by Tunku Abdul Rahman.   We

can  read  this in their newspapers all the  time.   They

believed  that  Singapore could  not  survive  after  its

separation   from  Malaysia,  and  they  never   expected

Singapore  to  grow  and  prosper.  Apart  from  being  a

politician,  Senior  Minister Lee is also  a  first-class

doctor. Under his careful nurturing, this "abnormal baby"

grew  up  strong  and healthy, it did not  die  an  early

death.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Prime Minister Mahathir is an

astute  statesman.  As a doctor, he knows  that  one  can

survive  without food for three days but no one can  live

for  three days without water. As such, he has been using

the  water  issue  as a lever against Singapore.  But  he

forgets  that  our  Prime Minister Goh  is  also  a  very

brilliant   person.  He  adopted   the   NEWater   as   a

substitution for natural water,  to ensure that we do not

die young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still surviving and we will continue to do

so. Singaporeans should be proud that our leaders are all

very skilful kung fu experts.  They can deal with all the

blows  that have been rained on them.  However, we should

not  be complacent, neither shall we be self-abased  just

because  we are a "little red dot". We want to live  with

dignity  and  self-respect,  but  not  forgetting  to  be

prepared  for danger in times of peace, and  be  vigilant

even in peace time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Taiwanese friend of mine commented to me that the

Singapore  Government  was  like  a  "twenty-four  filial

father"  (a  Taiwanese dialect expression to  the  effect

that  the father takes extreme care and looks after every

detail  of his children's well-being).   Perhaps this  is

why   our  people  are  so  heavily  dependent   on   the

Government.  I think this is food for thought!  We should

all ponder over this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Senior Minister of State for Trade

and  Industry  that  it  is not the  policy  that  drives

Singapore  ahead.   It is everybody,  every  company  and

every individual that drives the country forward.  We are

all  assets  of  Singapore.  We  can  make  contribution.

Everyone of us must work hard.  We must learn how  to  be

self-reliant.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



Singapore is small in land, with a small population.   We

must look after one another, stay united so that together

we   will   be  able  to  help  Singapore  maintain   its

competitive edge.  As the Finance Minister has  said,  we

will then become a leading metropolis in the world.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

it  is  interesting to note that when  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister   delivered  his  Budget  Statement,   we   were

expecting  both  a  response  to  the  ERC  report  which

contains   recommendations  for  the  longer   term   and

Government's  package of measures for  the  immediate  or

short-term challenges.  Some of these ideas may appear to

contradict  one another.  But the themes common  to  both

are  those  of  Singapore's competitiveness and  economic

positioning.   Let  me dwell on three aspects,  with  the

first in greater detail.

<br><br><i>CPF and the Concept of Retirement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has made many recommendations on

restructuring  the Central Provident  Fund  in  order  to

refocus  its  role  back  to  old  age  financing.    The

Government  has decided to defer the restoration  of  the

CPF  contribution  rates for two  years,  lowered  salary

ceilings for contributions and reduced contribution rates

for  older workers, whilst phasing in higher contribution

rates to the Special and Medisave Accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these can be confusing signals, as they serve

different    purposes   -   from   ensuring   Singapore's

competitiveness to providing for old age to checking  any

imprudent allocations to property investment.  I  believe

the  discussion  on  what appropriate structure  our  CPF

scheme  should take is incomplete without addressing  the

fundamental concept of retirement itself, and not  enough

attention is paid to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generations ahead of us never stopped working

and  had no concept of retirement.  They literally worked

till  they  dropped or were prevented from  doing  so  by

illness.    The   present  generation  of   Singaporeans,

however, feel they have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



worked doubly hard, no thanks to the competitive pressure

from    globalisation    and   technological    advances.

Retirement is therefore a given - regarded by some  as  a

necessity, by others as an entitlement and, to many,  the

earlier the better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the reality is, as a nation, we cannot

afford  the pensions and the CPF savings are insufficient

for most people.  With the CPF withdrawal age at 55 and a

life  span of almost 80, we could be facing some  serious

challenges if Singaporeans, who are expecting  to  retire

at  around  60-62,  fail to ensure they  have  sufficient

finances  for  themselves for a good 20-25  years.   This

takes  on  greater urgency when one were to look  at  the

sweeping changes to the concept of employment itself and,

specifically,  to the relationship between  the  employer

and  the  employee.   Let me explain  why  I  think  this

relationship will increasingly be mercenary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the idea of a one-career-in-one's-lifetime

is  no  longer the reality.  Business and product  cycles

are  shorter.  Just look at the speed at which new mobile

phone designs flood the market.  A manufacturer employing

a  few  thousand workers today may be history in a matter

of  2-3 years.  Thus, a person will increasingly have  to

bring his skills across different industries in order  to

remain employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more unlikely is the possibility of one-employer-in-one's-lifetime. This is not peculiar to

Singapore.  It is incumbent on corporations world-wide to

restructure  and  re-position  themselves  to  meet   the

changing demands of a global market place.  Look  at  the

sweeping  changes in the telecommunications arena.   Even

hitherto  old-fashioned businesses, like postal services,

have  extended themselves into a larger supply  chain  of

courier and other distribution services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even Government Ministries have to remake

themselves  on  a  continual basis to serve  the  economy

better.   For  example, the creation of Media Development

Authority  to  deal with the convergence of channels  and

the corporatisation of certain services like HDB Corp.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With employment trends changing in tandem with those

in  the  underlying  economy, gone  are  the  days  of  a

predictable  job pattern and fixed compensation  schemes.

Jobs  are  no longer 9-5, Mondays to Fridays, or confined

to  working within Singapore.  Salaries will increasingly

be linked to performance rather than to seniority or pre-determined  salary structure.  The short business  cycles

mean  that  companies can no longer  carry  fixed  labour

overheads and that they need to be nimble-footed when  it

comes  to  right-sizing.  Therefore, unlike in  the  past

where contract work is associated with temporary or  even

cheap labour, contract work will increasingly be the norm

for many professions.  By extension, Singaporeans can  no

longer expect the income levels to be one predictable and

regular  wave, but a series of steps, both up  and  down,

with   the  occasional  gaps.   Towards  this  end,   the

promotion of portable medical benefits is a step  in  the

right  direction of dealing with multiple  employers  and

the occasional breathers in-between employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this context, the concept of retirement at a

certain  legislated  age is no longer  tenable.   Neither

will  it be helpful to our ageing nation.  Some may argue

that  the solution may be found in raising the retirement

age,  difficult  as it is politically, to  inch  the  bar

upwards.  Sir, I believe we should abandon the concept of

retirement  altogether,  and  the  earlier  the   better.

Singaporeans  should  decide  when  they  want  to   make

transitions between jobs or to slow down at a certain age

or  when  they would like more leisure.  We  should  work

longer,  but  moderate the pace as we go  along  and  not

artificially stop at some pre-determined age.   Moreover,

there  is anecdotal evidence that an abrupt end to active

employment can cause the retiree to lose self-esteem  and

suffer poor health prematurely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to urge the Government to

consider abandoning the whole concept of retirement  even

as we proceed with the various CPF changes.  In addition,

can incentives be provided

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



for  Singaporeans to maintain sufficient finances as they

age,  eg,  such that CPF balances are kept even past  the

withdrawal  age of 55 years?  At the same time,  can  the

Government  inject more resources into  facilitating  the

employment  of  older people on a contract  or  part-time

basis?

<br><br><i>Role of Government in Services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister has elaborated on the

need  for  us to nurture the services sector  as  a  twin

engine  of  growth  to  manufacturing.   But,  many  have

unwittingly  limited  this to the  role  of  the  private

sector  as  the driver, with the Government  playing  the

role  of  a  facilitator or, better still, as a  customer

through  continual outsourcing of non-strategic services.

Sir, I agree that the Government should outsource as much

as  possible.  However, we should not pre-judge the roles

or  limit  our own potential as a collective  whole.   We

need  to  think  out  of  the box, blur  the  demarcation

between  the  public  and  private  sectors  and  do   an

inventory  of our services expertise.  Let me  illustrate

with some examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of our expertise resides within the Government

Ministries.   In education, we have over the years  honed

our  abilities  to  develop sound curricula  and  testing

resources  for schools, established commendable practices

for  managing educational institutions and systematically

nurturing  teaching resources.  Some schools  in  the  US

have   paid  the  compliment  by  using  our  mathematics

textbooks.   Foreign delegations visit  our  schools  for

ideas and to learn more from our experience, and the list

goes on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other examples can be found in our healthcare

services,   town-planning  and  business   infrastructure

building  skills.   But  these are all  deemed  strategic

services  and  thus  far  the respective  Ministries  are

unlikely to have considered their commercial applications

beyond Singapore.  Earlier on, my colleague Mr Khaw  Boon

Wan had explained the concerns over the influx of foreign

patients which may drive up healthcare cost in Singapore.

But I also note that he gave many other examples of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



the  pockets  of expertise that we have, for example,  in

running libraries.  Sir, I am optimistic that we can  add

substantial  economic  vibrancy  through  broadening  the

services  sector.   The challenge  is  therefore  one  of

commercialising such skills and exporting them to markets

where  the stage of development warrants the use of  such

expertise.   I  would  like  to  urge  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister,  in  his  capacity  as  Chairman  of  the   new

Ministerial  Committee on Services, to place emphasis  on

and   explore  the  commercialisation  of  the  expertise

residing within the Ministries.  I am hopeful that  these

can  be nurtured into new services to be exported and can

in  turn  spawn  new business for the private  sector  to

participate in.  Unlike Mr Chiam See Tong, I do think  we

need  to  operate on a caveat emptor principle as opposed

to tight regulation.

<br><br><i>Role of the Public Sector in Economy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is heartening to note that the Government

will devote serious efforts to reviewing rules.  This  is

to  be applauded but perhaps the Government should go one

step further and impose the sunset clause requirement  to

rules  relating to business operations.  A sunset  clause

puts  the  onus  on  the Ministry or statutory  board  to

justify  why a particular rule should be kept, whereas  a

review  is  likely to lead to the retention  of  existing

rules than otherwise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as some of my colleagues have urged, we need to

shift  towards being more pro-business rather  than  pro-risk aversion.  Generally, our policies are sound but our

execution  is  frequently fraught  with  an  overkill  of

measures to stem out the violation of rules.  This, I  am

sure,  is  best described by the now famous  "no  u-turn"

story  about  policy  execution in  Singapore.   Like  Mr

Raymond  Lim, my plea to the public sector is:   when  in

doubt on business issues, please say yes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Singapore's competitiveness, I would

like to propose that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



relevant  Ministries  and statutory  boards  be  assessed

according  to  how well they contain business  and  other

operating  costs  under their watch.   This  goes  beyond

reviewing  fees and charges.  For example, in  compliance

checking  with the financial institution, if  more  hours

are  spent fulfilling this requirement from one  year  to

another,  the spotlight should be shone.  Frequently,  it

is  time costs which are the real hidden costs.  In  this

context,  Ministries should be encouraged  to  pledge   a

certain  standard of service which must be credible,  not

the  usual  3-6  months or 4-6 weeks,  but  one  that  is

reflective of a real intent to provide top notch service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have an excellent public sector which has

served us well.  In meeting the challenges ahead, we need

to  have the same amount of nimble footedness in both the

private and public sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy

for the new fiscal year.

<div align="center"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND INVESTMENT SCHEME</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  (a) if he will provide an update on  the  plans

and  actions  taken  to  date to liberalise  the  Central

Provident Fund (CPF) Investment Scheme; and (b) how  does

the  CPF  Board  intend to market new plans  to  the  CPF

members.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently no plans to further liberalise

the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Investment Scheme, apart

from  implementing the ERC recommendation to  offer  low-cost privately managed pension plans to CPF members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is studying the best practices for pension

plans  in other countries. A consultant was appointed  in

December  2002  to assist in establishing an  appropriate

pension plan structure within the CPF framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of such pension plans is to enable

members  to  have a better chance to obtain higher  long-term  returns  through a well-diversified portfolio.  The

private  pension  plans are meant to  facilitate  regular

investments  over  a long-term horizon,  but  should  not

require  members to make complicated investment decisions

(cost  of participation should be kept low). This  is  to

cater  for  the  majority  of CPF  members  who  are  not

investment-savvy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details on the private pension plan framework will

be  announced  in a few months' time. The Board  is  also

working  out  strategies to educate  members  on  private

pension  plans.  This  will  build  on  existing   public

education  efforts to increase members' understanding  of

the financial market and investment products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would include the admission criteria for

pension  plan  providers  and investment  guidelines  for

pension  plans. The Board has sought public feedback  and

will  also be seeking feedback from the financial service

industry soon.

<div align="center"><b>SKILLS LEVEL OF THE FOREIGN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for

National Development (a) whether the scheme to raise  the

skills  level of the foreign construction workforce  will

similarly  apply  to Singaporeans; and  (b)  how  can  we

ensure  that this sector of the economy will increasingly

attract local participation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the new multi-skill scheme is to

raise the overall skill level of the foreign construction

workforce  and  reduce its reliance on  foreign  workers.

This  does  not  apply  to local workers.   Only  foreign

workers attract the levy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) is

working  towards raising the skills level of Singaporeans

in  the  construction  sector and attracting  more  local

participation  in the sector.  It aims to  transform  the

industry  from a dirty, demanding and dangerous  industry

to  a  professional, productive and progressive industry.

The new measures to upgrade the skills of foreign workers

would  help  in  this  transformation.   There  are  also

opportunities  for Singaporeans to take up higher  value-added   jobs   such  as  professional,  supervisory   and

technical  positions in the industry.  In  addition,  BCA

conducts talks in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



schools to encourage students to consider a career in the

construction  industry and offers scholarships  to  groom

talents.   For  existing local workers, the  Construction

Industry  Training Institute (CITI) and other  institutes

of  higher  learning offer a wide range of  construction-related  training courses to upgrade their skills.   Many

of  such courses are subsidised by the Skills Development

Fund (SDF) and Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP).
