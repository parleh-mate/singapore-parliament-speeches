<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  if  he  will  give his comments  on  the  recent

statements  and accusations made by Malaysian leaders  on

bilateral issues between Singapore and Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani</b> asked the

Minister  for Foreign Affairs if he will give the  status

of  the bilateral negotiations with Malaysia on the water

issue and whether he sees any progress on this issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr R. Ravindran</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  (a)  whether  it  is  true  that  Singapore   is

reluctant  to submit the dispute on Pedra Branca  to  the

International  Court of Justice and  (b)  when  will  the

Special Agreement be signed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  if  he will comment on the Malaysian allegations

that  Singapore  always opposes proposals  from  Malaysia

such  as  the  ASEAN+3 Secretariat  and  the  East  Asian

Economic Caucus (EAEC).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs what is Singapore's position on comments

by  the  Malaysian  Prime Minister  and  other  Malaysian

leaders  that  (i)  Singapore  failed  to  keep   to   an

undertaking  to  let Malaysia continue  to  maintain  its

naval  base facilities in Singapore after the Separation;

and  (ii)  Singapore deliberately increased the rate  for

the  lease  of  those  facilities in  Woodlands,  thereby

forcing Malaysia to vacate them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs, in view of the constant remarks  of  war

by  Malaysian  Ministers, (a) what is the likelihood  and

possibility of Singapore going into a stage of heightened

tension   or   war  with  Malaysia  over  the  unresolved

bilateral   issues  and  (b)  what  can   Singapore   and

Singaporeans do to help reduce the tension.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, several Members have

asked  many  questions  on the  state  of  our  bilateral

relations  with Malaysia - not only Dr Ong  but  also  Mr

Ahmad Khalis, Mr Ravindran, Mr Sin Boon Ann, Ms Irene  Ng

and  also  Mr  Steve Chia, and there was a  Question  for

Written  Answer  by Mr Zainudin.  They  have  also  asked

questions  on  a  number  of  allegations  made   against

Singapore on a wide range of 'old' issues as well as  new

issues, from water, Pedra Branca, the ASEAN+3 Secretariat

to KD Malaya, the former Malaysian naval training base in

Woodlands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These allegations paint Singapore as "insensitive",

"arrogant"  and  "unneighbourly" in the  conduct  of  our

bilateral relations with Malaysia.  We are also  said  to

be "selfish", "profiteering" and "legalistic".  Now, they

even  talk  of  war,  using as a peg a  book  that  spoke

favourably about the SAF.  The author, Tim Huxley,  is  a

British who has no connections with us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These allegations have no basis whatsoever. KD

Malaya was an old issue.  The Malaysians left their naval

training  base in Woodlands on their own accord in  1997.

When we revised the rent in 1991, far from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>



forcing  them  out,  we offered them several  options  to

maintain  their  base  and stay  on  here  in  Woodlands.

However  they chose not to take up the offers and decided

in 1992 to relocate their base to Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Pedra Branca, it is not true that we were

reluctant to sign the Special Agreement (SA) to refer the

matter  to the International Court of Justice (ICJ).   In

fact,  we were the ones who proposed referring the  issue

to  the  International  Court of Justice.   Nor  have  we

carried  out construction activities recently.  The  last

structures were built well over 10 years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, it is untrue that Singapore was the only

ASEAN country which had problems with the proposal for  a

separate  ASEAN+3  Secretariat located in  Kuala  Lumpur.

Indonesia, among others, also did not support it.  And as

for the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) proposal, it  is

completely false that Singapore opposed it.  In fact,  we

were one of the first countries to come out in support of

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I shall circulate fuller details

on these specific issues as an Annex* to my Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this afternoon, I wish to focus on water,

which  is  the core problem underlying all this  endless,

vitriolic  barrage.  I have to state the  facts  on  this

central  issue  to show what is the true  position.   The

water issue is critical to Singapore because it has grave

implications for our survival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In setting out the facts, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I

shall be releasing the correspondence between the leaders

of  both countries and also the diplomatic exchanges.   I

will also circulate copies of the two Water Agreements of

1961  and  1962, plus a supplementary water agreement  in

1990  relating to the building of the Linggiu dam on  the

Johor  River  and  the purchase by Singapore  of  treated

water  in excess of the 250 million gallons per day (mgd)

from this river.  These are all documents for the record.

Mdm Deputy Speaker, I have been reluctant to release

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>



these  documents despite misrepresentation of facts  from

the  other  side  because we have  hoped  for  a  win-win

situation.   But I have to release them now because  this

hope   is  no  longer  realistic  and  because  so   much

misinformation  on the water issue has been  put  out  by

Malaysia   that  needs  to  be  rebutted  by   conclusive

evidence.   Despite repeated attempts to  clear  the  air

through   various  statements  from  my   Ministry,   MFA

Spokesman's   statements   as   well   as   Parliamentary

statements  that  I  have made in this  House,  Malaysian

misrepresentations have not ceased.  Recently, there have

even  been  loose talk of war in some Malaysian  circles.

We  therefore  have  no  choice but  to  set  the  record

straight by releasing these documents for people to judge

for  themselves the truth of the matter.  These documents

will  clear the air for everyone, especially Singaporeans

who  travel  to Malaysia, read their media  and  talk  to

their Malaysian friends. These documents

are in two volumes which will be given to Members later.

Mdm  Deputy Speaker, I request that they be part  of  the

official  records  of  the  House.   I  would   also   be

circulating the text of my statement later.  The text  of

my   statement  will  contain  cross-references  to   the

documents as well as the various correspondences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, my statement has three parts.

First, it is to make clear that the fundamental issue for

us  is not the price of water as such. The vital issue is

not  how  much  we  pay, but how any  price  revision  is

decided  upon.  Malaysia wants Singapore to pay more  for

water.   But the price cannot be revised at the  will  or

dictate  of Malaysia.  The 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements

were  enshrined  in  the Separation Agreement  which  was

registered  at the United Nations.  They are  fundamental

to  our very existence as an independent nation.  Neither

Singapore  nor  Malaysia  can unilaterally  change  them.

This is the root of the dispute between us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the negotiations on the package of issues,

both  sides  asked  for and offered various  concessions.

Singapore agreed to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>



pay  more  for  existing water, but only  as  part  of  a

package  deal that included the future supply  of  water.

Malaysia  agreed to settle several outstanding  bilateral

issues as a package.  The documents will demonstrate this

clearly.    However,  in  October  last  year,   Malaysia

unilaterally decided to take the water price revision out

of the package, to be discussed and decided on its own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I will give a full chronology of the talks

on  water.   This  will  show  that  Singapore  has  been

consistent  and  forthcoming in  the  negotiations.   The

difficulties  arose  because Malaysia repeatedly  changed

its  position, and shifted their goal posts each time  we

neared an agreement.  No sooner had we agreed on a  price

for  water  when they changed their minds and  upped  the

price.   After  the two countries had discussed  all  the

issues  as  one  package for several years at  Malaysia's

request,  Malaysia unilaterally and without prior  notice

abandoned  the  package approach, saying that  they  only

wanted to discuss the current price of water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite all these sudden twists and turns, we

accommodated and persevered, never closing  the  door  on

negotiations,  in  order to reach a  mutually  beneficial

agreement.   The  Malaysian allegations  against  us  are

totally  unjustified  when we  were  trying  to  find  an

amicable way forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of my statement is that I want to

stress  that it is in the overwhelming interest  of  both

countries  to  settle our differences in accordance  with

international law, either through the International Court

of  Justice  (ICJ) or the Permanent Court of  Arbitration

(PCA), or in the case of the water price revision through

the   method   provided  for  in  the  Water   Agreements

themselves, namely, arbitration according to the laws  of

Johor.  This process of arbitration can determine what we

have  not been able to agree on, namely, whether Malaysia

has  the right to revise the price after a lapse of 16-17

years and, if so, by how much the revision should be.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Sanctity  of  the  Water Agreements  and  the  Separation

Agreements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with the first part. Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  some  Singaporeans and foreign  observers  have

asked  why is it that the two Governments are quarrelling

over  what  appears to be a relatively small  and  simple

issue  over the price of water.  Why cannot Singapore  be

more accommodating, more reasonable and pay a little more

for  the  sake  of  neighbourliness  and  good  bilateral

relations?  If only the matter were that straightforward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear. It is not just a matter of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue goes beyond whether we have to pay 45 sen

or  60  sen  or  stick  to  3 sen.   Of  course,  we,  in

Singapore,  are  not  going  to  be  impoverished  by  an

increase  from  3  to 45 sen.  Neither will  Malaysia  be

enriched.   In fact, Prime Minister Mahathir himself  has

said,  and  I quote: "We don't depend on them (Singapore)

to  bring us revenue to finance the government as  income

from  selling water is a small fraction (of our revenue).

It's  not  a  major source of income for the government."

(Bernama, 6th August 2002).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of the water price, for both

countries, is Singapore's existence as a sovereign nation

separate  from  Malaysia, and the sanctity  of  the  most

solemn   agreements  that  we  have  entered  into   with

Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Water Agreements are no ordinary agreements.

They are so vital that they were confirmed and guaranteed

by  both  Governments  in the 1965 Separation  Agreement,

also  known  as the Independence of Singapore  Agreement.

The  Separation Agreement was registered  at  the  United

Nations.  Both countries have to honour the terms of  the

agreements and the guarantee in the Separation Agreement.

Any  breach  of  the  Water  Agreements  must  call  into

question  the Separation Agreement and can undermine  our

very existence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, not many people know that

Malaysia also gave effect to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>



the Separation Agreement by an amendment to the Malaysian

Constitution  on 9th August 1965 through an  Act  of  the

Malaysian Parliament, Act 53 of 1965.  Section 14  reads,

and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of Singapore shall guarantee that

the  Public  Utilities Board of Singapore  shall  on  and

after Singapore Day abide by the terms and conditions  of

the  two Water Agreements dated 1st September, 1961,  and

29th  September,  1962,  entered into  between  the  City

Council  of Singapore and the Government of the State  of

Johore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of Malaysia shall guarantee that the

Government  of  the  State of Johore will  on  and  after

Singapore  Day also abide by the terms and conditions  of

the said two Water Agreements.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the guarantees are an integral part

of  an  international  agreement solemnly  entered  into,

adopted  by  a  constitutional amendment in Malaysia  and

later   registered   with   the   United   Nations.    In

international  law,  both parties must  ensure  that  the

Water  Agreements  are  observed  and  neither  side  can

unilaterally   vary  their  terms  and  conditions.    If

Malaysia  can unilaterally revise the price of raw  water

from  3 sen to 60 sen, and then from 60 sen to RM 3, then

they  can eventually fix it at RM 8, which they  said  is

the price since that is what Hong Kong pays to China,  or

to  any  other  price.  The sanctity  of  the  Separation

Agreement would have been breached.  All other agreements

we  have  signed  with Malaysia will become  meaningless.

Nor  will any new agreement we conclude with Malaysia  be

worth anything.  In such a world, there would be no basis

for   international  relations.   There   would   be   no

foundation  for international law, which all  UN  members

have a duty to uphold, in order to maintain a stable  and

peaceful international order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has actually acknowledged the importance of

the Water Agreements for a long time.  For example, three

years  after our independence in 1968 at a very important

conference of plenipotentiaries, the UN Conference on the

Law  of Treaties, mind you, the Conference was on the Law

of   Treaties,  the  Malaysian  representative  to   that

Conference, Mr M. O. Ariff said, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some treaties might be so fundamental to the very

existence  of  States  that  they  simply  could  not  be

dispensed with, whatever political differences might

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

arise.   For  example, the new island State of  Singapore

was  dependent  on  Malaysia for its  water  supply;  the

treaty  under  which  Malaysia had to  supply  a  certain

quantity  of  water  daily  to  Singapore  could  not  be

terminated  or suspended between the two states  for  any

political reason.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in early 2002, Prime Minister Mahathir

began  to  criticise  the water agreements  as  allegedly

unequal  treaties  foisted on Malaysia  by  the  British.

Prime  Minister  Mahathir said that the price  for  water

under  the  agreements  was too  low  and  that  as  such

"practically, they (Singapore) get their water free".  He

also  said that "also, the agreement was drawn up by  the

British  which of course favoured Singapore."  Later,  he

said  "what we know is that we have been charging them  3

sen  per  thousand gallons of raw water and we also  know

that  countries like Hong Kong buy their raw  water  from

mainland  China  at  RM 8 per thousand  gallons".   Other

Malaysian leaders took up the refrain and stoked a frenzy

of  media  criticism  against  Singapore.   For  example,

Menteri  Besar  of Johor Ghani said "all this  while,  we

have been supplying Singapore with free water..."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deliberate raising of Malaysian ground

sentiments seriously alarmed Singapore.  It could  easily

have   spiralled  out  of  control  and  led   to   grave

consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on 5th February last year, we sent

Malaysia  a diplomatic note, Third Person Note  (TPN)  in

which we pointed out that "pending a binding agreement on

the  overall package of issues, all legal obligations  of

the existing Water Agreements and the Points of Agreement

(POA)   remain   in  force  and  are  binding   on   both

Governments".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reminded them that the Water Agreements are

binding  legal arrangements duly confirmed and guaranteed

by  the  Governments  of Malaysia and  Singapore  in  the

Separation Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said that the Separation Agreement "is the

fundamental   basis  of  Singapore's  existence   as   an

independent sovereign nation" and that "any variation  of

the Water Agreements without the consent of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>



both  Governments  will  be a breach  of  the  Separation

Agreement and that cannot be accepted".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also pointed out that "further negotiations on

new  agreements  pertaining to the long  term  supply  of

water to Singapore can only proceed on the basis that the

agreements  already concluded cannot be  altered  without

the  explicit  consent of both parties.   And  we  added,

otherwise  any new agreements on water can  similarly  be

altered   without   consent.   This   will   have   grave

implications for bilateral relations."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th March 2002, the Malaysian Government replied

to  Singapore's demarche.  Malaysia's TPN  conveyed  "its

commitment to resolving the issue of water with Singapore

in  the context of an agreement on the overall package of

issues",  and  they also said, "at no time  was  there  a

suggestion  that the Government of Malaysia would  depart

from  such  a commitment."  They said that any suggestion

to  the  contrary is "misleading and constitutes a  gross

misinterpretation  of  the well  known  position  of  the

Malaysia Government."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We replied through another TPN on 25th March 2002

taking  note of their commitment and assurances.  And  we

also reiterated our own commitment to reaching a mutually

beneficial   agreement  on  the  package  of  outstanding

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Minister Syed Hamid himself noted at the

First  Ministerial Meeting at Putrajaya on 1st July 2002,

and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Malaysia has repeatedly said that it will honour

the  1961 and 1962 Agreements until their expiry in  2011

and 2061 respectively..'



He added:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. During the Separation of Singapore, Malaysia did

not  propose  for  the Agreements  to  be  reviewed.   It

continues to honour the Agreements and such commitment is

further  reinforced when Malaysia signed  the  Separation

Agreement in 1965.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were thus flabbergasted when their Minister in

the  Prime  Minister's  Department  Rais  Yatim  publicly

declared   on  24th  October  2002,  that  as  Malaysia's

solution,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia  could enact domestic legislation to render  the

Water Agreements null and void.  But as I had said at our

sitting  on 31st October 2002, no country can  evade  its

international treaty obligations by enacting  a  domestic

law.   This  is  a  very  well established  principle  of

international law.  Should any country choose to  violate

that principle, it would signal to the world that it  can

and   will   do  likewise  for  any  other  international

agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also add that contrary to what Malaysia has

alleged, these Water Agreements of 1961 and 1962 were not

fixed  by  the  British  in  Singapore's  favour.   These

Agreements were signed by the Johore State Government and

the Singapore City Council in 1961 and 1962 respectively.

By   then,  Malaysia  was  already  an  independent   and

sovereign  nation,  and  Singapore  had  achieved   self-government.   It  is really absurd to  suggest  that  the

Federal Government of an independent and sovereign nation

Malaysia  would allow the Johore State Government  to  be

manipulated by the British to sign an agreement that  was

against Malaysia's national interests.

<br><br><i>Chronology of the Package and Water Agreements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me address the allegations that Singapore

has been the unreasonable party in the negotiations.   To

do  so,  I will have to recount to Members in some detail

how the matters unfolded over the last few years.  A full

chronology is set out in the bundle of documents, but let

me take you through the major milestones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Malaysia experienced problems in the Asian

Financial  crisis  in  1997-98,  at  Malaysia's  request,

Singapore began to discuss a financial assistance package

for  Malaysia  in  the context of a framework  for  wider

cooperation.  The framework included the supply of  water

to  Singapore  after  the expiry  of  the  current  Water

Agreements.   Singapore's assistance entailed significant

market   risks   and  potential  financial   losses   for

Singapore.  This framework would make it politically

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>



possible  for  Singapore to carry these financial  risks.

The  price  review  of  water  under  the  current  Water

Agreements  was  never  raised  by  then  Prime  Minister

Mahathir and was not part of that framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the ASEAN Summit in Hanoi in December 1998, Prime

Minister  Mahathir  informed  Prime  Minister  Goh   that

Malaysia  no  longer  needed  financial  assistance  from

Singapore.   Prime  Minister Mahathir proposed  that  the

outstanding  bilateral issues be resolved together  as  a

package.   In  the  interest of  clearing  the  decks  of

bilateral issues, Prime Minister Goh agreed to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the items in the final package as from

August 2000?  The key items in the package were:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;future supply of water for 100 years after 2061;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use of Malaysian airspace by RSAF;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variation in the terms of the POA, including giving

an  additional 12 parcels of KTM or Malayan Railway  land

at Bukit Timah for joint development;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;early withdrawal of CPF monies amounting to some RM

3 billion by West Malaysians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And later, as I will elaborate, two more items were

added to the package by Prime Minister Mahathir, namely:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Malaysian proposal to replace the Causeway with

a bridge; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revision of the current water price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting between Prime Minister Goh and Prime

Minister  Mahathir in Hanoi was followed by three  rounds

of  negotiations  on the package at the officials'  level

from March to May 1999 where not much progress was made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2000, with Prime Minister Goh's approval,

Senior  Minister Lee visited Kuala Lumpur to try to  make

progress on the package .  He worked through then Finance

Minister  Tun  Daim Zainuddin.  After first  meeting  Tun

Daim,  Senior Minister had a four-eye meeting with  Prime

Minister  Mahathir on 15th August 2000.   Prime  Minister

Mahathir

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>



brought  into  the package two new issues: the  price  of

current water, and the replacement of the Causeway with a

new   bridge.   Senior  Minister  Lee  agreed  to   these

inclusions.  The two leaders reached agreement on a  list

of  items, including a new price of raw water for 45  sen

per  1,000  gallons  for both current and  future  water.

This was the first time that the current water agreements

featured in the bilateral package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following that meeting, Senior Minister Lee wrote to

Tun Daim on 24th August 2000 to confirm the list of items

which he and Prime Minister Mahathir had agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st February 2001, Prime Minister Mahathir

replied  to Senior Minister Lee in which he said, "Johore

believes  that a fair price would be 60 cents  (sic)  per

mgd  (sic)  of  raw water" and this "should  be  reviewed

every  five  years".  Mgd is million gallons  a  day.   I

think  there was a typographical error.  I think what  he

meant was "60 sen per thousand gallons".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd April 2001, Senior Minister Lee replied to

Prime  Minister  Mahathir pointing out that  this  was  a

variation  from their oral understanding of  15th  August

2000 which was 45 sen for current and future water.   And

now  Prime Minister Mahathir was proposing a higher price

of 60 sen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2001, Senior Minister Lee made a second

visit  to  KL to try to close the gaps on the package  of

issues.   After  their  meeting on  4th  September  2001,

Senior  Minister Lee and Prime Minister Mahathir  held  a

joint  press conference to announce that they had  agreed

on  a  basic  skeleton of an agreement on the package  of

bilateral  issues.  Senior Minister Lee  told  the  media

there, in Putrajaya, that Singapore had offered to pay 45

sen  for  raw  water  supplied under  the  current  Water

Agreements,  although we were not legally obliged  to  do

so.   He explained that this offer was made in return for

assured  water supply from Malaysia, beyond 2061,  at  60

sen per 1,000 gallons for raw water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st September 2001, Senior Minister Lee wrote to

Prime Minister

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>



Mahathir confirming and elaborating on this offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say here that the Malaysians have argued that

since  Senior Minister Lee had offered 45 sen for current

water,  it  showed that Singapore had, in fact,  accepted

that  Malaysia  had the right to review.  Prime  Minister

Mahathir  said, "If we don't have the legal  right,  then

why  did Lee Kuan Yew come and see me and suggested  that

the  water price should be revised upwards to 45 sen  and

then  we said it should be 60 (sen), 15 sen more?"   But,

Mdm  Deputy Speaker, it is clear from the documents  that

when  Senior  Minister Lee offered  45  sen  for  current

water,  it was "in return for assured water supply beyond

2061"  at  60 sen.  Senior Minister Lee never  said  that

Malaysia  had  the  right to review the  price  of  water

outside the package, which included water beyond 2061  as

well as airspace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picking up the chronology again, between 18th

October  and  10th  December  2001,  there  were  further

exchanges  of  letters between Senior  Minister  Lee  and

Prime Minister Mahathir to clarify various details of the

bilateral package, including the price of water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4th March 2002, Prime Minister Mahathir wrote to

Senior   Minister   Lee   enclosing   totally   different

proposals.   This  was  after Prime  Minister  Mahathir's

statements to the press about RM8 being the real price of

water.  Under Malaysia's new proposal, the 60 sen  price,

which  he  had  earlier agreed, would now apply  for  the

first  five  years from 2002 to 2007, and  from  2007  to

2011, the price will be RM3 per 1,000 gallons.  And  from

2011  until  the  expiry of the 1962 Water  Agreement  in

2061,  the price of water would be revised annually  from

RM3, based on the average inflation rate of Malaysia  and

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about future supply of water after 2061?

In that letter, Malaysia proposed that negotiations begin

only in 2058; in other words, just three years before the

expiry  of  the  1962 Agreement.  Malaysia also  proposed

that the new water agreement would be valid for 100 years

from 2002.  In effect, this would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>



mean  that the new agreement would only last for 40 years

after the expiry of the 1962 Water Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Senior Minister Lee replied on 11th March 2002

that  this  had  completely changed from  what  they  had

discussed  before  and  in their subsequent  exchange  of

notes and letters.  He said that Singapore would have  to

study the implications of Malaysia's new offers and would

respond in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th April 2002, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong

wrote  to  Prime  Minister Mahathir to  give  Singapore's

response to Prime Minister Mahathir's letter of 4th March

2002.   Prime Minister Goh stressed that he did not  want

bilateral relations to be always strained by the issue of

water.   Hence, for the sake of good long-term relations,

he  said that Singapore would produce as much water as it

could   to  supplement  the  existing  Water  Agreements.

Singapore would ramp up our NEWater programme to  replace

the  supply of water under the 1961 Water Agreement  when

it expires in 2011.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for water after 2061, Prime Minister Goh accepted

Malaysia's offer of 100 mgd of raw water and 150  mgd  of

treated  water.  On price, as Malaysia had withdrawn  its

offer of 60 sen for current water and future water, Prime

Minister Goh proposed to peg the price of future water to

an  agreed  percentage  of the cost  of  the  alternative

source  of water, ie, NEWater.  Why?  This was to provide

a  definite  basis  for  future price  revisions.   Prime

Minister  Goh reminded Prime Minister Mahathir that  this

agreement should be valid for 100 years from 2061 as this

had  been  the basis for negotiations, and not 100  years

from 2002.  Prime Minister Goh did not offer revision  of

the current water price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Prime Minister Mahathir's letter of 4th March

2002  and  Prime Minister Goh's reply of 11th April  2002

then formed the basis for further discussions between the

respective Foreign Ministers and officials on the package

of  issues.  Two Ministerial Meetings were held, as  hon.

Members

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>



know, the first in Putrajaya in July 2002, and the second

in Singapore in September 2002.  I updated Members on the

outcome of these two meetings on 23rd July 2002 and  31st

October  2002  respectively,  and  the  Senior  Officials

Meeting  in  Johor  Baru from 16-17th October  2002.   In

short, really, there was no progress on the key issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, Malaysia came out with another

new  formula under which the price of raw water  in  2002

would be RM6.25 per 1,000 gallons.  They did this at  the

Ministerial  talks,  and they did not  explain  how  this

price  could  be  justified under the provisions  of  the

water agreements.   They also insisted that they had  the

right  to review the price of current water, when we  had

pointed  out  that they had lost their right  of  review.

They also said that they would not negotiate the terms of

future water supply until 2059 - now it is 2059 - ie, two

years  before  the  expiry of the 1962  Water  Agreement,

instead  of the three years before the expiry,  as  Prime

Minister Mahathir had proposed earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Second Ministerial Meeting, as I had told

the  House,  when Prime Minister Goh met  Prime  Minister

Mahathir in Putrajaya on 8th October 2002, Prime Minister

Mahathir said that Malaysia wanted to "decouple the water

issue"  from  the  other  items in  the  package.   Prime

Minister  Goh  responded at that  meeting  that  all  the

issues were tied together.  If the water issue was  taken

out  of the package, Singapore would have less leeway  to

make concessions on the other issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would recall the many statements in the

Malaysian  media  and  from  Malaysian  politicians  that

misrepresented  what transpired at that  meeting  between

Prime  Minister  Goh  and Prime Minister  Mahathir.   The

Malaysians  alleged that Singapore had agreed  to  delink

water  from  the  package  and  had  accepted  Malaysia's

prerogative to review the price of current water.   Those

statements  distorted what was discussed at  the  meeting

and, in fact, impugned Prime Minister Goh's integrity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days after his meeting with Prime Minister

Mahathir, Prime Minister Goh

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>



received a letter from Prime Minister Mahathir dated  7th

October 2002, ie, one day before their meeting.   In  his

letter,  Prime Minister Mahathir informed Prime  Minister

Goh that Malaysia had decided to "discontinue the package

approach and give the highest priority to first resolving

the  water  issue, particularly the price review  of  raw

water".   In other words, even before Prime Minister  Goh

had  met  Prime Minister Mahathir, Malaysia  had  already

unilaterally discontinued the package approach, which had

been agreed to by both Prime Ministers, and reaffirmed in

Malaysia's  TPN of 14th March 2002.  Hon.  Members  would

remember  that I had quoted the TPN, that they said  that

it   is  outrageous  that  you  should  even  make   that

suggestion  that we would do anything other than  proceed

in accordance with the package approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th October 2002, Prime Minister Goh replied to

Prime Minister Mahathir, reminding him that they had both

agreed on the package approach in December 1998 and  that

was  why Singapore had been prepared to make concessions.

But now that Malaysia wanted to deal with the water issue

separately  and discontinue the package approach,  trade-offs  against other issues in the package were no  longer

possible.  Henceforth, Singapore would have to deal  with

water  and  the other issues on their stand-alone  merits

and no longer as a package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, the Singapore officials attended the

meeting in Johor Baru to discuss the water issue from 16-17th  October 2002.   At that meeting, it was clear  that

Malaysia  had no intention of striking a deal  on  future

water.   This  left only the current water price  on  the

agenda.  Now we could no longer trade off a current water

price  revision  against  the  supply  of  future  water.

Therefore,  we have no choice but to rely on the  express

provisions  of  the  Water  Agreements,  and   that   any

variations  must be in accordance with the terms  of  the

Water Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, from this chronology of events,

Members  can see how Malaysia has repeatedly changed  its

position,  not only on the water issue, but also  on  the

entire package negotiations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, having agreed to 45 sen for current and

future water in 2000, they then raised their demand to 60

sen.   When  we counter-offered 45 sen for current  water

and  60  sen  for future water, they raised their  demand

further  -  an immediate increase to 60 sen  for  current

water  and then RM3 from 2007.  And, later, they came  up

with  the  figure of RM6.25 for current  water.   As  you

know,   Prime  Minister  Mahathir  recently  acknowledged

publicly  that he had proposed 60 sen to Senior  Minister

Lee,  but  he  said  that he had been  later  advised  by

Malaysian officials that the price was too low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the starting point for the negotiations

since  1998 had been the supply of water for another  100

years  after  2061.   But in March 2002,  the  Malaysians

reduced  this  to 40 years, and only at a formula  to  be

negotiated  in  2058  and to supply treated  water  at  a

formula  to  be negotiated every 20 years.  On  2nd  July

2002,  Malaysia again agreed to 100 years but now with  a

price  formula  based  on rates benchmarked  against  the

China-Hong  Kong model (or RM8) and other  models.   And,

finally,  on  2nd  September  2002,  Malaysia  said  that

negotiations on future water can only take place in 2059.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Malaysians committed themselves to

resolving the issues as a package from December  1998  to

September  2002.  However, Prime Minister Mahathir  later

unilaterally took water price revision out of the package

by  his  letter  of 7th October, without informing  Prime

Minister  Goh when they met on 8th October  that  he  had

written to Prime Minister Goh the day before to have  the

water issue dealt with separately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By taking current water out of the package, the

Malaysians wanted to get this price revision without  any

commitment to give future water supply in exchange.  They

have  changed  the  package deal Prime Minister  Mahathir

first  offered  to Senior Minister Lee in  KL  in  August

2000,  and  then  followed up  in  a  letter  dated  21st

February  2001,  where  he named 60  sen  as  what  Johor

considered a "fair price".  But the Malaysians  know,  as

they have repeatedly acknowledged, they could not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>



under international law unilaterally revise the price  or

other provisions of the Water Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, on our part, we have tried our

best  to accommodate Malaysia's successive new positions.

Even   though  Malaysia  had  repeatedly  shifted   their

goalposts,   Singapore   has   not   walked   away   from

negotiations.   In  fact,  we  attended  the  Johor  Baru

meeting in October 2002 in good faith just six days after

the  Malaysians had unilaterally discontinued the package

approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should also note, I think, that four out of

the  six items in the package - current water price,  POA

variation, CPF and the bridge - were to benefit Malaysia.

Singapore was not legally obliged to pay more for current

water,  we are not obliged legally to vary the Points  of

Agreement,  or  to  make  special arrangements  for  West

Malaysians  to  withdraw their CPF monies early.  And  we

also  had no interest in demolishing the Causeway and  to

build  a  bridge  in  its place.  Singapore's  overriding

interest  in  the  package was  future  water.   We  were

prepared  to  agree to the items which  Malaysia  wanted,

including  a  current  water  price  revision,  only   in

exchange  for Malaysia agreeing to provide us a long-term

supply of water beyond 2061, and RSAF access to Malaysian

airspace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say that these concessions to Malaysia

would have been at a considerable cost to us.  They  have

to  be  seen  in the context of the overall package  deal

being  negotiated and, as we have said before, in an  MFA

statement  on  2nd February 2002, "the  total  amount  of

money that Malaysia will receive when other items in  the

package   are  factored  in  will  be  over  1.5  billion

ringgit."   This did not include the cost of  over  S$500

million, cost to us, for building our half of the  bridge

and  a  new  Customs,  Immigration and  Quarantine  (CIQ)

complex.   But,  we  thought  that  all  these  would  be

justified if we could secure future water.  This was  why

when   Prime  Minister  Mahathir  proposed  the   package

approach in 1998, Prime Minister Goh agreed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tried to meet their demands as long as future

water  supply  was  on offer as the  quid  pro  quo.   As

negotiations went on, we became aware that they  did  not

want to sign an agreement on future water supplies.   All

they  promised at the final meeting in Johor Baru was  to

discuss  the  matter in 2059, two years before  the  1962

Water Agreement ends.  Members will understand why I  say

that  this  has  pushed  us to  prepare  for  a  negative

outcome,  one that requires us to develop our  capability

for  NEWater and desalination.  These are no light  tasks

for us to undertake.  We will need many years to build up

the  know-how,  keep abreast with technological  advances

and,  just  as important, we must prepare psychologically

our people for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having unfolded the story of how the negotiations

went,  and  I  hope  Members will  be  able  to  see  how

reasonable Singapore has been, now let me reflect on  the

way forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding our efforts to reach an agreement,

we  clearly  find ourselves at an impasse.   So,  Members

naturally may ask, what next?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Mahathir and Foreign Minister Syed

Hamid  had  spoken  about referring the  water  issue  to

international  arbitration  by  the  Permanent  Court  of

Arbitration (PCA).  On 28th December 2002, when our media

asked  me about this, I said it was a great pity that  we

have not been able to reach agreement on the package, but

Singapore,  obviously, could not force  Malaysia  to  the

negotiating table if it chooses not to do so.   Hence,  I

said  that if Malaysia proposes to submit the water issue

to PCA arbitration, Singapore would have to agree, albeit

reluctantly, in the interest of overcoming the impasse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my surprise, their Berita Harian (30th December

2002)  reported Foreign Minister Syed Hamid as responding

that  the option of referring the water issue to PCA  for

arbitration did not arise, although they were  quoted  as

suggesting this in the first place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if Malaysia does not wish to send the matter

for arbitration to the PCA, a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>



world   organisation   which   is   renowned   for    its

impartiality, then what is the next best solution?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to have recourse to arbitration in accordance

with  the  provisions  of  the  Water  Agreements.    The

provisions  in  Clauses 21 and 19 of the  1961  and  1962

Water  Agreements respectively provide for the settlement

of   disputes   arising  under  the  Agreements.    Those

provisions  stipulate  that  where  disputes  cannot   be

resolved, the matter shall be referred to arbitration "in

accordance  with  and subject to the  provisions  of  the

arbitration  law at the time of such dispute existing  in

the State of Johore".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Johor State

Secretary  had sent letters to the PUB dated 14th  August

2002  seeking to give Notice of price review under Clause

17  and  Clause 14 of the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements,

respectively.   As  Singapore's  position  was  that   as

Malaysia had lost the right of review, the PUB replied on

9th  October 2002 that it did not accept that  the  Johor

State  Government was still entitled to serve  notice  to

seek  a  review of the charge of raw water under the  two

Water Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I may interject here, on this business of

the  price  review of current water, Members will  recall

that  I told the House on the 31st October sitting,  that

the  Malaysian leaders had publicly said that it was  not

an  oversight or mistake that Malaysia did not review the

price  of  current  water  in  1986/87,  but  it  was   a

deliberate  move.   Dr  Mahathir said  Malaysia  did  not

revise  the  water pricing when it was due  because  they

thought  Singapore would also revise the price of treated

water  supplied  to  Malaysia.   (Bernama,  11th  October

2002).   Johor  State Assembly Speaker Zainalabidin  Mohd

Zain  also said that the Johor Government had not made  a

mistake  in  not pressing for a review in 1986  and  said

"there  was  no  point  in doing  so  because  Johor  was

dependent on Singapore for its treated water supply,  and

Singapore would have also increased its price of  treated

water sold to Johor" (New Straits Times, 3rd July 2002).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Second Ministerial Meeting in September 2002

in  Singapore,  Foreign Minister Syed Hamid  pointed  out

that  the Notice of price review which Johor had sent  to

PUB "made references to Clauses 17 and 14 of the 1961 and

<br><br>1962&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water  Agreements  respectively  as  well  as   to

arbitration  in  the event that both  countries  fail  to

reach  agreement."  These Clauses 17 and  14,  the  price

review clauses, provide that "in the event of any dispute

or  differences  arising  under the  provisions  of  this

clause  the  same  shall be referred  to  arbitration  as

hereinafter provided."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Malaysia, through these formal

notices,  has  effectively taken steps towards  referring

its water dispute with Singapore to arbitration.  At that

time,  we  were  reluctant to go along  this  arbitration

route  because  we  still hoped for  an  agreement  on  a

package deal including future water.  However, now it has

become  clear  that  we cannot expect renewal  of  future

water  supply.   As  this removes the basis  for  further

negotiations,  we are ready to have the dispute  resolved

through arbitration according to the laws of Johor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question as to whether there is still a right of

review, as well as the quantum of the price revision, can

both  be  resolved through the legal process as  provided

for in the two Water Agreements?  In other words, this is

the  way that we are also resolving Malaysia's claim over

Pedra  Branca.  If, in fact, Johor has not lost the right

of  revision  by not exercising it in 1986/87,  then  the

arbitrator  tribunal's award on the price  revision  will

take  effect from the date when Johor gave its Notice  to

PUB  as  provided for in the two Agreements.  As Malaysia

has commenced this process, then I say, let the matter be

settled through arbitration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, indeed, I want to stress that

peaceful  and  amicable settlement of disputes  has  been

Singapore's  consistent approach.  For the  Pedra  Branca

issue, we had proposed, and they have agreed, to refer it

to the ICJ.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am as concerned as Mr Steve Chia about the loose

talk by the Malaysian

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>



leaders  in  the  Malaysia media  about  "war".   Bernama

reported  Foreign  Minister Syed Hamid on  31st  December

2002,  saying, "Singapore has two choices.  If it refuses

to  compromise ... go to war".  In his New Year  message,

Prime  Minister Mahathir said "we promise that if  anyone

violates  our  freedom, they will get what  they  call  a

`bloody  nose'"  (New Straits Times, 1st  January  2003).

Asked  by  reporters  the following day,  Prime  Minister

Mahathir  did not specify which country he was  referring

to,  but neither did he categorically rule out Singapore.

This  further encouraged the Malaysian media to  play  up

Singapore's alleged forward defence strategy and link  it

to   Singapore's  "arrogance"  in  the  conduct  of   its

bilateral  relations  with  Malaysia.  This  was  quickly

followed by remarks by various Malaysian leaders publicly

emphasising   their   military  capability,   the   MAF's

capability, in defending Malaysia from external  threats.

For  instance, Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak said that

the  MAF  had experience fighting in a real war and  that

sophisticated weaponry systems were not the yardstick  to

measure  whether a country could win a war (Bernama,  7th

January 2003).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst all the bellicose talk of war, the Malaysian

media  created a furore over Tim Huxley's book "Defending

the  Lion  City".   Now,  this book,  based  on  academic

research   on   the  SAF's  capabilities,  was   actually

published by a British academic from Hull University more

than  two years ago.  Back then, the Malaysian media  did

not  pay  any attention to this book.  So, one  can  only

speculate why the Malaysian media have chosen to do their

book reviews only now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, there were almost daily articles

in   the  Malaysian  Malay  language  press  playing   up

Singapore's  alleged  aggressive  intentions.   On   18th

January   2003,   Berita  Harian  (Malaysia)   recklessly

alleged, and I quote,  - I think Members should note this

because this is not in English, readily available to  all

-  "Singapore  has stealthily embarked on a  bioterrorism

defence program, and that it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2380</b></font><br><br>



has  set  aside  more than RM201 million specifically  to

carry  out  R&D  to  build  up its  bioterrorism  defence

system.   History  has  proven that  every  country  that

undertakes  R&D in biodefence will also end up  by  doing

R&D into weapons for biological attacks.  Singapore is no

exception to such thinking."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any evidence to substantiate their

allegations,  they  accuse the  Singapore  Government  of

breaching its obligations under international conventions

it  has signed against the possession of Weapons of  Mass

Destruction  (WMD).   Such  war-mongering  articles,   it

should  be  noted,  are  found especially  in  the  Malay

language  press, which can only be designed  to  stir  up

animosities in their Malay population against Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, such loose talk of war is both

irresponsible  and dangerous.  It whips up emotions  that

could   become  difficult  to  control.    In   such   an

atmosphere, the Malaysian navy and marine police  vessels

have    escalated   their   intrusions   into   Singapore

territorial  waters  off Pedra Branca  in  the  past  one

month.   Such provocative actions are not only senseless,

but  dangerous.  Why senseless?  Senseless, because  both

sides   have   agreed  to  refer  the  dispute   to   the

International  Court of Justice, and such actions  cannot

in  any  way  affect the outcome or the decision  of  the

international court.  Dangerous, because of the  risk  of

accidents that may not only cause loss of life  but  also

cause  serious damage to naval vessels with unforeseeable

consequences, and the Malaysian Government would have  to

bear  responsibility for the consequences caused  by  the

aggressive and repeated intrusions of its vessels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, Singapore has exercised exclusive

control, ownership and sovereignty of Pedra Branca  since

the  1840s  without  any protest from any  country  until

Malaysia published a map in 1979 claiming it as  part  of

its  territory.  This was, and is, the status quo.  Until

Malaysia's  claim is decided by the ICJ, the  status  quo

must  remain,  consistent  with Malaysia's  own  position

which  it  has  taken  in  the case  of  Sipadan/Ligitan.

There, in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2381</b></font><br><br>



that  case,  Malaysia adopted the position that  as  they

were  in possession of the islands, the status quo should

prevail.   For  example, this is  what  they  said  in  a

diplomatic  note  to  Indonesia on 3rd  January  1994,  a

diplomatic  note  which they filed  together  with  other

documents in the International Court of Justice, and that

note said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government of Malaysia reiterates that since

Sipadan  and Ligitan are parts of Malaysia, any  and  all

activities  undertaken by Malaysia on  or  pertaining  to

those  islands  and  their surrounding waters  constitute

legitimate exercise of its sovereignty and jurisdiction.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And note this part:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The continuing acts of intrusion by Indonesian

naval  vessels  and  aircraft in  Malaysia's  territorial

waters  and airspace around Sipadan and Ligitan similarly

cannot in any way, advance Indonesia's claim over the two

islands.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, having taken that position for Sipadan and

Ligitan,  Malaysia now disregards the status quo  in  the

case  of Pedra Branca by intruding into Singapore  waters

around  the  island which has belonged to  Singapore  for

more than 150 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is in the overwhelming national

interest  of  both countries to avoid such escalation  of

tensions  and  conflicts,  as the  consequences  will  be

costly for both countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Mahathir said that Malaysia would

respect  international  law on territorial  disputes  and

avoid  any confrontation with Singapore on Pedra  Branca.

And let me say that this is also Singapore's position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I want to assure

this  House  that it is Singapore's desire to have  good,

not  strained, relations with Malaysia.  We believe  that

there  is  much that both countries can gain  by  working

together.  And our common interests definitely exceed our

bilateral differences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must ensure a firm and level basis for

conducting   state-to-state  relations.    Whenever   the

Malaysians run out of arguments on bilateral issues, they

accuse   Singapore  of  being  unreasonable,  legalistic,

sticking to facts and the law.  As

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>



I  have  said  to  the House before,  how  else  can  any

country, especially a small country like Singapore,  deal

with   other  countries  other  than  on  the  basis   of

international   law  and  the  sanctity   of   agreements

voluntarily entered into by governments?  If we were ever

to  yield  on this basic position, we would suffer  grave

and  permanent consequences.  Singapore cannot afford  to

be intimidated into allowing this to happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's relationship with Malaysia will be

difficult  from time to time.  But what is  important  is

that  we  stay  calm and rational through these  periodic

cycles  of  ups  and  downs.  And I  close  by  reminding

ourselves  of what Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong  said  in

his  speech  to  the Singapore Institute of International

Affairs on 27th November 2002:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must manage these swings with a certain

psychological equanimity; not lapsing into complacency or

euphoria  when  things go smoothly, nor  becoming  unduly

alarmed or despondent when things go bad'.  [Applause].



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the

<div align="center"><b>QUESTIONS ON THE MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> We have heard the Minister for

Foreign Affairs make his Ministerial Statement which  has

dealt with the Questions on the Order Paper.  He has also

distributed  fuller details as an Annex.  I  shall  allow

Members  to raise questions addressed to the Minister  on

the statement he has delivered.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

first,  I  want  to  thank  the  Minister  for  his  most

comprehensive and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2383</b></font><br><br>



full answer on Malaysia/Singapore relations.  It is clear

from the statement given this afternoon that Singapore is

most  reasonable, most accommodative and most patient  in

our  negotiations  with Malaysia.   I  want  to  ask  the

Minister  whether the Malaysians understand and know  the

sanctity  of international agreements made by  them  with

other  countries.   Or  do  they deliberately  choose  to

ignore  this?   And, if so, what is their  motive?   With

Malaysia chopping and changing its position time and time

again,   how  would  Singapore  engage  meaningfully   in

negotiations with Malaysia?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to know, although the Minister has

mentioned, what is next.  Is there any date or time-table

in  mind  or  is  it  going to  be  just  a  vacuum?   In

particular,  I would ask the Minister to comment  on  the

announcement that Johor would cease to buy treated  water

from  Singapore  from mid-2003 onwards, after  their  own

water treatment plant has been completed.  What would  be

our response to this?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Dr Ong Chit Chung asked several

questions,  whether they know of the  importance  of  the

sanctity  of  the water agreements and so  on.   From  my

statement, Members will realise that I have given  enough

quotations  -  some  old ones, like what  Mr  Ariff,  the

Malaysian representative to the Vienna Conference on  the

Law  of  Treaties  said  in 1968 -  he  was  telling  the

representatives  of the whole world that  the  Separation

Agreement  and  the  Water  Agreements  were  very   good

examples  of  how  agreements or special agreements  that

could  not  be suspended or terminated for any  political

reason - to what Foreign Minister Mr Syed Hamid said last

year  that  they would continue to honour the agreements.

But  you  have to contrast these statements with some  of

the other statements which I mentioned in early 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the motive for making all these statements?

I  think  that is in the realm of speculation.   What  is

important,  not so much speculation, is for us  to  state

what are the implications, which I have done,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>



and  what is Singapore's position, which is what we  have

done.  That is, we cannot allow treaties solemnly entered

into to be lightly disregarded or contravened.  And if we

allow  Malaysia to unilaterally change or alter important

provisions  of an agreement so critical as the Separation

Agreement, then where will all this end?  Are we expected

to   quietly  accept  any  other  revisions  of  critical

provisions  of  the  Separation Agreement  or  any  other

agreement?  So, that is why we have to state our position

very clearly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his other question, that Johor would be having

its  own  water  treatment plants and they  may  not  buy

treated  water, that is entirely their right.  The  Water

Agreements provide for them to purchase a certain  amount

of treated water from Singapore.  In fact, they have been

purchasing water well beyond the amounts stipulated.  But

if  they  choose not to, then it is their right,  and  we

cannot compel them to purchase treated water from us.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> What is the next step?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> As for the next step, we have to

wait  and see.  We have stated our position that the  way

forward  is  through  peaceful,  amicable  settlement  of

disputes.   What  does that mean?  In  normal  diplomatic

practice, countries discuss, talk and negotiate to try to

find  an  agreement.  I have outlined in  the  chronology

that  we  have tried that.  We have been reasonable,  but

there  is  an impasse.  What do we do after the  impasse?

Then,  I  pointed  out  either  the  Permanent  Court  of

Arbitration  or we have to follow the provisions  of  the

agreement,   which   provide  for  arbitration,   and   I

contrasted  this  with the loose talk of  war,  which  is

certainly not the way forward.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

notwithstanding   the  fact  that   we   are   developing

alternative   sources  of  water  such  as  NEWater   and

desalination - and we know that, today, there even exists

equipment  that allows us to extract drinking water  even

from  air - and in spite of the fact that we are  dealing

with a party that is bent on shifting the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2385</b></font><br><br>



goal  post  frequently  in  the  negotiations,  does  the

Minister agree that it is still in the interests of  both

sides  to  reach an amicable solution to the  issues  and

that the successful conclusion of the Water Agreement  is

still  our  aim?   As such, an agreement,  besides  being

critical  to  our survival, serves also to symbolise  the

inextricable  links between our two countries,  and  that

the  issues  before  us should not be allowed  to  hinder

other areas of bilateral cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, does the Minister agree that the current

climate of frenzy and agitation that has been whipped  up

by  the Malaysian media overlooks the larger interests of

both  countries and serves only to undermine the  efforts

to  broaden other areas of bilateral cooperation, and it,

in   no   way,  contributes  towards  enhancing   foreign

investors' confidence in the region at a time when we are

faced  with  many  other important  challenges,  such  as

economic  competition from North Asia and the  threat  of

terrorism, all of which require our joint efforts?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> As to the first part of Mr Tan Soo

Khoon's question, whether it is possible to have any room

for  further negotiations and talks, I would  agree  with

that - let us continue to talk.  That has always been  my

position.   It  has  always been the  position  of  Prime

Minister  Goh and of the Government.  And I hope  that  I

have sufficiently demonstrated by taking Members through,

in  some  detail, the chronology that we have taken  that

position because, if we can have a win-win deal, that  is

good  for both countries.  After all, it would deal  with

our   future  water  supply  situation.   But,  as  Prime

Minister  Goh  said,  we must also  bear  in  mind  that,

because we do not want the water issue to be a thorn that

bedevils  our relationship, we will have to  develop  our

own  alternative supply of water.  But in response to his

specific question, if we can have a deal, is it not worth

to  continue talking?  I say, yes, of course, and that is

precisely why we have continued our discussions.  But for

the  reasons  I have pointed out, they have, through  the

many changes of positions and, finally, discontinuing the

package and not wanting to talk about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2386</b></font><br><br>



future   supply   of  water  till  2059,   made   further

negotiations impossible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of his question is related to the

media  frenzy.   Does  it  not  hinder  cooperation   and

undermine efforts between both countries?  The answer is,

yes.  It does not make sense for the two countries to  be

in this state of ups and downs, particularly on the water

issue.   But  there are so many issues where  allegations

have  been  hurled  at us.  Rather  than  this  state  of

affairs  where  accusations have been hurled  at  us,  it

really  makes  sense for us to cooperate in  many  areas.

And,   indeed,  there  are  many  areas  which  we   have

cooperation in the past, and we continue to have areas of

potential  cooperation, such as in the area  of  economic

cooperation.  Both sides are important to each other  for

trade and investments.  I think Members are aware of  the

figures.   We  also  have to cooperate  in  the  area  of

terrorism,  as the former Speaker has mentioned.   And  I

would add that both Malaysia and Singapore are also  well

positioned  to  work  together to advance  the  cause  of

ASEAN.   So,  there  are many areas  where  Malaysia  and

Singapore  could  work  together to  advance  our  mutual

bilateral interests and work together for the advancement

of the interest of our region.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  first,  could  I  ask  the  Minister  why  does

Singapore  maintain  that Johor has  lost  the  right  of

review  when the Water Agreements provide for the  review

after 25 years, but does not specify exactly when such  a

review  should  take place?  Second question,  could  the

Minister explain why Singapore is not insisting that  the

price  review  be  referred to the ICJ or  the  Permanent

Court of Arbitration?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> On his first question, Mr

Ravindran is a lawyer, and also a few other Members, I do

not  think this is a place to engage in a detailed  legal

analysis  of  the  Water Agreement  provisions.   I  have

mentioned before that if you look at the Water Agreements

which  are in the bundle of documents, both have  clauses

on price review, which provide

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2387</b></font><br><br>



that  the rates can be reviewed after 25 years.   We  can

have  a legal argument as to whether it should be on  the

25th  year,  or at any time after 25 years, or  within  a

reasonable  period  after 1986-87.  Now,  we  have  legal

advice  which  said that Malaysia has lost its  right  of

review.   Well, that is a legal issue which will have  to

be  debated at an appropriate forum, and I have said that

it  is  a matter that can also be put through the process

under the Water Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to also note, in this context, that

the   Malaysian  leaders  have  said  that   they   chose

deliberately  not to review at that time when  they  were

entitled to because they feared that the price of treated

water  supplied  by  Singapore would  also  be  reviewed.

Because  the  review clauses cannot  apply  only  to  raw

water, it must also apply to treated water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor that I should mention, which we

pointed  out  to  the Malaysians, is  that  if  they  had

exercised  the right to review then, it might  well  have

caused  different decisions on our part as to the amounts

of  money that we have invested in Johor on various kinds

of works, which actually have come to more than a billion

Singapore  dollars - water works, pipe lines,  ancilliary

works, the Linggiu Dam.  So this is a question which will

have  to  be decided at an appropriate time, but we  have

taken legal advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are on the subject, even though we took the

legal position, we told the Malaysians, "We know this  is

important to you.  So, we are prepared to discuss this in

the  context of the package; in other words, on a without

prejudice basis.  But if you take it out of the  package,

shelve future water to 2059 and insist on discussing just

existing  water, then we will have to go by the terms  of

the  provisions of the Agreement."  And they have a legal

view, we have a legal view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question is: why not international

arbitration  and adjudication?  I would say  that,  as  a

general  principle, if you ask me as a  Foreign  Minister

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2388</b></font><br><br>



someone  who has taught international law, when countries

have   disputes,   it  is  always  preferable   to   have

international adjudication or international  arbitration.

But as Mr Ravindran knows, that is not something that you

can  compel another side.  It requires consensual  basis.

Both  disputing parties must agree to that  international

arbitration process.  And in this case, of course, it  is

better for international credibility and transparency and

the  signals we are giving to the international community

that even this dispute is referred to, say, the PCA.  But

they have said, no.  How do we resolve it amicably?   So,

we  have to fall back on the provisions in the Agreement.

And  the  provisions  provide  for  arbitration  by  that

particular mode, and we are parties to the Agreement, and

we  have  said,  OK,  we  follow the  provisions  in  the

Agreement.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Just to follow

up on that point.  Can we not insist that the more proper

forum  would be the PCA?  It is a more neutral body.   If

we  go according to the laws of Johor, it might not be as

neutral  as  we would like it to be.  And I  would  think

that if Malaysia is confident of its case, as it has said

it  is,  it would be prepared to take it to the PCA.   My

second  question is also on water.  Given that it  is  no

longer  realistic to hope for future water from Malaysia,

can the Minister assure all Singaporeans that we are well

prepared  to be self-sufficient for all our water  needs,

present and future?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> On the first part of Ms Irene Ng's

question, why shall we not insist, and so on, I have just

answered  Mr  Ravindran's question that PCA requires  the

consent  of  both sides.  We can insist, but it  requires

their consent.  It is preferable.  That is my view.   But

we  deal  with  the  situation as it exists.   We  cannot

compel  them.  So, we fall back on the provisions of  the

Water Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her second question as to whether we can assure

the House, Members have heard both Prime Minister Goh and

my  colleague, Minister Lim Swee Say, inform the House in

detail  of  all  the efforts being done  to  develop  our

capability for alternative sources of water - NEWater,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2389</b></font><br><br>



desalination - and we will press on with them.  But we do

not  know  when  and  how fast that capability  can  come

about.  Therefore, in the meantime, what is important  is

that  the obligations under the Water Agreements must  be

complied  with.  And that is why I have said that  it  is

very  important.   It  is  not only  important  from  the

theoretical  principle  of  observance  of  international

agreements,  it  is also critical for our  existence  and

survival.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I

would like to go back to the question of the sanctity  of

contract  which, unfortunately, Rais Yatim does not  seem

to  have  a  basic  understanding of.  Can  the  Minister

comment  on  the Malaysian accusation that Singapore  has

failed  to  abide  by the agreement  which  was  made  at

independence,   offering  the  right  of  the   Malaysian

military  to  maintain  facilities  in  Singapore?    And

related to that question, I understand that there was  an

issue on revised rental.  Is there no contradiction  when

Singapore  raised  the rental of land for  KD  Malaya  to

reflect  market rates while objecting to the revision  of

the price of water to reflect to market rate?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Perhaps, during the break, Members

have  not  had  time to read the written  answer  to  the

question  on  KD  Malaya  in  the  Annex  which   I   had

circulated.   But if I may just sum up, I will  make  two

points which were further elaborated in my Annex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is this. While there was a rental

increase for KD Malaya, it was not targeted at KD Malaya.

It  was  part of Singapore's policy to adjust rentals  on

properties towards market rates.  And that policy applied

to others, including voluntary and welfare organisations.

So, that is the first point I want to stress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to stress is: far from

wanting to chase them out of KD Malaya, Malaysian leaders

were  told  by Singapore leaders - both the then  Defence

Minister Dr Yeo Ning Hong and Prime Minister Goh  himself

-  that we wanted them to stay in Singapore, and we  made

several proposals and alternative suggestions which would

have enabled

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>



them  to stay on, including staggering and phasing in  of

the  new  rentals.   And our proposals also  included  an

option of our building, at considerable cost to us, of  a

camp  for  them  at a much lower rental.   I  forgot  the

figure.   It is in the Annex.  But they decided on  their

own volition that they would leave.  And, in fact, in the

passing-out ceremony in 1997, their then Defence Minister

-  and now Foreign Minister - thanked Singapore for these

facilities.  The quote is in the Annex, and he said  that

they had no problems with or complaints about Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part of the question as to whether this

was a breach of the Separation Agreement, the hon. Member

was  probably  referring to some  statements  made  that,

under the Separation Agreement, they had a right to  stay

in Singapore and so on.  Perhaps Members ought to look at

the  terms of the Separation Agreement, which is also  in

the  bundle  of  documents.  Members  will  find  in  the

provisions of the Separation Agreement a reference to the

right  of  Malaysia  to  maintain  bases  and  so  on  in

Singapore.   But that was envisaged, together with  other

items,  as part of an agreement to be concluded  by  both

countries  on  mutual defence, which never  materialised.

In other words, it was not a substantive provision of the

Separation   Agreement.   It  was  part  of  the   points

indicative  of  what our future mutual defence  agreement

could  be,  and it was never concluded.  In other  words,

from 1965 to 1997 when they left, they stayed here not on

the basis of any treaty provisions, but because we wanted

them  to continue having those facilities.  I hope I have

answered that question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  with reference to the proposal by Malaysia  for

the  ASEAN+3 Secretariat to be located in KL, may  I  ask

the  Minister whether there were other members  of  ASEAN

besides  Indonesia,  as mentioned in the  Statement,  who

were  opposed  to this proposal?  My second question  is:

how  and  when did Singapore express its support  to  the

EAEC proposal, and why is there a confusion on this?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> On ASEAN+3, I can inform Members

categorically  that  I  was  present  at  all  the  ASEAN

meetings  where this topic had been discussed,  including

at  some retreats of Foreign Ministers.  And I can assure

the   House  that  many  countries  in  ASEAN,  not  just

Singapore,  but  Indonesia and  a  few  others,  such  as

Thailand   and   Vietnam,   also   had   discomfort   and

reservations about this proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the EAEC, I shall not repeat what is in the

written  answer that I have circulated in the Annex,  but

Members  will  find  there chapter and verse,  quotations

from  speeches  that Prime Minister Goh  and  others  had

given, which expressly supported the concept and the idea

enunciated by Prime Minister Mahathir on the EAEC.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker, I would like to seek some clarification from the

Minister  on  his speech, and also to follow  up  on  the

questions  on  NEWater.  From what he said regarding  the

chronological  events  in the negotiation  of  water,  it

would  appear to me that the major turning point  is  the

letter from Dr Mahathir to Senior Minister Lee dated  4th

March  2002, which led us to a major decision to ramp  up

our NEWater programme to replace the 1961 Water Agreement

when  it  expires  in  2011.  I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister whether he could clarify or elaborate on what is

so  unattractive  or unreasonable in the Malaysian  Prime

Minister's  letter  that led to our major  decision  like

this.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The full text of the letter is in

the  bundle.  It is a short letter, and the proposals are

attached to the letter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why I said in my speech that they were totally

different  proposals, they came about after Dr Mahathir's

various  statements that maybe the real  price  of  water

ought to be RM8.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the differences in this new proposal? Let

me  recap.  Under Malaysia's new proposal that he tabled,

60  sen would apply not only from 2002 for five years  to

2006, but also be backdated.  Backdated to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2392</b></font><br><br>



when?  Backdated to 1st September 1986 and 29th September

1987,  in respect of the two Water Agreements.  And  from

2007  to  2011, the price would be RM3 per 1,000 gallons.

That  was another change.  And from 2011 until the expiry

of   the  Water  Agreements,  the  RM3  would  be  raised

annually, based on average inflation rate, as I mentioned

in  my  speech.  The other major change is the  way  they

dealt differently with the question of treated water.  As

far  as treated water is concerned, they proposed to  fix

the price of treated water, which we were selling back to

them  under  the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements  at  RM1,

from 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points worth noting here. First,

there  was  no backdating to 1986 and 1987.   Raw  water,

revised - backdated to 1986 and 1987.  Treated water,  no

backdating.  Second, under this proposal, raw water  from

Johor  is worth RM3 per 1,000 gallons.  So, having raised

it,  after  processing, our revised  treated  water  will

still be only RM1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same letter, they proposed to supply 100 mgd

of  treated water in 2011, which was in response  to  our

earlier  proposal  for the supply of 100  mgd  raw  water

after  the expiry of the 1961 Water Agreement.  Based  on

the  formula that they proposed, do you know how much  we

would  have to pay?  We would have to pay about RM10  per

1,000  gallons of treated water.  At this price,  treated

water from Malaysia would be much higher than the cost of

NEWater.  It is also much more than desalinated water.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> I have a few

questions  for  the Minister arising from  certain  facts

that   the  Minister  has  put  forward.   We  know  that

Singapore  has  exercised sovereignty over  Pedra  Branca

since the 1840s.  We know that we had separation in 1965,

and  the first time that the Malaysians had made a  claim

to  Pedra  Branca was in 1979 in a map, which  means  139

years  after we exercised sovereignty and 14 years  after

Separation.   Have the Malaysians given  any  explanation

why  there has been this deafening silence on their  part

in relation to assertion of sovereignty for 139 years

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>

or  14  years?  More specifically, is it their case  that

they did not know in 1965 and they suddenly knew in 1979?

Or  is  it that they knew in 1965 but forgot until  1979?

Or  is it the case that they neither knew nor forgot  and

suddenly  decided in 1979?  And, if so, is it a principle

of  international law that they can suddenly decide  that

they have sovereignty over their neighbour's property?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> These are questions which should

be  directed to the Malaysians.  But the pointed  way  in

which  Ms Indranee asked those questions, maybe we should

include  her  in  our team to argue in the  International

Court of Justice!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, really, 1979 was the first time that they

published a map.  I have looked at some of the maps prior

to 1979.  And prior to 1979, Malaysian maps showed "Pedra

Branca  (Singapura)".  After 1979, it was shown as  being

within  Malaysian waters, and the "Singapura"  was  taken

out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a principle of international law that they can

suddenly  claim  ownership, out of the  blue,  after  130

years,  and 14 years after our independence?   I  do  not

think one has to be an international lawyer to know  that

that  is not the case.  Although, as I have said, we have

been in possession, control and ownership of Pedra Branca

and  the surrounding waters for more than 150 years,  can

somebody spring this and claim that they are owners?  And

they  also  claim that they have the right  to  come  and

patrol  our waters?  In international law, in  our  view,

that proposition is not tenable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask hon. Members to imagine this. You have a

compound  house with a garden.  You have lived there  all

your  life.   Your  parents have lived  there  all  their

lives.   Your  grandparents had  lived  there  all  their

lives.  Nobody has ever challenged your ownership or your

forefathers' ownership of that property.  You have  lived

peacefully there and suddenly one of the neighbours says,

"Hey,  your  house belongs to me."  And he  says  he  has

found  some ancient document in his attic and this  house

belongs  to  him.   You maintain your  legal  rights,  of

course,  and  he says he is going to go  to  court.   And

instead

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2394</b></font><br><br>



of  coming  to  blows, you say, "Go  ahead.   Take  legal

action."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get up one morning and, lo and behold, you find

your  neighbour climbing the fence, wanting  to  pitch  a

tent  in your garden, and saying, "Look, since I  am  now

challenging  it,  there is a dispute, I  am  entitled  to

pitch a tent and help you safeguard your property."   You

will,  of  course, say no, won't you?   So,  we  have  to

maintain  observance of international law, and observance

of  international law is that the status quo  has  to  be

maintained.   And  the status quo is that  Singapore  has

always been in sovereignty and ownership of the territory

and of the waters, and that continues to be the case, and

will  continue  to  be  the case, until  and  unless  the

International Court were to rule otherwise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

back to the issue of water.  From all the facts that  the

Minister has presented to us, obviously, we know that the

Malaysians  are  insincere.   They  are  not  sincere  in

resolving  this  issue.  When the Minister  talked  about

"shifting  of  goal-posts", I think there are  no  longer

goal-posts now in this whole game.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysians have also, unilaterally, from time to

time, changed their positions, eg, taking the water issue

out  of  the package of issues.  Do we not think that  we

have wasted enough time with the Malaysians?  Maybe it is

about  time the Minister took the position that water  is

an  issue  that we are no longer interested in discussing

with them and focus on building our own sources of water,

rather  than to waste the Malaysians' time and our  time,

and  also  to bring us all back on a Saturday to  discuss

issues like this.  I think it is about time that we  just

put  our  foot down and said that the water issue  is  no

longer  for discussion.  We have an agreement.   If  they

want to sue us, go ahead and we will settle it in a court

of law.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Well, I hope the Member is not

complaining  that his Saturday golf game or whatever  has

been spoilt.  It is a matter of grave importance, whether

Saturday or Sunday, it is necessary to meet.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it must be clear from my speech that we have

been  as reasonable as we can.  Why?  In order to achieve

a  win-win solution, and we thought it is possible.  But,

I  think  we  have come to the end of the  road,  not  on

account  of  our  intransigence or rigid  positions,  but

because of, as the Member has said, the "shifting of goal-posts", and finally discontinuation of the package by the

Malaysians.   That is why I say we are at an impasse  and

we  have  got  to think of how to move  on.   It  is  not

Singapore's  intention  to  be  fixated  on  this   issue

because,  as  I answered Mr Tan Soo Khoon's question,  we

have  to move on and do not let this issue so affect  the

sum  total of our relations, because there are many other

issues  that  we need to focus on, both domestically  our

economic and other problems, as well as bilaterally,  and

in  the  region.   So, we need to move  on,  and  I  have

outlined to Members how we can move on.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> It was claimed

that  Singapore  made huge profits by  selling  water  to

ships,  and  the water supplied by Johor  should  be  for

domestic consumption.  Could the Minister comment on this

accusation?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> This matter - that we buy water

from them at 50 cents and we sell at exorbitant rates  to

ships  and  therefore  we  are profiteering  -  has  been

answered  several times in this House by  Prime  Minister

Goh,  as well as myself.  So, let me restate the position

that  this  is  really without basis.  It  is  an  absurd

allegation.  Yes, PUB sells water to ships at the maximum

rate of S$21 per thousand litres.  But, as Prime Minister

Goh said in this House on 5th April, the sale of water to

ships  is less than 1% of Singapore's total water demand,

or  one  mgd.  And why do we do this?  It is deliberately

done  to  price  it  at such a high  rate  to  discourage

demand,  not to make a huge profit.  But, more important,

is  this:   Malaysia also does the same at  their  ports.

For  instance, the Port of Tanjong Pelapas in Johor sells

water  to ships at the maximum rate of RM455 per thousand

gallons  for  volumes of 50 thousand  litres  and  above.

This is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2396</b></font><br><br>



obviously substantially higher than the rate charged  for

domestic consumers, and I presume they do so for the same

reason,  to discourage demand.  So, it is not a  question

of profiteering.  It is less than 1%.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Thank you,

Mdm  Deputy Speaker, finally, you caught my eye!  I would

like  to  join  my  colleague,  Dr  Ong  Chit  Chung,  in

expressing  our  appreciation to the Government  for  its

very  level-headed  and rational approach  to  this  very

important  issue,  in  contrast to the  Malaysian  style,

which  seems to be twisting and turning all the time.   I

have four questions for the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I note in the Minister's statement that the

Malaysians now want to review the second Water  Agreement

only  in  2058.  This seems to be a bit late in  the  day

because,  as he said, there would be only two years  left

before the expiry of the actual Agreement.  I want to ask

whether  in  the  formal Agreement  itself,  is  there  a

timeframe   for  an  earlier  form  of  consultation   or

discussion  because, obviously, two years is  not  enough

for us to prepare ourselves.  If it is true that there is

not enough time for us to review until 2058, what are  we

going  to  do about our own water provision plans  before

that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that the Minister said that the

Malaysians always have this cycle in their relations with

us  -  there are ups and downs, and now it seems like  we

are  in  the  low  end of the cycle.  Maybe  the  Foreign

Minister  could enlighten the House on whether there  are

reasons  behind  their more agitated behaviour  now,  eg,

domestic reasons or other reasons that cause them to want

to  always use Singapore as a whipping boy on this  water

issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that we also read in the papers

that  the  Malaysians now want to have  their  own  water

processing  plant in Johor.  In future,  they  would  not

need to get processed water from Singapore any more.  But

we know that Singapore has spent a lot of money; in fact,

$1.5 billion on our own water processing plant, which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2397</b></font><br><br>



can  also  cater for Johor.  Should we not talk  to  them

about  the possibility of this spare capacity to be  used

for their own water processing, instead of spending their

money on building new plants for their purposes?  In  the

process, there is mutual benefit.  We can put it  in  the

terms  for  discussion, so that we can find  it  mutually

beneficial for us to help them to process their water and

become   part  of  the  agreement.   Because  the   water

processing plant can be very expensive for the Malaysians

to build themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on Pedra Branca, I want to ask the Minister

what  really is the economic or real value of this  piece

of rock, so to speak, for the Malaysians?  For Singapore,

we  know it is our sovereign right, because we have  been

owning this piece of island for the last 150 years.   But

I  am surprised that the Malaysians suddenly took a stand

and  want to claim it.  Is there any particular economic,

or  maybe touristic, reasons for Malaysia wanting to make

a claim on this island?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> First, of the four questions, is

that  2058  or 2059 is rather late in the day.   I  think

that  is  a real under-statement.  On this, he asked  two

questions: is there any provision in the Water Agreements

which  provides for review and so on.  The answer is  no.

The  Water  Agreements are self-contained.  They  do  not

have   built-in  provisions  which  provide  for  trigger

mechanism  for a review process.  So, the legal  position

is  that  -   and we are not taking any other position  - both Agreements, when they expire, unless both sides have

agreed to extend, will lapse.  That is the position.  So,

when  we  are  talking about agreements, we  are  talking

about  agreements which will be separate from  the  Water

Agreements  for the supply of water after the  expiry  of

the Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part of his question, since it is late

in  the  day, what should we do and so on.  I  think  the

answer  is, as Mr Lim Swee Say and others have  said,  we

have  to  ramp up our capability and capacity to  develop

our  alternative sources of water supply.   That  is  one

very important task that we have in Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>



and  as  Members  know, we are taking it seriously.   The

second  question he asked is what could  be  the  reasons

behind  all these ups and downs and bashing of Singapore.

I  think  Members  are  used to  my  style  in  answering

questions,  ie, I try not to speculate.   It  has  really

reached a point of diminishing returns.  Your speculation

is  as  good  as mine.  I prefer to answer questions  and

make statements based on hard facts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, they want to have their own water treatment

facilities  and so on.  Should we engage  them  and  say,

"Look,  why  are you guys doing this?"  I think  if  they

want to have their own water treatment plants and be self-sufficient in their treatment of water, let them  do  so.

It  is not necessary for us to tell them that they should

not do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Pedra Branca, it is partly speculative. I do not

know  how many tourists that rock can take.  I have  been

there.   Again,  I  do  not  want  to  speculate.    But,

obviously,  one answer to his question is, if  they  take

away the rock, it would reduce Singapore's space.  Let me

say this.  For every country in the world, whether big or

small,  political independence and sovereignty over  land

and  territorial waters is of paramount importance.  This

is  a  key  attribute  of  nationhood.   When  we  became

independent   on  9th  August  1965,  the  territory   of

Singapore  consisted  of  our  main  island  and  several

smaller  islands, including Pedra Branca, as Ms  Indranee

has  pointed  out.   When we became  independent  on  9th

August  1965,  this  is  what we  have.   If  territorial

integrity  and sovereignty is important for all  nations,

it  is  very important for Singapore as a small  country.

We  are one of the smallest countries in the world.   But

our  size  has  been  determined on independence  on  9th

August 1965 and we cannot change it.  Although we are one

of the smallest countries in the world, every inch of our

territory  or  of our waters is of paramount  importance,

and we will have to safeguard our territorial sovereignty

and preserve it.  If anybody challenges us, it has to  be

resolved  by  reference  to an international  body.   And

until  any  international body,  like  the  World  Court,

decides otherwise, that sovereignty

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>

and  territorial integrity must be preserved by Singapore

at all costs.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the

Minister  has  taken  a  somewhat unprecedented  move  in

releasing correspondence between the leaders of Singapore

and  Malaysia,  as  well  as  other  communiques  at  the

diplomatic level.  His reason has been that the hope  for

a  win-win  outcome on the issue of water, in particular,

is  now not realistic.  May I ask why he has come to this

conclusion  at this stage, because most Singaporeans  and

this  House certainly are very familiar with the rhetoric

coming  from across the Causeway on the issue  of  water,

and  the noise levels have a cyclical nature?  This time,

the noise levels have gone up again.  But we have arrived

at  a  very  major  decision, it would  appear,  on  this

matter,  in wanting to set the record straight  publicly,

and  I  would appreciate it if the Minister could clarify

the thinking behind such a move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have taken a move of great gravity on a

matter  that  has  been at the centre of  bilateral  ties

between  Singapore and Malaysia for some time.   I  think

Singaporeans  would want to know and  appreciate  how  is

this  going  to  repercuss on the broader bilateral  ties

between  our two countries.  Because we have stated  that

we  want  to move on from the issue of water on to  other

matters,  and  find resolution.  I would appreciate  some

clarifications from the Minister on that.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The first part of Mr Iswaran's

question  was  about  the  release  of  these  documents,

exchanges  and diplomatic notes.  I think it  would  have

been  clear  from  my speech that I  have  done  so  with

reluctance.  But why are we doing this?  If I may sum  up

the  reasons again: first, we did not want to release all

these  documents because there was still  hope  that  the

negotiations could continue and there would  still  be  a

door open for talking.  But, alas, that was not the case.

If  it  had been just that, it would have been all right.

We  have  been  painted  as the unreasonable  party,  the

intransigent party,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>



the  party  to  blame for all this.  And accusations  and

allegations have come forth with that line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that these accusations have to be

countered.   Otherwise,  repetitions  of  untruths,   and

repeated incantations of these untruths might be taken to

be   the   truth.   It  is  important  for   Singaporeans

particularly, to know the facts.  To do that,  should  we

just  say, "That is not true", and sit down?  I think  we

have  to come out with all these facts so that the  facts

and  the  documents  will speak for  themselves.   It  is

important that all concerned have a clear idea  of  where

we are, what we are and how we came about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of his question was, since this has

been  a  central issue, whether it will impact  on  other

areas  of cooperation.  In answer to an earlier question,

I  have made it clear that there are many other areas  of

cooperation which both Singapore and Malaysia can gain to

benefit  by  focusing ourselves on  them.   And  that  is

precisely  why  we should not let this be  such  a  spiky

thorn  in  our  relationship,  that  its  non  resolution

continues  to  affect the sum total of our  relationship.

That  is  why I pointed out that we are in this  impasse.

Let  us find a way out of the impasse.  If talks are  not

possible, then arbitration - and let us try to  move  on.

There are many more urgent things at stake.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Given the

history  of their habit of changing their minds  ever  so

often,  does the Minister foresee that they might  decide

to  go  back on the package route again?  If so, what  is

our response to that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, now that the package has been dismantled,

can  the Minister explain how the other bilateral issues,

apart from water, are going to be resolved?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Members somehow do not believe me

when  I  said that I would not like to speculate.   If  a

proposal  comes  back and they say, "Let  us  resume  the

talks", I would take it a step at a time and deal with it

when that happens.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2401</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issues are unresolved and they would have

to  be  dealt with separately on a stand-alone merit.   I

think that is very clear.  They are no longer linked.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

the  Minister must be aware that the Malaysians  have  no

intention   to  settle  the  various  issues.    To   the

Malaysians, no solution is also a solution, and  we  have

to  remember this.  They have their own domestic politics

to  play  to.  If they were to settle all the  issues,  I

think  they have a difficult way of winning their ground.

So,  we  must have this behind our heads when we  go  and

negotiate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I ask the Minister to see whether there

is  an  easier version of what he has given to us as  our

ground.   I think our ground is very important.   Let  us

concentrate  on  our  own ground, ie,  we  must  convince

Singaporeans,  for example, that we are not unreasonable,

that   we   are  always  sticking  to  the  3-sen   price

negotiation,  and  that we have actually  been  the  more

reasonable party.  And that we are also prepared to up it

to 45 sen, but it is always changing at every negotiation

table.  Therefore, I believe that the Malaysians have  no

intention to sell us water in the coming years.   Let  us

face the truth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Pedra Branca, let the ground know that it

belongs to Singapore.  It is not a disputed territory and

that  if Malaysia wants to challenge us, they have to  do

so  through the International Court, and that their  navy

cannot come and patrol our waters.  And I think we should

tell them very seriously that we really mean business.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thank the Member for his speech.

He  asked  whether  I  could give an easier  and  simpler

version  of my speech.  I thought his summary  itself  is

excellent  and  maybe  we should  distribute  it  to  the

Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that Dr Tan Cheng Bock made is right - that the process of getting Singaporeans to know the

facts cannot just be done by the Foreign Minister

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2402</b></font><br><br>



making  this  one-hour speech in Parliament,  and  people

reading it the next day.  I think the thrust of his point

was  that  Members of Parliament, in turn, will  have  to

explain  to residents and constituents.  And I hope  that

it would not be just the Government MPs.  It has to be  a

collective effort of all the MPs in this House.  Whatever

assistance they may need from my Ministry, of course,  we

will be at their disposal.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

could  the Minister enlighten this House on the  possible

reasons  why the Malaysians are using the word  "war"  so

loosely?  Can they be seriously considering waging war on

Singapore?   Do  they  not realise the  catastrophic  and

destructive  effects of war on both countries?   How  can

they be treating war so lightly?  And how can they be  so

irresponsible?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Dr Lily Neo is absolutely right

that such talk of war does not make sense, and the sooner

it  stops  the better, because it is provocative  and  it

heightens the temperature which makes bilateral relations

very,  very  tense and spiky.  Not only that, as  another

Member  alluded  to,  it is also not  good  for  investor

confidence.  So, I agree with her that such talk is  both

senseless and dangerous.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  I have two supplementary questions.   One,  the

Minister's statement has been a watershed development  in

more  ways  than one.  In other words, it  is  no  goreng

pisang matter for anyone to take it lightly.  It is, in a

way,  a matter of our lifeline.  My question is: how does

the  Minister  intend  to  get  the  message  across  the

Causeway to the Malaysian people when the Malaysian media

and leaders are bent on giving misrepresentations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, having bared the facts - and Singapore

needs  to do that - how does the Minister ensure that  it

does  not add unnecessary heat to the important bilateral

relations which are already emotionally charged in  Kuala

Lumpur and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>



with the word "war" being bandied around irresponsibly?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The Member is right that the

Malaysian  media does not portray the Singapore  side  of

the story either sufficiently or accurately, or sometimes

not  at  all.  We will do our best to present our  facts.

As  I  mentioned before, all these will be on the website

of  MFA  and  also on the Kuala Lumpur Mission's  website

(embassy's website), and we will find other ways.  But  I

hope  that  both the people and leaders in Malaysia  will

read  the  statement carefully because it is not intended

to  add heat, as Mr Zainul has mentioned.  Rather, I have

carefully  drafted  my statement in  a  measured  way  to

present  the  facts.  And facts sometimes  not  only  can

elucidate  but  they can also dispel  rumours  and  false

allegations,  but  the facts must be able  to  speak  for

themselves.  And bringing up the facts cannot be said  to

be motivated by wanting to up the temperature.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mdm

Deputy  Speaker,  I  have  two  supplementary  questions.

Firstly,  I understand that while we operate a lighthouse

at  Pedra  Branca, we also operate a lighthouse at  Pulau

Pisang.   But while we say that Pedra Branca  belongs  to

us,  we  do not have a similar position as regards  Pulau

Pisang.   My  first question is: what are the differences

in  Singapore's  position  as  regards  Pedra  Branca  as

opposed to Pulau Pisang?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question, to borrow my colleague, Ms

Indranee's terms, has Malaysia decided or realised or  in

any  other way taken any steps to claim any other  island

that belongs to us, besides Pedra Branca?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> What is the difference between

Pedra  Branca  and  Pulau Pisang?   Let  me,  first,  say

upfront  that Pulau Pisang belongs to Malaysia.  We  have

never  disputed Malaysia's sovereignty over Pulau Pisang.

But  our  Maritime Port Authority (MPA), however,  has  a

right  to operate the Lighthouse on Pulau Pisang and  the

plot of land on which the Lighthouse stands

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>



as  well  as  the  roadway leading to the Lighthouse  was

granted  in perpetuity to Singapore, so long as Singapore

operates  the  Lighthouse.  And this was in an  indenture

between  the  Johor  Sultan and the Straits  Settlement's

Government in 1900 and we became successor to that.   So,

for   Pulau   Pisang,  we  have  never  contested   their

sovereignty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Pedra Branca, we have sovereignty over it.

It  is ridiculous to say - as the Malaysians have said  - that  Singapore  can  only  operate  the  Lighthouse  for

Malaysia.   I  might  add that, in 1968,  the  Malaysians

objected  to  the flying of the Singapore flag  over  the

Lighthouse  in Pulau Pisang.  They objected to  the  flag

and  we  took it down.  But they never objected then,  or

later,  to  the  flying of the Singapore  flag  on  Pedra

Branca.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they making any other claims? I think the

Member is asking because there were some press reports, I

believe, in March last year where Berita Harian carried a

report  from  some Malaysian lawyer.  That might  be  the

report where it said that Pulau Tekong Kechil was part of

Johor.   But  this  is  important.  The  very  next  day,

Malaysia's Foreign Minister publicly denied the claim  on

Pulau  Tekong Kechil.  Foreign Minister Syed Hamid  said,

Malaysia  had  "no  wish  to  create  new  problems   for

Singapore  by  staking new claims" and that  "as  far  as

Singapore was concerned, the only outstanding territorial

matter with Singapore was over Pedra Branca."

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  may  I ask the Minister whether  Singapore  has

considered  using mediation, instead of  arbitration,  to

resolve this matter?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The difference between mediation

and arbitration is this.  A mediator would listen to both

sides  and suggest a solution which will not be  binding,

and  it is up to both sides.  Arbitral tribunal or  court

will  listen to both sides' facts and evidence, and  give

an award or decision which will be binding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is mediation possible? I will not rule out

anything.  But after so many years of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2405</b></font><br><br>



discussions  at  such  high  levels  between   officials,

between  Ministers and between Prime Ministers, and  even

involving  Senior  Minister,  and  we  do  not  reach  an

agreement  -  and  I have shown you what their  attitudes

have been - I am not sure whether mediation would produce

better results.  But in line with my position of amicable

settlement of disputes, I would not rule out any form  of

amicable settlement of disputes.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Two supplementary

questions,  Mdm Deputy Speaker.  First, I would  like  to

have  the  Minister's views as to how he  sees  what  has

happened  between Singapore and Malaysia,  how  has  that

impacted  upon the relationship in ASEAN.   Because  many

outside ASEAN look upon ASEAN as being not a very  strong

organisation,  particularly in this era of  multi-lateral

organisations where people get together in order  to  put

up  a  great  supposition  of  strength.   How  has  this

impacted ASEAN?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is whether the Minister considers

that  there is a need or possibility to develop a channel

for  dispute settlement among the ASEAN countries  itself

because,  up  to now, there appears to be no channel  for

such  a  settlement of disputes, if such disputes develop

within ASEAN?  And whether this would be something useful

for  ASEAN  to  consider, particularly, since  the  ASEAN

countries  like Singapore and Malaysia are very important

countries in the grouping?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> On the first question of whether

the  difficulties in our bilateral relations will  affect

ASEAN,  I would give a mixed answer, yes and no.  No,  in

the  sense that, fortunately, the way ASEAN has developed

over the years, it has had a very good tradition of ASEAN

meetings  continuing among officials and  Ministers,  and

the  Ministers  of  the  10 countries  meeting  on  ASEAN

projects  without  letting bilateral  differences  impede

cooperation.  So, if Members look back in the history  of

ASEAN, the members of ASEAN have had, at different times,

their ups and downs in their relations, not just Malaysia

and Singapore,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2406</b></font><br><br>



others  too.   Indonesia and Malaysia had  problems  over

illegal  immigrants, Philippines and Malaysia  had  other

problems, and so on.  But the laudable feature  of  ASEAN

is  when  you go to meetings, whether at leaders'  level,

Foreign Ministers' level, or other Ministers, not only do

we  sit  down and discuss, but there is also the personal

camaraderie  that continues.  For all the differences  we

have with Malaysia, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid and I are

able to meet and talk and discuss at ASEAN meetings.  So,

in that sense, I would say the answer is "no".  The "yes"

part of a mixed answer is that, while it has not affected

cooperation within ASEAN, obviously, questions  would  be

asked  by  commentators outside  ASEAN  as  to  why  some

countries  are  bickering, and so on, and the  impression

may be given that ASEAN countries are in a disarray.  So,

I  think  it is important for ASEAN countries to  try  to

resolve these disputes among themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her second question was whether it would be useful

for  ASEAN  to  have a mechanism for dispute  settlement.

Actually, the answer to the question is that there  is  a

fairly  high level dispute settlement procedure  provided

for in the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation.  It  is

known  as  the TAC.  That is a very high level  mechanism

which  will  involve  the  high  council  in  ASEAN.   It

involves  the  leaders of all the ASEAN  countries.   But

that  envisages a very grave kind of situation  and  that

dispute  settlement  procedure mechanism  has  not  taken

place  and,  I  think,  on  the understanding  that  most

countries  should  be  able  to  work  this  out  amongst

themselves.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> In

view  of  the  twists  and turns of the  issues  and  the

tendency  for the Malaysian media to play up on  some  of

these  issues, I would like to ask the Minister  whether,

in  his assessment, there could be a possible danger  for

terrorist groups to exploit the issues, and this  becomes

the  Achilles' heel in our bilateral relations.   If  so,

what  can  we  do  to  overcome  this  and  not  let  the

seriousness of the way the situation is developing to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2407</b></font><br><br>



actually  add  to  the danger we are facing  from  global

terrorism?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Of course, both countries will

always be mindful of that.  But I would like to allay the

fears  of the Members that, amidst all this, one  of  the

silver   linings,  if  I  may  say  so,   is   that   the

professionals  in  our law enforcement agencies  on  both

sides  - our intelligence, our narcotics, police,  CID  - have  an excellent record of close cooperation.  And this

record  of  close cooperation continued in the  past  and

continues  even  during the ups and  downs  in  bilateral

relations.   And  I  can say so from  personal  knowledge

because, for some years, I was Minister for Home Affairs,

and  there is excellent cooperation.  In fact, only a few

days  ago,  one  of our highest awards  was  bestowed  by

President  Nathan  on  Malaysia's  Inspector-General   of

Police  - I turned up at the Investiture Ceremony  -  and

that cooperation will continue.  It has to be so.  We are

so close to each other and that there is so much movement

of  people at the borders that, if we were not  so,  both

countries will suffer in dealing with not just terrorism,

but  law and order, narcotics and so on.  So this is  one

aspect which I should highlight.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

the  Minister  has  just now referred to  the  furore  by

Malaysia on Singapore over defence strategy, and also Tim

Huxley's  book.  I would like to ask the Minister  if  he

could  give  us  an insight why this is so,  particularly

when  Singapore  is a small island and  the  strategy  is

probably  the most meaningful.  And, secondly,  the  book

was  written by an academic, not in Singapore, but really

in the UK.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Again, I do not know. It did not

make sense.  The book was published two years ago.  It is

not  a  book  which  was  written  or  published  by  the

Government,  but by an academic.  When it  was  published

two  years  ago, there was no fuss, and now, out  of  the

blue,  it is used as a peg to stir up emotions.  I  would

not be able to tell you why.  But I will tell you,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2408</b></font><br><br>



as  I  did, that such fanning of emotions is, to  put  it

very bluntly, dangerous.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

at least, now we have heard something more positive.  The

Minister has said that there is good cooperation  between

the  civil  servants of Home Affairs Ministry  and  their

Malaysian  counterparts.  When the civil  servants  could

strike   such   a   cooperation  with   their   Malaysian

counterparts, I wonder why are our Ministers not able to.

In  fact,  Mdm  Deputy Speaker, I was quite surprised  to

hear  about  the  chronological sequence of  negotiations

that  the  Minister and the Prime Minister had  with  the

Malaysians.  It seems to me that our Ministers are  being

pulled  around by the Malaysians, going up and down,  and

changing the goal posts here and there.  To me, I thought

this  is  quite  uncharacteristic of the PAP  Government,

which  is  always  talking about no  nonsense  and  being

tough.   So, I am quite surprised that, in the  bilateral

relations  and negotiations, it seems that  Singapore  is

being pulled around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I understand that we

have a non-speculative Foreign Minister, always based  on

facts,  very  diplomatic and very  accommodating  and,  I

think,  in the negotiations, was even prepared  to  dance

with  the  Malaysians from 45 sen to RM3 and so  on,  for

water  supply.  But I wonder whether up to this point  in

time,  with  the  approach that has been taken,  we  have

reached  the  point  where there is a  need  to  open  up

everything  to  the public and to tell  the  public  that

perhaps there is no return to negotiations.  With the way

of   Singapore's  approach  to  the  negotiations  -   so

accommodating, so diplomatic - could the Foreign Minister

comment on whether this has been the correct approach  so

far?   If  so,  why  is  it that we  end  up  in  such  a

situation?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> That is a good question, because

it  causes us to pause and reflect.  As he said, why have

we  reached this position?  Have we reached the  position

because  of  some  "incorrect" approach  of  the  Foreign

Minister and the correct approach of their Foreign

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2409</b></font><br><br>



Minister?  These are not personal whims and fancies of  a

Singapore  Minister  dealing  with  personal  whims   and

fancies  of  a Malaysian Minister.  These are negotiating

positions and national positions taken in the conduct  of

negotiations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have been accommodating and very reasonable

in the negotiations.  But if the hon. Member had listened

to  me,  and as it would be clear from the documents,  he

would  have  seen how the Singapore side - not  just  the

officials  or  the Foreign Minister, but  leaders  -  the

positions  we  have articulated at every turn,  what  has

been  uppermost  in  our  minds  has  been  the  national

interest  of  Singapore.  And in  pursuing  the  national

interest  of Singapore, in the negotiations we  have  had

certain   markers,  and  those  markers  have  not   been

compromised.   What are the markers that  have  not  been

compromised?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, observance of agreements solemnly and

willingly  entered  into.   On observance  of  the  Water

Agreements,  the guarantees in the Water  Agreements,  we

have always insisted on and never departed from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we were prepared to have the issues resolved

in  a  package, in return for future water.   That  would

have  been  in Singapore's national interest.   That  has

been  a  central  point  in the  negotiations.   Have  we

conceded on that?  We have not conceded on that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, when they discontinued with the package and

insisted on the price of current water, our position  has

been another marker - that we are prepared to discuss the

price of current water in the context of the package.  If

they  take  it out of the package, push future  water  to

2059, it is off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, when it is off, we cannot be bullied and

intimidated into agreeing to unilateral revision  of  the

Water  Agreements.   There are clear  provisions  in  the

Water Agreements, and they cannot do it at their whim and

fancy.  It has to be resolved in accordance with the law.

And, in accordance with the law, we say they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2410</b></font><br><br>



have lost the right to review.  They disagree, then there

is  a process.  So, at every stage, I think it should  be

clear  that  Singapore's negotiation  position  has  had,

uppermost, the overriding interest of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

both  Singapore  and  Malaysia have agreed  to  sign  the

special  agreement on the 6th of next month to refer  the

Pedra  Branca  matter  to  the  International  Court   of

Justice.   May I ask the Minister how long will  the  ICJ

take  to  resolve this problem and, during  this  period,

what is Singapore's stand on the management of this small

island?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I wish I could give the hon.

Member  a  specific deadline as to when  the  Court  will

decide  after  the  signing of the agreement,  but  I  am

unable  to do that.  There are certain timelines.   After

signing  the agreement, within so many months, each  side

must  submit  certain kinds of documents.   And  after  a

particular  date,  each side must reply  to  the  other's

documents,  and so on, in what is known as the pleadings.

Then, a date is set for hearing.  When a date will be set

for  hearing  depends on the workload of the  court,  how

many other cases there are in the queue, and so on.   So,

I  am unable to give him a precise answer, but I think it

will take at least about two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, what happens? Nothing happens,

because we are in ownership, control and possession,  and

exercising  sovereignty  over  the  island.    And   that

continues.   That  is  the status  quo.   And  that  will

continue until the Court has decided, and it will  change

only if the Court decides otherwise.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> In the

Minister's concluding remarks on the Pedra Branca matter,

he said that the consequences for both countries would be

costly.   Could he clarify what exactly is meant by  that

statement?  In terms of our navy and air force around the

Pedra  Branca area, I think they face continual agitation

from the Malaysian forces.  Could the Minister

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2411</b></font><br><br>

enlighten us on what are the instructions given  to  them

in such instances?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I think the closing part of my

statement on Pedra Branca must be quite clear.  In  other

words, we have intrusions.  As I have said, there will be

incidents,  there will be accidents, and we have  a  high

risk of loss of lives, damage, and there will be a lot of

consequences.  I do not have to spell this out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to her second question, what are the instructions

given, I have no doubt that the Defence Minister, Dr Tony

Tan,  would  have  given whatever instructions  that  are

necessary  for  us to maintain our territorial  integrity

and sovereignty.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> The Minister said that our

common   bilateral   interests   exceed   our   bilateral

differences.  Can I ask the Minister how does he see  the

two    countries   cooperating   and   increasing   their

cooperation, especially given the present atmosphere?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I hope Ms Irene Ng will

understand.   I do not want to repeat.  I  think  I  have

answered the question posed in a different form by Mr Tan

Soo  Khoon.  I answered that there are areas for economic

cooperation and, in answer to Prof. Ngiam, I talked about

cooperation  in  security  and  law  enforcement   areas,

cooperation in the wider area in ASEAN and so on.  So,  I

think  there  are areas for cooperation,  and  we  should

endeavour  to continue in those areas and try to  resolve

these issues in a way that does not mar such cooperation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  Dr  Tan Cheng Bock has observed  that,  to  the

Malaysians, no solution is their solution, and I  believe

Dr  Lily  Neo has alluded to the loose talk of war.   The

situation of no-peace no-war is not good for both  sides.

There  may be an accident and a war can happen.  In 1914,

hon.  Members  would know that the First  World  War  was

started  by  just the shooting of one man.   So,  in  our

case, I think we should not allow this kind of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2412</b></font><br><br>



situation, where there is no-peace no-war, to exist.   In

this light, I would like to know whether or not Singapore

is  willing to make a standing offer to Malaysia to  have

the  outstanding matters arbitrated or to go  before  the

International  Court of Justice, since the  Minister  has

said  that it needs the consensus of both sides to go  to

the help of a third party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is: has the situation at Pedra

Branca  improved  since  the  recent  statement  of   the

Minister  for  Defence,  Dr  Tony  Tan,  with  regard  to

intrusion  of  Malaysian naval vessels in  our  Singapore

territorial waters?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The answer to the first question

on whether we would make a standing offer, is yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Have we made the offer?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Yes, because we offered to go to

the  Permanent  Court of Arbitration, and they  said  no.

And, as is clear from my speech, since they have said  no

to  that, to resolve the impasse, we said, "Look, let  us

follow  the  provisions in the Water  Agreements."   But,

actually, that is a move that they have already commenced

by  issuing a notice.  So, we have commented and we  have

said that we are prepared to take that route.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the situation on the ground at Pedra Branca

improved?  My understanding from my discussions  with  Dr

Tony Tan is that the situation has not improved.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> I shall take one last

clarification.  Mr Chandra Mohan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm

Deputy   Speaker,  perhaps  we  may  need   to   consider

alternative  forms of discussion to try and  resolve  the

problem  or, at least, minimise the problem.  Would  this

House  consider  alternatives?  For instance,  if  it  is

possible,  let  us  disseminate information  as  much  as

possible  in Singapore - which is being done now  by  the

Hon.  Minister, which is a positive point.  Let the  mass

media disseminate that and perhaps on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2413</b></font><br><br>



Internet.  Let the Malaysian press be told to disseminate

there  too, because this is a serious problem.  I  cannot

understand  why human beings need to have  this  kind  of

problems  when the citizenry, the people,  just  want  to

carry  on  with life.  And if there is a problem  and  an

impasse between Ministers or Cabinet, I think let us look

for alternatives.   I would even suggest ---

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chandra Mohan, can

you please ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Yes. Would the Minister

consider  a  group of parliamentarians from  Malaysia  to

appear  before  the  Parliament in  Singapore,  and  vice

versa,  to  present  our  cases to  each  Parliament  and

present   the  facts?   And  by  having  this   kind   of

dissemination  of information, would it somehow  minimise

the  problem,  and the Ministers with powers  would  know

what their responsibilities are in trying to resolve  the

problem?   And the people's power would sort of  override

and  say, "Let us resolve the problem."  Because  we  are

not  finding a solution.  And, over the years,  this  has

happened.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If indeed I was in a position to

order  the  Malaysian press to publish my  statement,  of

course, I would do so.  But I cannot quarrel with what Mr

Chandra   Mohan  has  said  about  the  widest   possible

dissemination of the facts.  I agree with the  objective.

We  shall endeavour to do so, but I hope he will also  be

part  of this process as a Nominated MP.  I do know  that

he  has contacts in Malaysia.  We should use all possible

contacts  to disseminate the facts, just as  we  need  to

understand  what motivates them to do or  say  what  they

have done and said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to alternative forms of discussion, I am not

averse  to  any and every possibility which can  aid  the

process of solving bilateral disputes.  And I have  never

taken  the  position that the promotion of  goodwill  and

good relations between countries is the sole preserve  of

the  Foreign  Minister.  It is not.  It  must  involve  a

whole spectrum of Ministers, officials, non-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2414</b></font><br><br>



governmental bodies, and parliamentarians have a role  to

play.    But  on  the  specific  suggestion  of   sending

Singapore parliamentarians, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I do  not

know  how  we will form such a group to go up to Malaysia

and  present the facts in the Malaysian Parliament.   How

different   would  it  be  for  the  Minister   and   his

negotiating  team presenting it, face to  face  with  the

Malaysian  Minister  who  has the  full  powers  and  the

direction  to decide?  If he thinks he can resolve  that,

then  let us consider that.  But, as a general principle,

and  as Foreign Minister, I welcome all suggestions,  but

they must be practical and workable.

<div align="center"><b>ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mdm

Deputy Speaker, I beg to move "That the Bill be now  read

a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Road Traffic Act (RTA)

for the following broad purposes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to revise the penalty framework for weekend

and  off-peak car offenders.  I will refer to  them  from

now on as off-peak car offenders;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to require the disclosure of vehicle recalls

and rectification of safety-related vehicle defects;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to provide a legislative framework for the

licensing of taxi companies;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to enable enforcement action to be taken in

respect  of  jaywalking  at bus interchanges,  false  and

misleading  statements made in relation to vehicle  type-approval     and    de-registration    processes,     and

indiscriminate parking of heavy vehicles; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to formalise existing procedures and to

revise outdated definitions and procedures.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the key provisions in the Bill

for the proposed amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the penalty framework for off-peak car

offenders.   My  Ministry has reviewed the penalties  for

off-peak   car   offenders   who   tamper   with    their

supplementary  licences.  Typically, such  offenders  are

caught  with supplementary licences that have  torn  tabs

that are pasted back. Presumably, the offender had pasted

the tabs back in order to re-use the licence.  Currently,

offenders  who  are  convicted of  tampering  with  their

supplementary  licences are given  jail  sentences,  even

though  the Road Traffic Act does not require a mandatory

jail sentence.  As a result, the careers of the offenders

are  likely  to be ruined.  The jail sentence  is  unduly

harsh for those who are convicted for the first time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the severity of the penalty for first-time

offenders,  clause 13 amends section 129 of  the  RTA  to

remove  the  custodial sentence provision for  first-time

offenders.   However, to emphasise that it is  a  serious

offence  to  tamper  with  a supplementary  licence,  the

maximum  fine  will  be raised from  $5,000  to  $10,000.

Repeat   offenders   who   tamper   with   off-peak   car

supplementary licences will face stiffer penalties.  They

will  now  be  fined up to a maximum of $20,000  or  face

imprisonment  for a term of not more than  12  months  or

both.   This  represents a substantial  increase  in  the

maximum fine from $5,000 to $20,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also taken the opportunity to

rationalise the penalty framework for some of  the  other

off-peak car related offences.  Currently, offenders  who

drive  off-peak cars without valid supplementary licences

are  liable  to  a fine, which is subject  to  a  minimum

pegged  to  the  road tax of a normal  car  in  the  same

category.   This  means  that the  minimum  fine  quantum

varies according to the engine capacity of the car,  even

though the savings derived from the offence are the same,

regardless of the engine capacity or road tax of the car.

Hence, clause 3 amends section 11A of the Act to de-link

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2416</b></font><br><br>



the  penalty framework for the offence of driving an off-peak  car without a supplementary licence from the  value

of  the  road tax.  It also aligns the penalty  framework

for  this  offence with other off-peak car  offences,  by

setting a maximum rather than a minimum fine.  Under  the

new  provision, first-time offenders will face fines  not

exceeding  $5,000 while repeat offenders will be  subject

to fines not exceeding $10,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 11A(4) deals with offenders who falsify the

number  plates  of off-peak cars, so that their  vehicles

can pass off as normal vehicles.  The Government takes  a

very  serious view of these offences.  Clause 3  enhances

the  penalty  for such offences by replacing the  current

fine,  which is based on a minimum of 24 months  of  road

tax,  with  a  more definitive penalty  which  carries  a

maximum  fine  of  $20,000 and a  provision  for  a  jail

sentence.  This new penalty for this offence is  in  line

with  that proposed for repeat offenders who tamper  with

off-peak car supplementary licences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the amendments serve to rationalise the

penalty framework for off-peak car offences and make  the

penalties  more  reflective  of  the  severity   of   the

offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of amendments deals with vehicle recall

requirements  to better protect the interest  of  vehicle

owners.  Currently, vehicle recalls by manufacturers  for

defects  due to the design or production process  of  the

vehicle are carried out only through the co-operation and

goodwill  of  motor traders. Clause 5  introduces  a  new

section 23A to make manufacturers and dealers responsible

for  disclosing vehicle safety-related defects to the LTA

and the affected vehicle owners.  To ensure the safety of

the affected vehicles, manufacturers and dealers will  be

required  to effect the necessary rectification  to  such

defects.   Manufacturers and dealers who fail to disclose

safety-related   defects   and   effect   the    required

rectification will face heavy penalties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on now to the amendments pertaining to

the taxi industry.  A

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2417</b></font><br><br>



major  source  of dissatisfaction with the taxi  industry

today  is  the mismatch between supply and demand  during

peak  periods,  and poor service standards.   To  address

these  concerns,  clause  11 of the  Bill  introduces  an

entire  new  part to set up a framework for licensing  of

taxi  companies,  with  a view to  raising  taxi  service

standards.   The new licensing framework will  also  pave

the   way  for  the  further  deregulation  of  the  taxi

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have put in place the rules on how taxi

companies  can  be  set  up  and  how  they  are  to   be

accountable  for their service standards,  we  will  lift

controls  on the number of taxi companies, and the  fleet

quota  imposed on each company.  Such a move  will  allow

the market to respond freely to demand, thereby providing

a  better  match  between supply and demand.   This  will

complete our move to liberalise the taxi industry,  which

started with the de-regulation of taxi fares in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new framework, any person who wishes to

run  a  taxi  business  must apply for  a  taxi  operator

licence.   Applicants  will  be  assessed  based   on   a

comprehensive set of criteria.  This would include  their

financial   resources   and   plans   for   providing   a

satisfactory  service.  Applicants will  be  required  to

operate  a minimum fleet size of 400 taxis, and  will  be

given four years to achieve this.  This will ensure  that

the new operators will have sufficient economies of scale

to  provide a good service, for example, by being able to

invest in GPS-based taxi booking services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the licensing framework, LTA will impose

licensing  conditions aimed at improving overall  service

levels  in  the taxi industry.  These conditions  include

minimum Quality of Service standards and compliance  with

audit  directions.   The  taxi  companies  will  also  be

required  to  pay  a  licence fee, which  will  be  based

largely  on  the  principle of cost recovery.   LTA  will

formulate  benchmark performance standards and track  the

taxi companies' actual performance.  Companies which fail

to  meet  these benchmarks will be subjected to financial

penalties,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2418</b></font><br><br>



which  are  capped  at  $100,000 per  contravention.   In

severe and recalcitrant cases, their licences may also be

suspended or terminated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the licensing framework, LTA will also be

empowered   to  specify  codes  of  practice  and   issue

directives  in several areas, including the  preservation

and  promotion  of  fair  competition  in  the  industry.

Together  with the introduction of a licensing  framework

for taxi companies, LTA will be revising the disciplinary

framework for errant taxi drivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, LTA handles all disciplinary cases for taxi

drivers  according to internal procedures and guidelines.

LTA  will  be  revising the framework  to  make  it  more

transparent and to enable the taxi companies  to  play  a

role  in  disciplining their errant  taxi  drivers.   The

revised  framework  will be similar to  Traffic  Police's

Driver  Improvement Points System.  The  details  of  the

offences  and  the disciplinary framework  will  be  made

known to taxi drivers and the public in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised taxi driver vocational licence demerit

points system will complement the licensing framework for

taxi  companies.  Together, they will bring about  better

taxi  services  for commuters, and pave  the  way  for  a

liberalised,   competitive  and  more   responsive   taxi

industry in Singapore.  LTA will shortly release  details

of the licensing framework for the taxi companies and the

taxi driver vocational licence demerit points system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also enable enforcement actions to be

taken in several areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill enables the Registrar to

empower employees of bus operators to take action against

anyone   caught  jaywalking  at  a  bus  interchange   or

terminus.   In recent years, there have been a number  of

serious accidents where pedestrians were hit by reversing

buses while taking short cuts across bus parking bays  at

interchanges.   The bus operators have  put  up  advisory

signs  and  fencing to deter pedestrians from  jaywalking

within the bus park areas.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2419</b></font><br><br>



However, they have been unable to act against persons who

ignore  the  signs.  Allowing the bus operators  to  take

enforcement action against jaywalking therefore serves to

ensure the safety of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 129 of the RTA, false or misleading

statements  or  declarations  made  in  relation  to  the

registration  of a vehicle are punishable. However,  this

provision does not cover similar offences in relation  to

vehicle  type-approval and de-registration  applications.

Clause  13 extends the scope of section 129 to allow  for

enforcement  action  to  be taken against  vehicle  type-approval and de-registration applications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 empowers the Minister to make rules to

regulate  the  keeping  and the use  of  heavy  vehicles.

Currently,  owners of heavy vehicles have to  demonstrate

that  they have approved parking places before  they  are

allowed  to  renew  their road  tax.   They  do  this  by

furnishing  their  Vehicle Parking  Certificates  (VPCs).

The  VPCs are issued by the operator of the heavy vehicle

park  at which they have their designated parking places.

There  are  39,200 heavy vehicle parking lots island-wide

compared  to  the  population of 27,000 registered  heavy

vehicles.   As  such, there are more  than  enough  heavy

vehicle  parking  places, an excess of 12,000  additional

parking places than there are vehicles.  However, despite

having  their  designated  parking  places,  some   heavy

vehicle  drivers  still  park  their  vehicles  overnight

illegally  or  indiscriminately along  public  roads  and

within  private housing estates.  Usually, this  involves

drivers  or individual owners who were unable  to  obtain

designated  parking places near to their  homes.   I  can

understand  their  preference  to  park  their   vehicles

nearby,  so  that they can walk in the morning  to  where

their  vehicles are parked.  Unfortunately, HDB  and  URA

have  stopped providing new heavy vehicle parking  places

within  HDB estates.  This is because of noise  pollution

and  safety  concerns.  URA is also not able to  allocate

new heavy vehicle parks

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2420</b></font><br><br>



next  to HDB estates because in most areas, the currently

available  large  plots of vacant land are  usually  land

that  has  been  reserved  for development  in  the  near

future.   As such, these drivers should, like  the  other

drivers  who  are  parking their vehicles  in  designated

parking places, make the necessary transport arrangements

to   get  to  and  from  their  vehicles  parked  in  the

designated parking places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will enable enforcement actions to be

taken  against indiscriminate parking of heavy  vehicles.

But  before LTA proceeds to take enforcement actions,  it

will provide a grace period for owners and drivers to  be

informed  about this new regulation.  As there are  still

some vacant parking lots available near HDB estates,  LTA

will work with URA and HDB to make known to heavy vehicle

owners  and drivers where these additional parking spaces

are  still available. In the meantime, I would urge heavy

vehicle    owners   and   drivers   who    are    parking

indiscriminately  at night to make appropriate  transport

arrangements  to  travel  between  their  home  and   the

designated parking places of their heavy vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments proposed under the Bill

concern   the  refinement  of  existing  procedures   and

definitions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in summary, this Bill contains several

amendments  aimed  largely at supporting  new  regulatory

frameworks,   as  well  as  formalising   and   improving

procedures  for better administration and more  effective

enforcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  I  wish to speak in support of  this  amendment

Bill.   There are several areas of amendments listed  out

by   the  Minister  and,  in  general,  I  support  these

amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I want to focus today on this issue

of  licensing  of taxi operators.  This is  an  important

feature in this list of amendments, and it focuses mainly

on  the  legislative  framework  for  licensing  of  taxi

operators which will come in place.  We have heard a  lot

of  complaints  and we read about them regularly  in  the

papers  from  the public concerning this call  for  taxis

during peak hours or rainy period, and this is one of the

issues  which I suppose the Bill addresses,  ie,  service

standards of taxi companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that while there are certain conditions

which are attached to this legislative framework for  the

licensing  of taxi operators within the context  of  more

competition,  as  spelt out in section  111,  I  am  not,

however,  entirely persuaded that by licensing conditions

alone,  we  can  properly  and  adequately  tackle   this

question   of   service  standards  during   periods   of

heightened  demand,  such  as during  holiday  season  or

during  peak hours and rainy season, and so on.  While  I

can  understand  public  sentiments  when  taxis  do  not

respond  during holiday seasons and the attempts made  by

the  Minister to try and correct them, we can think about

issues  or instances of airport service standards  during

Chinese New Year, or shopping centres, and so on,  during

rainy periods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a journalist wrote a long piece decrying

the transport service standards in Singapore when she had

to  wait  for hours for taxis at Centrepoint  during  the

Christmas  season  or  rainy period.   I  appreciate  the

frustration  of  any member of the public  waiting  at  a

stand  for a taxi which does not turn up.  But I  suggest

that we should try to understand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2422</b></font><br><br>



the problem of delivering service to satisfy peak demands

in  its  proper  context.  This kind of  heightened  peak

demand  is  not  something new.  Just a  heightened  peak

demand,    epitomises   by   the   long   queue   outside

Centrepoint's taxi stand, cannot be satisfied within that

window,  especially when the holiday shopping  season  is

coupled with a rainy period.  It is the same, whether  we

are  talking  about waiting for a taxi in Centrepoint  or

waiting for a taxi outside Harrods in London.  It is  the

same problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not trying to explain away the problem of taxi

operators'  service standard.  But it is only logical  to

say  that  when  the demand within the window  period  is

heightened,  as  is  expected  during  rainy  or  holiday

seasons, some mechanism for rationing and allocation must

be  allowed  to  operate, to solve this  problem  of  the

frustrated  long  queue wait.  We have to  solve  such  a

problem  in  micro-management terms as best as  possible.

And  it  is  not  fair, I would say, to  blast  away  the

overall  transport system and decry the world's  standard

service that we have delivered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, economists have been talking about this

and the answer comes from the time of Adam Smith.  It  is

called  the  price  mechanism in  allocating  of  limited

resources.   Whenever there is a long queue  waiting  for

taxis  and  the  taxis are not available,  we  should  be

wondering  where  they  are.   If  the  taxis  are  fully

occupied in servicing all the other parts of the  island,

and if we are so concerned about that particular belt  or

shopping  point in town that must be serviced,  then  the

answer is to put in a price differential factor through a

proper  pricing mechanism sufficiently enough to  attract

the supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I wonder whether the Minister, in this taxi

operating  licence and service standard  framework,  will

also  instruct  the  LTA to think along  that  line.   We

should allow for the price loading interesting enough for

the  taxis to ply into the city, not just to attract  the

flow  of  taxis  into  the city but also  to  offset  the

additional cost of coming into the city because of ERP

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2423</b></font><br><br>



charges.   And  a price loading must also be sufficiently

attractive  for  taxi drivers to come into  town  because

there  are  so many other demands for their  services  in

other places at those times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said this, it is possible that too many

taxis  are  changing shifts during certain  hours.   This

actually  can  be  adjusted by administrative  rules  for

operators so that they do not change shifts at one  time,

taking  away  taxis during a certain  time  window.   The

authority  can ask operators to actually smooth  out  the

availability  within  a certain band  or  plus  or  minus

certain percentage so that the changing of shifts can  be

actually  distributed  across a  day  period.   Then  you

smooth  out  this  aberration in availability  of  supply

during  those changing shift periods.  Another  thing  to

regulate  the  supply is actually to  require  a  certain

minimum  logging of mileage by taxis, which  I  think  is

presently being done by the LTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support these new amendments for taxi

operators, I would also caution that we should let market

forces  more play and more room to play, so that  choices

can  be offered to the customers.  Customers should  also

be  realistic about service standard at peak times and be

prepared  to  bear with increased charges for  delivering

services at those hours.  These amendments also pave  the

way  for the liberalisation of the taxi industry and  the

Minister  has  said that it will probably  be  the  final

touch to the completion of this liberalisation effort.  I

welcome  this.  However, while deregulation is  welcomed,

basic standards of deliverables must be set with rules to

comply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sections 111(g) and (h) of the Bill spell out

the  need  for  the operators to meet the  guidelines  on

codes   of  practice,  performance  standards  and   fair

competition.   In the past, I understand there  had  been

half-yearly  performance yardsticks  by  which  operators

have  to  fulfill  and I would like to ask  the  Minister

whether  operators,  in general, up  to  now  meet  these

yardsticks.  I suppose these include

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2424</b></font><br><br>



utilisation   rate,  the  engaged  mileage  rate,   radio

despatch  rate, and so on.  If so, what are  the  further

yardsticks or performance indicators that he has in  mind

that the LTA will need to target.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing these performance indices (KPIs), we

must  not  tilt the index list so that the  operators  in

fulfilling  them  end  up giving a  buyer's  product  and

output  which  will  not  benefit  the  larger  group  of

consumers.   What do I mean?  If a KPI list is  drawn  up

for  monitoring  and it has too much  weight  given,  for

example, to measuring booking performance, then operators

will  play this game.  Or the LTA might want to put heavy

weight  on  utilisation rate such as, for  example,  paid

mileage out of a total mileage plied by the taxis.  Then,

we  may  end up with most taxis waiting around for calls.

If  that happens, this would work against the benefit  of

the  public who need taxis for street hire.  So  the  end

result  is that the poor hirer on the street suffers  and

taxis  will not be available to the people on the street,

while meeting the demand for those who want to book.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in implementing these regulations, I urge the

Ministry to apply the light regulatory touch.  We  should

give market forces more play and more room to play.   The

more  regulations we put in, the less room there  is  for

competitive  market forces to be at  work,  and  the  net

result is a loss of consumer welfare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory costs should be minimum so that the

consumer does not end up paying for all these.   While  I

am  a firm believer in relative pricing mechanism to draw

out the allocation, I am not urging for heavy fees to  be

slapped  on in a non-discriminatory way.  That  way  will

not  allow  for the allocation mechanism  to  work.   The

price mechanism must give room for differentiation in the

price  level  for  allocation.   Slapping  on  additional

licensing fees alone is not necessarily the solution.  In

the same way, any cost of administration or audit, or for

compliance,  should not be passed on  to  the  operators.

This  is  important.   In times like  this  when  we  are

concerned  about the competitiveness in our  private  and

public sectors

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>



of  the  economy,  we  should not pass  down  costs  from

administration,  which properly should  be  part  of  the

bureaucracy,   to  the  private  sector.    Because   the

efficiency of the bureaucracy and the public sector  must

also  be  subject to the rigours of audit and performance

and to the yardsticks of efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I

rise  in support of the Bill.  First of all, I would like

to  applaud  the Ministry of Transport for introducing  a

legislative  framework  for the  licensing  of  the  taxi

industry,  which plays an important role in  our  tourism

and  transportation development.  But I am not  sure  how

this  licensing  framework is  going  to  address  public

dissatisfaction  with  the  taxi  industry  and   improve

service for the commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key issues we have to look at first is

whether taxis are considered public transport service  or

a   mode   of  private  transportation.   In  the  Public

Transport  Council's  "Framework  of  Regulating   Public

Transport  Services",  the Land  Transport  Authority  is

acknowledged  to have the responsibilities  of  licensing

and  regulating  rapid transit system  as  well  as  taxi

services.   But,  in  reality, taxis  do  not  enjoy  any

benefits that are accorded to public transport providers.

Be  it the ERP charges, vehicle tax structure or the COE,

taxis  are basically treated no differently from  private

cars.   Yet,  taxi  drivers  have  to  abide  by  various

regulations  and  face constraints that  are  imposed  on

private car drivers.  So, perhaps ERP charges are one  of

the  key  reasons  for the complaint of mismatch  between

supply and demand during peak hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what many thought, taxis do pick up

passengers inside the CBD at peak hours.  But  once  they

drive  out of the CBD, most would cruise outside the  CBD

as  there are not many passengers who travel into the CBD

during  week day evenings.  Most taxi drivers  would  not

want  to  risk driving back into the CBD without a  fare,

pay  ERP charges and put up with the traffic jams in  the

hope of picking up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2426</b></font><br><br>



passengers  within  the  CBD a second  time.   Naturally,

without  this  turnaround, peak hour demand  will  always

exceed supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I then look at the proposed licensing

framework  again  and wonder whether it will  solve  such

service shortcomings and bring about improvements.  There

are  about  19,000 taxis on our roads today.   Of  these,

some  18,000, or 95%, are managed by the big operators  - Comfort,  City  Cab  and TIBS.  They  are  either  public

listed  or  owned  by public listed  entities.   I  would

assume  that these operators do care about their  service

standards, are concerned about public complaints  and  do

have  the  resources to invest in training and facilities

to maintain certain performance standards.  How would the

proposed  licensing  framework cause  taxi  companies  to

improve  their  service  beyond  what  the  existing  big

operators  are already doing?  It is not that  I  do  not

support  the  need for taxi operators to be licensed  and

regulated.   My  concern is about the big taxi  companies

passing   on  the  cost  of  compliance  to  the   38,000

individual  taxi  drivers or to taxi commuters  who  make

600,000 trips daily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are an estimated 85,000 persons holding taxi

vocational  driving  licence in our  economy.   With  the

current  poor economic conditions, there is  a  queue  of

people  waiting to be taxi drivers.  The income  of  taxi

drivers has fallen by 10-15% because of the weak economy.

Commuters' expectations and pressure on the taxi  drivers

to  meet higher standards continue to rise.  Taxi drivers

dare  not  speak up against their operators for  fear  of

losing  their  rice  bowl.  In  the  meantime,  the  taxi

companies  are  shifting  the operational  and  financial

risks and liabilities to their drivers.  The taxi licence

thus  has  become  a  money printing machine,  where  the

licence  holder simply sits back and rents out  its  taxi

without much financial risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much taxi drivers can do if operators

decide  to  shift their cost burden to them,  or  not  to

share  any  increase in revenue with them.  For  example,

LTA  recently  approved a taxi operator's application  to

place an advertising panel sitting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2427</b></font><br><br>



on  top  of the back of the taxi boot.  The panel  covers

half   of  the  rear  view  of  the  taxi  driver.   This

compromises  the  safety  of the driver,  passengers  and

other  road  users.   If the panel is damaged,  the  taxi

driver  would most certainly be made responsible for  the

repairs.   But how much of this advertising revenue  does

the taxi company share with the driver?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to move on to the revised

penalty for off-peak car offenders.  Considering that the

total  number  of weekend or off-peak cars registered  in

the last 10 years is only about 7,000, I am surprised  to

learn  that  close to 200 people have received  custodial

sentences   for   tampering  with   their   supplementary

licences.  I fully support the revised penalty framework,

as  I  see this as a necessary move by Parliament to step

in  and  entrench in the law the desired  punishment  for

first-time offenders and to have a higher maximum fine in

place of a custodial sentence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to formalising procedures to make

manufacturers  and  dealers  responsible  for  disclosing

vehicle safety related defects and rectifying them,  this

is  indeed  a  good move.  This is particularly  so  when

there are now more and more parallel importers.  But with

the relative ease of setting up a parallel import agency,

one would also expect more of such agencies going out  of

business.   Who could the car owner turn to in the  event

that  his dealer has gone bust?  And instead of requiring

notice  of  the  defects  to be  given  in  the  form  of

newspaper  advertisements, would it not be more effective

if  media  releases were issued and carried by the  local

news  networks?   The dealer can then be  charged  a  fee

based  on  the number of defective vehicles he  has  sold

which needed to be recalled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this Bill also deals with the indiscriminate

parking  of  heavy vehicles.  I believe the  solution  to

illegal  parking of heavy vehicles is not just in beefing

up  enforcement  and  introducing  more  regulations  and

fines,   but  to  couple  strict  enforcement  with   the

provision of more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2428</b></font><br><br>



lots  for such vehicles at more accessible parking  areas

closer  to the housing estates.  I would like to strongly

urge  the Ministry of Transport to work closely with  the

Ministry  of National Development to solve this  problem.

Heavy  vehicle  drivers  play an important  role  in  our

development as a logistics and transportation  hub.   For

example,  a port driver has to be on call and get  up  at

odd hours of the night and morning to move containers and

keep  our  port bustling around the clock.  I believe  we

owe it to them to provide them with some transportational

and  infrastructural support, to help them in their  work

duties.   We cannot just leave them to tackle  their  own

problems  and  inconveniences, while we  take  pride  and

applaud  when  our  port is ranked the  world's  best  or

busiest.  Let us not forget the individuals and the  nuts

and bolts that help drive our success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Road

Traffic  (Amendment)  Bill  authorises  the  Minister  to

punish  the  drivers of heavy vehicles for indiscriminate

parking.  Instead of parking their heavy vehicles in  the

designated  places,  these drivers chose  to  park  their

buses  and lorries near the HDB estates or in the private

housing  estates, resulting in a lot of  complaints  from

the residents there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owners of these heavy vehicles have actually

purchased  the licences to have their vehicles parked  at

the designated vehicle parks. Yet, the drivers choose  to

park  these  vehicles in the housing  estates.   I  think

there  must be a  reason why they are doing so.   I  have

spoken  to  some  of these drivers and I  now  understand

their problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two important factors. Most of the

drivers  of  these heavy vehicles, including lorries  and

buses,  are  living in HDB estates.  They belong  to  the

lower middle income group of people.  Their working hours

are irregular, having to leave home early and return home

late  every  day.  Naturally, they would prefer  to  park

their vehicles at proper parking places near their flats.

But parking lots for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2429</b></font><br><br>



heavy vehicles are not readily available near the housing

estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of the Land Transport

Authority,  if an owner wants to renew the road  tax  for

his  heavy  vehicle, he must produce  a  Vehicle  Parking

Certificate (VPC) to prove that he has a proper place  to

park  his  vehicle.    Since such parking  lots  are  not

available near their HDB estates, he would have no choice

but to purchase a VPC for parking at a designated vehicle

park  at  some remote industrial estate, just to  satisfy

the  requirement for the renewal of road tax.   As  these

parking  places are far away, private bus  drivers  would

have  to  leave home before 5 o'clock in the  morning  to

ferry  the students to school and lorry drivers too  have

to  leave  home  early to avoid the morning  peak  hours.

More  often than not, public transportation such  as  MRT

and  buses  are not available in the early hours  of  the

morning.  In the circumstances, they decide to park their

vehicles somewhere near their HDB estates, and risk being

booked  for  such parking offences and incur heavy  fines

every month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, some 2,000 parking lots for heavy vehicles

were  allocated  in Jurong East, Jalan  Bahar,  Choa  Chu

Kang,  Bukit  Panjang  and Bukit Gombak.   The  needs  of

drivers  in  the western part of Singapore are  basically

satisfied.   But such parking facilities in  the  eastern

and  northern  parts  of Singapore, particularly  in  the

newer  HDB estates in Sengkang, Woodlands, etc, are still

lacking.  I  hope that the Minister would understand  the

plight of these drivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister mentioned that the total

number  of  available parking lots exceeds the number  of

heavy vehicles registered in Singapore. But most of these

parking  lots  are  situated at  industrial  estates  and

remote  places which are impractical for the  drivers  to

use  them.  Yes, there are parking lots, but the  drivers

just  cannot  make  use of them. Therefore,  I  urge  the

Minister  to liaise with the HDB and URA to  open  up  or

develop more parking lots for heavy vehicles in order  to

meet  their demands.  Lorries and bus drivers have played

a great role in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2430</b></font><br><br>



our  nation building and economic development. We  should

do something to help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With advanced IT, can LTA dispense with the need to

produce  the  VPC when renewing the road  tax  for  these

heavy  vehicles,  just like the way we  renew  our  radio

licence  with the road tax of our motorcars?  This  would

save the owners the trouble of having to go personally to

LTA just to physically produce the VPC.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  on  the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill,  I  will

touch mainly on clause 11 which refers to the new Part VA

of the Bill that sets out the framework for the licensing

of  taxi operators with the aim of bringing about  better

taxi services for commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting a licensing framework in place, the

amendments   will   provide  a  direction   for   further

possibilities in deregulating the taxi industry, such  as

allowing  it  to respond to market forces that  determine

the  supply  of  taxis.  The new section 111A  defines  a

person  who operates a taxi service as one who owns  more

than  one taxi and leases them to individual drivers  for

the  purpose of providing taxis for hire or booking.  The

insertion  of  Part VA is timely for the  taxi  industry.

This is especially so in view of NTUC Comfort's plans  to

merge  with Delgro to form a huge transport company  with

the potential to monopolise the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the merger, NTUC Comfort will be the market

leader  with 17,000 taxis, or 90% of the market,  leaving

TIBS taxis as the other operator with only 2,000 taxis to

compete.  This Bill will then allow other players, be  it

big or small, to enter the market to compete.  However, I

wish  to highlight that, while the legal framework allows

players  to  compete within the rules,  it  must  not  be

stifling to participants who are comparatively of smaller

organisation sizes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must try to create an environment for competition

to be fair, irrespective of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2431</b></font><br><br>



the  size of market participants.  Competition should  be

based not only on cost but also on services.  New section

111D(1)(g) states that the Ministry must specify codes of

practice and standards of performances in connection with

the  preservation and promotion of fair competition.   An

industry that merely consists of two players is certainly

not  healthy  for our public transport system.   Perhaps,

the  Transport Ministry may, as a start, promote a scheme

to  encourage successful taxi drivers to band together to

form  their  own  corporations to hold licences  as  taxi

operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to raise some concerns relating

to taxi drivers.  Taxi drivers are the frontline faces of

the  industry.   How  they  carry  out  the  services  to

commuters  will  determine  the  success  of   the   taxi

operators  that rent the vehicles to them.  Collectively,

they are a potent force in promoting goodwill to tourists

and  a  conduit for the latest news in town.   They  work

long  hours  and,  most  of the time,  in  heavy  traffic

conditions  under wet and hot weather.  It takes  stamina

and  endurance to drive a taxi for eight to ten  hours  a

day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, regulations must be in place to monitor the

taxi operators' house rules, which have to be observed by

the  taxi drivers and which may, at times, be onerous  to

the  taxi  drivers when these rules are taken in addition

to  the  usual  regulatory obligations of  the  industry.

Such  monitoring would go a long way in making sure  that

the  taxi  operators give due consideration to  the  taxi

drivers   in   their  pursuit  to  provide   better   and

competitive services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New operators who are successful should also be

encouraged to provide assistance schemes to taxi drivers.

NTUC Comfort has a retirement scheme which has begun this

month.   Taxi drivers with at least ten years of  service

will  receive  a  lump-sum ranging from $300  to  $1,400.

They  will also receive annual amounts ranging from  $100

to   $400.    TIBS  taxis  also  has  an  incentive   and

progressive  bonus  of up to $1,300 every  year  for  its

drivers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority, which I assume will

continue to regulate the taxi industry, should take  into

account  new incentives to encourage taxi drivers  to  be

proud  of  their vocation, in which this new  legislation

has  not taken into account.  Provisions, such as  relief

packages  for  taxi drivers in the event of  an  economic

downturn,  can  be  mandatory for taxi operators  to  set

aside.   This  safety net provided for  by  the  industry

players will be more and more crucial when commuters have

more  choices  of transport to choose from,  causing  the

earnings  of  taxi  drivers to fall  heavily  during  bad

times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an illustration, a taxi hirer pays about $100 per

day  as hirer's fee, which is usually borne by the  hirer

and  his relief driver.  In addition, diesel cost per day

comes  up to about $15, after discount.  This means that,

each  day, a taxi driver has an overhead cost of at least

$115  to recover before seeing any profits.  In order  to

make  a  decent income each month, a taxi driver  has  to

drive  long  hours to earn more, in order  to  cover  his

fixed  overhead  costs.  This may be at  the  expense  of

maintaining a safe level of concentration for  themselves

and  other  road  users.  A relief  package  during  poor

economic conditions will help in reducing business  costs

to the taxi drivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC Comfort, as a responsible taxi operator, has

already  extended a relief package to taxi drivers  since

November  2001, which will last till August  2003.   This

package  consists of a monthly rental rebate  of  $40  in

cash  and $20 worth of diesel, adding up to a $60  relief

package.  It has also promised to sell diesel to  cabbies

at  a discounted price.  However, I urge the Ministry  to

monitor such relief schemes, in order to do more to  help

taxi drivers tide over tough times.  This help scheme  is

even  more necessary, as the relationship between drivers

and  operators is no longer that of a cooperative,  where

the  drivers  are  shareholders of  the  cooperative  and

owners of their cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which regulators need to note in

regulating  a robust taxi industry is the taxi operators'

way   of  handling  taxi  drivers'  welfare  after   road

accidents.  Let

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2433</b></font><br><br>



me  illustrate.  For NTUC Comfort drivers, a  deposit  of

$1,500,  excluding  GST,  has  to  be  paid  irregardless

whether the driver was at fault or not.  Deductions would

then  be made from the deposit for repairs when he is  at

fault.  However, if the driver is not at fault, it  takes

up  to  a year for the refund to be made.  The driver  is

further disadvantaged as he would be out of pocket during

the period of repairs to his vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 111C(3)(d) of the Bill states that the

Ministry  will  consider  "the existence  of  other  taxi

services", which is the supply side, "and the demand  for

taxi services" to determine whether to grant a licence to

operate  a  taxi service.  I would like the  Minister  to

clarify  what  are the considerations the  Ministry  will

take into account to determine the number of taxi drivers

and  operators in the market, and what are the guideposts

that  will  signal the Ministry that the  market  may  be

saturated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC Comfort started with a fleet of 1,200 taxis in

1970, rising to 11,000 in 2002.  TIBS taxis started  with

50  taxis  in 1990 and, in 2000, it released its  2,000th

taxi on the road.  This steady increase in the number  of

taxis  has  been even felt by passengers.   A  grassroots

leader  told  me that 10 years ago, one has  to  wait  at

least  20-30  minutes for a cab.  Today, according  to  a

survey  conducted by NTUC Comfort, 90% of passengers  say

they can get a cab within 10 minutes.  While this is good

news  to  the commuters, it translates into lower  income

for drivers, but not necessarily taxi operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, when regulating the taxi industry, fines

and  punishments, as stated in new section 111H for  both

taxi  operators and taxi drivers for offences,  need  not

necessarily  be made in haste for the sake of efficiency,

through imposing heavy fines according to the book.   But

options  must  be in place for a dispute  resolution  and

mediation process, which may eventually lead to either  a

waiver  or reduction of the fine.  This avenue  can  help

taxi drivers who find that the cost of doing the business

in  driving  a  taxi already too high.  The Ministry,  in

planning for a well-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2434</b></font><br><br>



run  taxi industry, should have a market mechanism,  such

as  a dispute resolution and mediation panel that is fair

and  unbiased for taxi drivers and operators to  turn  to

for help when faced with unfair practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe this Bill will provide

a  foundation  for  the Ministry of  Transport  to  allow

healthy competition in the taxi industry which, in  turn,

will be more responsive to changes in the transport needs

of the commuters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

please  allow me to seek clarification from Mr Andy  Gan.

Is he aware that Comfort is a publicly-listed company and

not a NTUC cooperative?

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Yes, I am aware of that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like

to  thank  the four MPs who have spoken, and Mr Yeo  Guat

Kwang,  the  5th MP, who pointed out that Comfort  is  no

longer a NTUC cooperative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will address the points brought up by the Members

in  turn.   Some  of them may overlap, because  they  all

touch on pretty much the same theme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay started by talking about the problems faced

by  the  taxi  industry, particularly the dissatisfaction

with the taxi industry in terms of supply versus demand - that  during peak periods, commuters have to wait  for  a

long time.  And he felt that the price solution is really

the  best mechanism, that when there is a scarce resource

and  there  is a mismatch between supply and demand,  the

price  mechanism needs to come in to make sure that there

is  a  better balance.  I totally agree with Mr Chay that

this  indeed is the case, especially when the  demand  is

not  constant throughout the day.  The commuters complain

about  the  long queues for taxis at peak periods  during

rainy  weather and that, even when there is fine weather,

during  the peak periods, there is never enough.  But  it

is not because taxi drivers are not working.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2435</b></font><br><br>



because  demand far outstrips supply.  So,  the  question

is: Is the supply of taxis in Singapore inadequate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the answer is: No, far from it.

We  actually  have  more taxis per  1,000  population  in

Singapore than any other equivalent major city.   Let  me

explain.  In Singapore today, we have 4.8 taxis per 1,000

population.   This compares with only 2.8 taxis  in  Hong

Kong,  2.9 in New York, 2.6 in London, and 2.3 in  Tokyo.

If  we have almost double the number of taxis compared to

other  places, and despite the fact that we have  a  good

bus  and  MRT system, why is there such a strong mismatch

between  supply  and  demand during  peak  periods?   The

answer,  as  pointed  out  by  Mr  Chay,  is  the   price

mechanism.   In  Singapore, the average fare  for  a  10-kilometre taxi ride costs about $7, compared to $16.70 in

Hong  Kong and $20 in New York and London.  In fact, with

our low taxi fares, 3-4 persons travelling together as  a

group  will  find the taxi fare only a little bit  higher

than if they had taken a bus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not for my Ministry to set taxi fares, as

we  had  deregulated taxi fares already  in  1998.   Taxi

companies  will  need  to strike a good  balance  between

fares that are too low versus raising them too high.  Low

fares  will  result in taxi drivers having to  work  very

long  hours  to  earn a decent living, but will  generate

plenty  of  consumer demand.  On the other  hand,  higher

fares  will give the taxi hirers a better income but  may

reduce taxi ridership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understandably, the taxi companies have been careful

about raising fares in a weak economy.  Also, there is no

shortage  of  taxi  drivers,  as  the  income  is   still

attractive.   But  when the economy  recovers,  the  taxi

industry  will  have to compete with other employers  for

workers  and drivers.  And what the drivers are  able  to

earn,  compared to other jobs, will then  be  a  relevant

factor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, even today, it may be useful for the

taxi companies to look into,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2436</b></font><br><br>



as  Mr  Chay  has  pointed out, whether a higher  premium

should be added for certain places.  For example, at  the

airport.   The  airport needed to put on a  surcharge  in

order  to  attract  taxis  to  go  there  to  serve   the

passengers.   So,  for  certain  shopping  centres,  etc,

whether a surcharge may be needed to attract taxi drivers

to  go  there to serve the passengers, that is  something

the taxi companies will have to look at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also talked about the changing of shifts.

Mdm  Deputy Speaker, the taxi companies are exploring now

the  various  means  to encourage  taxi  drivers  not  to

perform  shift change during the peak periods.  LTA  also

proposes  to  use this macro approach for a start.   With

the  proposed quality of service standards, one indicator

that  LTA  will  be  using is the cater  rate  for  phone

bookings of taxis.  This cater rate is the percentage  of

calls  despatched  that  are  successfully  matched  with

taxis, and this is to be measured during the peak periods

especially.   In order for the taxis to be  available  to

meet  the cater rate, taxi companies will have to explore

ways  to encourage the taxi drivers not to perform  shift

change during the peak periods.  If this does not work, I

am  sure  LTA will also look into other ways of effecting

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked about the quality of service

standards,  whether the operators have met  the  existing

standards,  and what the new standards meant to  achieve.

Mdm  Deputy  Speaker,  in  the  past,  the  LTA  did  not

prescribe any standards.  What the LTA did was to monitor

the  indicators  of  performance  captured  by  the  taxi

companies  themselves, and use the different  submissions

from  the three companies as a comparison and rank  them,

ie,  it  was  not  meant to be a service standard  to  be

complied  with,  but rather for LTA to  monitor  how  the

companies  are actually doing.  By having the quality  of

service  standards now under this new framework, LTA  can

therefore  proceed to stipulate what are  the  benchmarks

that  the  taxi companies would have to comply with.   As

pointed  out  by  Mr  Chay, we will make  sure  that  the

benchmarks  are such that they are not overly  biased  in

any direction.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2437</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of service standards will comprise a few

elements,  including performance with the phone bookings,

which really must be the guaranteed service.  Anyone  who

wants  a taxi very badly, all they have to do is to  call

up  any of the taxi companies, and they should be able to

get  a taxi within a prescribed time-frame.  So, in  this

way, we are able to assure anyone who needs a taxi badly,

that they will be able to get one.  However, we would not

be  able to guarantee that a street hailer would be  able

to  just  raise  a  hand  and get one,  because  this  is

something  which is fully out of the hands  of  LTA.   If

they  are at the taxi stand or they are waiting somewhere

and  cannot  get a taxi, which company is guilty  of  not

supplying  enough taxis?  Whereas we can make  sure  that

when a commuter calls in to a specific taxi company, that

taxi  company  must  be able to meet the  needs  of  that

caller.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay called for LTA to have a light regulatory

touch and to leave to the market enough room to play, and

also  to make sure that the cost of administration should

not  be passed on to operators.  Indeed, that is what LTA

intends  to  do.   LTA  intends  to  implement  this  new

framework  with  a  light  touch,  and  leave  the   taxi

companies  to decide on how they want to operate,  decide

on  what fares they want to charge, which they are  doing

now, as well as what size of the taxi fleet they wish  to

have.   Also,  we hope that with the opening  up  of  the

market, new players would come in and, therefore, provide

additional competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the licence fees, LTA will keep the

licence  fees very moderate, and will only aim to recover

cost.   Why  do  they  need to recover  cost?   Basically

because this work that they are doing is meant to benefit

both commuters and the taxi companies.  They will need to

do   some  auditing  and  they  will  need  to  do   some

administrative  work.   It will  not  impose  much  of  a

financial burden on the companies and, in fact, in  terms

of  the audit work, LTA does not intend to set up a full-time workforce within LTA.  As and when needed, they will

farm the auditing work to consultants outside, who then

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2438</b></font><br><br>



have  to bid for the job.  So, in this way, we make  sure

that work is being done in the most cost-effective way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min asked whether the taxi companies are

public   or  private  transport.   Taxi  is  a   high-end

personalised  form  of  public  transport,   because   it

provides   fast,  convenient,  door-to-door  service   to

commuters, without the burden of the commuters having  to

own  a  vehicle.  As it does not belong to the mainstream

public transport, our policy is to treat the taxi service

like  a  private  car  in  terms of  the  tax  structure.

Otherwise, it will provide incentives for people to  hire

taxis and to use it as a private vehicle because the taxi

is  exempted from all the different taxes and fees.  This

would  be contrary to our policy.  Notwithstanding  this,

taxis  still enjoy some form of tax concession, in  terms

of  their  road tax and the COE category.   In  addition,

taxi companies get automatic renewal of their COE by just

paying the prevailing quota premium instead of having  to

bid for a new COE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min also speculated as to whether the

ERP  is one of the factors why taxis refuse to come  into

the  city  centre to pick up passengers.  The  answer  is

very  simple.  Because the demand outstrips supply,  taxi

drivers who fetch passengers from the city centre to  the

outlying  areas normally do not need to come  in  because

they can find passengers wherever they are, whether it is

in  an  HDB estate or elsewhere.  The answer, as Mr  Chay

has mentioned, is if you want to draw them in, it may  be

necessary  for  taxi companies to impose a  surcharge  to

make  it attractive for the taxi drivers to come in.   In

any case, with this new framework, anyone within the city

centre, if they require a taxi badly, whether they are in

a  taxi  queue or otherwise, they should just be able  to

call up and be guaranteed of a taxi within, I think, a 10-minute timeframe.  This would be much shorter than having

to queue up for half-an-hour in a taxi queue if they need

a taxi badly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong was also concerned about the welfare of the

taxi  operators.  He is afraid that companies  will  just

pass  on  the cost of compliance to drivers  and  not  be

concerned about the welfare of the drivers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2439</b></font><br><br>



I  think the actions of the three taxi companies over the

past  year  or so when the taxi drivers were  facing  the

challenge  of  the economic downturn show that  the  taxi

companies  have  actually been very concerned  about  the

welfare of their drivers.  And this is for a good reason.

They  are "employers", in effect, and as "employers",  if

they  do not look after their own employees, I think they

are  going to have very, very great difficulty recruiting

fresh  drivers whenever there are resignations.  I would,

therefore, leave it to the taxi companies and the  market

place  to  operate  in this area, rather  than  have  the

Government  intervene  in terms of making  compulsory  or

mandate what sort of relief package would be needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, Mr Ong also said that the taxi licence may be

akin  to  a money printing machine.  If it was so,  under

this new framework new companies can be set up because if

the  taxi companies are indeed making outrageous profits,

I  am sure other companies would very gladly come in  and

set up their own taxi fleet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong asked about the vehicle recall. He asked

what  happens  if the dealer goes bust, and  he  proposes

that  we  require  the use of the local news  network  to

publicise the recall.  Under the new framework, if  there

is a recall, the manufacturer and the present dealer will

have  to make the recall.  If the dealer is no longer  in

existence, we will still go to the manufacturer,  through

the  new dealer, to do the recall.  This has been the on-going   practice.   But,  in  the  past,  this   was   an

administrative   procedure,  and  we  depended   on   the

cooperation of the dealer and the manufacturer.  With the

passing  of  this Bill, we will now have  the  regulatory

powers to do so, if cooperation is not forthcoming.   So,

it  has been on-going and it has worked quite well.   The

dealers  would  then communicate directly with  the  car-owners because they have the details of who bought  which

model.   So,  for  that particular model they  will  know

exactly  who are the owners.  And, if they are unable  to

find  or to identify the current owners, LTA will  assist

them because we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2440</b></font><br><br>



have  the details of who the current owners are.  So,  it

is  unlikely  they need to really go to  the  local  news

network to reach out to the current owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong and Mr Ang touched on heavy vehicle parks and

I  will answer them together.  As I explained just now, I

can  understand  why  the individual owners  and  drivers

would  prefer to have their heavy vehicles parked nearby.

It  is great if we could achieve this but, unfortunately,

all the MPs must also have encountered this.  If we allow

heavy vehicles to be parked within the HDB estates, there

are  a  lot of complaints about the noise level and  also

about  the  safety issue.  In fact, I had one huge  lorry

park in my area before when I was in Hong Kah South,  and

I  had  no  end of complaints from the residents  in  the

area.   When  HDB  closed down the lorry  park,  all  the

complaints  stopped.  So, residents are really  concerned

about the noise because the drivers of the heavy vehicles

tend to begin work quite early, as pointed out by Mr  Ong

and  Mr  Ang, quite often 5.00 - 6.00 am, and  when  they

start the vehicles it creates a lot of noise.  Because of

that,  HDB and URA have relocated the heavy vehicle parks

out  of the HDB estates.  There are still some remaining,

but I think the majority have already been moved out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is: Is URA able to provide new

heavy  vehicle parks at sites adjoining HDB estates?   We

have  asked.  URA have informed us that most of the large

vacant  plots  available today are earmarked  for  future

developments and therefore they are not able  to  convert

these  plots  of  land to heavy vehicle parks.   We  will

continue  to work with URA on this.  But, nonetheless,  I

think  it  is very important for the minority of  drivers

and  owners  who  are still parking indiscriminately  and

illegally,  to follow the example set by the majority  of

the  owners  and  drivers.  Most of  them,  from  what  I

understand, either ride a bicycle or a motor cycle to the

heavy vehicle park.  In some cases, the companies provide

transport or a transport allowance.  This is no different

from  workers  who have to work three shifts.   When  the

worker has to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2441</b></font><br><br>



work the midnight shift or morning shift, quite often the

companies  will  have to provide private transport  or  a

transport allowance, if the workforce is small.  I  think

this  is  what  is  happening for most of  the  transport

companies  as well.  So, for the minority, we  will  give

them  some  grace  period  to  understand  that  the  new

regulations will be in place soon, and for them  to  make

the  necessary transport arrangements to enable  them  to

get  to  their  heavy vehicle in the morning  in  a  very

convenient way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng also brought up the issue of the

owners  of  heavy  vehicles having to bring  the  Vehicle

Parking  Certificate  (VPC) to the LTA  when  they  renew

their  road tax.  Madam, the VPC is issued to the  owners

when  they purchase their season parking permit from  the

operator  of  the  heavy vehicle park.   Therefore,  they

already have it.  When they go and renew their road  tax,

it  is no additional problem for them to bring along  the

VPC,  just as when we renew the road tax for our cars  we

need  to  show the inspection certificate,  we  bring  it

along with us as well.  It is no additional inconvenience

to  them.  But, if there is anything in addition to  that

which we are not aware of, I would be very happy to  hear

from Mr Ang on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan asked that in this competitive

environment it is important that we be fair to  both  the

big  and small taxi operators.  Yes, we intend to do  so.

And,  in fact, for the QOS, LTA will be making sure  that

for  the  smaller companies, with a smaller  taxi  fleet,

things  like cater rate, where they would not be able  to

perform  in  the  same way as the bigger companies,  they

will be given some concession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether we have a target figure for

the  number of taxi companies in Singapore as well as the

taxi  population.   We  do  not believe  that  with  this

framework there is a need for us to arbitrarily establish

a  number.  We will leave it to the market to decide.  If

there are new companies that are coming in, and they  are

prepared  to invest because they feel that they are  able

to  do  a good job, we should not be stopping them.   But

the  provision is there, just in case it is needed in the

future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered all the questions, Madam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> I would like to seek a

clarification  from the Minister.  My question  is:   are

there sufficient taxis on our roads today?  Based on  the

comparative figures per 100,000 population, mentioned  by

the  Minister, it seems that there are sufficient  taxis,

but  yet we all agree that during peak periods and  rainy

days,  there  is  a mismatch.  So, how  would  the  price

mechanism help?  If you impose a surcharge, let  us  say,

for  the  CBD or any particular area, would it  not  just

shift  supply  from one area and transfer it  to  another

area?   Could it be that demand actually outstrips supply

only  during  peak  hours, and that during  other  hours,

there  is  actually  an oversupply,  and  increasing  the

supply  of taxis would only lead to an adverse impact  on

the income of all taxi drivers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I think Mr Ong answered the

question himself.  During peak hours, the supply  is  not

adequate.   But  if the taxi companies  expand  the  taxi

fleet  significantly to meet this supply, they are  going

to  be  in  deeper  problems during the off-peak  period.

Perhaps there is a case for differential charging  during

peak  and  off-peak periods.  That is already being  done

for  the  midnight surcharge.  Perhaps there could  be  a

case for differential charging.  In any case, if the taxi

fares  remain low, so that three passengers will find  it

more  attractive to ride a taxi than to take a bus, there

will  never be enough taxis during peak periods.  So  the

price mechanism must come in sooner or later to establish

a  better balance.  But where that balance is, we have to

leave it to the taxi companies to decide.

<div align="center"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MALAYSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER'S REMARKS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Zainudin Nordin</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs what is his Ministry's response  to  the

Malaysian  Foreign  Minister's remarks  that  during  the

economic crisis when Malaysia was looking for a loan from

Singapore,  the  latter  had agreed  but  made  it  'very

onerous'.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the height of the Asian financial crisis in early

1998,  the  ringgit  was  under speculative  attack,  and

confidence in the Malaysian stock market had fallen.   At

that   time,   the  Singapore  Government   was   holding

substantial funds in ringgit as part of our reserves.  We

also   had   investments  in  Malaysian  stocks.    Other

investors   were  selling  their  ringgit  and  Malaysian

stocks,  but  we  held  on to ours despite  the  risk  of

currency and capital losses.  We did not want the ringgit

and Malaysian stock market to further weaken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Malaysian banking system was

experiencing  a  credit  crunch.   Deposits  were   being

withdrawn  from Malaysian banks, to be placed instead  in

foreign banks.  We did the opposite to help Malaysia.  At

the  request of Malaysia, we transferred RM2  billion  of

our  deposits from banks in Singapore to Malaysian  banks

in Kuala Lumpur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia also requested a package of financial

assistance from Singapore amounting to RM15 billion (US$4

billion).   This  was  to consist of  additional  ringgit

deposits  with Malaysian banks in Kuala Lumpur,  purchase

of  the  ringgit,  and purchase of Malaysian  stocks.  As

these  actions involved considerable financial risks  for

Singapore,   we   proposed  to  provide   the   financial

assistance  within  a  framework  of  wider  co-operation

between the two countries, which would include the supply

of  water to Singapore after the expiry of the 1962 Water

Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Malaysia requested the RM15 billion package

to  be  converted into a US dollar loan.   We  offered  a

medium-term US$4 billion loan at an interest  rate  which

was significantly lower (about 4 percentage points lower)

than what Malaysia would have had to pay in the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, however, we did not proceed with this

financial assistance package.  At a bilateral meeting  in

Hanoi  during  the ASEAN Summit in December  1998,  Prime

Minister  Mahathir  informed  Prime  Minister  Goh   that

Malaysia no longer needed it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, Singapore had tried to be helpful to

Malaysia  during the financial crisis. The terms  of  our

proposed  assistance  were far from  "very  onerous",  as

alleged by Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>



<br><br><b><i>Pedra Branca (Question asked by Mr R Ravindran)</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedra Branca is not a new issue in Singapore-Malaysia relations. It arose in 1979, when Malaysia for

the  first  time  published a new map which  claimed  the

island.   Prior  to  that,  Singapore  had  occupied  and

exercised full sovereignty for more than 150 years  since

the   1840s  without  protest  from  Malaysia.   Previous

Malaysian maps, even as late as 1974, showed Pedra Branca

as  belonging to Singapore.  As I had briefed Members  on

this issue in Parliament on 16th May 2002, both countries

had   agreed  in  1998  to  refer  the  dispute  to   the

International Court of Justice (ICJ) and had  settled  on

the text of a Special Agreement.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For four years between 1998 and the middle of last

year, Malaysia made no real attempt to pursue the signing

and ratification of the SA.  After the 17th December 2002

judgement  of  the ICJ on the Sipadan and  Ligitan  case,

there  was  an outburst of wild allegations,  made  on  a

daily  basis.   These  came hot on  the  heels  of  their

Mingguan  Malaysia  story  on 22nd  December  2002  which

claimed   that   we  were  engaged  in  many   kinds   of

construction activities on PB.  They were wrong  both  in

law  and  facts  and  we have rebutted these  allegations

fully in the MFA statement on 26th December 2002.  Let me

recap the main points.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that we were dragging our feet on the signing

of the Special Agreement.  What are the facts?  Singapore

had  always  been ready to sign the Special Agreement  at

any  time  and at any place.  It was Singapore which  had

first  proposed to resolve Malaysia's claim  through  the

ICJ process, as early as 1989.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had suggested that the Special Agreement could be

signed  at  the  sidelines  of the  ASEAN-EU  Ministerial

Meeting  in  Brussels,  on 27-28th January  2003  because

Malaysia  wanted  to sign the Agreement quickly  and  the

meeting  in Brussels was the earliest and most convenient

time   for  Minister  Syed  Hamid  and  myself  to  meet.

However,  the  Malaysians  later  counter-proposed  other

dates in January and February so that the signing can  be

done  either  in Malaysia or Singapore.  As I  have  said

publicly,  it is absurd to quibble over the  location  of

the signing ceremony as it will not affect the outcome of

the case at the ICJ in any way.  As Members know, we have

now agreed to sign the Special Agreement in Putrajaya  on

6th February 2003.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Singapore's so called construction and other

alleged  "illegal" activities on Pedra Branca.  The  fact

is  that  there has been no recent construction  work  on

Pedra  Branca.  The last structures were built  in  1991,

well over 10 years ago.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, there is no cause to make an issue of

this,   as   it   is  a  well-established  principle   in

international law that acts done by disputing parties  to

advance  their  own  case after the dispute  has  already

arisen will not be given credence.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen their allegations, Malaysia claimed

that  they  had never done similar "unfriendly"  or  "un-neighbourly"  acts  to Indonesia in  their  dispute  over

Sipadan  and Ligitan.  What are the facts?  According  to

documents filed by Indonesia at the ICJ, Jakarta  had  in

fact  protested  at  least  five  times  about  continued

Malaysian  activities on Sipadan.  Malaysia had  rejected

these  complaints, saying that the activities were simply

the  continuation  of actions they had undertaken  before

the  dispute  arose.   Well, in this  light,  Singapore's

actions  on  Pedra Branca are no different  in  law  from

Malaysia's own actions on Sipadan.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2449</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Singapore's position on Pedra Branca

continues  to  be clear and consistent.  Our  sovereignty

and ownership of Pedra Branca is based on facts and sound

principles  of  law.  Nevertheless, we are  prepared  and

ready to work with Malaysia to move forward with the  ICJ

process.   We  have  always dealt with  Malaysia's  claim

amicably and in the spirit of goodwill, and will continue

to  do so.  Our media has never attacked Malaysia in  the

way their media has attacked Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><b><i>KD Malaya (Question asked by Ms Irene Ng)</i></b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was never an issue. The Malaysian Navy

departed  from  the  Woodlands Naval Base  on  their  own

accord  in December 1997.  In fact, then Defence Minister

Syed  Hamid  gave a warm final address at the passing-out

ceremony  in August 1997, where he thanked the  Singapore

Government  for its "help and cooperation  in  making  it

possible to have a recruit centre here for so long".   He

said that as Malaysia was an independent country, it  was

timely that its navy had its own training centre.  He had

also described Singapore-Malaysia relations as "good with

no problems or complaints".

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strange that in 1997 there were "no problems

or  complaints",  but  five  years  later  the  Malaysian

leaders  have  turned  their  voluntary  departure   from

Singapore   into   an  issue  and  an  example   of   how

unneighbourly we have been.  PM Mahathir said that  "they

(Singapore) deliberately increased the rate for the lease

for  the  naval base in Woodlands that we were forced  to

vacate  and  we vacated without being paid  even  a  sen"

(Bernama, 30th December 2002).

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They allege that we 'forced' the Malaysian Navy to

leave the Woodlands naval base by increasing the rent.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the facts? Yes, there was a rent revision

in  1991.   But  the  truth is that Singapore  Government

tried  to find ways to help the Malaysians maintain their

base  and  stay in Woodlands when the rent  revision  was

carried out in 1991.  When we increased the rental it was

part  of  a government revision of property rates applied

to  all, not targeted at KD Malaya, but in line with  our

market-based rental policy to maximise the use of land in

land  scarce  Singapore.  This  policy  applied  to  all,

including  voluntary and charitable  organisations.   The

increase of rental from $1.936 million to $6.152  million

reflected  the  difference  between  the  rent  that  the

Malaysian Navy was paying, and the market rental rate  of

the  day.   We  understood that such a sudden  and  sharp

increase  in rental might cause the Malaysian  government

budgetary difficulties and we went out of our way  to  be

as  helpful  as possible.  So, in the spirit of  goodwill

and  on  our own volition, we offered them a 20% discount

of  the  proposed  rate of $6.152 million,  reducing  the

rental  to $4.8 million, with a phase-in period  of  five

years.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also offered a second option, whereby Singapore

would build a camp on an alternative piece of land nearby

in place of the facilities at the Woodlands base, for the

Malaysian  Navy  to  occupy at a  nominal  fee  of  about

S$500,000  for as long as it needed.  The new camp  would

have cost MINDEF about S$50 million to build.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

During  all  stages of the discussions  on  this  matter,

Singapore repeatedly emphasised to the Malaysians that we

welcomed their Navy to stay at the Woodlands base for  as

long as it wanted to.  In 1981, then PM Lee Kuan Yew told

PM  Mahathir that Singapore would not seek the return  of

the  land for as long as the Malaysian Navy needed to use

it.   PM Goh also told PM Mahathir in September 1992 that

he  would like KD Malaya to stay in Singapore for as long

as  Malaysia  wished.  It was our policy to continue  our

close defence links with Malaysia.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2451</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, after the Malaysians announced that they

would withdraw from Woodlands in 1997, we reiterated  our

assurance  that they were welcome to stay  and  that  our

offer  of the substitute camp remained open.  In December

1992,  when  then  Malaysian Defence Minister  Najib  Tun

Razak  wrote  to  us  formally  to  inform  us  of  their

decision,  then  Defence Minister Dr Yeo  Ning  Hong  had

replied  to  convey that PM Goh would like the  Malaysian

Navy  to  stay in Woodlands.  It was emphasised that  the

Singapore  offer of SAF-built facilities to be placed  at

the  disposal of the Malaysian Navy remained open, if  it

wished to take it up later.  But Malaysia never did.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Singapore's best efforts to offer

alternative  options  to enable  the  Malaysian  Navy  to

remain in Singapore, then Defence Minister Najib had made

a  public  announcement on 25th November  1992  that  the

Malaysian Navy would relocate the base from Woodlands  to

Malaysia after 1997.  Until then, the Malaysian Navy will

stay  at  Woodlands "at the rate rental  which  has  been

determined by the Singapore Government".  Najib explained

that  Malaysia's decision to leave was "based on economic

factors".   He  also said that "the Malaysian  government

understands  the decision of the Singapore Government  to

increase  the  rate  of rental on  the  basis  of  market

principles", and this "will not adversely affect the good

relations  in  the  realm  of  defence  between  the  two

countries".   It was clear that citing economic  reasons,

the Malaysians had left Woodlands on their own accord.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was five years ago. Now, in 2002, we are

accused  of not having displayed neighbourliness  in  our

dealings  with  them.   But the KD  Malaya  case  clearly

showed that we had put in tremendous effort to help  them

out.   We  did  offer alternatives at  our  expense.   We

offered  to  fork out S$50 million to build another  camp

near the Woodlands site for the Malaysian Navy to use  at

a  nominal fee.  This proposal, which entailed additional

capital outlay on the part of Singapore, was made in  the

spirit  of  goodwill and to show the Malaysians  that  we

were sincere in keeping our word to them about staying on

in Woodlands.  It was Malaysia which chose not to take up

this offer.

<br><br><b><i>ASEAN+3  Secretariat and Malaysia's proposal on the  East

Asia Economic Caucus (Question asked by Mr Sin Boon Ann)</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some of the other absurd

allegations.   Mr  Sin Boon Ann asked about  their  claim

that  Singapore  was the country which  had  opposed  the

setting  up  of an ASEAN+3 Secretariat in  KL;  that  (a)

Singapore always opposes any initiative from Malaysia and

(b) Singapore was the only country to do so.  Related  to

this  was  the other complaint that we had opposed  their

EAEC proposal.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commenting on Singapore's reaction to Malaysia's

ASEAN+3  Secretariat  proposal,  PM  Mahathir  had  said,

"Singapore  rejects everything that comes from  Malaysia.

We have problem with the EAEC (East Asia Economic Caucus)

before  because  Singapore rejected  (it),"  adding  that

Malaysia  had  tried to be as friendly as  possible  with

Singapore  but  that this was impossible  (Bernama,  11th

October 2002).

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

In  more  recent  remarks,  FM  Syed  Hamid  had  accused

Singapore  of  influencing the other ASEAN  countries  to

oppose  the  proposal. He said "sometimes  we  find  that

quietly,  they (Singapore) also have given very  negative

signals  to  other countries, like in  the  case  of  the

ASEAN+3   Secretariat.   Singapore  has   objected   very

strongly  and  yet they host the APEC Secretariat  there,

and   they   go  very  strongly  in  trying  to  belittle

Malaysia's  efforts  and yet they talk  about  East  Asia

community" (Star, 2nd January 2003).  In a Berita  Minggu

interview  (5th  January 2003), Syed Hamid  alleged  that

"when  Malaysia proposed the establishment of the ASEAN+3

Secretariat,  Singapore was the  only  ASEAN  country  to

oppose it."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were we the 'only' country to oppose it? What are

the facts?

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2453</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN+3 Secretariat: As regards the proposed

ASEAN+3   Secretariat   in   KL,   yes,   Singapore   had

reservations about this proposal but not because it was a

Malaysian  proposal  but because of the  implications  on

ASEAN  and  the  ASEAN  Secretariat  in  Jakarta.   While

Singapore recognises the value of the ASEAN+3 process, we

hold  the  view  that  it should  be  allowed  to  evolve

gradually.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true only Singapore had this view? Other

countries   such   as   Indonesia   were   also   clearly

uncomfortable  with  the proposal.  In  a  Kompas  report

(14th  August  2002), Indonesian FM Hassan  Wirajuda  was

quoted as saying that "there is no consensus - if we want

to speak honestly - ... because most of the ASEAN members

do  not  see  the  need  for  the  formation  of  ASEAN+3

(secretariat) yet".  More recently, former Trade Minister

of  Indonesia Arifin Siregar said that Indonesia  is  not

keen on another secretariat for the ASEAN+3 grouping  and

he  said  that  the Indonesian view is that  the  ASEAN+3

secretariat  could  be a unit within the  existing  ASEAN

secretariat in Jakarta (Straits Times, 8th January 2003).

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the EAEC, Singapore was one of the first

countries  to support, and I stress support, not  oppose,

Malaysia's proposal to establish the EAEC.  Let  me  give

you some examples.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the dinner hosted by PM Mahathir on 11th January

1991 during PM Goh's first official visit to Malaysia  as

Singapore's Prime Minister, PM Goh had said:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I share your concerns about the future of the

multilateral  trading  system.   Like  you,  I  hope  the

Uruguay  Round  will end successfully.   If  GATT  breaks

down,  we will all be adversely affected.  Your  idea  of

closer economic co-operation among countries on the Asian

side of the Pacific Rim has immense potential.  It is far-sighted.   It  is imaginative.  I support it.   I  am  in

favour  of  strengthening regional economic  co-operation

among the Asian countries of the Pacific Region, whatever

the outcome of the Uruguay Round.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a New Straits Times report filed on PM's visit

(12th January 1991), the newspaper said:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore has reiterated its commitment to support

Malaysia's  recent proposal for the establishment  of  an

East  Asian economic grouping.  Visiting Singapore  Prime

Minister  Goh Chok Tong made this "very strong  and  very

clear" statement at a meeting with Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir

Mohamad   at  the  Prime  Minister's  Department   today.

Briefing  the  Press on the 90-minute discussion  between

the  two  premiers,  Foreign  Ministry  Secretary-General

Datuk  Ahmad  Kamil  Jaafar  said  Mr  Goh  stated   that

Singapore  would join Malaysia in explaining the  concept

behind the move to countries that should be invited  into

the grouping.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in his Keynote Address at the CSIS-Asia

Society  Conference  in Bali on 4th March  1991,  PM  Goh

said:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But even as ASEAN becomes more competitive, it may

not  be big enough a team to be able to insist on a level

field.   ASEAN  may have to play within  a  bigger  team.

ASEAN  can do this by linking up with other economies  in

the  Asia-Pacific through structures like the East  Asian

Economic  Grouping  proposed by Dr  Mahathir,  and  APEC.

This way ASEAN will not be side-lined.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These facts speak for themselves.
