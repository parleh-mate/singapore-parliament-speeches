4, there

is  a  report  of the proceedings in the  Committee  of

Supply  of our Parliament. It said that the Member  for

Sembawang had produced a black-list of nurses and given

it  to the Minister for Health. In actual fact, it  was

wrong  reporting, because I only gave  the  information

which the Minister required of me. So I would like  the

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Guardianship of Infants Ordinance

(Chapter  16 of the Revised Edition), is based  on  the

United  Kingdom Guardianship of Infants Act, 1885,  and

is  out  of line with modern trends in family  law,  as

exemplified, for example, in our Women's Charter, 1961,

in  that  it gives the father a superior right  to  the

mother in the matter of the guardianship and custody of

children.  The Ordinance applies to Muslims  but  would

appear to be contrary to the Muslim law which, in  this

respect,  gives  equal rights to  the  father  and  the

mother of the child; and in fact, in many cases,  gives

the mother a prior right to the care and the custody of

very  young  children.  It is, therefore,  proposed  to

adopt the provisions of the more recent Guardianship of

Infants  Act, 1925, of the United Kingdom, which  makes

the  welfare  of the infant the paramount consideration

in  making  orders for the guardianship and custody  of

children  and gives the mother an equal right with  the

father in applying for such guardianship and custody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will remove the discrimination against

married  women and will be in line with the  resolution

of  the  Economic  and  Social Council  of  the  United

Nations  of  3rd  August, 1955, which  recommends  that

State  members  of the United Nations should  take  all

necessary  measures  to  ensure  equality  as   between

parents  in  the  exercise of rights  and  duties  with

respect to their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. [Mr E. W. Barker].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Widows' and Orphans'

Pension  Ordinance  (Chapter  61),  under  which  every

Government officer restricted to a monogamous marriage,

except  those  who joined the service on or  after  2nd

March,  1961,  was  required to  contribute  towards  a

pension for his widow and orphans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through an amendment to the Ordinance, such officers,

where  already contributing, were allowed an option  to

continue  to  contribute;  to  stop  contributing   and

preserve  the rights that had accrued to  them;  or  to

stop  contributing and be paid an actuarily  calculated

sum.  The  law  further provided for a  period  of  six

months within which these options were required  to  be

exercised, commencing 1st April, 1965. It followed that

bachelors, who contracted monogamous marriages prior to

1st  April, 1965, were accorded these options  as  they

had the status of contributors before that date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law did not provide, however, for the cases of

bachelors,  who  joined the service before  2nd  March,

1961,  the  date prescribed in the Women's Charter  for

marriages   thereafter  to  be  monogamous,   if   they

contracted marriage after 1st April, 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no provision for such officers to be enabled

to  choose to continue to contribute or to be  excluded

from   contributing  to  their  widows'  and   orphans'

pension,  and  this Bill seeks to repair that  omission

and  make legal provision for them to elect to  become,

or  to  continue as, contributors within one  month  of

contracting monogamous marriages. Administrative action

has  already  been  taken  to call  upon  the  officers

affected to opt whether to become contributors within a

month  of  marriage.  So  this Bill  will  provide  the

necessary legal provision to regularise these cases  in

accordance with the intention of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Kim San].

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the Bill is to provide textual

changes and changes of terminology necessitated by  the

separation  of  Singapore from  Malaysia  and  its  new

status as an independent sovereign Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only amendment of substance relates to section 8

of  the  principal Ordinance by the addition of  a  new

subsection  to  permit the Commissioner  to  waive  the

assessment  and collection of duty under the  Ordinance

where  such  duty does not exceed $5. As the  Ordinance

now  stands, the Commissioner is obliged to  levy  duty

even  for  trivial amounts and this is administratively

uneconomic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, if you look at

line 20 - clause 6 (b) :

`by deleting the word "Crown" wherever they appear...',



I  take  it  that there is a clerical error - "wherever

they appear" should read "wherever it appears".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is a question of grammar. I think

"it" will be appropriate. Yes, "wherever it appears".



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon. Members that

the  amendment be made as suggested - it is  merely  an

error  in drafting - that the words "they appear"  will

read "it appears"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister will now move it

formally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment made: "In page 2, line 20, to leave out

"they  appear" and insert "it appears". - [Mr Lim  Kim

San].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with an amendment; read a Third time and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>STAMP (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stamp Ordinance was not amended when Singapore was

part   of  Malaysia.  So  the  majority  of  amendments

proposed   in   this  Bill  relate   to   textual   and

terminological   changes   which   take   account    of

Singapore's  new  status  as an  independent  sovereign

Republic.  References to the Colony, the Federation  of

Malaya, the British Commonwealth, and so on, are to  be

appropriately  amended in keeping with Singapore's  new

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make certain

other  amendments. For example, section 35 (b)  of  the

principal  Ordinance, which exempted grants  or  leases

made by   the  Government  or  under  the  Foreshores

Ordinance, is to be deleted, as no good reason exists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



for  such  exemption. Exemptions previously granted  to

the  Malayan Railways under Schedule A, Article 53 (e) ,

and  to  the Co-operative Societies registered  in  the

Federation  of  Malaya  under  section  35  are  to  be

withdrawn, as such provisions are inappropriate in  the

laws of an independent Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Article 27 of Schedule A, counterparts and

duplicates of instruments are liable to stamp duty, and

the  proposed  amendment  will  exempt  duplicates   of

instruments   from  such  duty.  This  is  particularly

desirable  as traders are required to retain  duplicate

copies   of  receipts  issued  under  the  Income   Tax

Ordinance.  It was never intended that duty  should  be

imposed  on duplicate copies required for the  purposes

of the Income Tax Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Kim San].

<div align="center"><b>ESTATE DUTY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1965, the Malaysian Government passed an Act

to  vary  the  laws  in force in Malaysia  relating  to

estate  duty when Singapore was in Malaysia.  That  Act

provided  for  harmonisation of the  law  with  Malayan

legislation.   It   further  transferred   to   Federal

Authority  functions  under the Singapore  Estate  Duty

Ordinance and made other amendments consequent upon the

passing  of  the Malaysia Act. It is now  necessary  to

amend  the  Estate Duty Ordinance to  accord  with  the

independent status of Singapore, to revert to the rates

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



estate  duty  that  were  applicable  to  the  amending

legislation  of  Malaysia,  and  to  make   minor   and

consequential amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (b) amends the definition of "property" to

exclude  immovable property situate  in  Malaysia  from

liability to duty in Singapore, while clause 4  reverts

the  rates  of  duty  payable in  respect  of  property

passing on the death of any person, dying domiciled  in

either  Singapore  or  Malaysia, to  the  pre-Malaysian

rates  which  become applicable except for  the  period

January 1st to August 9th, 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 re-enacts new provisions relating to

circumstances  in  which  postponement  of  payment  of

estate  duty may be permitted. The existing  provisions

were  considered to be too restrictive and are repealed

by  clause  10. Primarily, the object is to  facilitate

administration of estates and obviate undue hardships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 repeals the provisions of section 44A

relating to payment of duty into the joint account  and

complementary   thereto.   Clause   3   provides    for

accountability by the Commissioner by payment into  the

consolidated account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 repeals the provisions of section 54 which

provided  for the entering into of agreements  for  the

purpose of exchanging information with other countries.

This  power  is  necessarily inherent in  the  Minister

without the need for formal agreements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of reverting to the pre-Malaysian

rates  of  duty,  new Sixth and Seventh  Schedules  are

added to the Ordinance by clause 16. The Sixth Schedule

contains  the  rates applicable in  respect  of  deaths

before 1st January, 1965, and from 9th November,  1955,

when  the  rates  of  duty were  increased,  and  after

Singapore Day, whilst the Seventh Schedule contains the

Malaysian rates applicable to the period 1st January to

8th August, 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Estate Duties (Apportionment and

Miscellaneous   Provisions)   was   to   provide    for

apportionment  of  duty in the case  of  persons  dying

prior  to 1st April, 1946, domiciled or leaving  assets

in the Straits Settlements and in respect of which some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



duty  remained  unpaid  after the  dissolution  of  the

Straits Settlements. Whilst theoretically a case  could

still  arise  at the present time where death  occurred

prior to 1st April, 1946, in respect of which duty  has

not  been  paid, the likelihood is somewhat remote  and

hence there are amendments in clause 18 for its repeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remainder of the amendments are of a minor and

consequential nature. They are necessitated  either  to

accord  with  the  independent status  of

Singapore-clauses  2  (a) ,  5,  6,  7, 8,  9,  13  and  17  -  or

consequential  upon  amendments  already  described  in

clauses 11 and 18.

Mr Teong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1002 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1181.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan

Kebangsaan was established in 1960 after Singapore  had

self-government.  Its purpose is mainly  to  carry  out

campaigns  for the study of the national  language,  to

encourage the people to learn and use it, and  also  to

help  the Government implement its language policy.  It

is  hoped that the different races in Singapore will be

able to use a common language in the near future. Since

the  establishment of this Dewan, it has  been  working

assiduously in the promotion of the national  language.

Two National Language Months were held this year and we

received keen support from all sections of the  people.

Cultural  groups and the Dewan co-operated in promoting

the  learning of the national language. Because of this

joint effort, more and more non-Malays are studying the

language.  This can be seen from the number  of  people

who took part in Malay examinations in recent years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when people are keenly responding to the

movement,   we   find  that  there  are  two   abnormal

phenomena. The first is that one political Party, which

calls   itself  as  representing  the  Malays,  namely,

U.M.N.O.,  has  never  taken part in  the  Government's

campaign to promote the national language. This  causes

people to doubt what they say they represent. In actual

fact,  Malay is their mother tongue. And now the P.A.P.

Government has made Malay the national language and has

encouraged all people, including non-Malays,  to  learn

Malay.  Yet  U.M.N.O. has not responded to our  appeal,

They  have totally disregarded and ignored our National

Language  Month  and  the  promotion  of  the  national

language. This is regrettable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another political Party is the Barisan Sosialis. They

have always been indifferent to the promotion of the

national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



language as though it has nothing to do with them.  Yet

they  claim  themselves to be a  political  Party  that

supports  Malay as the national language.  Their  claim

judged from their action is very doubtful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to sponsoring and conducting the National

Language  Month  or National Language Week,  the  Dewan

also produces literature in the national language.  But

I  feel  that there are other fields of work which  the

Dewan has not been able to undertake.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether it will be able to do work in

other  fields, such as the compilation of a  new  Malay

dictionary,  because when we learn the Malay  language,

we  need  more reference books of this nature. Although

there   are   Malay  dictionaries  available   in   the

bookshops,  they were compiled several years  ago,  and

the new words are not found in them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that the Dewan should pay more

attention to the promotion of the national language.  I

feel that the holding of National Language Month once a

year  is  not enough. In addition, it should also  hold

forums  and discussion groups on the national  language

to  encourage and promote its use. For instance, it can

encourage   students  from  the  primary  or  secondary

schools  to  learn the national language  so  that  the

study  of  the  national  language  can  be  undertaken

jointly  by all people concerned. This will be a  great

help in the promotion of the national language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as we know, the national

language is accepted by all, as  it concerns us and transcends political consideration. The

Government  is  conscious of the need  to  promote  and

propagate the study of the national language  and  also

to provide all possible facilities and encouragement to

the people to acquire proficiency in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1965, two National Language Months have been held,

and as in previous national language campaigns, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



representative committee with members from  the  public

and  private  sectors,  including  employers  from  the

Chamber of Commerce and the Manufacturers' Association,

and  cultural organisations have considered the overall

programme of activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang has

suggested that U.M.N.O. and other political Parties did

not  participate fully in past campaigns and that  they

should  do so in the future. With regard to the absence

of participation by U.M.N.O., I feel that this question

can  best  be  answered  by U.M.N.O. themselves.  Very

unfortunately, they have been rejected by the people to

hold  seats  in  this  House.  However,  I  shall  take

advantage  of this opportunity to enlighten  the  House

later on our language policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the Member for Sembawang will agree

that  the  national language is common to and  concerns

all our people, and efforts to popularise and propagate

the  study  of  it  should also  be  a  national  issue

transcending barriers of political ideology,  since  it

has  been  accepted by all. We therefore hope  that  in

this   pragmatic  approach  of  persuading  -  I   said

persuading,  not  forcing - the  people  to  study  the

national  language, members of other political  Parties

will  also  fully and actively play their  part,  since

this is in the best interest of the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Sembawang, I

should  like to state that the Government has spent  no

less   than  $26,000  on  the  two  national   language

campaigns  carried  out this year. And  the  activities

included  debates, essay competitions, forums, cultural

activities,  book  exhibitions  and,  above  all,   the

publication by the Ministry of Culture of a book  known

as  the Istilah, a book on Malay terms and designations

of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for

Sembawang  on  the  necessity to publish  a  dictionary

comprising  new  words and new terms  in  the  national

language,  this is indeed a very good suggestion  which

is worthy of consideration. The Ministry is, in fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



now  in  the process of making such a compilation.  The

House  will  agree  with  me that  it  will  be  highly

uneconomical  for  us  to publish  a  small  dictionary

comprising perhaps 20 to 30 words. So until  such  time

as  the new terms and new words have been collected and

put  into  a  sort  of dictionary, this  book  will  be

circulated  first  to  Members of  Parliament  and  the

various  Government departments and then to members  of

the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am also grateful to the Member for

Sembawang  for allowing me this opportunity to  explain

to  the House the general attitude of the Government of

Singapore to the national language issue. In  a

multi-racial,  multi-lingual and multi-cultural society  like

Singapore,  we  believe that the only  way  to  achieve

results  is  by  means of persuasion, that  the  people

should  take  up the national language as a  matter  of

pride  as  citizens  of Singapore, and  not  by  force,

threats  and  intimidation. As we see, these  are  very

commonly   the   tactics  employed  by   the   language

extremists in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot run away from the reality that whatever

statements and opinions are uttered across the Causeway

do  affect  Singapore, and during the short  two  years

that  we  were  in Malaysia, the amount of intimidation

and  threats  by the language extremists  did  to  some

extent  influence  the thinking of the  people  on  the

national  language issue. We believe that  by  friendly

persuasion  and conviction people will take pride,  and

not  fear, in the national language. However,  this  is

the  situation and the Singapore Government is now left

with  the  job  of  clearing the minds of  dissatisfied

people in this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  very grateful for the explanation given  by  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture.  I

withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1331.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is this Ministry aware that the News

Section  (TV and Radio) has issued news emanating  from

our  neighbouring countries whose attitude  is  one  of

animosity towards us? Sometimes the news is given  wide

publicity. Is this News Section still under the control

of  the  Ministry in Malaysia, or are the  officers  in

this  News  Section run by officers seconded  from  the

Malaysian News Section? What is the attitude or  policy

of  the Ministry on the News Section which issues  news

emanating   from   our  neighbouring  countries   whose

attitude  is  one of enmity towards us?  What  are  the

changes  whereby the news items of our country  can  be

given   more   prominence  than  the  news   from   our

neighbouring  countries?  Is  it  possible  that   news

regarding our country can be given wider publicity?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the   radio  and  television  together   provide

entertainment   and  scope  for  the   acquisition   of

knowledge.  Radio programmes cannot be of much  use  to

the  people unless they are set out properly. The Tamil

programmes over the radio and on T.V. have not improved

very much. The Government has allocated 15 hours a  day

for  its  Tamil programme over the radio. The  attitude

seems to be one of trying to while away the 15 hours by ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The item relates itself to the News

Section. If the Member is embarking on the whole policy

relating   to  the  time  allocation  of  the  language

programmes, he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am just

speaking  in  general. I am only  quoting  this  as  an

example.  Old  tapes  are used and old  programmes  are

broadcast  on holidays and special occasions,  and  the

officers thus feel that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



they have discharged their duties. Perhaps some of them

think  that the Minister of State for Culture does  not

understand  Tamil.  But  they  must  not  forget   that

thousands  of  people  listen  to  the  news  and  view

television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T.V. has been functioning for the last three years and

yet  there have been no improvements. Outside  artistes

are  not given an opportunity to take part. In general,

local  radio  artistes take part in more programmes.  I

think that three years is a long period to effect  some

improvements.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every nook and corner of Singapore, radios are

turned  on.  But  they  broadcast mostly  Kuala  Lumpur

programmes. The reason for this is that the  programmes

here  are  not up to standard. The Singapore Government

gets  $12  annually as a radio licence  fee  from  each

subscriber.  And  he  has  to be  satisfied  with  just

listening  to the Kuala Lumpur programmes. About  seven

or  eight years ago, a Commission of Inquiry was set up

to   investigate  into  the  Tamil  Section  of   Radio

Singapore. After two or three years of that, I was told

that the programmes were good. The Ministry should  try

to  do  something  to  bring up  the  standard  of  the

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highly paid officials of the Radio and T.V.

section are not doing their duties properly. They  have

given  most  of their jobs to the lower paid  staff.  I

think this is one of the reasons for the lower standard

in  the  programmes.  In some cases,  applications  for

broadcasters  in  the  Radio  and  T.V. sections   are

invited. Both men and women are asked to apply. A voice

test  is given to the applicants. When these tests  are

given to women especially, they are given dialogues  of

love  scenes  to read instead, and the men,  in  reply,

give  their  opinions. In fact, people who  are  really

interested in such talents are shocked by tests of this

nature. I hope the Ministry of Culture will be able  to

remedy  this state of affairs so that better programmes

can be provided for the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, I have a

little complaint against T.V. and Radio.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The News Section, I hope!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes, the News Section. It seems to me

that  the  T.V. and Radio News Section have  given  more

coverage  to  the Barisan Sosialis than  to  the

Back-benchers  of our Government. Some time last week,  when

Dr Lee Siew Choh was giving a Press conference, a very

good  report  was broadcast over the radio  and  T.V.  I

remember  the  radio and T.V. did not report  even  one

line  of my Budget speech, which contained about  eight

and a half pages. This is my complaint, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will start off

with  the  complaint about the news. There are  several

daily  news casts over the radio and television in  the

four  language streams in Singapore. The radio news  is

from  both the medium and shortwave network. This means

that it is heard not only in our neighbouring countries

but  also in those countries that are much further.  As

has  already  been pointed out in the  Address  by  the

President,  every effort will be made by the Government

to   publicise  fully  its  policies  and   activities,

especially  its  reaction  to political  situations  in

other   countries,  particularly  in  the  neighbouring

territories. This is essential to Singapore's  position

as  an  independent  country whose  future  depends  on

worldwide   orientation  and  effort.  It  is   equally

important  to provide an international content  in  our

daily  news  bulletins for our people and,  especially,

cover  politics  and  happenings  in  our  neighbouring

countries,   particularly  Malaysia   with   whom   our

connections and interest are basic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the comment by the Member for Kampong

Kapor,  namely, that the radio and T.V. have  given  an

undue  over-coverage  of countries  outside  Singapore,

particularly in Malaysia, I should like to  state  that

we  are  a democratic country and we are not afraid  of

any  adverse opinions or comments on us. We  also  feel

that the radio and T.V. are a public media which can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



provide  a channel of knowledge to the people,  and  we

are  not  afraid of letting the people know  the  truth

although it is painful at times!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the complaint by the

Member for Farrer Park on programme planning, I wish to

assure the House that every programme on T.V. and radio

is  carefully planned and timed, particularly according

to  the  festive  seasons of the  various  communities.

However, there are ---



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Shortcomings!



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Shortcomings. I thank the Member

for  Aljunied for that word. There are shortcomings and

difficulties  that  confront  us  from  time  to  time,

difficulties relating to obtaining good artistes -  for

we  wish  to  maintain  a fairly  high  if  not  decent

standard - and also the technical difficulties. Over the

last  few  years,  Radio Singapore and Television  have

grown  considerably. But the studio has not  grown.  We

hope  that when the new studio is completed, there will

be an overall improvement, to the satisfaction of those

Members  who  have  complained about  the  standard  or

quality of the programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement by the Member for Bras Basah goes to

show  that  we  are  more  than  fair  to  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  they  have

decided  to  boycott the sittings of  this  House.  The

Member has pointed out that on one single occasion  the

radio  and  T.V. gave a good coverage to Dr  Lee  Siew

Choh  at  a Press conference given by him, stating  the

reason  why  the Barisan Sosialis should  boycott  this

Parliament.  This goes to show that the  allegation  by

the  Barisan Sosialis that the radio and T.V. are  only

reserved  for the Government use is far from  true.  We

consider  that if the people are kept informed  of  the

happenings in our country, whether they are  in  favour

of  the  Government or are adverse to  the  Government,

then  we can build up faster the sophistication of  the

people, which is very essential to the survival of  our

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1371.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has given equality of

status  to  all the four languages. I am pleased  about

it.  It  has  also provided certain facilities  in  the

National Library. I wish to applaud the Government  for

that.  But  I wish to comment on one point.  There  are

only  old  books  in the Tamil section. This  situation

should   be   remedied  and  newer  and  better   books

beneficial  to  the country should be  added.  Further,

there  should be a Tamil clerk to look after the  Tamil

section. The Ministry should arrange for such things so

that these defects will be rectified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Library is in the centre of the city.

Therefore,  those who are in the rural  areas  find  it

difficult  to go there. So mobile libraries and  branch

libraries should be opened up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. Those who have completed their

education  should  not waste the  knowledge  they  have

acquired; and children, in order to improve themselves,

should go on reading. If they continue with this habit

of  reading, they will be able to contribute better  to

society.   Therefore,   the   Government   should   not

concentrate  the  National Library in just  one  place.

There  is no point in looking after the books  in  that

particular  library alone. We should teach  the  people

how  to  make  use  of the facilities of  the  library.

Branch  libraries  should be opened  up.  A  sufficient

number  of  books should be supplied to those branches.

People and children and the future generation should be

provided with books for their education and knowledge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the observation

of  the Member for Anson with regard to the paucity  of

Tamil  books in the National Library and the  need  for

improvement in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



Tamil service are generally appreciated. I will ask the

National Library Board to give further consideration to

this  matter, and will keep the Member informed in  due

course as to what will be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the House, the service of a

full-time Tamil library officer has been provided since

January  this  year. The number of Tamil books  in  the

National Library has grown from 2,000 in 1959  to  over

13,000 at the present moment. The number of Tamil books

lent  to  adults  and children has also increased  from

3,760 in 1959 to 22,074 in the year 1965, that is, from

January to November.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for Anson

to  set up branch libraries, I wish to inform the House

that  the National Library has now two part-time branch

libraries   in  the  Joo  Chiat  and  Siglap  Community

Centres.  The  Ministry of Culture is seeking  the

co-operation of the Housing and Development Board to  rent

or  to  acquire suitable shop-house premises in housing

estates,  such  as  Queenstown,  Jurong,  Kallang   and

MacPherson,  for use as small branch libraries.  It  is

hoped  that  in  a short while we will have  sufficient

full-time  branch  libraries in the  densely  populated

areas  and  they  will  replace many  of  the  existing

service points.

explanation and I, therefore, beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1531.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote a booklet published in 1959 by the

People's Action Party on its cultural policy:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We want to promote the cultures of the various races

in  order to fuse it into a common Malayan culture.  At

the same time, we want to suppress all foreign and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



immoral culture in order to prevent this yellow culture

from undermining the moral attitude of our people. Many

people  have  been victimised by this  yellow  culture.

That  is  why we want to suppress the growth of  yellow

culture to safeguard the healthy growth of the people's

minds.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have quoted the policy on culture

formulated  by  the P.A.P. in 1959 and ever  since  the

Government has been following it. On the one  hand,  we

are trying to promote healthy culture and, on the other

hand, we are ruthlessly suppressing foreign immoral and

yellow  culture.  Therefore,  in  the  past  few  years

healthy culture has been thriving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what surprises me is that recently in many cinemas

in  Singapore,  unhealthy and yellow  films  have  been

shown.  This  causes us grave concern.  This  unhealthy

culture  can  be classified under the following  heads:

firstly, fiction pictures; secondly, fighting pictures;

and   thirdly,  romantic  and  immoral  pictures.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, most of these films come from  Japan  or

the  Philippines. Their contents are absurd and against

ethical  values, the stories are very absurd too.  Most

of  these films show armed robberies and illegal sexual

relations between men and women. They appeal to  people

of  low  taste. They will undermine the  minds  of  our

adolescents  and  young  people.  If  we  continue   to

tolerate  such  unhealthy  films  being  shown  in  our

cinemas  here, they will not only annul the  effort  we

have made in the past to destroy yellow culture, but it

will also lead to an increase of all sorts of crime  in

our  society. Therefore, in the interest of the people,

I  would  like to urge the Minister concerned  to  take

immediate  action  to put a stop to  the  screening  of

unhealthy  pictures  and that the  Film  Censors  Board

should   carry  out  more  stringently  its   work   in

accordance  with  our cultural policy  and  allow  more

healthy   films,  educational  films,  films  of   high

artistic  value  to  be  imported  into  Singapore  for

screening.  As a newly emergent nation, we should  have

the  nourishment of a healthy culture to enable the two

million people of Singapore to benefit from it  and  to

inculcate in our people a healthy ideological outlook.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full

agreement with my friend the Member for Sembawang  that

the  Film Censors Board must be careful about censoring

indecent  films. The deleterious effects of  indecency,

violence,  crime and immorality are too well known  for

me to preach a sermon here. But I think we are becoming

too  dangerously tolerant or liberal in  this  respect,

and some drastic steps seem to be called for. That much

for the Film Censors Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have received a representation

from  a cinema operator and film distributor that delay

has  been unduly caused by this Film Censors Board.  It

is  obvious that films imported from Taiwan, Hong Kong,

Japan,  and even for that matter, from Communist China,

have  been unduly delayed. In this connection,  Sir,  I

hope the Film Censors Board should try to expedite  the

censoring  of  these films as quickly as  possible.  Of

course,  we  may  have to be careful that  these  films

imported  from  the countries I have mentioned  earlier

have  to be treated with the same caution. By all means

we  agree, knowing full well ourselves the struggles we

have  been through to defeat anti-national forces.  But

surely the process of censorship can be expedited  with

no weakening of our armour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grumble amongst the importers of these films is

that  the  Censor authority takes a long  time  -  some

three  to  four months - to screen these films.  It  is

pretty  well  known that films usually are imported  to

coincide with certain festive occasions and periods  in

the year when the importers believe the films will make

the  biggest impact. You can, therefore, imagine,  Sir,

their  quandary perhaps to find that after having  paid

through their noses to get the film into Singapore,  it

does  not  get  through the censor barriers  until  the

season  for that picture is completely over.  In  these

circumstances, the importer, instead of having a  large

box office draw, loses a lot when the film for which he

pays so much gets out of season.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this is a genuine complaint, and I hope it

will be met. But I want to make it clear, nevertheless,

that I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



holding  no  particular brief for these  operators.  My

only  interest  is that there is a crying  need  for  a

sensible arrangement. We do not want our citizens to be

deprived  of their measure of appropriate entertainment

because  the wheels in the Film Censors Board  move  so

very  slowly. They can be made to move faster  so  that

cinema  operators  can  confidently  arrange  for   the

entertainment  of  this  section  of  the   people   of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have similar views on this subhead.  I

think  the Government's measures against yellow culture

have  been  very  well carried out.  But  I  have  also

discovered  that there are some loopholes.  Of  course,

from the point of view of film importers, if Government

can only relax certain regulations, they will stand  to

benefit.  If  Government  can  only  allow  strip-tease

shows, this will appeal to them very much because  this

is  in their own interest. However, the Government will

have  to carry out certain measures in accordance  with

its  cultural  policy. This is even more  so  now  that

Singapore has achieved independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised certain points,

and  I  have certain views about them. Sometimes it  is

not   the  substance  that  matters.  It  may  be  film

importers have used various means to attract members of

the   public,   or   perhaps  they  have   purposefully

emphasised  certain sexual scenes in order  to  attract

members of the public.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes in a story various means are used to arouse

the  emotions  of the people so as to attract  them  to

these  films  for their own benefit. I personally  feel

Government should introduce strict measures to stop the

film  operators  from using immoral means  and  various

sexual  appeals  in  advertising  certain  films.  Some

advertisements  are really appalling. I have  forgotten

the titles of these films. In the Tiong Bahru and Tiong

Poh areas, I have come across certain advertisements in

which  there  were four ladies in very  short  panties.

They were scantily dressed in order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



attract passers-by and these advertisements were placed

at  street corners. Motorists too were attracted to the

advertisements.  As  a result of  this,  the  lives  of

others were endangered by these motorists driving their

vehicles.  I feel it is my duty to point out  the  very

sexual  appeal  in the advertisements. I  am  convinced

there are other films which have not been passed by the

Film  Censors  Board and these are particularly  sexual

films  of  an  immoral content. I hope the  Board  will

continue  to adopt stringent measures in this  respect.

There are films which have not been passed in Singapore

but  have been passed in Johore. So you will invariably

find  crowds  of people going to Johore to  view  these

films  which  have been extensively advertised  in  the

local   Press.  Often  the  advertisements  appear   in

mysterious ways, sometimes even with question marks, in

order  to  arouse the curiosity of the people and  make

the films more mysterious and more appealing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I begin by

briefly  informing the House of the policy of the  Film

Censors with particular emphasis on Japanese films. Out

of  a total of 900 original feature films dealt with by

the  Film  Censors Board this year up to the middle  of

December, about 130 were films of Japanese origin,  the

majority of which were Mandarin dubbed or intended  for

Mandarin dubbing. Of these 130 Japanese films, about 20

were  passed without cuts, 90 with cuts, and 20  banned

altogether.  This constitutes about the highest  figure

percentage-wise  of  films  cut  or  banned.  There  is

absolutely  no  reason  why Japanese  films  dubbed  in

Mandarin, or any other language for that matter, should

be  singled out for unduly rough or harsh treatment  by

our  Film Censors. Sir, the Film Censors Board is fully

aware  of  the nature of these films and each  film  is

censored  on  its own merits. Censorship  of  films  is

carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the

censorship  directives which are as  realistic  and  as

liberal  as possible. Sir, we have no control over  the

quality of the films. The production



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



of  Japanese films is usually and surprisingly high and

those that have been released are deemed to be suitable

for  public exhibition. The reason for the increase  in

such films in Singapore is in reality two-fold. On  the

one  hand,  as  stated above, these  films  enjoy  wide

popularity and so the exhibitors bring them in in large

numbers.   Notwithstanding  the  adverse  comments   by

various Members earlier, there are many people who have

commented  favourably on Japanese-produced films.  Then

again  there  have been criticisms too. These  opposing

factors,   however,  merely  serve  to  underline   and

emphasise  what  censorship work involves.  It  is  not

possible   to  please  everybody  at  the  same   time.

Differences of opinion must exist, and indeed it  is  a

healthy sign that differences of opinion do exist,  for

they  indicate interest in what is going on around  us.

But  they must be aired in the spirit of give and take.

No  one  sector of opinion should impose its will  upon

the  other with absolute finality. Sir, even  when  the

Board  makes  a decision on the film, that decision  is

not final. It is subject to appeal by the exhibitors to

the  Film Appeals Committee. They could bring it up for

decision by the Appeals Committee. Sir, the decision of

the  Appeals  Committee - whose members  are  appointed

annually  by  the  Minister and who come  from  various

walks of life - over-rides that of the Board. There are

many films which were partly or wholly rejected by  the

Board  but were released for exhibition by the  Appeals

Committee  either with less cuts than  they  originally

required or completely uncut.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to deal briefly with some of the

comments  made  by  the Members earlier.  We  must  not

forget  that we are an affluent society and, therefore,

the situation has now completely changed since 1959. We

will  have to be more liberal in our approach, but that

does  not  mean that we completely lose  sight  of  our

Party's  policy.  It is difficult,  particularly  in  a

place like Singapore which is multi-racial, for one  to

impose  the  standard of morality of one  community  on

another  with  differences  in  background,  education,

culture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



and  tradition. No one can claim that he is an  arbiter

of   morality.  Nevertheless,  we  consider  that  film

censorship in Singapore is about the strictest in  this

part  of  the world. We are so strict that, as  pointed

out by the Member for Delta, there appears to be a

one-way  traffic going across the Causeway. I say good luck

to  the bus companies and the film exhibitors in Johore

Bahru.  Sir,  this  goes to show  that  our  policy  is

different  from that across the Causeway. We  are  more

liberal  with films which have a political aspect.  But

we   are  very  strict  with  films  that  we  consider

detrimental to the morality of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Sembawang has implied in his

comments that we are responsible for not showing  films

of  educational  value. The House will appreciate  that

the  contents of production and the number of films  on

educational aspects are completely out of our  control.

In  as  much as we try to bring up a very cultured  and

refined society, we must also not forget entertainment.

I  am  sure the film companies and film exhibitors  are

very  sensitive  about profits and,  therefore,  we  at

least  must be as cultural and as entertaining  in  the

execution of the Film Censors' work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Bras Basah has complained of the

undue delay caused by the Film Censors Board. I wish to

state  that  we  view  films  practically  every   day,

sometimes up to eight or nine films a day, and there is

no  undue delay as suggested by him. We normally notify

the  exhibitors of the films that are banned or  passed

with  cuts, and if they so desire, they may  appeal  to

the   Appeals  Committee.  If  the  films  are   banned

altogether,  the  Film Censors Board  normally  returns

them  to the exhibitors well in time for them to return

to  the distributors. If the Member could assist me  by

quoting one instance of which film was delayed, I shall

take up the matter with my officials and see to it that

no  undue  delay will be caused in future to  any  film

submitted  by  any film exhibitors. I would  also  call

upon the Member for Delta



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



and  the  Member  for Sembawang to  quote  me  specific

instances  where they consider Japanese films,  or  for

that  matter any other films, are undesirable in  order

that  we  may consider their opinions. Perhaps  we  may

even adopt them in our film censorship policy.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture

just  now  in  his reply has said that our  society  is

different  from  that  existing before  1959.  This  is

undeniable,  of  course. But in  the  past  we  were  a

colonial  territory;  now we are  controlling  our  own

fate.   Ours  is  an  independent  country.  Therefore,

everything  will  have  to  be  decided  by  ourselves.

Everything  should progress with time. We  should  also

remember that the development of culture is multi-fold.

It  depends on how we guide its development. It is  not

right  that  if in 1959 there were Yang Ko  dances,  we

should  pursue them also this year. It is  not  logical

that  we should pursue now what has taken place in  the

past.  Our  culture is developing with  the  times;  it

should   also  be  able  to  accommodate   the   racial

characteristics and habits of the different communities

in  order  that the cream of the various  cultures  can

blossom forth and contribute to the general culture  of

Singapore. Since such evil things as mentioned  by  the

Members  have happened, we should take steps to control

them.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

heard  discussions  on film-goers in  Singapore,  films

censored in Singapore and those barred from film  going

in Singapore. I have never been a frequent cinema-goer,

so  I do not know what is going on in the cinemas.  But

what  I would suggest is that we should have a movement

for  a healthy culture - healthy dances and dramas  and

so  on  -  to  compete  with the so-called  not-so-good

culture  or a bit yellowish culture, which hon. Members

have mentioned. I quite agree that we should uphold the

good name of our citizens. Therefore, I urge every  one

of  us to show some responsibility and try to inculcate

in our citizens a better sense



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



of  culture  by  organising and helping our  people  to

organise  themselves  and compete  with  what  we  call

yellow culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, I think we have discussed

this   topic  long  enough.  Various  views  have  been

expressed.  Just in reply and no more.  Just  one  last

speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

glad  to hear the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Ministry of Culture. He said that, in regard to

culture,  the Government's policy would not be contrary

to  what has been laid down in 1959. I am glad to  hear

that.  I  also agree with him that one section  of  the

people cannot impose the characteristics of its culture

on  the other sections of the people. I should tell him

that  I  have never mentioned that we should do  so.  I

have  never said that Chinese culture is the  only  one

that  is  healthy or that Western culture is  the  only

healthy one. So if the Parliamentary Secretary has been

vague about this in his speech, I hope he will clarify.

As  regards  the film, "War and Peace", there  is  also

some  controversy over it. Even among Western pictures,

there are also good ones. I consider "War and Peace"  a

good  film.  We should judge films according  to  their

contents.  I  am  glad  to say that  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  has assured us that the Government  will  in

its  policy on films pursue the same policy as has been

laid down. So I give my support to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, when I say that no community

should impose its standard of morality on the others, I

was  making a general statement, and I hope the  Member

for  Sembawang will not be unduly sensitive about  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will try to clarify one point which the Member

for  Delta  has  brought  up earlier;  that  is,  there

appears to be an absence of healthy films in Singapore.

As  I  have  said,  Sir, we have no control  over  this

matter. We only censor what is submitted to us. And  if

the  film  producers do not intend to produce films  of

educational value, we do not receive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



them  and  we do not censor them. With regard to  those

films that are submitted to us, as I have said earlier,

we  censor  them  according  to  their  own  merits  in

accordance with the established policy of the  Ministry

of Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, do you wish to proceed to a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is for information only. Though the sum here

is  $550, I just want to know what has Broadcasting got

to do with the Caldecott Hill Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Caldecott Hill

Estate, where Radio and T.V. Singapura are situated, is

private property, and except for the portion where  the

studios  and the officers of the Broadcasting  Division

are  situated,  the  roads in this estate  are  private

roads.  Just  as every householder on the site  has  to

contribute  to the general maintenance of  the  estate,

the  Broadcasting Division also has to  contribute  its

share  towards  grass-cutting charges at  about  $30  a

month,  repairs to the private roads, sewers, etc.  The

purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government is going to complete the building of

its new television studio, and when it is completed the

four  language streams will present programmes for  all

the  people in a very good way. This was stated in  the

President's Address. We welcome it. However, I have  to

air my views on certain shortcomings in the programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks ago we celebrated our National Language

Month  -  on  stage, in community centres  and  in  the

Press.  We  gave it a lot of publicity. We  talked  and

wrote   much   about  it.  There  were  daily   special

programmes  over television. You also might  have  seen

and listened to all these programmes, Mr Speaker, Sir.

"Bahasa Bersama" is the title of one of the programmes.

Girls  were  shown  in this programme.  The  television

camera  was  focusing on the breasts  of  these  girls.

Perhaps the camera man was very happy about it. But the

people  are not very happy about it. We have to condemn

such activities. It is the duty of the Government to do

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Tamil Section of Radio Singapore

should  be  improved.  Although  more  time  has   been

allotted on T.V. for Tamil programmes, we never see any

good  programmes. I hope the Head of the Tamil  Section

will look into this. After the Radio news, a report  is

given  of  the  parliamentary proceedings whenever  the

House  meets. In this programme, Members' speeches  are

reported.  I  have listened to them. But there  is  one

shortcoming.  Last  night,  at  8.45  p.m.,  the  Tamil

Section   gave   a   broadcast  on  the   parliamentary

proceedings.  It was stated that I had  requested  that

television sets should be installed in all the wards in

Middleton Hospital. This is wrong. What I said was that

the children's wards in all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



hospitals  should be provided with T.V. sets.  I  hope

such  mistakes will not occur in future. At  times  the

people   have  criticised  radio  programmes   in   the

newspapers, particularly in the Tamil newspapers.  When

such  cases come up, the Ministry should not just  keep

quiet but should take action to remedy the defects.  It

should  also announce to the public that such criticism

could be forwarded to the Minister direct.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Discussion may also take place on

amendment No. (7) . Does any other Member wish to  speak

before I call on Mr Fong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I would like to congratulate

the  technicians who produced the film on the  national

language  because at least it succeeded  in  attracting

the  attention  of  the viewers. Sir,  Mr  Lingam  has

pointed out some undesirability ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Aljunied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I am sorry. The Member for Aljunied

has  pointed  out  some undesirability  in  the  camera

technique  of  the particular film which he  had  seen.

However, the interpretation of the meaning of that film

is  left  to the individual. If the Member for Aljunied

chose  to  interpret it in that sense, then I  have  no

control  over  his  feelings. But I  will,  of  course,

instruct   my   officers  in  future   to   take   into

consideration the opinions and comments as expressed by

the   Member   for  Aljunied  which  I  consider   very

constructive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the misquotation of the parliamentary

proceedings last evening over the Radio Tamil  network,

I  was  given  to  understand that the  debate  was  on

Middleton Hospital, and it was quite natural  that  the

report should have stated that the Member had requested

that  television  sets be installed in  every  ward  in

Middleton  Hospital. However, I agree with  the  Member

for Aljunied that that was not exactly what he said  in

this   House,  and  I  have  instructed  the   officers

concerned to be more careful in future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to assure him that the mistakes were

not deliberate but inadvertent.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): The Parliamentary Secretary has

not  answered my last question, i.e. the criticism from

the  public  or criticism by newspapers could  be  sent

direct  to  the  Minister, and this promise  should  be

given to the public, and publicity should be given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, the Ministry is always alive

to  constructive criticism, and I assure Members of the

House and, for that matter, members of the public, that

any letter whether written direct to the Minister or to

a local newspaper, will be attended to and discussed by

the  officials in the Ministry. And if the contents  of

the  letter are found to be constructive in nature,  we

will  then take them into consideration and will remedy

our shortcomings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): I withdraw my amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $15,810,190 for Head 1002 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1003 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our Government is one that looks after

the   benefits  given  to  the  people.   Annually   we

appropriate a sum of more than $10 million  for  public

assistance. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Social Affairs has already stated that  last  year

public assistance came to $10 million. But this year it

is  only  $9  million.  This  shows  that  there  is  a

reduction in public assistance, and the reason given is

that  the  number  of  people  seeking  assistance  has

decreased  and,  therefore, the  expenditure  also  has

decreased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I have received many complaints from members of

the public that their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



applications to the Department concerned for assistance

have been delayed unduly. What are the reasons? I would

like the Minister concerned to look into the matter and

to  see how best to deal with it. Our Government  is  a

Government  that  looks  after  the  interests  of  the

people,  especially the poorer class, and we should  be

sympathetic  to  such  people  who  apply  for   public

assistance. The staff in the Social Affairs Department,

being  public servants, should be sympathetic to people

who need assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that recipients of public assistance are mostly

aged  people who have no means to rely upon to  make  a

living,   and  widows,  widowers  and  other  destitute

people.  Some of these people have been unemployed  for

quite  a long time and are unable to get some means  of

support.  Their situation is very difficult and  should

merit our sympathy. Therefore, since our Government  is

one  that looks after the interests and welfare of  the

people, special attention should be paid to this matter

so  that we can be of assistance to them. Yet there are

some  Government officers who are not properly carrying

out  Government's policy in this regard,  and  so  they

have not been able promptly to deal with cases in, say,

approving  applications and giving out the  assistance.

The recipients earnestly hope that they will be able to

receive  their aid in time, because they have to  incur

various  family expenses, such as rent for their  house

and  other things. As far as I understand it, the delay

has  been even up to six months, and the shortest delay

is three months. So I would like the Minister concerned

to investigate and see whether there are such instances

of delay or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Ministry concerned to give

special attention to applications for public assistance

from  people  in rural areas. Usually when  replies  to

these  people are delayed for several weeks, they  will

have to go to the Social Welfare Department to enquire,

thus  incurring  transport expenses to  town  and  also

expenses  for  their meals when in town. We  know  that

these poor people cannot afford



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



such expenses, and if the Department concerned can help

them, it will reduce their burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng): Mr Speaker, normally it

takes  about  two weeks to consider an application  for

public  assistance  from the date of its  registration,

for  the application has to be investigated, processed,

and  given  a decision. However, there are cases  where

applicants  -  (a) have furnished incorrect  addresses,

(b)  leave addresses which are difficult to locate, and

(c)   require  a  thorough  investigation  into   their

circumstances.  In  all  these  cases,  some  delay  is

unavoidable as more than one home visit will have to be

made and a fuller investigation required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few months the Social Welfare Department

has  had to cope with special assignments, for example,

the  relief  and  rehabilitation of  victims  of  civil

disturbances  in July and September 1964,  the  special

assistance  scheme for fishermen who were  affected  by

the curfew imposed in Singapore coastal waters in early

1965,  and  a  special  scheme  for  payment  of   rent

subsidies  to  Malay families who are affected  by  the

Government's redevelopment scheme. As a result of these

special assignments, investigation officers have had to

be  taken off their normal public assistance work. This

has   resulted  in  an  unavoidable  slowing  down   of

investigation of public assistance cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action is in hand to recruit more staff for the public

assistance   section.  It  is  hoped  that   with   the

employment of additional staff, it will be possible  to

speed up the investigation of public assistance cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does that satisfy the Member?

<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has established many

creches and rendered facilities to the people. However,

more  creches  should be built so that parents  can  be

relieved  of a heavy burden. Quite a number of  parents

have to go out to work. Therefore, they have no time to

look  after  their children. I hope the  Ministry  will

take adequate steps in this connection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, at the moment the

Department maintains a total of ten children's  creches

and 16 children's centres. The creches provide care and

training for children of a few weeks' old to five years

of age, whose mothers are working and who cannot afford

to  send them to private kindergartens. Every child  is

given  breakfast,  lunch, and  tea,  and  free  medical

attention is provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creches are open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Mondays

to  Fridays and from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays. The

ten  creches  have a daily total average attendance  of

over 300. It has been found that the ten creches, which

are  located in various parts of Singapore,  appear  to

have met the need for this type of service, so that  at

the  moment  there  is no demand for  an  extension  of

service. In fact, a number of our creches, for example,

those  at  Manila  Street and Bukit Ho  Swee,  are  not

filled to capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 16 children's centres run by the Department have a

daily  total  average attendance of over  1,000.  These

centres provide elementary education for children  who,

for  some  reason or other, cannot be admitted  to  the

schools run by the Ministry of Education. They are open

from  9 am. to 5 p.m. on Mondays to Fridays and from  9

a.m. to  12 noon on Saturdays. The children  attending

these  centres  are  from 5 to 13 years  of  age.  They

receive  snacks  of  milk,  vitamins,  buns,  and  free

fruits.  Free  medical  and dental  treatment  is  also

provided.  All these children's centres are located  in

existing community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



centres  run  by  the Peoples Association,  and  it  is

possible  that  the hon. Member is referring  to  these

centres rather than creches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of increasing the number of children's

creches will have to be considered in relation  to  the

availability of staff and the need in each locality. In

fact, the position has been under constant review h the

Department of Social Welfare



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. Member would like to suggest particular

locations  where  there  is at  present  no  children's

centre and where he considers the establishment of such

a  centre is desirable, the matter will be looked  into

by the department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer

to  the  centres where children are looked  after  when

parents   go   to   work.  Those  are  the   particular

institutions I am referring to. I am not talking  about

children's  centres which cater for  education.  What  I

mean  are  creches where the parents leave the children

when they go to work. These children are taken away  by

their  parents later in the day when they  return  from

work. I am saying that these centres will be beneficial

to  the  parents.  I  feel that all  community  centres

should  run  this  sort of centres, thereby  making  it

convenient for parents to go to work. I hope the number

of  creches  will be increased. I was not referring  to

other matters. I was referring to creches.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chan, do you wish to add anything

more? Yes, Inche Othman Wok.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think there

is   any  possibility  of  starting  a  creche  in  the

community centres because most of the community centres

especially in the rural areas are being used during the

day  time. In the morning, for instance, they are  used

for  selling pig food and other things. There are  also

centres run by the Social Welfare Department and  these

are  used  by  the  public from three  o'clock  in  the

afternoon. So if you have working parents who  wish  to

leave



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



their children in the creches, that means they have  to

take  back their children at three o'clock and  not  at

five  o'clock because both parents usually finish their

work  at  about 5 p.m. However, the Ministry will  look

into this matter further to satisfy the Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In views of the reply, does the Member

wish to pursue the matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): I beg to withdraw the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2062.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is observed that there is an

unusual  increase in the Estimates for  the  year  1966

from $2,500 in 1965 to $86,500 in respect of this vote.

Does  the  Government expect more destitute persons  in

1966 or is it due to the under estimate in 1965?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under subhead 2063 the provision of

$9.6  million has been estimated for public  assistance

to unemployed persons. I do not understand why there is

such a need for this vote. Sir, I begin to suspect that

we  are  gong  to face a situation in future  in  which

there  will he an influx of destitute persons from  the

other  side of the Causeway. If this vote is meant  for

repatriating these destitute persons hack to the  other

side of the Causeway, then I say. Sir, it is unfair for

our  hard-earned revenue to be spent on this.  However,

this is the responsibility of the Malaysian Government.

We should hold the Malaysian Government responsible for

this  expenditure. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  is  only  my

assumption. Nevertheless, I should he grateful  if  the

Minister  for  Culture and Social Affairs would  kindly

enlighten this House on the utility of this vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, this provision is

used  for assisting destitute and stranded persons  and

for  the  purchase  of rations for feeding  victims  of

civil  calamities  like fires and floods.  It  was  the

practice in previous years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



to  make a standard provision of $2,500 per year and to

supplement  this  provision from  savings  under  other

votes in the course of the year should the provision be

inadequate. For 1966, however, the provision  has  been

increased to meet additional payments as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Special relief to fishermen who have been

adversely affected by the curfew imposed in the coastal

waters  around  Singapore. Fishermen families  affected

are  given  assistance at the rate  of  $5  per  person

subject to a maximum of $30 per household; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Special grants of $5 per person to victims of fire

and other calamities which in the past were charged  to

a   public   assistance   vote.   It   was   considered

inappropriate to charge this expenditure to the  public

assistance vote and the transfer of liability  to  this

vote is to regularise the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, does that answer satisfy you?

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well then. amendment (4) is not

proceeded with. Amendment (5) - Inche Mohd. Ariff  bin

Suradi.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan) (In

Malay): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 he reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2063.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, each recipient of public assistance from

the  Social Welfare Department realises and knows  that

the  money given to him is not for his maintenance  but

to  assist  him  to  stave off hunger.  If  I  am  not

mistaken  the head of a family gets $21, his wife  gets

$10, and each child under the age of 18 years gets  $5.

This  total  is at times reduced by the Social  Welfare

Department.  For instance, when an inspector  from  the

Social Welfare Department comes round to investigate  a

family receiving public assistance, the person is asked

whether it is sufficient or not. The officer knows that

the  amount is insufficient. But because the  recipient

is  sincere, he says that he has to seek other means of

income. When it is found that he has other means to get

some  money, for instance, by selling cakes and so  on,

so  as  to enable him to pay for the transport expenses

of  his  children, his public assistance  allowance  is

cut. This is very unsatisfactory because the assistance

given  to  such recipient is inadequate and, therefore,

he has to find other ways to augment his income. So the

method  employed by the inspector in carrying  out  his

investigations into such matters is unsatisfactory.  On

getting the answer, the allowance is cut for the coming

month.  If  an  elderly person is  entitled  to  public

assistance and he stays by himself - if he merely stays

in the place for shelter - he is given only $4 and not

$21.  This  too  is a matter about which  I  feel  most

unhappy. Although he should be getting $21, he  is  not

given  it  simply because he has to stay  with  someone

else.  For  this reason he is given only  $4.  So,  Mr

Speaker,  I  request  that the Minister  concerned

re-consider both these matters that I have raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to raise concerns

the public assistance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



given  to Malays who are affected by the urban  renewal

scheme.  Those who are affected are given subsidies  of

20  per  cent. I would like to remind the Minister  for

Culture and Social Affairs that quite a good number  of

Malays who are not affected by the urban renewal scheme

are  keen  to stay in flats but because of their  small

income,  they cannot afford to do so. I would  like  to

know from the Minister whether this assistance could be

given to those people who are not affected by the urban

renewal scheme but who wish to stay in flats,



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think possibly this would be a good

time to take the tea break.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1003 (contd.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head 1003, Amendment No. (5). Inche Mohd

Ariff Bin Suradi has already spoken. Mr Sim Boon Woo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the same

view  as the Member for Kampong Kembangan on the matter

of   public  assistance,  as  I  am  facing  the   same

difficulties  with  the voters in  my  constituency.  I

would  like  to add that in my constituency  there  are

fishermen living in Bedok, Padang Terbakar, Mata  Ikan,

Ayer  Gemuroh, Kampong Changi, Pulau Tekong  Besar  and

Pulau  Ubin who are affected by the imposition  of  the

off-shore  curfew due to the Indonesian  confrontation.

Sir, all of them have registered for public assistance,

but not many of them have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



been  entertained by the Social Welfare  Department.  I

would  like  to draw the attention of the  Minister  to

this  matter,  and I hope he will be able to  enlighten

this House on the measures he proposes to implement for

assisting these poor fishermen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like the Minister also to inform

this  House  that if an applicant for public assistance

has two wives, whether both of them will be included in

the  assessment of public assistance allowance. Sir,  I

beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, under this Head, we see that the Government is

voting $9,600,000 for 1966 and yet for 1965 it was  $10

million.  There is a great difference in the  vote.  We

can  expect, therefore, that some applicants for public

assistance  may not be able to get assistance,  because

of  a  reduction in this vote. Just now the Member  who

spoke on this subject also mentioned this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister concerned a few

questions.  To  give an example, if a couple  have  two

children  and  they get $30 public assistance  with  no

other  sources  of income, they will  not  be  able  to

maintain  themselves  and their two  children  on  this

meagre   sum.  Therefore,  under  these  circumstances,

possibly one of the family - maybe the wife - will have

to go out and do some work, such as washing clothes for

others, in order to get some extra income which will be

about  $30  per  month. Under these circumstances,  the

couple's  public  assistance from  the  Social  Welfare

Department might be cut by the same amount. Let us also

say that one of the children gets a temporary job at  a

salary  of between $30 and $40 a month. Such  a  meagre

income  may be enough for the child's expenditure,  but

it  is  likely that the Social Welfare Department  will

cut  off all the assistance given to that family.  Thus

this  will  give  the  public the impression  that  the

people  who  get  public  assistance  from  the  Social

Welfare  Department are those who stay at home  and  do

not  go  to work and that if they go out and make  some

money  for themselves, their allowance will be  cut  by

the  same amount that they earn. So they might as  well

not go to work. They might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



as  well  depend  forever on public  assistance.  These

things are quite common in my constituency and that  is

why  I mention them in this House. There are such cases

in my constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to give another example. An aged

couple  with no children drew public assistance of  $20

per  month  for  quite some time.  After  paying  their

monthly  rental,  they had nothing left.  They  had  no

other  alternative but to seek other means of income.

This  couple told me frankly of their plight. They said

that  they  could  earn an income of  about  $20.  They

wanted  to  know,  if  the  Social  Welfare  Department

officers  approached  them  in  the  course  of   their

investigation,  whether they would  have  to  tell  the

officers frankly about this extra income. Since I  have

to  look after the interests and welfare of the  people

in  my  constituency. I was in a dilemma,  not  knowing

what  to  tell them, whether or not to advise  them  to

tell  the  Social  Welfare Department officers  frankly

that they were in receipt of an extra income of $20.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Minister concerned will deal with this

kind of cases and adopt a better method whereby if  any

cut were to be made in public assistance to any family,

he  should take into consideration other facts and  cut

only the part in respect of the working members of such

a family. I hope he will give due consideration to this

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to associate

myself  with the views expressed by my three colleagues

who  have  spoken before me. I notice that $10  million

was estimated for this year and $9,600,000 for 1966;  a

vast  sum of $400,000 has thus been deducted. I say  "a

vast  sum"  because we know that people look to  public

assistance  not because they like to enjoy  the  bitter

bread  of  charity  but  because of  extreme  financial

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in view of this, I would like the Minister to

enlighten  this House on the reason for budgeting  $9.6

million for next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, I think one has to

face a lot of hard facts in life. Getting money from

the Government is one of them and the Government has a

duty to look after the taxpayers' money and not just

pay it out without looking into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, first of all, answer the Member for Kampong

Kembangan on the point he has raised just now?  As  the

total  payment under the public assistance  scheme  has

been  rising very steeply from $7.2 million in 1961  to

$9.7  million  in  1963, and as  a  result  of  reports

received  by the Department of large numbers of  public

assistance recipients receiving public assistance under

false  pretences - the majority of recipients who  find

jobs  fail to report to the Department and continue  to

draw  public  assistance although they  are  no  longer

eligible - it was decided to start a systematic  review

of  all  public assistance cases in April  1964.  As  a

result  of this review, it has been found that, on  the

average,   about  20  per  cent  of  public  assistance

recipients  are  bogus cases. This review  has  enabled

bogus  cases  to be closed and the money available  for

public  assistance relief to be diverted to the  really

deserving  cases of families whose heads are  genuinely

unemployed.   Public   assistance   recipients    whose

allowance has either been stopped or reduced can always

appeal  to  the Assistant Director (Public  Assistance)

for  reconsideration. On receipt of an appeal, the case

is  reinvestigated and if circumstances  are  disclosed

which   merit  the  continuance  of  public  assistance

relief, the case is reinstated.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second point raised by the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan on housing subsidies, for  the  time

being,  the subsidies are only confined to those  Malay

families   who   are  affected  by  urban   development

projects, who have a total income of less than $300 and

who  wish to occupy Housing Board flats. But as for the

others  who  are  not  affected  by  urban  development

projects,  the  Government, of course,  is  willing  to

study their cases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by the Member for Kampong

Kembangan  is  that those who are staying with  friends

have  their subsidies deducted. I hope that the  Member

for  Kampong Kembangan can take up such cases with  our

Minister. We shall look into these cases also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to matters raised by the Member for

Changi,  according to the records of the Social Welfare

Department, a total of 163 fishermen living  in  Changi

have  been  referred to the department  for  assistance

under the scheme. As a result of investigations carried

out  by the department, 22 of these families have  been

found eligible and have been given assistance under the

scheme.  The  balance of 141 were found ineligible  for

assistance  under the scheme for various  reasons.  For

example, some have been found to be already in  receipt

of  public  assistance; others have  found  alternative

sources  of  income  which render them  ineligible  for

assistance. Secondly, there are cases in which a public

assistance applicant has two wives and both of them are

included in the assessment for public assistance relief

if  the  department is satisfied that both of them  are

without income of their own and are dependent upon  the

applicant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Punggol, it will take a

considerable time to go through the records  of  public

assistance  pensions  for  a number  of  recipients  in

Punggol  constituency,  as the  records  are  kept  for

Singapore  as a whole and not broken up by constituency

or  by  area. In fact, a number of requests  have  been

received from Members of Parliament asking for  a  list

of    public    assistance    recipients    in    their

constituencies, and the Social Welfare  Department  has

been   hard   put  to  it  to  provide  the   necessary

information. Members of Parliament who have  asked  for

this information and have not been supplied with it are

requested  to be patient, is the work involved  in  the

compiling   of  the  information  required   is   quite

considerable.  It  is regretted that  it  will  not  be

possible to inform the Member for Punggol of the number

of  applications which have been submitted to  him  and

which  have  been  successful,  as  this  will  involve

searching through every public assistance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



file  which has been opened for the last 5 or 6  years.

As  there  are about 30,000 public assistance cases  in

action,  it  will be appreciated that this  involves  a

considerable amount of work which the public assistance

section, which has a lot of work daily, will be  unable

to  undertake  at  the moment. I think  these  are  the

points raised by the Member for Punggol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Ulu Pandan, he has raised the

point   that  public  assistance  relief  be  paid   to

recipients  who are engaged in casual work.  Under  the

public  assistance scheme, relief is paid on the  basis

of  a  means test under which the following  limits  of

income  are not taken into account - first, a recipient

with  no dependants, $10; second, a recipient with  one

or  two dependants, $15; third, a recipient with  three

or  four dependants, $20; fourth, a recipient with five

or  more  dependants,  $25. Thus  a  public  assistance

recipient  who  has  five or more  dependants  and  who

earns,  say,  $50 a month from casual  labour  will  be

allowed to retain $25 of his income. The remaining  $25

will  have  to  be deducted from his public  assistance

allowance.  In some cases, however, it is difficult  to

ascertain  the  amount of income  earned  by  a  casual

labourer; and in such cases, a rough and ready rule  is

applied and the average monthly income is estimated  at

$40. Each case is, of course, treated on its own merits

and  where  there  are  special circumstances  meriting

sympathetic  treatment, the recipient is usually  given

the  benefit  of  the  doubt and, where  possible,  the

minimum  amount deductible under the scheme is deducted

from the public assistance allowance.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): If there are

bogus cases, not only should their assistance allowance

be  stopped, but the due process of law should be taken

against  them. But if the cases are genuine,  then  the

matter  should be considered. I have put  forward  four

cases to the authorities, but to no avail.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture and

Social Affairs for replying to what I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



have  not  asked for; that is, I had intended to  raise

the  matter, but I did not say just now that  I  wanted

information  on  the  number of  recipients  of  public

assistance  in  my constituency. However,  I  am  still

grateful to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, he has not answered one little point, that is

in  respect of the $400,000 that has been deducted from 1966 Estimates. I will be grateful if he will be kind

enough to enlighten this House on why the $400,000  has

to be deducted next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, I think this is due

to   the  bogus  cases.  Some  bogus  cases  have  been

uncovered;  so it seems that we will have enough  funds

for next year's expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has said that action should

be   taken  against  the  bogus  recipients  of  public

assistance allowance. I think we have definitely  taken

action  against them. He said that we have  not  looked

into the matter, but I think the Minister has told  him

outside this House that he can submit his cases to  him

and  that he will be prepared to look into those  cases

which are not being looked into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2081.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I just wish to elicit information

only; what is this allowance and to whom is it given?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this allowance

is for the foster-mothers. The fostering out scheme has

been  administered  by the department  since  1956  and

provides  carefully  selected  foster-mothers  to  look

after  children  up  to the age of  10  who  cannot  be

brought  up in their own homes or who, for some  reason

or other, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



been  deprived  of normal maternal care;  for  example,

when the mother is ill or has been hospitalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fostering-out of the child is an assignment which

calls  for careful consideration and selection, and  it

is  vitally important that he is placed in a home where

the  foster-mother is capable of understanding him  and

where he is likely to find a happy adjustment, the  aim

being  to  provide him with the best substitute  for  a

home. Foster-mothers under the scheme are paid from $50

to  $60  per  month according to the age of  the  child

placed  in their care and, where possible, parents  are

encouraged to make a contribution towards the cost.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not satisfied with the Social Welfare

Department's  assistance  to the  needy  in  Singapore,

because   this  department  does  not  carry  out   its

investigations  fully  in  respect  of  a   recipient's

dependants who are in need of public assistance.  There

are  applicants whose living conditions are  appalling.

But  there  are also applicants who possess  their  own

homes  and  some are living in rented homes.  The  same

amount  of  public assistance from this  department  is

received for the same number of dependants. I  am  sure

that those applicants who are living in their own homes

are   not  in  a  bad  plight  because  of  the  public

assistance  they receive. But for those applicants  who

have to pay house rents from the public assistance that

they receive, this may mean more difficulty.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall give an example to explain such a case in my

constituency.  A family lived in a Geylang  Serai  flat

belonging  to the Housing and Development  Board.  When

the  head of the family first occupied the flat, he was

employed  in a small Chinese firm. Not long after,  the

firm wound up, and he became unemployed. He applied for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



public  assistance  from the Social Welfare  Department

and  he  received an amount of $46. The rental  of  his

flat was $46.50, not including water and light.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the public assistance he received was

insufficient  to support his family,  he  had  to  wash

clothes  and  his daughter had to sell cakes.  When  an

investigator from the Social Welfare Department came to

know  that he was earning some money by washing clothes

and  selling cakes, his public assistance was  stopped,

although  he  had  explained his circumstances  to  the

investigator concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the special allowance given to a person who

lives  in his own house is $21. In the case of  another

who  is  a lodger, the allowance is $4. When the person

appealed  to the Department concerned in order  to  get

more public assistance, he was advised to move out  and

live on his own, which means that he would have to rent

a room. If he can only get $21 from this Department and

he has to pay a rental of $20, then the balance will be

a  paltry sum. This will cause more hardship to him.  I

hope this matter will receive due consideration by  the

Ministry concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, under the public

assistance  scheme,  the  rates  of  payment   are   in

accordance  with  certain rules of  eligibility  and  a

means test. Those Malay families living in Housing  and

Development  Board  flats  and  are  receiving   public

assistance  have  been  paid  in  accordance  with  the

scheme. To give any special treatment to those families

under  the  scheme  will  raise  difficulties  in   the

administration   of   the  public  assistance   scheme.

However, if there are such families whose circumstances

require  special consideration, it may be  possible  to

assist  them  in other ways outside the  ambit  of  the

public  assistance scheme. I would suggest to the  hon.

Member that he give the particulars of such families to

this  Ministry,  so that we can ask the Social  Welfare

Department to look into the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely want to know why the

provision for this subhead for the year 1966 is  double

the  amount estimated for 1965. Consequently, if I  may

say  so, Sir, the efficiency of the Fire Service should

increase. There is always the fear that whenever  there

is  a  fire, the houses in the affected area  are  more

often  than not gutted before the arrival of  the  fire

engines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, this provision is

for  paying  rental  charges to the  Telecommunications

V.H.F. radio  sets  are  used  as  a  means  of  quick

communication  between  the fire  engines,  ambulances,

fire   officers   and  fire  stations.  The   increased

provision  has been made necessary by the  increase  in

rental   charges   imposed  by  the  Telecommunications

Department, which in most cases have been doubled.  For

example, the rental previously charged for a mobile set

was $800 per year. This has been increased to $1,200  a

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1108 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present there are about 60 boats anchored

regularly  at the jetty at Upper Serangoon Road.  These

boats  are used for deep-sea fishing purposes. I  think

well over 90 per cent of them have boat licences. But I

noticed  that  these  licences  were  obtained  not  in

Singapore  but from our neighbouring country, Malaysia.

The  size  and  tonnage of these boats  range  from  80

horsepower upwards to well over 15 tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not understand why these fishermen do not

obtain  their boat licences from our Fisheries Division

in  the  Primary Production Department.  I  think  that

licences  obtained from elsewhere will do us  no  good,

because  we  lose  revenue.  So  I  would  request  the

Minister for Law and National Development to look  into

this  matter  with  a  view to issuing  Singapore  boat

licences  to these boats, so that, in one way,  we  can

get revenue for our country's coffers, which is our due

by right. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to the Member

for  Punggol, I do not intend to tell a fishing  story,

but  there is a little history behind all this.  Whilst

we  were  part  of  Malaysia, certain  Singapore  boats

preferred  to  obtain their fishing licences  from  the

State of Johore, because boats registered in the States

of  Malaya  were  given preferential treatment  by  the

Malaysian Navy Patrols, and it was for that reason that

the  boats from Punggol obtained their registration  in

Johore and left their nets in one of the coastal  towns

in  the  east  coast  of  Johore whilst  operating  and

selling  their catch in Singapore. With the separation,

however,  the position has now changed, and the  owners

of  these boats have been informed that at the  end  of

this year their licences, on termination, will not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



renewed  in  Johore. As from the 1st  of  January  next

year,  these  boats  will  have  to  be  registered  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the revenue, I would like to point out to the

Member  for  Punggol that the amount  of  licence  fees

involved  is negligible, but I agree with  him  on  the

principle of his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the

<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Government's policy, some car parks

are  covered while others are not covered. The  covered

car  parks are in Cecil Street (the multi-storeyed  car

park) and at Raffles Place. The open parking places are

along  the roads. The parking time-checks are  done  by

the  staff - and not by machinery or meter - by men and

women  attendants. I would like to mention that certain

women attendants have been sent to sites which are  not

suitable for them, e.g. Shenton Way and Robinson  Road,

which  are  quite  remote, and there  are  no  lavatory

facilities.  If  women  car park  attendants  are  sent

there, it will cause them a lot of inconvenience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister concerned whether

women  car  park  attendants could  be  sent  to  these

covered parking places. I do not mean to say that these

women attendants cannot stand the sun or rain, but what

I  would  like  to see is that they are  sent  to  more

suitable  places  to  work. I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister concerned to give some consideration  to  this

matter.  At  the  same time, I hope  he  will  consider

recruiting  more  women  car park  attendants,  as  the

figures  now  show that there are more  men  attendants

than women attendants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is about the time-checks and the

handling  of fees. At the moment, this sort of  job  is

done  by men car park attendants, and no women car park

attendants have been allotted this job. I feel that the

handling  of  parking fees should also be  assigned  to

women  attendants, because they are more  suitable  for

this   job.   I  hope  the  Minister  will  make   some

adjustments in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to be

allocated for Head 1108 be reduced by $10 in respect of

subhead 1259."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking on the amendment, amendment No. (3) may

also be taken into account.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  just  now  the Member for Delta has  asked  three

questions which are in a way surprising from a champion

of equality of rights for men and women workers. She is

now  suggesting that we should give preference  in  the

recruitment  of  parking  attendants  to  females   and

posting  them to covered car parks; and we should  also

permit  the  checking and handling of money within  car

parks  to be done by female attendants, as females  are

more careful. The selection of car park attendants  for

appointment  is  done  by a special  committee  in  the

Ministry  of Labour and approved by the Public  Service

Commission.  It is not for the Ministry to say  whether

the  committee  should  select or  the  Public  Service

Commission approve male or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



female attendants. It is Government's policy to make no

differentiation  whatsoever  between  male  and  female

officers.  It  is also patently unfair to  reserve  the

softer jobs - the jobs that are within the covered  car

parks  - for female parking attendants, while the  male

parking attendants should be posted to do outdoor work.

Car-parking   attendants,  by  the  nature   of   their

appointments, are required to attend to  the  many  car

parks  in  different parts of the city, and he  or  she

must  discharge all the duties of the post which he  or

she holds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, there have been some complaints that

certain car park attendants were favoured in that  they

were given work in the office or in covered car parks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it has been decided that there should be a

proper roster drawn up so that every car park attendant

would  do  the same range of duties, both  indoors  and

outdoors, on an equal basis, irrespective of whether or

not the attendant is a male or a female.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible for anyone to be certain that

female  officers  are more careful in the  handling  of

money  than male officers. The Car Parks Division must,

of necessity, treat every officer as being equal. There

are  no  posts of checkers as such in 1965,  but  there

will be new posts created in this way in 1966, and

car-parking  attendants will be selected to fill the  posts

of  checkers, but the selection will not  be  based  on

sex, but rather on the merits of each candidate.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for

National Development has given me a reply, and I  would

say  that  from the start I had already told the  House

not  to  criticise  me  when I  was  going  to  mention

something about the treatment of women. Actually, I  am

not  trying to get more favours for women. I only  hope

that   the  Minister  can,  more  or  less,  give  some

consideration  to  them. I am  not  requesting  him  to

reduce the working hours for women car park



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



attendants, but because of certain conditions  peculiar

to  women - judging from objective circumstances  -  he

should give some consideration to the fair sex.  It  is

not  a question of giving more favourable treatment  to

women,  or to assign them to covered car parks.  It  is

only  a  matter of administration, and I hope that  the

men,  the opposite sex, will not be too harsh  in  this

respect,  and  I think that all the Members  here  will

agree  with  us,  because usually  the  men  will  say,

"Ladies first!" This is really a very simple matter.  I

am not requesting a favour; I am making a request based

on human nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Parliamentary Secretary also mentioned

that  the recruitment of car park attendants should  go

through   P.S.C. selection.  Of  course,  I  was   not

suggesting that the P.S.C. should select men  or  women

for  certain  posts.  But  the  question  is  that,  in

inserting  advertisements in the Press, the  Department

concerned  could  stipulate  that  there  should  be  a

certain quota for women applicants or a certain  number

should  be  filled by men applicants. So this  actually

has nothing to do with the P.S.C., but it has something

to  do  with the Department which is going to  put  out

advertisements to recruit members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Members of

this  House should be grateful to the Member for  Delta

who, before the Government could take up the suggestion

of  having a Women's Research Institute on the problems

facing women, has done some research on her own. I, for

one,  have not been able to put myself in the  position

of the fair sex and think of the problems facing female

parking attendants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we all know, of course, Mr Speaker, that there

is  a  difference in the problems facing men and women;

for  instance,  men have got woman problem,  and  women

have  got  man  problem! So the only thing  that  I  am

wondering about is whether it would be appropriate  for

men  to  solve women's problems, or for women to  solve

men's  problems,  because, as  the  saying  goes  among

women, "The way to a man's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



heart is through his stomach." But we all know that all

gastronomic delights are best prepared by men!  In  the

same  way, women who are inclined to solve the problems

of  dressing in order, shall we say, to solve their man

problem have got to go to men dressmakers, too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards the problem of female

car-parking attendants, the problem that was posed  by  the

Member for Delta has never occurred to me, and that  is

the  difficulty  of female attendants  getting  certain

facilities in certain places where they are  posted.  I

am  sure  that my colleague, the Minister for  National

Development,  who is a great admirer and  respecter  of

the  female sex, will certainly look into this  problem

and  see that the appropriate facilities are there,  or

failing  that, that women will not be posted to  places

where there is a shortage of such facilities.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in regard

to the debate on male and female parking attendants,  I

have   known  from  my  own  experience  that  in  many

progressive  countries, women workers can compete  with

men  in  all  walks  of  life. This  shows  that  their

countries want to progress. If the women can adopt such

an  attitude, I am sure they can beat the men folk, and

that  the  men folk will not be able to beat the  women

folk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta should urge women parking

attendants  to  show greater efficiency to  their  male

counterparts. Only thus can they solve their problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

not  speaking  on behalf of women. But  it  seems  that

there is only one woman Member in this House now -  the

Member for Delta, The other woman Member is not present

now.  But I feel that the men in this House should  not

be too harsh to the Member for Delta. She has mentioned

the  facilities which should be given to female parking

attendants and their allocation of work. In this  House

there are only two women Parliamentarians



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



who  can  speak  on  behalf  of  women.  There  are  49

gentlemen here in this House speaking on behalf of  the

men  in Singapore. Since we have more spokesmen for the

men  in  Singapore,  of course, we  should  allow  more

latitude to the two spokesmen for the women. We  should

give more consideration to their speeches. I would also

urge   the  Minister  or  the  Parliamentary  Secretary

concerned not to quibble too much over their request.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

merely  want  to reply to what the Member  for  Kampong

Kapor  has said. Just now the Member for Kampong  Kapor

has  mentioned the principle of equality  for  men  and

women, and that the women should do an equal amount  of

work  to  show the men. I have said just now  that  the

female  car park attendants are no different  from  the

male parking attendants in so far as work is concerned.

They both work eight hours a day. What I was saying was

that  certain  facilities should  be  given  to  female

parking  attendants. That is to say, I am referring  to

the  welfare  of  the  female  parking  attendants.  In

certain  areas, the sites are not suitable  for  female

parking  attendants. Of course,  I  will  not  go  into

details about this. Otherwise people will accuse me  of

talking too much and it will not be becoming of  me  to

talk  in  great detail about this. It is not  really  a

question  of  equality of men and women, or  women  and

men.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that there is an increase in the estimates

for  1966 from $8,330 in 1965 to $51,470 for this vote.

This is a tremendous increase. There is a great need to

conserve Government funds for better utility.  Such  an

unusual  increase is unwarranted if there are no  major

or   new   development  projects  under   the   Primary

Production  Department which require overtime  work  to

cope  with the extra amount of work. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

this  House  would  be  happy  if  the  Minister  would

enlighten  us  on  whether or  not  it  would  be  more

practical  and justifiable to recruit new  workmen  and

labourers  instead  of  paying the  existing  employees

overtime allowances. This would give more employment to

a great number of unemployed in Singapore.

overtime  allowance. But, in fact, there is no increase

in  the  overtime allowance for 1966 as  compared  with

1965. In past years, overtime allowance was included in

the individual items of expenditure, such as labourers'

wages and allowances, daily-rated staff, watchmen, etc.

In  1966  the Budget section of the Ministry of Finance

decided that overtime allowances must be taken  out  of

the  individual items of expenditure and put  into  one

lump  sum  under one separate subhead, as a  result  of

which $51,470 was entered in the 1966 Estimates. I  can

assure the hon. Member that there has, in fact, been no

intention to increase the overtime allowances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1108 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2183.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have come to understand that the penghulus

receive  an  allowance of $50 a month  and  the  ketuas

receive  an  allowance of $35 a month. These allowances

given  to  the penghulus and the ketuas of the  islands

are, in my opinion, insufficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the penghulus and ketuas act as liaison officers

between  the Government departments and the  islanders.

As  far as I know, the work of the penghulus and ketuas

is  that  they  bring the islanders to  the  Government

offices   to  pay  house  assessments,  property   tax,

changing   and  applying  for  identity  cards,   birth

certificates, death certificates, and so on. A penghulu

from  Pulau Tekong, that is from my constituency, will,

for  example,  spend $2 as launch fare to Changi  Point

and  back.  Another $1.50 is spent  on  bus  fare  from

Changi Point to the City and back to Changi Point.  And

perhaps a few cups of tea or coffee and lunch will cost

him, say, about $1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the expenditure incurred by the penghulus

and  ketuas  in carrying out their official  duties  is

considerably high, I wonder how much the penghulus  and

ketuas  from the Southern Islands will have  to  spend.

Therefore, I would suggest that the allowances for  the

penghulus and ketuas be given considerable increment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my argument is that since the pro-Communist

Barisan Sosialis M.P.s can be paid a tax-free allowance

of  $500  each to fight our own people, I think  it  is

fair  that the penghulus and the ketuas who are working

for the interests of the people should be paid a little

bit more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Changi  has  raised the question of  allowance  to  the

penghulus and ketuas. In fact, the allowances given  to

the penghulus and ketuas are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



not  emoluments or monthly salaries as such, but rather

reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses for  transport

and   incidentals  which  a  ketua  or  penghulu   will

reasonably incur in discharging his duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is of the view that the present

allowances,  which were raised not very long  ago,  are

adequate  to  cover such out-of-pocket expenses.  If  a

ketua or penghulu can show that such allowances are not

adequate for this purpose, then his case can be put  up

for consideration.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, the point that I raised

was  a  point which I know from the penghulus  from  my

constituency. And as far as I can gather from the  hon.

Member  for the Southern Islands, the penghulus do  all

the  work and they do not have any extra earnings  from

the  islands.  Therefore, I am  urging  this  House  to

consider whether a considerable increment can be  given

to complement their allowances.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the answer given by the

Parliamentary Secretary was that this is not  a  salary

but  an out-of-pocket allowance. Is that the point  the

Parliamentary Secretary was making?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the vote for allowance

to  these  penghulus and ketuas was decided after  very

careful study of the monthly expenses incurred by  each

of  them  by  way of launch fares and other  incidental

expenses, like the cost of lunch in Singapore and  soft

drinks. The Government considers that the existing rate

of  allowance  is  fair  and  reasonable.  But,  as  my

Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, if either  the

penghulus  or the ketuas or the hon. Member for  Changi

can  somehow prove that these allowances are, in  fact,

very  inadequate, then I can assure them that  we  will

increase these allowances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It seems a fair answer. Is the Member

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Mr Sim

Boon Woo and Inche Mahmud Awang ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1108 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1108 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, is the Ministry aware that prompt

attention  is  not  being  given  to  applications  for

repairs  of houses, renovations, etc.? Complaints  have

been  k.i.v'd  for months. Considerable  time  is  also

taken  between the investigation of complaints and  the

time  repairs are made. After waiting for  months,  the

roof  leakages will be worse if they are  not  attended

to.  If  these defects are not rectified,  it  will  be

difficult  to  get  people  to  own  flats.  Here,  Mr

Speaker, it shows whether the defects were as a  result

of the construction by the contractors or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, another point regarding the Letting

Section.  Although there are legitimate  complaints  of

malpractices,  it is difficult to prove them.  What  is

feared    is    that   such   news   may   be    spread

indiscriminately. This Ministry should be in a position

to  control and take remedial measures in order that we

can get the confidence of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member

for  Kampong  Kapor  has raised  two  points.  Firstly,

regarding  the  contractors in the Housing  Board  and,

secondly,  regarding the malpractices  in  the  Letting

Section  of  the Housing Board. In reply to  the  first

point, I must say that if a tenant finds any defects in

the  flat, he should inform the respective officers  by

phone  or  by letter so that the Maintenance  Inspector

can go to the flat and check what are the defects. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



contractor would be instructed to repair this in two or

three  weeks' time. If nothing has been done, then  the

tenant  can  approach  the  Complaints  Bureau  in  the

Ministry of National Development and lodge a complaint,

and  action will be taken. I do not know what instances

the Member for Kampong Kapor is referring to. If he can

give me more details, I will look into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the second point, the Letting Section of

the  Housing Board. The present position is  this.  The

Letting Section handles 300 cases per day and sometimes

there  is considerable delay in the work and applicants

who  receive the letter late often complain. There must

be  something wrong somewhere. If the hon. Member knows

some  instances  where he suspects that  corruption  is

going  on,  he can give me the information.  Surely  my

Ministry   will   refer   it  to   the   C.P.I.B. for

investigation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as

requested by the Parliamentary Secretary, I am ready to

supply him with details, and if he really wants  me  to

make complaints now, I am quite prepared to do so.

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1109 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1109 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, due credit must be given to the Public Works

Department for having carried out the policies  of  the

Government faithfully in providing all the good  things

of life for our people, and, at the same time, they are

responsible  for  beautifying  our  city   to   attract

tourists.   Sir,  to  many  people  the  Public   Works

Department  is merely associated with the  construction

and maintenance of roads, bridges and drains. Little do

they realise the other varied and diverse



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



functions of this important department. In fact,  there

are  little government activities which do not  in  one

way  or  another  involve the Public Works  Department.

Some  of the important functions of the department  can

be summarised as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design, planning and construction of roads,

drainage schemes and bridges, extension of the  Airport

runway,  the  design,  planning  and  construction   of

sewerage  schemes such as the extension  of  Kim  Chuan

Road  Sewerage Disposal Works, extension  of  main  and

minor  sewers  to  bring  in more  areas  under  modern

sanitation, the new sewerage scheme for the  Toa  Payoh

satellite  town,  the  design and the  construction  of

Government  buildings, such as new Government  offices,

schools,  hospitals,  clinics,  post  offices,   police

stations, housing for Government employees, warehouses,

jetties,  fountains, etc., building  of  multi-storeyed

car  parks,  underground  car  park,  Airport  Terminal

Building, abbatoir, Ministry of Education Headquarters,

etc., etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the design, planning and construction of

new works and buildings mentioned above, the Department

is  responsible  for the maintenance of  public  roads,

bridges,   drains,   Government   buildings,   offices,

quarters, Civil Airport, street lights, sewerage works,

septic tanks, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the major works done by the Public Works

Department, which I think are worthy of mention,are

very big projects costing millions of dollars. Braddell

Road,   for  instance  -  the  construction   and   the

realignment  of  this  road into a dual-carriageway  is

completed  except for a short section for  a  foot-path

and  cycle  tracks. It costs approximately $2  million.

Bartley  Road,  Ayer  Rajah  Road,  West  Coast   Road,

Clementi Road Bridge, Dunman Road Bridge, Sungei Padang

Bridge,  Sungei Bang Kuang Bridge, Tanglin Halt Bridge.

Some  of the major drainage is also constructed by  the

Public  Works Department in conjunction with the  flood

alleviation  schemes;  Rochore Canal  lining  and  tide

gates. Opera Estate outlet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



drain, Geylang River concrete lining costing about $1�

million.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member have any questions to

Public Works Department. If he has got any question  to

ask  the Minister, he may do so. But, at the moment  he

is  still on a panegyric of the Department. That is not

the point and purpose of this time.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I will be a little brief on

this.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member had better be a

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> What I want to give credit for is

this; little has been announced to the public that such

work  has  been carried out by this Department,  and  I

simply want this to be recorded, Sir, but ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Have you any complaints against the

Public Works Department?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please get on with them then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, my complaint is a minor one.

In  my  constituency, I would say that for the last  10

months,  the filling up of the junction of Tanah  Merah

Kechil and Changi Road has not been done although I was

told by the Urban and Rural Services Committee that the

work  has  been  given to the Public Works  Department.

Nothing  has  been done so far, and therefore  I  would

like  the  Minister concerned to pay more attention  to

these projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the total sum to

be allocated for Head 1109 be reduced by $100." Mr Ho,

there is only one complaint. You may answer it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Changi has complained about Tanah Merah Kechil. In

fact,  an  engineer of my Ministry has already  looked

into the matter, and the estimates will be forwarded to

the U.R.S.C. for consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is that satisfactory?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Parliamentary  Secretary, how long  this  consideration

will last and when the work will start.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a fair question. When will the

work start, Mr Ho?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Changi  is a member of the U.R.S.C. So when the project

is approved, of course, tenders will be called and work

will be carried out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, this is not a matter of

the  U.R.S.C. The U.R.S.C. has given this work  to  the

P.W.D.,  and therefore the P.W.D. has to carry it  out.

This  is  not  a  matter of my being a  member  of  the

U.R.S.C.  This is a different matter - a  case  of  the

P.W.D. and the U.R.S.C. What I want to know  is,  when

will this work commence?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do I understand that the Committee has

approved the work?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There you are, Mr Ho. The Committee has

approved the work, it seems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> No, Mr Speaker, this is procedure

and  it will take some time. Once a project is approved

by the U.R.S.C. today, it does not mean that it will be

carried out tomorrow. It is impossible, you know.  When

a  project is approved, the usual procedure is to  hand

the  job  over  to  the  P.W.D. The  P.W.D. will  then

advertise in the newspapers and tenders will be called.

When  this procedure is completed, work will be carried

out.  So it is difficult for me to state here when this

work  will  be carried out, because a certain procedure

has to be followed.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Apparently the matter has been caught in

that  Punggol  Road, being a public  street,  has  been

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1111 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1111 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in the course of my

Meet-the-people's sessions, I have come across many requests

from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



my  constituents  who want to apply for  permission  to

reconstruct their existing houses and also to apply for

permits to retain their existing houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to deal with the second point first,

that  is:  application for permits to  retain  existing

houses. Such houses were built more than 10 years  ago,

and   today,  with  social  amenities  like  water  and

electricity supplies being available in many  parts  of

Punggol  constituency,  many  of  the  constituents  in

unnumbered houses have come to me to seek my assistance

to  get  for them permits for existing houses in  order

that  they  can obtain house numbers so that  they  can

apply for such facilities. Sir, the point is this.  The

application  forms are printed in the English  language

only,  and  I also notice that on the form  itself  the

applicant making such an application has no opportunity

to  state his date of application and that at the  back

of this form the applicant has to draw a sketch plan of

the site indicating where his existing house is and, at

the same time, draw a sketch plan of the house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the course of rendering such assistance, I

find  that  if I were to request the Minister concerned

to  see  to it that such forms are printed in the  four

official  languages, then I am sure that many of  these

applicants would be able to fill up the forms easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. The form being duly completed

will  be  submitted to the Chief Building Surveyor  who

will  look into the matter. Now I have come across such

applications which had to wait for more than two months

- I am not simply alleging this complaint, but it it is

necessary  I  am prepared to furnish such  particulars,

that   officials  of  the  Chief  Building   Surveyor's

Department sometimes take up to two months to  visit  a

site  and later on when a permit is approved and  a  $2

fee  is  paid,  even then a house number is  not  given

until one or two months later. So, all in all, it takes

three to four months, sometimes six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the application for permits to

reconstruct   existing  houses.  Sir,  in   the   rural

constituencies,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



many  such houses are made up of plank walls and  attap

roofs. Very often, when such applications are made, the

houses  are  in  a  very  poor  condition,  and   these

constituents need to get permission as soon as possible

to  go  ahead with reconstructing them. I would suggest

to  the Minister concerned to look into the possibility

of  establishing  a  small unit in the  Chief  Building

Surveyor's  Department purely to look  into  these  two

matters  and to help the poor people, not  only  in  my

constituency, but also in other rural constituencies as

well, by facilitating these applications, so that  they

can  get  what they have applied for within as short  a

period   of  time  as  possible  and  with  as   little

inconvenience  to  them as possible.  For  example,  in

order  to apply for permission to reconstruct a  house,

the  poor  chap  will have to go down to  the  Planning

Department to buy two site plans. Many of these  people

are  not  familiar with site plans and more often  than

not  they  buy the wrong ones because first, they  have

got  to go down to the Planning Department and tell the

officer  what they want and they are not able  to  read

and  understand the site plans well. So in view of what

I  have pointed out, I hope the Minister concerned will

kindly look into those two matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Punggol wants to know why requests from rural residents

or  farmers  to  reconstruct their existing  houses  or

retain  their existing house numbers are being  delayed

and  whether a small unit should be set up in the Chief

Building Surveyor's Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the problem of unauthorised houses in Singapore

has  been reduced ever since the end of World  War  II.

There are thousands of such unauthorised houses and the

Government has been realistic in not taking  action  to

put the residents occupying unauthorised houses out  of

them,  but  rather  to  permit  them  to  remain  there

temporarily. It has been considered dangerous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



if we were to regularise every unauthorised house, even

though  it has been in existence for a number of years,

for  the  simple reason that it will mean  putting  the

stamp of legality on something that is unauthorised. It

will  soon  be  accepted to mean that  the  people  can

construct   houses  without  bothering  to  apply   for

permission  and with the passage of time  these  houses

will  be authorised. Since the Government is not  in  a

position  to  throw out families living in unauthorised

houses,  each house will be authorised with the passage

of  time. The Chief Building Surveyor's Department  has

been  dealing with this problem for some time.  Efforts

have  been  made to contain the problem  within  limits

rather  than to provide a solution. Wherever  possible,

those  houses  that could comply with the building

by-laws  would  be regularised and the owners  could  then

obtain house numbers to enable them to get supplies  of

electricity  and water. For those houses which  are  so

irregular  as to be unable to comply with the  building

by-laws,  the Chief Building Surveyor cannot regularise

them  and  they will have to remain as they are  or  be

demolished. It will be difficult for the Government  to

regularise  such  unauthorised  and  newly  constructed

houses which go against certain building by-laws.  Now,

the  Chief  Building Surveyor's Department will  assist

the  farmers or rural residents to obtain the necessary

temporary building permits, and there is no need to set

up  a  special unit just to assist them. As in  Punggol

the   Primary   Production  Department   has   recently

completed  a  veterinary centre at  the  9th  milestone

Punggol  Road.  Perhaps  the officer  working  in  this

veterinary centre will be instructed to assist in  this

matter.
