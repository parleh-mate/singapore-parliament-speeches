<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC ASSISTANCE ALLOWANCES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Increase of rates and payment facilities)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Culture  and Social Affairs if the Government  will

consider  increasing the rates of Public Assistance

Allowances and if he will set up payment centres in

all  the  51 constituencies for the convenience  of

the   recipients  and  to  save  them  expense   on

transport  in  having to go to the  Social  Welfare

Department in Havelock Road.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

P.A.P. Government assumed office in June 1959,  the

rates  of public assistance allowance given to  the

head  of  household have been increased twice  from - $15 to $16 in September 1959, and again from $16 to

$21 in January 1962. The allowance for the wife was

also  increased from $8 to $10 per  month  as  from

September 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the existing rates of public assistance are

the  highest in this part of the world, it  is  not

considered prudent in the interests of our  economy

to make further increases which can only be done if

we raise more taxes, in 1966 a sum of $8,262,815.95

cents  was  paid to 22,241 families on  the  public

assistance scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present there are 41 public assistance payment

centres situated in all parts of the island,  apart

from  the  payment  centre at  the  Social  Welfare

Department at Havelock Road, in addition, there are

mobile  payment  teams that go to the  neighbouring

islands, hospitals, homes for the aged, and to  the

individual homes of those recipients who are unable

to  get  to  the  payment centres to receive  their

public   assistance  allowance.  As  these  payment

centres have been so located for the convenience of

the  recipients  with  a view  to  lessening  their

expense on transport



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



to  get  to  the centres, and they are adequate  to

serve  the  localities  where  they  are  situated,

Government  considers it unnecessary  to  establish

payment  centres  on  the  basis  of  division   of

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Thomson,

the   42   payment  centres  are  located   in   33

constituencies,   which  means  that   in   certain

constituencies  there  is  more  than  one  payment

centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Can the Minister

concerned  give  the House the different  rates  of

assistance  and the names of the constituencies  in

which the Social Welfare Department has established

payment centres?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inche Othman, even if you have the

information  now, it might perhaps be best  if  you

circulate it in the Official Report.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> I will answer the first part of

the  supplementary question, which is short. As for

the answer to the second part, I will circulate  it

in the Official Report*.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 1

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001+.



<hr size="2" noshade>

+  The  same amendment also stood in the  name  of  Mr. Lim Guan Hoo.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having gone through all the heads of

expenditure of the various Ministries in  the  1968

Estimates,  I  am  drawn to some curious  footnotes

that  appear on pages 153, 155, 156, 158,  159  and

161 which explain the posts of some of the officers

in  the  Ministry of Education who are drawing,  in

addition  to  a  salary,  certain  allowances.  For

example, a footnote appearing in page 153 states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(v) In certain cases, holders of these posts

draw  in  addition  pensionable allowances  of $120,

$180, $240, or $300 p.m.'.



<br><br>Sir,  I have been trying to find out whether other

Ministries   have   payments  of  these   so-called

pensionable  allowances. In fact, I believe  I  can

see  none.  I  suppose these so-called  pensionable

allowances are given to certain officers  who  have

been  promoted, say, from the post  of  teacher  to

principal,  or  lecturer, or school  inspector,  or

specialist teacher. If my supposition is correct, I

am  inclined  to believe that the payment  of  such

kind  of  allowances  is far from  satisfactory.  I

would like to know whose brainchild it was to grant

such  pensionable allowances, and how much  it  has

cost us each year when this system was instituted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, is the Minister for Education aware

that  the  other Ministries have no such system  of

pensionable allowances? To me, Sir, it would appear

that  any officer in the Ministry of Education  who

has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



promoted, be it to principal, inspector of  school,

specialist  teacher, inspector, or lecturer,  would

automatically  enjoy  such benefit  in  pensionable

allowances. However, I must stress that  I  am  not

against  these civil servants obtaining any  higher

pay  if  they  so  deserve as  a  result  of  being

promoted. Therefore, I would like to propose to the

Minister for Education that this kind of payment be

scrapped and in its place a proper salary structure

be  instituted so as to give not only uniformity in

the  salary  structure  but also  opportunities  to

aspirants  to  reach  the  very  top  rung  of  the

education ladder.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I agree with what the Member has said

on  the  amendment.  Not very  long  ago  when  the

Minister   for  Education  proposed   the   Nanyang

University  (Amendment) Bill, I  pointed  out  that

there was a loophole in it, namely, that there  was

only  provision  for  a Vice-Chancellor  without  a

Chancellor,  although the Chairman of the  Council,

as  stated  by the Minister, was in name compatible

with that of Chancellor. But actually the nature of

the  duties  of  the  Chairman  of  the  University

Council  was not suitable to make him a  Chancellor

of  Nanyang University, because the Chairman of the

Council shall be elected by the Council from  among

its  members  while  a Chancellor  is  usually  not

appointed  by election. The Minister did  not  take

proper  steps  to amend the law but allowed  it  to

remain  as  it  was.  Through his  toleration,  the

designations of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor and  the

Vice-Chancellor have been officially  announced  to

be   the  "Vice-Chancellor"  and  the  "Chancellor"

respectively  in  the text of Chinese  translation.

These   difficulties  arise   when   there   is   a

translation from English to Chinese and vice versa.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, you are speaking about a

body  set  up by statute, and you are referring  to

matters which are not within the responsibility  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



Minister. So that no matter how long you  speak  on

this, if the Minister stood up and said, "These are

not  matters within my responsibility," that  would

be  an  adequate reply. Can you please relate  your

remarks to his functions as Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, can the

Minister  pay  special attention  to  what  I  have

suggested  and whether he will consider introducing

amending legislation? Because of the technicalities

of  translation,  there is confusion  in  the  term

"Vice-Chancellor", and I hope the Minister will  do

something  about it, because the law was introduced

by  him and passed by this House. So I feel that he

must look into this problem. And even though it may

not  be within his direct jurisdiction, he has  the

responsibility to see it rectified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  as  a  graduate of Nanyang University,  I

think  I  have  the duty to speak a  few  words  on

behalf of my University. As everybody knows ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to clarify. If the Member  wants

to  argue on behalf of the Minister, I think it  is

quite all right. But if he wants to argue on behalf

of the University, I would like to ask whether that

is permissible under our Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, I have not yet heard what

Mr Ho is going to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  think  the  Member  for Bukit  Merah  is  rather

sensitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody knows that Nanyang University has

been in existence for 11 years now. There have also

been quite a number of graduation ceremonies - eight

altogether.  There  are  more  than  3,000  Nanyang

University  graduates,  some  of  whom  have   gone

abroad,  some  are already working,  and  some  are

serving   society.  Many  Nanyang  graduates   have

achieved distinction in higher institutions abroad.

There are also many eminent and successful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



Nanyang  graduates  serving in  various  Government

departments  and commercial and industrial  circles

in every walk of life and their achievements can be

seen by all to be quite meritorious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Government is giving equal treatment

to Nanyang graduates, when these graduates apply to

join Government service, the Government seems to be

hesitating   about  the  recognition   of   Nanyang

University degrees. The Government does not seem to

have taken any decision on this matter, although in

the past I have already said that this question  is

very pressing.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only hear the sound of Government promise

without  its  being actually put into practice.  If

this  problem is not solved, it will embarrass many

of  our Nanyang graduates who go abroad for further

studies.   The   reason  is   that   many   foreign

universities  have  recognised  Nanyang   graduates

because  they have achieved good academic  results.

Yet   our  own  country  is  not  giving  them  any

recognition. Sir, after the reorganisation, Nanyang

University has already been put on the right track.

It  is  now prospering and marching along the right

path. It holds out great promise for the future.  I

think  the  time  has now come  for  Government  to

recognise  Nanyang University degrees. I  hope  the

Minister will try his best to help so that  Nanyang

University  degrees  will be recognised  early  and

Nanyang University graduates will benefit from  it.

I  am  looking forward to this good news.  Can  the

Minister  tell  us when the Government  intends  to

help Nanyang University?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  the  pensionable   allowances

referred to by the Member for Punggol is, in  fact,

known  as  "post  allowances". The system  of  post

allowances  in  the  Education  service  was  first

introduced   in  October  1953  with  retrospective

effect to 1st January, 1950. It formed part of  the

overall salary revision which was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



approved   after  negotiations  between  the   then

Government  and  the trade union then  representing

the  teaching profession. The new salary scales and

the post allowances were written into the Education

service  scheme  forming part  of  the  Scheme  for

Higher   Services,   1953.   In   the   course   of

negotiations,  the Graduate Teachers'  Association,

which  has  since gone out of existence,  played  a

prominent  part. Under the scheme, post  allowances

ranging from $120 to $360 per month are attached to

certain  posts  such as lecturers in the  Teachers'

Training   College,  Inspectors  of   Schools   and

principals of primary and secondary schools.  These

allowances become pensionable emoluments as soon as

the   officers  concerned  are  emplaced   on   the

pensionable  establishment.  In  other  words,  for

pensionable   officers  these  allowances   attract

variable allowance in the same way as basic  salary

and   are  taken  into  account  for  purposes   of

computing pension and gratuity. This system of post

allowances,  I agree, has led to many anomalies  in

the  service, chief among them being the fact  that

principals of secondary schools draw a higher  rate

of   allowance  than  Inspectors  of  Schools  when

logically it should be the other way round. Because

of  different rates of allowances being attached to

different   posts  of  more  or   less   the   same

responsibility,  it  is not  possible  to  transfer

officers    of   comparable   qualifications    and

experience from one post to another in the interest

of  the service and of the officers themselves.  I,

therefore,  agree with the Member for Punggol  that

the  system of post allowances should be  abolished

in  favour of different salary scales for different

grades   of  officers  with  a  variety  of   Posts

requiring  the  same qualifications and  experience

within  each grade. My Ministry has, in fact,  made

representations   along   these   lines   to    the

appropriate  quarters  and  the  outcome  is  being

awaited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has raised the

question  of the Chinese translation of  the  terms

"Vice-Chancellor" and "Deputy Vice-Chancellor". Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the nominal head of a university  is

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



Chancellor whose functions are mainly statutory and

ceremonial. The administrative and academic head of

a  university is the Vice-Chancellor whose duty  it

is   to  conduct  the  day-to-day  affairs   of   a

university. In Chinese universities, however, there

is  no  post  corresponding to that of a Chancellor

and   in  Nanyang  University  there  is  also   no

provision for such a post. Consequently, the  Vice-Chancellor  of Nanyang University is designated  in

Chinese as "Head of the University", that is,  Seow

Chang,  and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor is known  in

Chinese as "Deputy Head of the University", Fu Seow

Chang,  which  in  fact describe  their  respective

functions accurately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite sympathise with the

Member  for  Jurong's concern over the question  of

recognition of Nanyang University degrees. In fact,

this  question has been receiving the attention  of

the  Government for quite a considerable  time.  At

the  last convocation ceremony held in May 1967,  I

did   make   a  statement  that  the  question   of

recognition would be resolved in about two or three

years'  time.  However, judging from  the  rare  of

progress  in  the University, both in the  academic

field  as  well as in University organisation,  and

also judging by the better qualified staff that are

being  recruited at the moment, I am quite prepared

to  say that the question of recognition of Nanyang

degrees  would be resolved by the next convocation,

much   earlier   than   what   I   had   originally

anticipated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been

given  a detailed explanation of a system that  was

instituted by the previous Government and which led

to  so  many anomalies in the salary scales of  the

teaching  profession. Schemes agreed to in  January

1953  had  retrospective  effect  to  January  1950

-three  years  and  it was known as  the  Singapore

Education  Service  Scheme. The Minister  has  just

explained  that  the Ministry is already  aware  of

such a defect in the salary structure and has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



written  to  some  quarters making  representations

with  a view to rectifying such anomalies. I  shall

be  grateful if he will name the quarters and  when

this was done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot be

held  responsible for what took place way  back  in

1953  or 1950. Anyway, for the information  of  the

Member  for  Punggol,  the  representation  of   my

Ministry was made to the Salaries Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> When will the report of the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for [-lead 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1219.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the provision of the

Estimates  for  1968  in  respect  of  teachers-in-training at the Teachers' Training College,  it  is

noted that 1,495 posts had been abolished. In  1967

provision  has  been  made for  4,082  teachers-in-training, whereas in 1968 Only 2,587 posts will  be

provided.  Can  the  Minister clarify  whether  the

abolition  of the 1,495 posts means that there  are

more  than sufficient teachers for all the  schools

in  our  Republic  and that the intake  of  student

teachers  to  undergo  training  at  the  Teachers'

Training  College  in 1968 will  be  less  by  that

number?



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, the decrease in

the   number   of  posts  for  teachers-in-training

reflects the increasingly rapid reversion to  full-time  training  in the Teachers' Training  College.

Unlike  part-time trainees, full-time trainees  are

not paid a salary and consequently no posts need be

entered in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



the  Estimates for them. That we are able to revert

to  full-time  training shows  that  the  part-time

system  of  training introduced in 1960 has,  to  a

large extent, overcome the teacher shortage. It  is

expected  that no more part-time trainees  need  be

recruited in the Chinese medium for primary schools

next year, and the same situation will apply to the

English  medium part-time trainees in the next  two

or  three years. It is confirmed that the reduction

of  1,495 posts of teachers-in-training means  that

the  intake of part-time trainees in the  Teachers'

Training College will be reduced by that number  in

1968.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> In view of the information

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1221.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the rise in the number of births in

Singapore  and with the increase in the  number  of

children  registered in schools, I do not  see  any

increase  in  this provision for  1968  as  against

1967.  Can  the Minister say why the provision  for

1968 is not increased?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, this subhead refers to

Teachers  of  Religion in Malay schools.  In  1968,

there  will  be  an  increase  of  27  Malay-medium

classes  in the secondary level, but a decrease  of 13  Malay-medium classes in the primary level.  The

net  increase is, therefore, only 14 classes. There

is  provision in 1968 for employing a total  of  41

religious teachers and this number is adequate  for

our needs.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): With that

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1431.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally known that with a few exceptions,

school  for school, student for student,  and  even

teacher for teacher, the aided schools seem  to  be

doing  better than the Government schools.  Why  is

this so? I have no doubt the Minister for Education

will  be  able to give good reasons for  this.  But

having  good  reasons  for  the  present  state  of

affairs  is one thing and finding means to  improve

the situation is another. It is to be noted that 25

per cent of our Budget, which is equivalent to $151

million, is to be expended on education. If we  are

to  get  equitable returns for this  large  sum  of

money  spent,  and more important,  if  we  are  to

ensure that our younger generation will grow up  to

be well-educated, well-trained and well-disciplined

citizens of the future, then we must see to it that

every  child in school is given good education  and

that  every teacher is of the right calibre and  is

playing  his expected role in our education system.

That  this  is  not  so  is seen  in  the  apparent

disparity  in  educational standards between  aided

schools and Government schools generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the factors responsible for this

unsatisfactory state of affairs is the  quality  of

teachers   taken  in  by  the  Teachers'   Training

College. At one time, due to the rapid increase  in

the  number  of schools and due to the shortage  of

suitably  qualified  personnel  to  be  trained  as

teachers, the Teachers' Training College had little

choice. The situation is now quite different.  With

the  large  number of Senior Cambridge  and  Middle

School  graduates coming into the employment market

every year, it is now possible to recruit teachers-in-training   who  are  not  only  well   qualified

academically  but  also capable  and  dedicated  in

moulding   the  children  to  become   useful   and

responsible  citizens. In this  respect,  Sir,  the

conduct  of teachers must first be re-examined.  It

is  not  my  intention  to criticise  the  teaching

profession  for  the members of which  I  have  the

highest regard, and indeed there are a good  number

of  teachers who are above reproach. The House will

no doubt agree that wearing tight



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



jeans  and  drain-pipe trousers and the keeping  of

long hair by teachers are not good examples for the

children.  These  and  other undesirable  forms  of

conduct  of some teachers during school  hours  are

frowned  upon  not  only by  parents  but  also  by

respected  and  dedicated  members  of  the   noble

profession. I therefore urge that such elements  be

seriously  looked into by the Minister. I  have  no

doubt that any measures taken by him will have  the

support  of  the parents and the teachers'  unions,

for  this  will  help to preserve the  dignity  and

respect of the profession.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, I agree with many

of the remarks made by the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> I

strongly agree.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I can assure him that every

possible step is being taken to improve the quality

of teachers. I think there are many reasons why the

performance of the aided schools is better compared

with  the Government schools. I do not think  there

will  be  enough  time in this House  to  dwell  in

detail  on the factors. But suffice it to say  that

aided schools, as a whole, have a more stable staff

as  the  teachers are not liable to be  transferred

from  school  to school and, in many respects,  the

teaching staff are more dedicated, if not for other

reasons, at least for their own survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Anson that the

standard of education in schools depends to a large

extent on the quality of the teachers and, in  this

respect,  various  steps have  been  taken  by  the

Ministry to ensure that the teachers recruited  are

of  a  high  quality and that those who  have  been

recruited  in the past will be brought  up  to  the

sane  level. For this, various kinds of  in-service

courses   are  being  organised  by  the  Teachers'

Training College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the appearance of teachers in schools, I

think the Member for Anson will recall that at  the

sitting  of  Parliament  in  September,  I  made  a

statement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



that  teachers should dress decorously rather  than

decoratively.   Subsequent  to  that,   I   had   a

discussion  with  all  the  teachers'   unions   in

Singapore.  I  am  glad to say  that  all  of  them

expressed  support. The Singapore Teachers'  Union,

in   fact,  have  circulated  some  rules  for  the

guidance  of  their members as to the way  teachers

should  dress and behave in schools. When  the  new

term  begins  in January, if the Member  for  Anson

will  go round and visit some of the schools, I  am

sure he will notice an appreciable difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2123.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation for free text-books and stationery

for pupils for 1968 is no different from the amount

for  1967. Many schools are unable to provide  free

text-books  to pupils who deserve them. In  Kampong

Kembangan Constituency, there are schools  where  a

number  of  students deserve to get free text-books

but,  unfortunately, they could not  be  given  and

their applications were refused. Therefore, I would

request the Minister to increase the allocation for

Kampong  Kembangan  in view of the  fact  that  the

parents there are in the low salary bracket and  in

order  that children who deserve to get free  text-books can continue their education in the schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the school enrolment will

increase  by  about  15,000  next  year   and   the

provision for the free text-book scheme is the same

for  1967. However, this does not necessarily  mean

that  fewer pupils will receive the loan  of  text-books.  This  is  because schools have  accumulated

large  stocks of books over the last few years  and

the   funds  provided  will  be  utilised  for  the

purchase  of  new books and for the replacement  of

old books which are worn out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions for the issue of textbooks on loan

to  students  are made in such a way as  to  enable

deserving  students to enjoy this  privilege  on  a

priority  basis.  Although the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan has mentioned several deserving pupils in

his   constituency  not  being  able   to   receive

assistance under this scheme, I can assure him that

if these pupils are really deserving of help, as he

has said, and if he can supply me with the details,

I  am  quite prepared to look into these few  cases

that he has in mind.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as he is aware, the financial resources of

the  State are limited, It is not possible  to  get

something  more  for  the  free  text-book   scheme

without affecting some other Ministry or some other

items of expenditure which are equally important.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): With that assurance

by the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw.

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item (3) of  subhead

2124.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the education policy of the

Government  of Singapore gives equal  treatment  to

all  four  streams  of education  - Malay,  Chinese,

Tamil   and  English.  The  Malay  schools  receive

Government assistance. Recently a Committee was set

up to collect funds for the building of a secondary

school.  Can  the  Minister say whether  a  similar

grant-in-aid will be given to the proposed  Islamic

Secondary School?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Islamic

Secondary  School  mentioned  by  the  Member   for

Kampong Kembangan has not yet been built, it is not

likely that it will come into existence in 1968. So

the  question of grant-in-aid for this school  does

not therefore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



affect the current Estimates. Consideration  for  a

grant-in-aid can only be given when the  school  is

established  and application for aid is  submitted.

There  are conditions to be met before aid  can  be

given. It is not possible at this juncture to  give

blanket  approval for a project which has  not  yet

materialised.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the educational measures that

have  been put into practice are more or less based

on  the  1959 educational policy. But we are  aware

that  certain  policies have not been carried  out,

one  of  which  relates to teacher training.  Every

year,  we  spend  quite a large  sum  of  money  on

teacher   training.  We  know  that  the  Teachers'

Training College, apart from providing training  in

teaching   methods,  has  not  provided  the   most

important kind of training, namely, the development

of  the  outlook of teachers. In view of  the  fact

that  Singapore  has  been independent  for  nearly

three  years  now, we would like  all  students  to

realise that this country belongs to them.  It  is,

therefore,  very  important that we  should  instil

national  consciousness in their minds. It  follows

that  the trainee teachers must also be imbued with

this  quality, otherwise the minds of their  pupils

will  not he instilled with national consciousness.

I  remember  that  not  long  ago  certain  Chinese

schools did quite well in this aspect of education,

and they instilled a feeling of patriotism in their

pupils. Of course, many schools are teaching civics

and other subjects pertaining to patriotism, but if

the  trainee  teachers themselves are not  properly

taught  in this respect, they will not cut  a  good

image  with their students. I would like  to  quote

from the booklet "The Tasks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



Ahead - P.A.P.'s Five-Year Plan 1959-1964" under the

chapter  of "Spring Source of Our Nation"  to  show

that  certain  policies or measures have  not  been

carried out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers must therefore realise the important

role   they  play  in  the  building  of  a  united

democratic Malayan nation. And they must learn that

their duties do not end with the imparting of text-book  knowledge.  They have a whole  generation  of

children  to mould into a national pattern.  To  do

this  successfully,  they themselves  must  acquire

those social values and convictions which they will

have to impart to the young. It is unlikely that we

shall  succeed in building a Malayan nation  unless

teachers   know   exactly  what  this   means   and

understand exactly what they have to do.'



<br><br>Therefore,  I  feel that now that  we  have  gained

independence, our young generation must  be  imbued

with  national  consciousness and the  persons  who

teach them are the teachers. But there is a lack of

such  training  for teachers. They themselves  have

not  realised the important task of education. They

treat  it as a means of livelihood and not as their

vocation  or  as part of their duties.  They  treat

their  work in the same routine manner as the civil

servants.  The  Teachers' Training  College  should

institute such training in the courses for teachers

in the coming year so that our young generation can

better absorb social values and convictions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect in the P.A.P.'s

educational policy which has not been carried  out,

namely, the main objective of training our students

to  become  useful citizens so that they can  adapt

themselves to our economic policies and the task of

nation  building. They will be the next  generation

who  will  lay down the foundations of a  socialist

society.  If our industrial capacity is weak,  this

is  because  of  the educational policy  under  the

colonial  regime which was very backward. In  order

to  expand  our industry and economy, we must  make

full  use  of our talents. A nation can exist  only

because  it  has  the capacity to produce  all  the

material  resources and goods to feed  its  people.

Singapore does not produce any natural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



resources  and, therefore, our productive  capacity

must  be  fully  geared to the utilisation  of  our

human  resources.  Our  educational  policy  should

place  emphasis on the training of people in  order

to  achieve  such  an  objective.  There  are  many

schools  in  various parts of the  island  and  all

children of school-going age are assured of a place

in school.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the P.A.P. came to power, the objective

was   not  to  produce  white-collar  workers.  Our

objective is to produce technicians. But up to date

there  is a lack of technical schools and technical

training for our pupils.

hope  that in our educational development  for  the

future, we must stress the importance of scientific

and  other technical institutions so as to  produce

all  the  technicians  and technological  personnel

required  and  to achieve a balance in  educational

development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will try to finish what I have

to say in two or three minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education, in implementing

equality  of treatment to all the four  streams  of

education  and  in  the  inculcation  of   national

consciousness in our next generation, has  achieved

much.  This  cannot be denied. But there  is  still

room for improvement. For instance, the Member  for

Anson has mentioned just now that our aided schools

have  achieved a better performance than Government

schools. Why is this so? Why does the Minister  for

Education send those selected by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



P.S.C. to Chinese schools and they are regarded not

as  Government  servants,  whereas  those  who  are

selected  by  the P.S.C, and sent to other  schools

are   regarded  as  Government  servants?  Can  the

Minister  give  me a satisfactory reply?  Also  why

does the Ministry not allow other aided schools  to

be  developed  into  Government schools?  Generally

speaking,  our  aided schools can  do  better  than

Government schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point is that in certain integrated

schools,  some of which are having three  languages

and some two languages, the principals sent to them

normally can speak only one language. For instance,

in   an  integrated  school  where  there  are  two

languages, English and Chinese, the principal  sent

to  this  school is conversant only in English,  or

conversant  only in Chinese. Thus, the  results  of

such an appointment will not be very good.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree that

the  introduction  of political study  courses  for

trainee  teachers is important. In fact,  this  has

been  done  for  the last two or three  years.  All

teachers-in-training in the T.T.C. attend a 30-hour

course  on  civics  and government,  and  full-time

students  attend  a  90-hour  course  on  political

studies.  These courses have recently been  revised

with  the  aim of focusing attention on Singapore's

current  political, social, economic  and  cultural

problems.  Similar courses will also  be  conducted

for principals of schools and trained teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our view that good teachers will be better

teachers  if  they fully under, stand the  problems

confronting Singapore in the context of a  changing

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question of technical and vocational

education, the shortage is not at the school  level

but  at  the craft training level. There are enough

technical   and  vocational  schools  in  Singapore

today,   but   there  are  not  enough   vocational

institutes to provide craft courses for  those  who

are  leaving these schools. And as the Member  will

be  able  to  see in the Estimates,  we  have  made

provision  for four new vocational institutes  next

year. And it is hoped that when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



these  four institutes are eventually completed  in

1969 or 1970, the shortage will be resolved.

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for some time now a storm has

been brewing in the rather sedate atmosphere of the

medical and pharmaceutical world. Dark and thundery

clouds have threatened to blacken this shining  and

friendly  skyline and claps of rumbling  discontent

have echoed occasionally through the columns of our

daily newspaper. I see that my colleague, the  hon.

Member  for Tampines, has been exposed to  some  of

these  outbursts  and  has, with  great  dexterity,

managed  to dodge the scathing and sarcastic  bolts

from  the  pestle and mortar of the  pharmaceutical

colleagues.   This  eternal  and   purely   locally

peculiar dispute of our qualified pharmacists is in

many  ways understandable as being suitably trained

in  the  art  of  pharmacy. They feel  they  should

inherit  the useful and sometimes mystifying  world

of  drugs and dispensing. I, as a medical  man,  do

not  begrudge  them their rights  of  dealing  with

drugs. I am rather sad to see so much encouragement

has  been  given to the idea of producing  as  many

pharmacists as possible from our University without

one iota of thought being given to the consequences

if   the  markets  for  qualified  pharmacists   in

Singapore should become saturated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, judging from this dispute, I

feel our small island has probably reached this

saturation point so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



our qualified pharmacists are now feeling the pinch

of  not  being able to find enough jobs to  justify

their  position  in our society.  Something  should

therefore  be  done to absorb this surplus,  and  I

feel  the Ministry of Health should be able  to  do

this.  I note that only 35 pharmacists are  in  the

employment of the Ministry. This surely is  a  very

small number in the health service which covers the

whole  of  our island. Is it not possible  for  the

Minister  for  Health  to consider  increasing  the

number of pharmacists employed and thus reduce  the

tension  of  anxiety  and  frustration  among   the

graduates in pharmacy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I myself

have noted with concern the unnecessary exchange of

views  expressed by doctors and pharmacists  during

the last few months when I had already appointed  a

committee  to  investigate into this problem.  This

committee  has already been in session since  April

of  this  year  and it has had more  than  a  dozen

meetings.  I  believe  it is already  at  the  last

stages  of drawing up a report. It will, therefore,

be invidious on my part to try to attempt to answer

the questions posed by the Member for Joo Chiat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first say that in establishing the

committee,  I  had  taken the  precaution  to  have

adequate representation from the doctors. There are

three  representations from the medical profession,

three  from  the pharmaceutical profession,  and  I

tried  to balance the two forces with another three

who  are complete outsiders and who had nothing  to

do  either with medicine or with pharmacy.  One  of

them  is  the Deputy Chairman of the Public Service

Commission.  And  I also had two other  individuals

one  of  whom  is  the Director  of  the  Singapore

Institute  of Management, so that the  question  of

costs  would  be  very much in  the  minds  of  the

members  of the committee, and, thirdly,  a  female

member  of  the  Bar to introduce a little  of  the

female element into the discussion.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> So that there will be a rational

approach to the problem!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I should think so, Mr

Speaker. Because it is essentially a male committee

and   so   there  should  always  be  some   female

representation. I will, however, try to take up two

points raised by the Member for Joo Chiat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has mentioned that the University of Singapore

appears  to be producing more graduates in pharmacy

than there are jobs available for them. It was with

this  in mind that the fourth term of reference  of

the committee was as follows. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'From the available facts and having: regard to

the  recommendations made on the above [that is  to

say,  the  other three terms of reference for  this

committee on the pharmaceutical profession and  the

dispensing   of   medicine],   to   estimate    the

requirements   for   qualified   pharmacists    for

Singapore  for, say, the next five years from  1968

to 1972.'



<br><br>So  it  will come within the terms of reference  of

this  committee who, I think, would be in the  best

position  to assess, first, the number of graduates

already in Singapore, and how many of them may  not

be  able  to find employment easily, and  therefore

what  we  should do for the foreseeable five  years

ahead. So I hope the Member for Joo Chiat will be a

wee  bit  patient as I anticipate that  the  report

will be ready perhaps within a month or so when  it

will be published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that Government should try to

employ  more  than  35  pharmacists  - we,  the  big

employer, the model employer, how about giving more

jobs  to  pharmacists - I think one has  got  to  be

careful there. No graduate of our University should

feel  that  once  he graduates and qualifies,  then

automatically   there  is  a   job   available   in

Government service. I think that would  be  a  very

dangerous  assumption.  I  believe  the  Government

should   employ   a  percentage  of   each   year's

graduates,  but  surely not in order  to  meet  the

unemployment   situation.  I  do  hope   that   the

committee  would  recommend that  Government  would

employ more qualified pharmacists than has been the

case  previously.  But, Sir, I hate  to  anticipate

what  the  committee's findings will be,  and  here

again  I  would  prefer to wait and  see  what  the

report is like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



and Government will then be in a position to

express views on the committee's report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health under

the  dynamic leadership of the present Minister has

made  such  dramatic  improvements  in  our  health

services that our island Republic is now reputed to

be  the  cleanest city in this region. One  of  his

many  achievements,  which  has  gained  world-wide

recognition,   is  the  reduction   of   our   baby

population.   But   another   equally   significant

achievement of comparable standard is his reduction

of  the fly and mosquito population. To attempt  to

enumerate all his outstanding achievements would be

superfluous, but I am sure the Minister  will  have

no doubt about my sincerity -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>

achievements in the past four years ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Govindaswamy, you have

got  five minutes to make your point under "Medical

Officer-in-Charge, Outpatient Services". Mosquitoes

come under the next head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am coming

to  that  line. We hold the Minister in the highest

esteem. Sir, I wish to bring the attention of  this

House to one defect in our health services. I  hope

the  Minister will, in addition to the usual  reply

that "the matter is receiving attention", also take

effective measures to remedy this defect.  Sometime

back   the   Minister  very  capably   solved   the

intolerable  over-crowding at the General  Hospital

Outpatient   Department  by  setting  up   numerous

outdoor dispensaries all over the island. Then,  as

suddenly  as this growth in the outpatient services

began ---



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> On a point of

information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, are you prepared

to give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I have an amendment here and

guillotine time is approaching.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All I can say is that there will be

other  occasions when Mr Govindaswamy comes  after

Mr   Lingam.  You  can  show  him  then  the  same

consideration that he shows you now, Mr Lingam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Only a few minutes, Mr

Speaker, Sir,I will finish up. This again  brought

improvement  in  the  service.  But  now  with  the

increase  in  the population, with the increase  in

demand   for  medical  services,  long  queues   at

Government outdoor dispensaries are now  a  regular

feature  again. Is the Minister still consolidating

his  dispensaries, or is he now ready to embark  on

another  expansion  programme, which  seems  to  be

already  overdue.  I  hope  he  will  examine   his

attendance  figures at the outpatient  dispensaries

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



either   increase  the  staff  or   set   up   more

dispensaries to relieve the poor sick patients.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think  it  is really time for a great expansion  of

the medical services. I think it is still necessary

to  consolidate. But whatever it is, we did make an

attempt to increase our staff. We asked for another

46  doctors for next year, of whom 18 would be  for

the  outpatient services. But I am sad to say  that

the  Ministry  of Finance threw the whole  proposal

out.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The  same amendment also stood in the  name  of Madam Chan Choy Siong.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns the work of Senior Public Health

Inspectors.  There are really two  points  which  I

would  like to raise. The first one is that  it  is

known  that  over  the  past year  the  density  of

mosquitoes in Singapore has risen tremendously.  It

is  also  known  that, based upon a  recent  survey

conducted  by  some  officers of  the  Ministry  of

Health,  about 51 per cent of the septic  tanks  of

the  housing  estates  in  Singapore  are  breeding

grounds for mosquitoes. I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



like  to know what the Minister is able to  say  on

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that huge colonies of rats

have  made the Kandang Kerbau Market their habitat.

Is  it possible for the Public Health Inspectors to

do something about this?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree that

the  mosquito density in Singapore has been on  the

increase.  This has been so not only  recently  but

over   a   period  of  time.  There   are   various

explanations  for  this  unfortunate  situation.  I

think it can be said that while Singapore has  been

fortunate in that, although we are situated  within

a  malarial  region that extends  for  hundreds  of

miles  around  us,  Singapore  is  supposed  to  be

malaria  free.  We have been able  to  conquer  the

malarial  scourge although we are in the  heart  of

this  area.  We  do  occasionally  have  cases   of

malaria, about 100 to 200 cases per year, when they

get  hospitalised. But these are generally imported

cases.  They got the infection somewhere else,  and

then when they come here they have the fever. It is

diagnosed as malaria and then they are treated. But

all    this   while   the   department   has   been

concentrating  on  what is known  as  anti-malarial

work, leaving aside the other mosquitoes which  can

be  just as troublesome, just calling them nuisance

mosquitoes. This problem has been deteriorating for

some  time  for various reasons, partly because  of

the  rapid  development of Singapore  with  housing

estates  where trees have been lopped off  and  the

drainage is bad. In fact, in Singapore all that  is

needed is just a wee bit of water to be left for  a

week,  and  it is possible to breed mosquitoes.  We

have  a situation where the drainage is bad. It  is

applicable  almost everywhere in  Singapore.  There

has   also  been  a  deterioration  in  the  Public

Cleansing  Services. The situation is  worsened  by

thousands of unlicensed hawkers, and sometimes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



even  licensed  hawkers, throwing refuse  into  the

drains and clogging them up. We have, therefore,  a

problem which we have inherited with the passage of

time,  so  much so that it will, I am afraid,  take

quite some time before we are in a position to  say

that  Singapore will be mosquito-free.  An  attempt

has   been  made  to  improve  the  public   health

situation in various parts of Singapore. We are  at

present concentrating on the city area. I am afraid

that,  unless the nuisance is very bad in the rural

areas,  the concentration for the present  and  the

near future would be in the city, and then later on

it will be extended to the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes the question of septic tanks. This,

unfortunately, does not come within the province of

the   Ministry  of  Health.  It  comes  within  the

Ministry of National Development under sewerage. We

have  taken up the matter with them and  the  reply

given is that they will play their part by spraying

anti-malarial oil on to these septic tanks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rat colonies, I think this is really

an index of refuse in the particular place. I think

there  are  colonies of rats even in  the  best  of

cities.  However,  I do not wish to  belittle  this

public health problem of what the Member for  Bukit

Panjang  says,  "rat  colonies  in  Kandang  Kerbau

Market".  There  are rat colonies in  almost  every

market. However, in view of his complaints, I shall

get  my  department to try to do something more  in

Kandang  Kerbau  Market  to  exterminate  the   rat

colonies  as fast as we can and, at the same  time,

this  problem if it is found to be of such a nature

as to warrant further attacks in other markets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, I am more than

satisfied  with the answer given by  the  Minister.

May I beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of

Madam Chan Choy Siong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1125.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, Amendment No. (2) .



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1281.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a quarantine station here and all deck

and  other  passengers who are suspected of  having

epidemic diseases are detained here. But I am  told

that  the  conditions of the station are  not  very

good.  It seems that the inmates face threats  from

insects  like  centipedes, etc.  Moreover,  I  have

heard  complaints about the pots and utensils given

to  the inmates for cooking facilities during their

stay  in the station. If these complaints are true,

I  am  sure the Minister will take steps to  remedy

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to submit for the

Minister's  consideration is this. Is  it  possible

not  to  detain  deck passengers  unless  they  are

suspected  of having diseases? Sir, all  passengers

from foreign countries who come by boat or aircraft

should  have their health certificates. This  being

so, I can see no reason why they should be isolated

for  three days. I do not know whether the Minister

is  aware that certain deck passengers who come  to

Singapore disembark at Penang, because there is  no

quarantine  in Penang, and these passengers  arrive

in  Singapore even before the saloon passengers  of

the  same ship disembark at Singapore. Sir, if  the

intention  of  detaining  deck  passengers  is   to

prevent  diseases from spreading,  I  think  it  is

being  defeated  for  the  reasons  I  have  stated

earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, can the Minister consider

abolishing   the  quarantine  detention   of   deck

passengers  who  are not suspected  of  having  any

epidemic   diseases?  This  will  save  them   from

undergoing unnecessary difficulties and expenses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member for Aljunied has raised three points on  the

question  of quarantine. Our quarantine station  is

situated  at  St. John's Island, which  is  a  very

beautiful  island indeed. I do agree that sometimes

conditions may not be as good as one would want and

there  could  be room for improvement.  The  Member

says   that  the  inmates,  when  placed   in   the

quarantine station, would be subject to threats  of

insects like centipedes. I think even we, who  live

on  the  fair island of Singapore, are  subject  to

this.   It  could  happen.  There  are  centipedes,

lizards, and so on occasionally, but I have not had

any  reports  to  this effect. If there  have  been

reports,  I would expect that the matter  has  been

looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I consider as a question which needs a

fuller answer is the Member's suggestion that  deck

passengers,    when   they   come    with    health

certificates,  should be exempted from  quarantine.

This  is what exactly health certificates are meant

for.  When people travel from country A to  country

B,  they  should be in possession of  valid  health

certificates. But I am afraid that there have  been

occasions when such certificates have been  forged.

In  those circumstances, it is not possible for the

Ministry  of  Health  to relax regulations  because

Singapore  is  situated among  countries  that  are

habitually  endemic  with very  serious  infectious

diseases.  We cannot accept a situation where  just

allowing  one  case to slip through with  a  forged

certificate, as happened in 1949, would have caused

a spread of small-pox which would then endanger not

just  the health but the lives of thousands of  our

people.  Let me give an example, Sir, of  the  real

threat which Singapore faces daily. I refer to  our

Government   Gazette   which  regularly   publishes

statements  of quarantine notifications of  serious

infectious   diseases   which   are   current    in

neighbouring   countries.   I   am   referring   to

Notification  3626 of our Government Gazette  which

gives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



a statement of quarantine notifications in force on

the 8th December, 1967. They are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can possibly take chances when

we  are right in the heart of all these areas  that

have  these  infectious diseases which are  endemic

and as long as we have a situation where it is very

easy  just to get medical certificates for a  small

fee.  May I, Sir, refer to the publication produced

by  the  Regional  Office for the  Western  Pacific

region  of  the  World Health Organisation  of  the

first  regional seminar on international quarantine

which  was held at Manila early in April this year.

Just  to quote two very important paragraphs.  Page

18   of   the   Report,  paragraph  11   (2.2)   on

vaccination:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Vaccination against small-pox is a reliable

quarantine measure for the prevention of small-pox.

It   is   regrettable   that   forged   vaccination

certificates are still occasionally discovered. The

co-operation of all governments in controlling  the

issue of international vaccination certificates  is

very necessary.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important paragraph, page 24, paragraph

17 (5). I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'After 15 years of application, some of the

provisions    of    the   international    sanitary

regulations have been found by some governments  to

be   inadequate  for  protection   of   their   own

territories.   In   the  light  of   the   changing

epidemiological situation, traffic development  and

scientific advances, there is a need for  a  review

of the regulations and revision if required.'



<br><br>Sir,  if  Singapore has been free  for  years  from

small-pox, cholera, plague, etc., it is because  we

have taken very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



stringent regulations against incoming visitors.  I

think it is necessary to maintain this for our  own

sake.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1601.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Republic of Singapore, sanitation in

the rural areas on the whole is excellent. However,

there are defects which can be found and need to be

improved  in  the  administration  of  the   Public

Cleansing  Department. Workers in  this  department

work to rule in specified areas without giving  due

attention to the rubbish which cannot be cleared on

that  particular  day. This will  be  a  source  of

danger to public health. I have come across rubbish

dumps  which stench. It is more so if it is on  the

evening  of  a Saturday. And then if  Monday  is  a

public  holiday, the situation is aggravated.  Such

rubbish  dumps  are heaped up and  they  block  the

roads. This causes a traffic jam in that particular

street.  This has happened in Changi Road  opposite

Changi  Market,  and  at  Geylang  Serai  near  the

Geylang  Serai Market. This goes to prove that  the

Public  Cleansing  Department  cannot  control  its

workers.  This  will endanger  the  health  of  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had occasion to complain to the health

officers  at  Katong  over  the  telephone  and  my

complaints have been accepted in good faith. But  I

regret  to  say that only for a certain  period  of

time  were  the health standards maintained.  After

that, the former bad state of affairs continued.  I

believe that so long as the administration  of  the

department  is  not  reorganised,  this  state   of

affairs will continue in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to say is that in Geylang

Serai  there  are  many  drains  which  have   been

neglected. One or two drains may have been  cleaned

by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



workers,  say, once in four months or once  in  six

months.  As Geylang Serai is a low-lying  area,  if

the  drains are not cleaned, the water will  remain

stagnant  and  this  will be a breeding-ground  for

mosquitoes.  I  believe the problem  of  mosquitoes

cannot  be  controlled until and unless the  drains

are  flushed. I hope the Minister for  Health  will

consider  this  matter so that the  health  of  the

public can be looked after.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with

the Member for Geylang Serai that the public health

conditions in Geylang Serai are not as good  as  we

would  want them to be. But there are a  number  of

historical factors, some of which have already been

mentioned  by the Member himself when he said  that

Geylang  Serai is a low-lying area. If it  is  low-lying,  therefore, deep drainage is difficult,  and

drainage  comes within the jurisdiction of  another

Ministry.  But  somehow or  other  we  seem  to  be

saddled  with  all  the  complaints  which  we  try

painfully to carry on our shoulders. If an area  is

low-lying  and  waste water cannot  flow,  then  it

becomes  stagnant water, and within a  week  it  is

very  easy  for  a mosquito to lay eggs  and  there

would  be larvae and then mosquitoes. So the  basic

problem is how to drain an area well. I think it is

going  to take a lot of effort on the part  of  the

Ministry  of National Development to try  to  drain

all  our  low-lying areas well so that  water  will

flow readily, easily and, therefore, there will  be

less breeding-places for mosquitoes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Member for Geylang Serai will

appreciate that most of the drains in Geylang Serai

are not concrete drains which are found in most  of

the  built-up areas, but they are earth drains.  In

other words, a few feet of earth have been dug away

and  water is allowed to flow in, which means  that

if there is a bit of rain or when there is a bit of

flooding, the sides of the earth drain go into  the

drain   itself  and  therefore  greater  stagnation

results.  These  are problems of engineering.  They

need  more than just putting anti-malarial oil into

the drains to prevent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



mosquitoes  from  laying  their  eggs  and   larva-hatching. These are serious problems and I think my

colleague,  the  Minister  for  Law  and   National

Development,  and his Ministry have indicated  that

it  will  take some time before they can deal  with

this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards public cleansing for which I assume

full  responsibility, I myself have visited Geylang

Serai  Market as announced three weeks ago. I  must

say  that  I  am very dissatisfied with the  public

health   conditions   of  this   market   and   its

surroundings. But whatever it is, I think it  is  a

great  improvement on what it was some months  ago,

before  the overhead bridge was built across Changi

Road at the junction of Changi Road/Joo Chiat Road,

when it was necessary to resettle a large number of

hawkers  who  had congregated around this  junction

and outside not only Geylang Serai Market, but also

Joo  Chiat  and Changi Markets. I think  there  has

been  a great improvement. Thanks to the assistance

of  the Member for Geylang Serai and the Member for

Joo  Chiat, an attempt has been made to bring order

out of chaos at this junction. Things have improved

considerably but it must be admitted that there  is

still a lot more to be done. When I visited Geylang

Serai  Market,  which  was  built  at  a  cost   of

$400,000, I saw refuse all around the market, and a

lot of refuse on its roof thrown down by tenants of

multi-storeyed flats.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a ridiculous state of affairs - people

living in flats just throwing rubbish outside their

backyards on to the roof of a Government market. It

has  been cleaned before. So we are dealing with  a

situation where the public are responsible for  the

refuse  and  not playing their part  by  having  it

placed  in chutes specially meant for the  disposal

of  refuse. When we have a situation like  this,  I

think it will take some time to educate the public.

Of  course,  I  have  to get  more  work  and  more

efficiency out of my work force. They will play



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



their  part.  If ever the Member for Geylang  Serai

has  a complaint to make - and he should make it not

by  just  ringing up the Health Officer for Katong,

which  he has done, but by letting me know - I  will

see  that  he is relatively satisfied, as I  cannot

promise him that Geylang Serai will be very  clean,

but it will certainly be much cleaner than what  it

is  today. He did indicate that there is a  lot  of

refuse  on  Saturday evening, that it is  worse  on

Sunday,  and still worse on Monday if Monday  is  a

holiday. We have stopped the overtime racket of the

Public Cleansing Department early this year. It  is

because  we  wanted to break the  racket  that  the

workers  were  misled  into a  strike.  Now  having

broken  it,  I  think it will be  very  foolish  to

revert  back to Sunday and public holiday  work  at

double and triple pay. I do not think this will  be

re-introduced so long as our work force is able  to

perform its functions thoroughly during week  days.

But  it  is  the policy of the Cleansing Department

that  if  there  is  a public holiday  following  a

Sunday, work will be done on the public holiday. In

other  words, there will be no refuse  lying  about

uncollected for 48 hours. But we do want to  instil

into our work force the fact that they will work on

Saturdays, that there is no work on Sundays  unless

it is really very, very necessary and that if there

is a holiday on a Monday, they are expected to work

on  that day. So the situation of refuse left lying

about for 48 hours will never arise.





<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  explain that the earth drains are  choked

and  full  of  rubbish and brush. If  they  can  be

cleaned,  at least the filth in the drains  can  be

reduced somewhat.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yong, do you wish to say

anything  in reply to that? I think it was  nothing

more than in the nature of a suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think the Member for Geylang

Serai indicated grass in drains. Exactly, sometimes

the grass on the sides is cut and chucked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



into  the  drains. When grass is cut, it should  be

taken away. This adds to the rubbish that goes into

the  drains. Everything is thrown into  the  drains - tins,  bottles, grass and boxes. So if the  public

are  so  irresponsible as to keep on  piling  these

things,  there  is  a  limit  to  what  our  public

cleansing workers can get rid of. So I do not think

the  blame  should be put on just our workers.  The

blame  must be put on the irresponsible members  of

the public whom we have to educate, and perhaps  in

time  if  persuasion fails, I will have to ask  for

powers to fine them.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1741.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, various Members have spoken at length on

mosquito larvae, rubbish thrown into drains  and  a

lot  of  other complaints. The Minister has pointed

out  to  us the difficulties faced by his Ministry.

This  is  not only a problem that has to be tackled

by  his staff but it is also a matter that concerns

the  attitude  of  the public. In this  respect,  I

would  like to make a suggestion. Since  the  fault

does  not  lie with the actions of just one  person

alone,  and it is not the responsibility of anyone,

I  would  like to see a campaign conducted  by  the

Ministry  of  Health  - a  campaign  against  filth,

pests,  mosquitoes and the throwing of rubbish  - in

conjunction  with other relevant organisations.  In

other  words,  there  should be  something  like  a

tripartite organisation to conduct this campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said some time ago that there was a plan under way to launch a public campaign to promote cleanliness, and so on, but so far this has not materialised. I hope he will launch it to clean up our city.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am grateful to the Member

for  Delta for suggesting this anti-movement, anti-this,   anti-that,  and  so  on.  We  have   health

education  in  the  Ministry  of  Health.   We   do

understand   and  appreciate  that  education   and

persuasion are important. I have been in charge  of

the  Ministry of Education for one term of 4� years

and  I  know that education takes time - not  just  a

matter  of months. Human cussedness being  what  it

is, it may perhaps take years before people can  be

trained to do the things we want them to do. It  is

not  just  that  because we have  a  movement  that

within  three  or six months, there  will  be  less

mosquitoes. It will have to take a longer period of

time - years - before the results can be seen. So  we

have not lost sight of the importance of education.

It  is  being  done,  sometimes  very  quietly  and

without  fanfare. This has not been a section  that

has   been  sleeping.  I  think  it  has   done   a

considerable  amount of work - public cleansing  for

what  it is worth over radio and on TV, and in  the

newspapers.  Anti-malarial work is being  done  not

throughout  the whole of Singapore but  in  various

constituencies, like Geylang West,  Tanjong  Pagar,

Anson, Telok Ayer and now Hong Lim. We are tackling

the  problem of public health in toto, not only the

licensing   of  thousands  of  hawkers   in   these

constituencies   but   also   the   clearance    of

unauthorised structures over drains used by hawkers

and  also  by members of the public, the unslabbing

of  drains, drains which have been covered up  over

the  last five or ten years to look pretty in order

to  allow hawkers to carry on with their trade, but

which   increase  the  problems  of  public  health

because underneath, these slabbed drains are choked

with  refuse. Water cannot flow through  them.  All

this  is not done in just a matter of months.  This

is  a  legacy of years of neglect and it will  take

years of determined action not by just the Ministry

of Health but by even the Ministry of Education. We

are  now  instilling into our young in schools  the

way to behave and how not to litter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



playgrounds and class-rooms. Education  in  schools

and   over   radio  and  on  T.V. is   going   on

continuously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will try to have this anti-movement, but I

think it does little to catch the public eye. It is

more important that we do good work consistently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The

Minister  for Health has said that he is  paying  a

lot  of  attention to matters pertaining to  health

but that much of it depends on the co-operation  of

the  public.  This is correct. This year,  the  sum

allocated  to  the  Ministry  of  Health  is  quite

substantial. I think more pasars should be built on

a  large  scale  to  concentrate  all  the  hawkers

together,  otherwise we will arrest them.  We  will

first  give them a warning; we will fine  them  the

second time; and we will cancel their licences  the

third  time. It is only by going about  this  in  a

strict  way  that  we can make  a  success  of  our

administration.  But we cannot arrest  them  before

the  setting  up  of large markets  to  accommodate

them, because they have also the responsibility  of

looking after ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, if you are going to speak

much  longer on hawkers, your remarks may  be  more

appropriate  under subhead 1831 which is  the  next

amendment, although I appreciate you may have fears

that we may not reach the amendment because we  are

getting very close to 4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you for that, but allow me to speak a little

while longer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also said that health education is going on in the schools and elsewhere. We should educate the pupils to pay more attention to health matters. Campaigns should be carried out in the streets during their vacation terms. Health teams should go round the schools and streets to persuade

people  to abide by the health code and the correct

code of conduct, and so on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



Even a Minister should pick up any rubbish that  he

finds on the floor. I will also pick up any rubbish

that  I find on the floor. If everybody does  this,

then  we  will have a clean country.  But  we  must

first  start  with  the  hawkers.  First,  we  must

resolve  their problems of livelihood and  then  we

can  take  strict  measures against  them  for  any

infringement  of the health code. So  the  Minister

should  set up more markets for them - the more  the

merrier - in order to accommodate all of them. A lot

of  money  has  been allotted to  the  Ministry  of

Health.  So  I hope the Ministry of Health  can  do

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people want to build markets and they want

the Government to fork out the money to build them,

may I ask them, how many vacant stalls are there in

the  existing  markets'? You will be  astounded  to

know  that  in some markets three-quarters  of  the

stalls are vacant. So what is the point of building

more  markets  when you cannot  even  fill  up  the

stalls in the existing markets?

that  we  were  about to conduct a health  campaign

among  members  of  the public,  and  that  so  far

nothing has happened. I would like to add something

to  what the Minister has said just now. We are now

consulting the Citizens' Consultative Committees in

certain  constituencies to organise  this  sort  of

campaign.  Other than the constituencies which  the

Minister  has  mentioned, because  of  shortage  of

staff   and  personnel  in  the  C.C.C.s  of  other

hope that in the not too distant future we will see

help in the promotion of this health campaign.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han (Tampines):</b> Sir, I will speak

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1831.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the introduction of the

Hawkers' Code, the Minister has vigorously embarked

on   an  ambitious  programme  to  reorganise   our

hawkers.  He  first started with the  Geylang  West

Constituency, then the Anson Constituency, and then

the Tanjong Pagar Constituency. But I was told that

the Minister also intends to reorganise the hawkers

in  the  Telok  Ayer  Constituency.  While  he  has

improved   the  hawker  situation  generally,   the

problem  now is that some of the hawkers  in  these

constituencies feel that they have been  especially

singled out for licensing procedures, whereas their

counter-parts in other constituencies are  free  to

conduct  their  petty trading without  restriction.

The result is that hawkers who are granted licences

for  pitches in these constituencies have  migrated

to the free zones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me to be unfair to the hawkers in

these  constituencies  to  subject  them  to  rigid

discipline,  while  others  are  spared   of   this

control.  Therefore, I call upon  the  Minister  to

suspend  disciplinary measures against the licensed

hawkers until such time as the licensing system can

be  applied  universally to all hawkers  throughout

the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In places where the licensing of hawkers has

begun,  there seem to be more hawkers than  before.

This  means  that each licensed hawker can  now  do

less  business  than before. Therefore,  I  propose

that the licence fees for day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



business  be reduced from $10 to $6 and  those  for

night business be reduced from $20 to $12. Perhaps

the  Minister  may be aware of the fact  that  some

hawkers are unable to pay their licence fees due to

lack of business.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Chew, you have very little time

left.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han:</b> Sir, the problem of hawkers

has  indeed always been a difficult one. Though  at

present  the  hawkers  are  being  reorganised  and

resited,  they  will  continue  to  exist,  if  not

flourish, owing to our social and economic reasons.

They  have  in the past indeed provided  convenient

services  to the people and have been a great  help

to those who are unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one will probably agree with me that if

Singapore  is  going to become a garden  city,  the

hawkers  will have the duty to co-operate with  the

Government. It is a well-known fact that among  the

hawkers where the food is good, the place is always

less  desirable. Here, I would like to  name  three

localities just as examples. (1) Beach Road,  where

the  satay is good, everything is good; but  whilst

the  mouth  is  tasting the good  satay,  the  nose

smells  something  unpleasant  and  the  feet   are

resting in dust and mud. (2) New Bridge Road,  just

outside  the Chinese Tong Chai Medical Hall,  there

are  at least 20 different types of food. Excellent

food  it  is. There may be new stools, new  tables,

but before one can really sit down, one has already

kicked so many craters in the compound. And  if  he

does not fall, he will probably fall whilst sitting

on  a stool which is standing on uneven ground. (3)

Hokien Street, where the hawkers specialise in  the

famous palatable Hokien wee and quick service, they

open till early in the morning. But the environment

and chairs and tables often curtail one's enjoyment

of the food ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must now call the Minister

to reply very, very shortly. Mr Yong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I would like to answer

the  Member for Anson first. I am afraid we are not

in   a   position   to  reorganise   all   the   51

constituencies at one time. That is why we have  to

go  in stages. There is no question of singling out

any  of the hawkers. The worst situation is in  the

city area. So I am afraid we cannot suspend action,

because if we did, we might as well do nothing, and

go back to chaos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also afraid that it is not possible to

consider a reduction of licence fees, because  they

are already nominal. How much more nominal fees  do

the hawkers want? After all, we have to pay for the

services of the public cleansing workers.  They  do

not  do  it  for  free;  neither  do  the  hawkers'

inspectors. They have all got to be paid  salaries.

And  the number of licences that have to be  issued - the  stationery involved - all this has got  to  be

paid for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the statement made by the Member for

Tampines  that  nice  places for  hawker  food  are

unfortunately not nice places for the nose. That is

exactly   the  situation.  When  they   have   good

business,  they should be doing their  business  in

proper shophouses where the surroundings are clean.

That is what we hope the future will bring - that by

slowly  reorganising  the  hawkers,  they  will  be

selling their food inside shop premises. Perhaps it

will  be a little more expensive than what  it  was

before, but I think the public are prepared to  pay

a bit more for their food because they can enjoy it

under healthy hygienic conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the Minister is aware

that  a  new  form of gambling under the  guise  of

football pools is being legalised and introduced in

Malaysia,  like  the Social Welfare Lottery.  Given

time and an efficient distribution system, and with

the  encouragement  of  the  Press,  this  form  of

gambling will find its way into Singapore. I do not

think  we can afford to see large sums of our money

flowing  out of the country, and in this respect  I

would like to ask the Minister what he proposes  to

do  - whether he intends also to grant a licence for

the  operation of a football pool in Singapore.  If

the answer is in the negative, what does he propose

chance or gambling?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are asked to approve a sum of $300,000

for  this item. Is the Government going to organise

a  trade fair in Singapore during 1968? Or  is  the

sum  asked  for  to  send delegations  overseas  to

attend exhibitions organised by other countries?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member has asked whether

we are going to hold a trade fair in Singapore next

year  and whether the $300,000 is for this purpose.

I think that is his point. The answer is no. We are

not going to have any trade fairs in Singapore, and

if  we  did, it would cost much more than $300,000.

Let me inform Members of the House what is involved

in  organising trade fairs. Last year a trade  fair

was held in Bangkok for the ECAFE region. Singapore

was given the first option to hold this trade fair.

I  was  then  in the Finance Ministry, and  I  made

inquiries  into the cost of holding  such  a  trade

fair.  Experts from other countries were called  in

and  they  had  a look at the possible  trade  fair

ground which was the old Kallang Airport. Estimates

were  made  of  the different kinds  of  facilities

which  would be required of a world trade fair  for

the  ECAFE region and of a standard which ECAFE had

in  mind.  The cost was something in the region  of

$90   million  - the  whole  lot  to  be  borne   by

Singapore. We do not have that kind of money and so

we  passed off this option, and the trade fair  was

held in Bangkok.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, either in 1969 or 1970 there will be the

Osaka  Expo, or an Exposition in Osaka. When I  was

last  in  Japan, I got in touch with the organisers

of this Expo and asked them what, in their opinion,

should Singapore spend on its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



pavilion  in the Osaka Expo, assuming  that  we  do

participate in it. I explained to them that we  are

a  small poor country and what I really wanted from

him  was  an idea of the minimum sum that we  would

have  to  spend  in  order  not  to  disgrace   the

Republic. And he said, "$15 million". This kind  of

money,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am afraid  we  do  not

have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This $300,000 is really for participation in

rather   modest   trade  exhibitions   in   various

countries,  not in any way up to the  standards  of

the Osaka Expo or that kind of trade fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This $300,000 is really peanuts, but I am afraid

that is all we can afford.

are   paid   and  why  they  are  named   "Malaysia

Scholarships".  Can the name be  changed  to,  say,

"Singapore Scholarships" or something like that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This vote has a long history,

going back to 1961. In July 1961, there was held in

Singapore  the  Eighth Regional Conference  of  the

Commonwealth  Parliamentary Association  where  the

then Minister for Education announced the offer  of

ten  special  scholarships each year  for  students

from  Sabah  and Sarawak. These were  to  be  given

special treatment by way of training places and the

awards were to be known as "Malaysia Scholarships".

A separate vote was created in 1963 to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



finance  them.  But  when we joined  Malaysia,  the

territories  of  Sabah  and  Sarawak  also   joined

Malaysia simultaneously with us and technically  it

was  not  possible to award scholarships  to  these

scholars from the Colombo Plan vote. So to overcome

this difficulty the Malaysia Scholarship scheme was

introduced  in a separate vote made  up  for  them.

Since we left Malaysia in 1965, scholars from Sabah

and  Sarawak  were again eligible for Colombo  Plan

scholarships and, in fact, this would be the way in

which   they   would  receive  their  training   in

Singapore. So the present vote is really meant  for

the  15  scholarships awarded and  expected  to  be

outstanding  in 1968. The amount of this  vote,  of

course,  will  diminish in course of  time  as  the

scholars complete their studies and return to Sabah

and Sarawak.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I speak on this topic. I

would  like to ask your permission to speak  a  few

words  on  some other topic. I hope  you  will  not

hurry  us  too much when we are speaking, otherwise

we  cannot speak because Budget time should be  the

time  for us to air our complaints. So if  we  have

any complaints, we should make use of this time  to

raise them, otherwise we will not have much time to

air our complaints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that every

responsible citizen will not have any objection  to

the various items in the Estimates.



<br><br>4.50 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons is that at the moment the

person  in  charge  of  financial  affairs  is   an

experienced  as  well as an intelligent  economist,

Dr Goh Keng



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



Swee.  However,  the most urgent problem  today  is

whether  the  Government is effectively controlling

all  the  items of expenditure without  any  waste.

Sir,  I wish to mention some Government departments

where  there  still exist a number of  problems.  I

will make use of this opportunity to list them  one

by  one. For example, at the moment, there is still

the    problem   of   corruption   in    Government

departments. It has not been completely eliminated.

Of   course,   when  I  mention  this  problem   of

corruption, I must say that in accordance with  the

P.A.P. policy in 1959 when we came to power, we did

try   to   eliminate  completely  the  problem   of

corruption. I can say that we have had some success

in  this  task.  However, I  believe  this  problem

cannot  be  completely eliminated in a short  time.

Compared  to other countries, Singapore  is  better

than   them  a  hundred  times.  But  I  hope   the

Government  will not be complacent in dealing  with

this problem. As long as there is any corruption, I

hope  the Government will try its best to eliminate

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the bureaucratic attitude

of  public  servants is still prevalent in  various

Government  departments. Ever since the  Government

came  to  power, we have tried to eliminate  it  so

that  all  the  public servants can carry  out  the

policy  of our Government. As a result, the  people

in  Singapore have been praising the Government for

the  effective  measures taken. In each  department

there  should be a courteous atmosphere when  civil

servants are dealing with the public. But I do  not

understand why this problem has gradually come back

again  in  every department. There  is  again  this

attitude of discourtesy. If the Government does not

believe this, I think every Minister should inspect

the various departments in his own Ministry, as was

done   before,  and  he  will  discover  that  this

attitude  exists. The civil servants are  not  only

impolite  to  the  public but also  to  Members  of

Parliament. They are impolite and do not regard  us

as  Members  of Parliament. I am sure many  Members

have  had a similar experience and will agree  with

what I have said. If we allow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



this  state  of affairs to continue,  then,  as  an

effective  Government our policy will be  defeated.

In  addition,  after our party  came  to  power,  a

course  of  training was organised for  the  public

servants. If this is the result of such a course of

training, then I think such training was completely

useless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to bring up is the waste of

public  property. In many departments  some  public

servants  are  very  careless in  using  Government

property. They do not know how to economise. We all

remember  that  we have to economise  public  funds

because these funds come from the people. They have

worked very hard for them. If we do not investigate

this  problem  carefully, then the task  of  nation

building  will be endangered. I hope  the  Minister

will  carry  out a careful investigation  into  the

problems I have mentioned.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I note

that the estimate for this Ministry has reached the

figure  of  $57,776,690. This is about  $4  million

more  than for 1967. This means that this  Ministry

has   expanded   and  there  are  more   items   of

expenditure.  In the past, this Ministry  has  made

great  achievements in its work, such as the  issue

of  new  currency, the expansion of new industries,

and   effective  control  of  the  revenue  of  our

country.  All these achievements should be  praised

by  all.  Undoubtedly our present economic position

is  very  sound and stable. Therefore, the  various

schemes  and policies of the Government  have  been

fully  implemented.  The  national  income  of  our

people  has also increased. This is because of  the

general  improvement in the economic situation  and

the standard of living of our people. But it cannot

be  denied  that  there  are  certain  difficulties

facing   our   country,  namely,  the  problem   of

unemployment. This has also been recognised by  the

Minister  as the most serious challenge facing  us.

How  are we going to overcome this serious problem?

I  feel that the Minister for Finance should  adopt

better and more effective measures to deal with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



this and to expand industries, tourism and external

trade   in   order   to  solve  this   problem   of

unemployment step by step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister a few

questions. First, whether he intends to  set  up  a

price control committee or bureau in the very  near

future  in  order to control prices of goods.  This

scheme  is  being practised in many  countries.  We

know  that  the stabilisation of prices will  bring

about a peaceful and stable situation and keep  the

social  order in manageable proportions.  Otherwise

there  will  be fluctuations in prices  which  will

cause   a  lot  of  difficulties  to  the  people's

livelihood and will affect other economic  factors.

I hope the Minister can pay attention to this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, ours is a developing country. The

development  projects need large funds  which  come

from  taxation  and  the  issue  of  public  loans.

Sometimes  you have to get loans from international

organisations.  I would like to know  how  much  we

have  borrowed from international organisations  or

from which country and how much interest we have to

pay every year.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>5.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Delta has

raised  three important points. First,  corruption.

She says that although there have been improvements

since  we  took  office, there are no  grounds  for

complacency  and we should always  be  vigilant  in

stamping out corruption. I entirely agree with her.

We  cannot  afford  to relax the slightest  in  the

maintenance of a vigilant attitude towards  corrupt

officials.   We   have   the   Corrupt    Practices

Investigation Bureau which is doing a good  job  of

work.  For  instance,  in  my  Ministry  they  have

investigated into alleged corrupt practices in  the

Import  and Export Office, as a result of which  12

officers  have been interdicted and they are  going

to  be  charged in court. We cannot be too vigilant

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



searching for more offences and weeding out corrupt

officials.  The  final responsibility,  of  course,

rests  with  the public. If they know that  corrupt

practices  are  going on, they should  report  them

forthwith to the C. P. I. B.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's second point was about the

bureaucratic  attitude in the  civil  service.  She

said   that   after  1959  we  effected   a   great

improvement  and  that  lately  there  has  been  a

gradual  reversion. Public officers are more  prone

to  be  rude not only to members of the public  but

also to M.P.s. I do not know what the truth is, but

I will not be surprised at all if there is a lot in

what  she  says.  All  I  can  say  is  that  every

Minister,  and  every Parliamentary  Secretary  for

that  matter,  should  look  out  for  examples  of

discourteous  conduct  by  civil  servants  towards

members  of  the public. And when they come  across

such  instances,  the persons concerned  should  be

subject to disciplinary action. I cannot agree with

her  more that we must not allow any relaxation  of

the high standards of courtesy we expect from civil

servants and employees of statutory authorities. As

for  rudeness to M.P.s, I shall be grateful if  any

Member  of  Parliament, who has been so treated  by

civil  servants,  will report immediately  such  an

occasion  either to the Minister of the  Department

or  to  me  and I will undertake to make  immediate

investigations into the incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards waste of public funds, it is no use

pretending that public property or public funds are

not  being wasted. I will give you an example.  The

T.V, cameraman dogs Ministers on public  occasions

and eventually we get about six seconds on T.V.  To

take  these six seconds, I suspect they shoot about

five minutes of film, thereby wasting not only film - that  is  not  so  important  - wasting  not   only

developing solutions to develop this film,  wasting

not  only the contact prints that have to be  made,

but also the time of the editor and the splicer.  I

hope something can be done in this respect. This is

just one occasion ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon. Member:</b> Resign!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, no, heaven forbid. These

things  do  happen  and  all  I  can  say  is  that

everybody  should keep a sharp look-out  for  these

things  and  put  a  stop to  them  when  they  are

detected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang says we should have

price  control because other countries  are  having

price  control.  I ask him to name one  country  in

South-east  Asia  where  price  control  has   been

introduced  and is effective. Let us  forget  about

it.  It is all right for propaganda purposes to say

"Let's control prices." But everybody knows that if

an  open economy like Singapore's, you cannot  have

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now

I  mentioned  that  many countries  are  practising

price control on goods. As to its effectiveness, it

is  another  matter. I did not refer to  South-east

Asian  countries. I just said in some countries  in

the world.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, I have no doubt that if

you  furnish the Minister with a list, he will have

investigations conducted.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, let us not go for this

kind  of  propaganda stunt. Price control  will  be

ineffective  in  Singapore. The only  way  to  keep

prices  reasonable is to have a lot of  competition

so  that nobody monopolises anything and is  in  .a

position to exploit the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign loans, so far as the Singapore Government

is  concerned,  amount to only  $12  million.  They

consist  of  an interest-free loan granted  by  the

United  Kingdom Government in 1953 to help us  over

war  damage compensation. $11,580,000 of this  loan

is  still  outstanding. Then there is the  Colonial

Development  Welfare Loan granted in  1954  and  $�

million  of this is outstanding. So Government  has

borrowed  something like $12 million. On the  other

hand,  we have about $1,200 million invested abroad

or, in other words, lent to other countries. So  we

are a net lender of capital, not a borrower.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Public Utilities Board, the Port

of Singapore Authority and the Telephone Board have

borrowed money from the World Bank. These  are  for

what  people  call  self-liquidating  projects.  In

other words, they are not Government loans, as  the

term is understood, but are loans to pay for actual

economic  projects which will pay  for  themselves,

like  the  loan to build a power station or  extend

the  power station, to extend the supply of  water,

to  expand  the  port and to expand  our  telephone

services.  All this means more money is  earned  to

enable   the  loans  to  be  repaid.  But  as   for

Government loans as such, they amount to  only  $12

million.

the  Minister  for  Finance as to  what  are  these

allowances and whether there is any way of reducing

them or not paying them at all.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this is an obligation

which  we have inherited from the distant past.  In

fact,  we  have  to  go back to the  foundation  of

Singapore  itself, back to the year 1819  when  Sir

Stamford  Raffles  landed  at  the  mouth  of   the

Singapore  River. In that year, some  66  acres  of

land  in Kampong Glam were allowed for the  use  of

the  heirs  of  Sultan Hussain and his descendants.

The Sultan occupied the land



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



until  he  died in 1835 and this property had  been

passed on from generation to generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1897, the Courts of Singapore ruled

that  the  land belonged to the Colony of Singapore

and  not to the Sultan's descendants but that  they

were  allowed  to  make  use  of  it.  So  in   the

administration of the properties under  the  Sultan

Hussain's  Ordinance,  provision  is  made  for  an

annual  payment  to  be  made  to  the  family  and

descendants of the late Sultan, and throughout  the

years  the  net revenue has been paid  out  to  the

descendants  and  this amounted  to  $63,379.99  in

1964. In 1965, it was $60,422.38. In 1966, it  came

to  $61,005.85. There are now 23 beneficiaries  and

all  payments  are  made  in  accordance  with  the

provisions of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way of reducing this payment and I

think  we  should honour this historical obligation

which we have inherited from Sir Stamford Raffles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I imagine that I will be in a

similar position, as the question I am going to ask

concerns the Tourist Promotion Board which is under

the  charge  of the Minister for Law  and  National

Development.  I  might as well ask my  question  in

case  the Minister for Finance would like to answer

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Tourist Promotion Board has a three per

cent  cess  levied  on all tourist  hotels  with  a

minimum  of  one dollar. I believe  the  object  of

levying  this cess on tourist hotels is  to  obtain

revenue  for  the Tourist Promotion Board  for  the

promotion of tourist activities. But this  cess  is

in  turn  passed on to the tourist, in addition  to

his  hotel accommodation, he pays this cess and not

the hotel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask either the Minister for

Finance  or  the  Minister  for  Law  and  National

Development  whether  this  is  the  right  way  to

promote tourism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I think it is the right

way  to promote tourism. Other countries have  this

kind  of cess which is passed on to tourists.  They

also have sales tax which is passed on to tourists.

I  have  gone to many countries and stayed in  many

hotels  and,  quite frankly, the  charges  in  some

hotels in some cities are quite appalling. Ours are

really  cheap compared with what we have to pay  in

other countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

this,  would  it  not be fairer  if  this  cess  is

extended to cover more hotels than to confine it to

persons living in a few tourist hotels to pay  this

cess?  In  view of the present boom experienced  by

the  hotel  industry, will it not be beneficial  to

the  Tourist  Promotion  Board  if  this  cess   is

extended to cover more hotels?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, I do not think it is

equitable to require some hotels, who are really no

better  than  lodging-houses,  to  pay  this   tax,

because  under  no conceivable circumstances  would

international  tourists be  patronising  them.  The

Tourist  Promotion Board makes up a list of tourist

hotels  and these are the hotels that benefit  most

directly  from  the  promotion  activities  of  the

Board.  So  it is fair that these hotels pay  their

contributions. The other hotels do not. It is  true

that  some second-rate hotels may benefit from  the

present  shortage of hotel rooms, but this  can  be

regarded as only a very temporary phenomenon. But I

must  ask  the hon. Member not to believe that  the

tourist  hotels are only the very big  hotels  like

Goodwood,  Raffles, Inter-Continental, and  so  on.

Some  of  the smaller hotels are also paying  cess.

The Mayfair Hotel, for instance, is paying tax.

the provision for this year is $31,000 and for next

year  it is $25,800. I would like to know what sort

of  amenities our overseas students, especially  in

the  United Kingdom, are accorded, and whether  the

reduction in the vote will mean a similar reduction

in amenities.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am afraid I must give

the  same  reply which I gave the Member for  River

Valley when he raised his first inquiry. This  vote

appears  under  the  Public Service  Commission.  I

think  there has been a slip-up in the transmission

of  responsibility for answering these matters.  My

Ministry   was   under   the   impression    - quite

erroneously  as  it  has  turned  out  - that  these

questions would have been answered by the  Minister

responsible  for the operation of these allowances.

Apparently it is not so. So I do apologise  to  the

House for being unprepared to answer matters which,

strictly   speaking,   do  not   fall   within   my

responsibility.  I think this is a  thoroughly  bad

show. I hope that next year somebody will make sure

that  when  it comes to considering this particular

head  of expenditure, the Minister who is in charge

of  actually operating this vote will be present to

reply to hon. Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0806 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a sum of $350,000 has been entered in the

Estimates.  I  assume that this  is  to  set  up  a

department for the Export Incentive Scheme  and  to

implement the provisions of the Bill which has been

passed  by Parliament. May I have more details  and

information from the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member is quite correct in

his  assumption  that  this expenditure  is  to  be

incurred  in  respect  of  administration  of   the

economic  expansion incentives schemes. As  Members

know,  this scheme provides for a reduction  of  90

per  cent  of  income  tax on profits  earned  from

certain  types of exports, namely, exports  to  new

markets.  In  order to prove this  kind  of  export

performance, a manufacturer will have to submit  to

the Comptroller of Income Tax, Customs certificates

certifying  that  these goods, in fact,  have  been

exported.  So it can be seen that this scheme  will

involve  the  Customs in a considerable  amount  of

additional work, and this sum is to provide for the

additional  expenditure required. The  $350,000  is

made  up  as follows: Staff $302,000, Other Charges

Annually Recurrent $12,000, Equipment $36,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,974,300 for Head 0806 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0807 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0807 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, recently there has been a spate

of  upward revisions of property tax, especially in

the  rural  areas. I can quote examples  of  upward

revision  in my constituency, Choa Chu Kang,  which

caused  tremendous distress among  my  constituents

who  are  rural  folks  and earn  their  living  by

farming,   and   generally  are  poor   people.   I

appreciate that legally the levy of a property  tax

has no reference to the income of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



property owner. Property tax is levied according to

the annual value, i.e. what a property can fetch in

rent.  Let  me  give an example to  the  House  how

inequitable sometimes the rigid application of  the

law can be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us say a family has only a house which is

assessed by the Property Tax Division as a property

capable of fetching $300 income a year, which means

$25  a  month.  This is the rent that the  property

would fetch at market rates. Then the Property  Tax

Division  proceeds to levy a tax on  the  property,

i.e., 18 or 23 per cent or whatever the rate is  on

this  annual value of $300. If, say, it is  18  per

cent,  the  head of the family would  have  to  pay

something  like $48 a month. But the  rent  is  the

sole income of the property owner. However, if, for

example,  he  has  a sum of money and,  instead  of

investing it in a piece of property, he puts it  in

a  bank  and earns interest. Let us say he gets  an

equivalent of $300 interest a year. Now, if that is

his  sole income, he would be free from payment  of

income tax, because his income is $300 a year only.

And since he has no other income than this $300  he

need not have to pay income tax. But if he were  to

be  so  foolish  as  to put his investment  into  a

house,  as mentioned earlier, he would have to  pay

the Government $48 a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, as far as the law of property tax

goes, the Property Tax Division is quite correct in

assessing this case. But I think they are  applying

the  law  far  too rigidly. If I am  not  mistaken,

there  is  provision in the Property Tax  Ordinance

for relief, but this provision is never made use of

and  never  applied. I wonder whether the  Minister

can  assure the House that in deserving  cases  for

relief, he will ask the Comptroller of Property Tax

to invoke this provision liberally.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since this

amendment  has  been  moved by  my  colleague,  the

Member for Choa



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



Chu  Kang, I have also to move my amendment*  on the

same  subhead,  but  the  difference  is  that   my

amendment  is  to reduce the subhead by  the  whole

sum.  I  should,  however, like  to  speak  on  the

amendment moved by the Member for Choa Chu Kang.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment (2) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0807 be reduced by the whole sum in respect of subhead 1101.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am fully of the same view as that

expressed by him. But I have something more to add,

and  I hope that the Minister for Finance will look

into  such matters. First of all, Sir, I  refer  to

the  application  for  transfer  of  ownership   in

respect  of those who own houses. This concerns  my

constituency  very  much.  I  have  had   on   many

occasions received complaints from my constituents,

especially those involved in applying for  transfer

of ownership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may trouble the House with a little bit of

detail,  Sir. Let us say, for example, that  Mr  A

bought  a  house from Mr B some 15 years ago,  and

that house has been given a number. Today with  the

social  amenities  available to him,  for  example,

electricity  and water supplies, Mr  A  wishes  to

apply for such services. But unfortunately, Sir, on

the  property  tax bill, the name of the  owner  is

different.  In  other words, the  previous  owner's

name is given on the bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr A has to make an application to have his name registered in the owner's list. Unfortunately, too, Mr B, who sold the house to Mr A, could not be traced. There arises the complication. Poor Mr A would probably have to make a statutory declaration to the effect that to the best of his knowledge and

so  on  and so forth, he is the sole owner  of  the

house. And I take it that the Property Tax Division

would  come to his assistance. The rural folks  now

realise that with such amenities available at their

doorstep,  they  can have them,  and  in  order  to

facilitate  such matters the Property Tax  Division

should come to their assistance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to raise is this, and

that is in regard to renumbering of houses. I think

this  issue is not new, it has been brought  up  in

previous Budget sessions, and today I have to bring

it  up again for the simple reason that some houses

in certain areas have been renumbered and some have

not. The main reason I was given to understand  was

that the owner's name, as listed in the register of

owners, was different from that of the present, and

hence  a  number could not be given. Of course,  in

this  case the Minister could get a better look  at

it  and  say, "Will the Member submit me a list  of

names  and  so forth, and I will look up?"  I  say,

Sir, that such cases do exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that I come to my third point, and that is

the  application for a house number.  This  subject

again  is not new, and I am sorry I have to trouble

the House again with a little bit of detail just to

see  how a house number applied for would be given.

It  goes like this. First, you have an unauthorised

hut  or dwelling house, to put it whatever way  you

like.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Demolish it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang is

of the opinion that it should be demolished, but  I

would say that if the Minister says, "Go ahead with

the  demolition of all the unauthorised  structures

in  Choa Chu Kang," I think the Member for Choa Chu

Kang  will be the first to stand up and say,  "Sir,

these are the reasons, and on compassionate grounds

they should not be demolished, etc., etc.". I think

he  was  probably not attentive during the previous

years' Budget debates if he was here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is this: you have an unauthorised

dwelling house in existence for umpteen years  - 10, 15, 20 years - and there is no house number. And  as

I   have  mentioned  just  now,  with  such  social

amenities available at the doorstep, the  owner  of

this  unauthorised dwelling house comes  along  and

says, "Can I apply for a house number?"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



But   before  he  does  so,  he  has  to  make   an

application for the retention of an existing house,

for  which a form is supplied by the Chief Building

Surveyor. No doubt it does not concern the Ministry

of Finance, but somehow it will and I will dwell on

it  later.  This applicant fills up  the  form  and

sends   it   to   the  Chief  Building   Surveyor's

Department,  which  is  the processing  department,

because  after  investigation by their  officers  a

temporary  permit  will be issued.  This  temporary

permit  costs  $12  per  year  and  is  subject  to

renewal.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to that, Sir, up to 1965, as far as I can

remember,  the temporary permit was only  $2.  With

effect  from last year it was increased to  $12  - a

600  per  cent  increase - for one year  to  have  a

temporary permit. Be that as it may, Sir, to obtain

a  temporary  permit sometimes takes  a  couple  of

months.  That  may  be the earliest,  if  not  much

later.  The  next  process would  be  done  at  the

Property  Tax  Division, which is  a  unit  in  the

Department  of  Inland Revenue.  The  Property  Tax

Division  would send its own officers to  the  site

and investigate again and find out which number  to

give.  Here  is where it is my unfortunate  lot  to

have  to  bring  to  the attention  of  the  Deputy

Commissioner  of Property Tax the fact  that  there

has been undue delay of months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Years, my hon, colleague has

just  mentioned. But I would say  years  is  a  bit

exaggerated, Sir. I would say it would take  months

and  probably up to a year. My unfortunate part was

having  to  write  to  the Deputy  Commissioner  of

Property  Tax. I have on record in my own  file  of

"Meet the people sessions" copies of such memoranda

sent to him and in most cases there was no reply. I

am just wondering what this Division is doing. Just

to  get a house number! A chap who could not get it

would come to me and ask, "Please, Mr Ng, can  you

help?" All right, there goes a copy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



of  my note. No reply. I can dig it up and show  it

to  the Minister himself. I think this is going too

far, Sir. Something must be done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> This is not empty talk.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> This is no empty talk, as my

colleague, the Member for Changi, has stated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Sir, is my last point. My

colleague,  the  Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang,  has

mentioned the annual value of property in the rural

areas. Bear in mind that most of the houses in  the

rural  areas, whether they are in Changi, Choa  Chu

Kang, Tampines or Punggol ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Or Sembawang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Or Sembawang, as the case may

be,   are   known  as  temporary  structures   with

temporary  permits. The Inland Revenue  Department,

through the Property Tax Division, would come along

and  say, "Look, chum, we will have to assess  your

property which no doubt is temporary in nature at a

high  rate."  And  when  we  write  to  the  Deputy

Commissioner of Property Tax, he would say,  "1  am

afraid I cannot reduce the annual value. Therefore,

you  have to pay so much." I hope the Hon. Minister

for  Finance will sympathetically consider  what  I

have  mentioned and also those points raised by  my

colleague, the Member for Choa Chu Kang.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, there is no gratitude

ever  in  these matters. Only - when was it?  - three

years  ago,  maybe  four, we reduced  the  rate  of

property tax on owner occupiers of attap huts to $6

per year. If they are owners -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I do not think it was a

reduction.  As far as I can remember, the  property

tax  bills  in respect of temporary huts were  made

out for at $1.92. I can show the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



such bills. Then there was an increase to $6. I  do

not think there was a reduction, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There was a reduction, maybe

before  the Member was elected. I cannot be  wrong.

It  happened  in  this House.  This  $1.92  is  not

property  tax.  It is quit rent or  something  like

that. We are renting out land in the rural areas at

ridiculously low prices. Our rural folks are really

spoilt.  If  they  were  farmers,  say,  in   other

countries,  the landlord would take  over  half  of

their  produce  to start with, and  the  Government

would take half of the balance. This goes on in all

agricultural countries. And here, what do we charge

them  - $1.92 a year - not a month - quit  rent.  Then

the  owner occupiers pay $6 instead of $48. We  are

giving them a present of $42 a year. Far from being

grateful, they ask, why are we charging so much for

those who are renting out their houses? If they are

poor  farmers - men who are that poor - how can  they

build  a  house to let out? They become  landlords.

They are not poor farmers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Perhaps the Minister for

Finance might have misunderstood the position here.

Quit  rent  is  very different from  annual  value.

Moreover, annual value is assessed irrespective  of

whether  the  owner  occupies  the  house  or  not,

although, of course, there is a difference  in  the

rate  of  assessment. If it is owner-occupied,  the

rate is slightly lower.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the rate is considerably

lower.  How  can you say $6 is slightly lower  than

$48?  It is considerably lower. Owner occupiers  of

attap  dwellings pay $6 property tax a year.  There

are    12,000   owner   occupiers   enjoying   this

concession.  So  I  think Members representing  the

rural constituencies might have a kind word for the

Finance Ministry when discussing property tax. Now,

of course, the point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



is  why 18 per cent if they rent out the dwellings?

Why  not 18 per cent? They are landlords; they  are

not   farmers.  They  are  all  renting  out  their

property.  If they have built a stone  or  concrete

building, they pay 18 per cent. So if they build  a

wooden  structure with attap roof, why should  they

be exempted from property tax?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has brought up a number of

points    about   transfers   of   ownership    and

applications for house numbers. I must say that his

knowledge  of this business is quite encyclopaedic,

and  I cannot claim to rival his knowledge of  this

subject. I am not, of course, being subject  to  so

many  applications  at "Meet the people  sessions".

This  is a vexatious problem. I do not pretend that

it  is  not  a vexatious problem. These people  are

often not well educated and not educated in the law

and  administrative processes. This  is  a  subject

which  I  think  really does not  fall  within  the

province  of the Property Tax Department. This  is,

if   I  am  right,  something  which  concerns  the

Registrar of Deeds. Or is it the Land Office?  When

it  comes  to  matters  of ownership  of  property,

naturally the Property Tax Division must be careful

about   recognising  who  is  the  owner   of   any

particular  property. In the instance mentioned  by

the  Member  for  Punggol, the  original  owner  is

missing.  Surely this is a proper  reason  why  the

Property Tax Division has to be most careful  about

who  is the real owner. Otherwise more owners might

be  missing! In spite of all that, the  Member  has

talked   about  delays  in  getting   numbers.   My

information  is  that  the number  of  applications

received  for  house  numbers and  which  is  still

outstanding as of this moment is 347. So it  cannot

be  all that large, considering the number of attap

huts in the rural areas. It may be 30,000 or more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the reduction of annual values, there

are  set  procedures  laid  down.  No  doubt  these

procedures entail a lot of difficulties and trouble

which are beyond the rural folk to comprehend.  But

here again I must remind hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



Members  that the annual values attached  to  these

properties are very low. $300 a year would  be  an

exceptionally high figure. Most of them  would  be

in  the region of $150 to $180 a year. So it cannot

really be said that this involves great hardship on

the  rural  folks. On the question  of  whether  we

should simplify our procedures, I think the opinion

of Members from the rural constituencies is that we

should simplify them. I am willing to listen to any

reasonable  suggestion for simplifying  procedures.

if  hon.  Members have any good proposals,  I  will

give them the fullest consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I just

pick  up  two points which the Minister  has  said?

First is the question of quit rent. I said that the

bill was a property tax bill and it was $1.92 which

was collected until about 1960. From 1961, below $2

no  collections were made. This is the point I want

to  bring home. And I can supply the Minister  such

bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the transfer of

ownership.  As  I  understand it, the  question  of

ownership does not relate very much to the Registry

of Titles and Deeds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Sir, let me explain. For

example,  if  Mr A wants to apply for transfer  of

ownership  and hw cannot trace the previous  owner,

he makes out a statutory declaration. Or in another

case, if the house was registered under the name of

one  of his parents who had passed away many  years

ago,  all  the brothers and sisters would  have  to

become  signatories  to that  particular  statutory

declaration  which does not bind the  Property  Tax

Division  to  any  liability, to  the  best  of  my

knowledge.  In  other  words, the  registration  of

ownership only means that the tax on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



such  property  will  be  duly  collected  by  the

Property   Tax  Division.  Hence   there   is   no

connection  between  the Registry  of  Titles  and

Deeds and the Property Tax Division.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I will look into this

matter  and  see  whether or not we  can  simplify

proceoures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards $1.98 property tax, I will accept the

Member's  word  for  it. It just  shows  that  the

person in question had been under-assessed before.

[Laughter].

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This tax must have been laid

down  in  the reign of Queen Victoria and has  not

been  changed  since.  Some  years  ago  the  Land

Office,  which  was then in charge  of  collecting

these  revenues, had an enormous backlog and  they

were  fighting very hard to reduce it. It was  not

until this work had been transferred to the Inland

Revenue that much progress was made. I think  the

Member should congratulate the owner of this house

on having escaped an upward revision for so long.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0807 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that one of the objectives of our

Party  is  to  build a non-Communist  democratic,

socialist society. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



wish to resort to peaceful means to achieve social

reconstruction. In other words, we want  to  adopt

peaceful  ways and means by which we could  reduce

the  gap  between the rich and the poor.  However,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I regret to say  that  at  the

moment  there is a small number of public servants

who  do  not seem to understand the principles  of

democratic socialism. They still have the attitude

of  the  colonial  days. I want  to  quote  a  few

examples to substantiate what I have said. We  all

know  that  a  high  percentage of  our  country's

revenue is from property tax. Of course, the  more

property  tax we collect, the more is our  revenue

and  this is a very good thing. However,  I  think

assessment on properties should be based  on  the

background  of the owners. Some assessors  do  not

seem  to  understand the conditions under  which

the  rural dwellers live. Hence, their assessment

on  properties  is  excessively high.  In  certain

areas, because of land acquisition for military or

development   purposes,  the  people   have   been

resettled elsewhere. Of course, the Government  is

justified in acquiring these lands in the national

interests.  Before  they  were  resettled,   these

people had been occupying certain pieces of land.

Generally,  the  land area was many  times  larger

thaii  the land given to them on resettlement.  On

these  larger  areas  of  land  they  could  plant

vegetables  and fruit trees and make a living  out

of  them  more  easily.  Generally  speaking,  the

income  of  the people who have been resettled  is

less than their income before their resettlement.

Sometimes  when they are resettled in a  low-lying

area,  these  people will have  to  spend  several

thousands of dollars to try to drain off the  area

in  order  to build their homes and make a  living

out  of  the land. As such, the livelihood of  the

rural  people  is more difficult than  before  the

resettlement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, before the people were

resettled,  most  of  them were  living  in  attap

houses.  They were enjoying a certain  concession

on property



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



tax by paying only a few dollars per year. If they

were staying in attap houses, the property tax was

only $6. When they moved out, they could not carry

the  attap houses with them. So they have to build

new houses to stay

in.   Some  assessors, who do not quite understand

the conditions of these people, value these newly-built  houses  at many times more  than  what  was

assessed before, and sometimes as much as 700  per

cent  more. On the one hand, the income  of  these

rural people who have been resettled has dwindled.

On  the  other hand, their assessments  have  been

increased. This is the point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about pigsties and chicken

pens. Most of the rural people keep fowl, pigs and

other  domestic animals. They spend a lot of time,

energy and a great deal of labour in rearing their

domestic  animals. But very often there are  cases

of  losses  and  these figures  are  unknown.  For

instance,  not  very long ago there  were  certain

cases  of swine fever and other animal epidemics,

causing great losses to some of the farmers.  Even

if  they  can  make  some  money  out  of  rearing

domestic  animals, it is only meant to eke  out  a

living. From what I know, every pigsty keeper  has

to  pay  the Government licence fee of $12  for  a

pigsty.  These pigsties and chicken  sheds  cannot

avoid  the  assessors' valuation,  and  for  these

things,  their  owners will have to  pay  property

tax. So the owners have to pay double taxation.  I

have  not  found anything in the law  saying  that

there  should  be a property tax on  pigsties  and

chicken   sheds.  I  think  this   is   merely   a

requirement  by the assessors. Here I  would  most

earnestly appeal to the Hon. Minister for  Finance

to  consider  my  appeal. There  are  two  points.

First,   to  reduce  the  property  tax   in   the

resettlement  areas. Secondly, to exempt  chicken

sheds  and  pigsties  from property  tax.  If  the

Minister   for   Finance  can   agree   to   these

suggestions, I know the rural people will be  very

grateful to him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  I  fully  agree   with   the

sentiments  expressed by the Member who  has  just

spoken.  We  all  know that the rural  people  are

generally   very  poor.  Their   only   means   of

maintaining  their livelihood depends  on  rearing

pigs,  chickens and other domestic animals.  Their

income  is  merely to maintain their  families  at

subsistence  level.  If the property  tax  is  too

high,  they  might meet with certain  difficulties

and   might   not   be  able  to  maintain   their

livelihood. There are certain difficulties  facing

the  people  of my constituency. Every  year  some

people  have  to  pay $100 to  $200  per  year  in

property  tax  on chicken sheds and pigsties.  The

pigs  and chickens do not know how to pay property

tax.   So  the  owners  have  to  pay  for   their

accommodation.  We  have  to  consider  this.  The

Minister has said that taxes have been reduced for

10  years  in succession. Agriculture  and  animal

husbandry have also declined. If that is  a  fact,

we should improve the lot of the rural people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, Members appeal for a

reduction  in property tax in respect of  pigsties

and chicken pens. For their elucidation, there  is

no  property  tax on pigsties and  chicken  pens,

because  I  entirely  agree with  the  Member  for

Sembawang that pigs and poultry cannot pay tax. We

do  not  tax them. What happens is that the Health

Department  levies a fee of $6  a  year  on  every

pigsty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> $12.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> $6. Maybe these people have

two   pigsties.   The  Health  Department   render

services  to  farmers  so  that  their  pigs   are

healthy.  There is no collection of any  sort  for

poultry pens.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for farmers being worse off, farmers in every

country  say  this  thing. The Member  for  Jurong

should  be  very  fortunate that there  are  fewer

farmers there and more workers. So I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



have  thought that the reduction in the number  of

farmers  is  really to the advantage of  the  hon.

Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what he has said about hardship in

resettlement cases should be taken seriously. I am

sure  that  hardship  could have  arisen  in  some

individual cases but not generally. I think  there

should be some machinery for detecting these cases

of  hardship  so  that  action  can  be  taken  to

mitigate the effects. This is really a matter  for

the  Minister for National Development. I  suggest

to the hon. Member to bring it up before him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the explanation

given by the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Bernard Rodrigues -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated

for Head 0807  be  reduced  by $10 in respect  of  subhead

3014.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated or Head 0807

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is high time that

the  Government adopted a realistic policy on  the

implementation of the income tax laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, nobody will disagree with the

Government  that it must endeavour to  collect  as

much tax as it can from those who have to pay  tax

according  to  law. But the taxing of  a  worker's

gratuity or ex-gratia payment, when it is given to

him, say, on premature retrenchment or under  any

circumstances, can hardly be considered  just  and

equitable. The argument may be put forward that if

this  gratuity  is deposited with the  C.P.F.,  it

will  not be taxed. I do not think this is a  good

solution  to the worker who does not have  a  job.

What is he to live on until he reaches the age  of

55?  If  he  does not get a job to enable  him  to

support his family,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



you  do  not expect him to live on thin  air.  The

employment opportunities for men in the age  group

of   45   to  55  are  very  slim,  and  this   is

particularly so when they reach the age of 50.  Do

the  authorities consider that they can afford  to

be  taxed?  I  urge the Minister to  consider  the

exemption   of  tax  on  gratuities  or  ex-gratia

payments  made  to retrenched workers.  I  suggest

that  if  tax  has  to be paid, a certain  formula

should  be  worked out whereby the total  gratuity

should be divided by the number of years from  the

lime that a worker is retrenched up to the age  of

55,  and  that  this sum should  be  allocated  as

earnings  for each year up to the age  of  55  and

taxed  in  the  normal way if  he  is  within  the

taxation bracket.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only have one

question to ask as a result of what the Member for

Bras Basah has said. Will the Minister for Finance

consider  granting an amnesty over a fixed  period

of  time  to  tax-dodgers to reveal  their  hidden

assets  and income which, when revealed, will  not

be  taxed on condition that such assets and income

are   capitalised  and  invested   in   industries

selected by his Ministry?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member

for  Bras  Basah wants to know whether  retirement

benefits  paid  to  people  now  employed  by  the

British  defence forces will be liable  to  income

tax  when they are retrenched. The answer is  that

special  provision  will be made  to  exempt  such

payments  from income tax. This is a matter  which

concerns  the  Minister  for  Labour  who  is  now

working  out a comprehensive scheme to help  these

people through their period of difficulty. So  far

as  I  am concerned, I can say that the gratuities

paid  to  the  Base  workers retrenched  from  the

British armed forces will not be taxed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards tax exemption for tax-dodgers, if

they  bring out their assets and invest them in  a

way  which commends itself to us, I do not really

like to give a snap decision now. I would like  to

think this matter over. There are obvious pros and

cons to it. But the Member for Telok Blangah will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



rest assured that I will give consideration to his

proposal. I cannot say at present whether it  will

be favourable or otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, I have another

question  to ask in view of what the Minister  has

said.  Is he prepared to consider exempting  those

retrenched due to Singapore's industrial programme

from paying income tax on their gratuities'?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think this is really a

matter for the Minister for Labour who is going to

introduce  a  scheme  which  will  cover   persons

retrenched  not only from the British  Bases,  but

also   employees  retrenched  as  a   result   of

cessation  of  business,  or  because  they   are

redundant, or for one reason or another.  I  think

that  is entirely a separate matter and should  be

dealt  with  in the ordinary course of income  tax

administration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

assurance  given by the Minister for Finance  that

he  will  consider  exempting  payments  made  to

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Sim Boon Woo.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the rapid industrialisation programme

and our export drive, I think it is important that

our  Trade  Division, particularly the Import  and

Export  Office, should be efficient,  helpful  and

incorrupt.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early this year, certain persons in the Import

and  Export  Office  of the  Trade  Division  were

involved  in alleged corrupt activities.  Can  the

Minister  say whether investigations in  the  Depa

rtment  have  been completed and  whether  he  is

satisfied    that   it   is   now   satisfactorily

reorganised?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is never possible to

eliminate   corruption   completely.   Corruption

always  exists  even to a minor  degree.  What  is

important is that every effort should be  made  to

detect  corruption and to prosecute the  culprits.

In  this instance, the C.PI.B, investigations into

the  Import and Export Office have been concluded

and, as I said in reply to earlier questions, the

result  of the investigations is that 12  officers

have been interdicted. Charges have been preferred

against  some of these officers, while charges  of

arrest  are  being  cleared  with  the  Solicitor-General.  The Public Service Commission  has  also

appointed Committees of Inquiry and they will  be

holding disciplinary proceedings under the  Public

Service  (Disciplinary  Proceedings)  (Procedure)

Rules, 1964.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> In view of the information, I

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0809

be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the Trade Division should be

efficient  in controlling the prices of  goods  in

this    country.   Certain   shops   have   lodged

complaints.   For  example,  the  Government   has

intioduced  quotas and import duties  because  of

our  industrialisation drive in order  to  protect

local   industries  for  domestic   markets.   The

question   arises  whether  local   products   are

sufficient to meet local demand. Many small  shops

dealing in textiles have experienced a shortage of

such goods.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, they are not able to import

foreign  textiles  to meet the  demands  of  their

consumers  because  of  the  quota  system,  which

therefore  results  in complaints  lodged  by  the

shops.  On  the other hand, this also affects  the

consumers  and increases their burden because  the

local  products  are  insufficient  to  meet  the

demands  of local consumers and therefore  results

in  an  increase  in prices, thus  leading  to  an

increased  burden for the lower and middle  income

groups. Apart from textile goods, there are  other

local  products  which are manufactured  locally.

They too have the same problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that at the moment there has

been  a  general increase in the prices of  goods,

especially  since  the devaluation  of  the  Pound

Sterling.  At  that time, for the  convenience  of

exchange, merchants raised the prices of  certain

goods.  For  example, ground nuts or peanuts  were

sold  at 80 cents per katty formerly, but in order

to  facilitate the coin exchange, they have raised

the  price  to  $1 per katty. Another  example  is

milk.  Formerly it was sold at 65 cents  per  tin,

but it has since been raised to 70 or 75 cents per

tin.  These  are  all daily necessities,  and  the

increase  in  the prices of these necessities  has

led  to  an increased burden. In actual fact,  our

Singapore currency has not been devalued and, with

the  introduction  of  the  new  coins,  merchants

should  reduce their prices in order not to  cause

hardship to the general public. But up to date we

have  not seen any reduction, and the Ministry  of

Finance  has  not  taken any  steps  to  stop  the

increase in prices or to bring the prices down  to

their  original  level.  The  general  public  are

suffering and this will increase their burden.  On

the  other hand, their salaries are not increased.

Therefore,  I request the Minister for Finance  to

take  suitable measures to deal with  the  general

increase in prices.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The general position about

the  supply  of  consumer goods  produced  by  our

industries is that the supply is ample and quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



adequate  to  meet  domestic  demand.  Should  any

shortage  develop temporarily, the action  to  be

taken   by  the  Ministry  is  to  abolish   quota

restrictions or otherwise increase the imports  of

such  goods. This has happened, as I explained  to

Parliament some time ago, in respect of  a  number

of commodities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase of prices, I do not get

the  impression  that there  has  been  a  general

increase  in  prices  since  the  devaluation   of

Sterling.  The  market was greatly upset  about  a

week   or  two  because  of  this  wretched   coin

business.  This has sorted itself out. As  I  have

often  informed Members, some prices do go up  and

other prices do come down. And by selecting prices

which  go  up or prices which come down,  you  can

prove any point you want. But as I have said, I do

not  get  the impression that there is an abnormal

increase  in prices. Rather, at about  this  time,

the  festive  season, there  is  nothing  much  to

justify  increased prices. But that  is  what  one

suspects when people are buying more for Christmas

and  the  New Year. And I would say that for  this

year  prices  have  not gone further  up  than  in

previous years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving this amendment, I

wish to touch on the Central Provident Fund, which

is under the charge of the Minister for Labour. We

are  all  aware that the Central Provident  Fund,

ever  since its establishment in 1955, has been  a

very  good source of provision of capital  to  the

Minister  for  Finance  for  economic  and   other

development.  Since  1955  amendments  have   been

introduced from time to time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



to  improve the collection of contributions from

members and employers, which is a good thing. But

other  than  amendments  for  tightening  up  the

evasion  or avoidance of collections, I think  no

other  provision  has been made  to  improve  the

social benefits for its contributors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in November I asked the Minister

whether  he  would look into the  feasibility  of

setting up a committee to examine the possibility

of  allowing members of the C.P.F. to  use  their

contributions as down-payments for purchase  of

houses  in order to promote home ownership  among

the  lower  income  group and, if  necessary,  to

recommend   such   amendments   to   the   C.P.F.

Ordinance. The answer I got was that 74 per  cent

of  the contributors have less than $1,000 in the

Fund.  This  means  that  26  per  cent  of   the

contributors have $1,000 or more in the Fund. Is

the  Minister  not aware that this 26  per  cent,

though it may be in the minority now, will  be  a

big  minority  as  the  years  go  by,  and  will

outnumber the 74 per cent? Is it not time now  to

sit  down and consider what improvements can  be

worked out for the benefit of its contributors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that the C.P.F. is a good source of

capital accumulation for the Minister for Finance

in  his economic projects, but surely I think the

contributors   themselves  should   have   first

priority  for their own benefit or for their  own

family benefit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I agree with all  the  reasons

given by the Member for River Valley. But I think

that  since  he has been so enthusiastic  in  his

proposals,   perhaps   this   matter   has   some

relationship  with  his  position,  because   he

appears  to be a member of the middle class.  His

proposal  is  to help more people in  the  middle

class to own houses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the aims of the C.P.F, is to enable an

to  have  certain funds to live on after  he  has

retired.  But  we  know that if a  worker  should

begin  working at the age of 20 years and  retire

at  55,  it would be quite a long time before  he

could make use of his provident fund. To him,  it

is  not  quite economical, and although a certain

rate  of  interest is paid by the C.P.F.,  it  is

very  low.  So the suggestion by the  Member  for

River  Valley  that  Government  should  consider

allowing  members of the C.P.F. to  make  use  of

their  fund  as  a deposit to buy houses,  is,  I

think,  a very useful and good suggestion.  Since

our  Government  is  one that  looks  after  the

interests of the people, we should always  listen

to  the  views given by the people.  I  hope  the

Minister can give serious consideration  to  the

suggestion of the Member for River Valley.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can accept suggestions from the people, we

can  help them to raise their standard of living,

because  with  their  own  housing  accommodation

their livelihood will be better. I believe if we

can  do that, many people will thank our Minister

for Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, since we are

discussing  the Central Provident Fund,  I  would

like  to raise one particular point. I wonder  if

some alleviation could be brought about.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, as the law stands, a person can only

withdraw his fund when he reaches the age  of  55

or,  if he wants ti withdraw the fund before  the

age  of 55, he should be unemployed for not  less

than two years and he should not be likely to  be

employed  further.  In  my constituency,  I  have

periodically come across people in the age  group

of  40  to  45 who have been retrenched  and  are

unable  to  find jobs. They have been  unemployed

for  two  years -some less than two  years;  some

more  than two years. By definition, as  the  law

stands, these people cannot withdraw their funds

until  they have reached the age of at least  53. It  is not very likely that these people would be

able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



to   get   jobs   because  of  the   unemployment

situation.  Nobody is prepared  to  give  jobs  to

people  of  this particular age group.  They  want

younger  people as far as possible. Is it possible

to  look into this question and provide a means of

amelioration so far as this category of people  is

concerned'?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since the setting up of the

Central Provident Fund in 1955, not a single year

has  gone by without someone asking for his  money

to be released for some reason or other. This year

we  have three. The answer to this is very simple.

Human nature is such that so long as the money  is

there, the temptation or the urge to spend  it  is

always  there.  We, as trustees  of  the  people's

money, will be failing in our duty if we do not do

our best to resist this demand t get the money out

and  spend it. Thriftiness and the habit of saving

are  things which we must try to teach our  people

to accept. The Housing Board's introduction of the

house  ownership scheme has let loose a series  of

fresh demands to draw the money out, and this time

on  the grounds that they use tht; money as  down-payments  to purchase Housing Board flats.  I  am

afraid  they  have  got  this  all  wrong.   House

ownership  is  something we are  encouraging  the

people  to achieve. But they must achieve this  by

some  other worth while means and not by utilising

the  money which they have set aside for  old  age

security. If they really want to have a house or a

flat  of their own, they should try to do this  by

working  haider,  by putting in  extra  effort  in

productivity,  earn more and put in extra  efforts

to  save that extra money to achieve the object of

house  ownership. This will make their achievement

more  precious to them at heart. In this way, they

will  not only have a house of their own, but when

they  reach  the age of 55 they will also  have  a

lump sum of money to see them through in their old

age.  I  am  sure this is more beneficial  to  the

individual  as  well  as to  the  economy  of  the

country as a whole. There may be other perfectly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



legitimate grounds on which people would  want  to

draw  their  money  out of the  Central  Provident

Fund, such as unemployment, hardship, sickness, or

a  desire to finance a business venture. But I  am

afraid once the opening is allowed, the temptation

to  draw some more money from the C.P.F. is always

there  and in next to no time there will  be  no

more  money left. So the question is very  simple.

Do  we  or  do  we not want savings  for  old  age

security?  If  we  want  to  save  for  old   age

security, we must not touch the money. If we touch

the  money, there will be no old age security. You

cannot have your cake and eat it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister  is  evading  the  issue.  The

Central  Provident  Fund was  introduced  for  the

specific purpose of making provision for employees

in  their  old age, and what we are suggesting  to

the  Minister  is not in a sense to  withdraw  the

money  from the C.P.F., but to ask the  C.P.F. to

come  to some arrangement with the I-lousing Board

whereby  it would be easier for contributors  who

have  a  certain  sum  in the C.P.F. to  purchase

houses  which  they  could now  enjoy  instead  of

waiting until their old age.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> If I may say so, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  do not think the  Minister  has

really answered the problem that

brought  out about the category of people  between

the  ages  of  40  and 50 who are  unemployed  and

unable  to  get employment because  of  their  age

factor  and  who  want  to take  this  money  out.

Otherwise, in the meanwhile they are destitute.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I do not think I am evading

the  issue. The issue, as I see it, is very clear,

whether  we want to draw the money out or  not.  I

would say they should not draw the money out,  and

they  should leave it there until they  reach  the

age  of  55. Otherwise who will look after  them?

Whether you call it house ownership or you  buy  a

house from the Housing Board, or you pay money  to

a man who is out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



of  work at the age of 45, he is still drawing out

the  money.  So the main issue here is whether  we

should allow that withdrawal before he reaches the

age of 55. If we want, we must take the matter  up

quite  differently. But somehow or other the  line

must  be  drawn  somewhere. We have  decided,  and

rightly decided, that the line should be drawn  at

the age of 55. That is it.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would

like to ask the Minister only two questions on the

Central  Provident Fund. Will the deposit  in  the

Central  Provident Fund earn interest, as  in  the

case of banks? if this money is put in the Central

Provident  Fund  without  the  C.P.F. giving  any

interest, as the banks are giving, then the  value

of   their   deposits  will,   in   actual   fact,

depreciate.  We  know that as society  progresses,

the  prices  of  daily necessities  increase.  For

instance, if you have put in $1,000, then  by  the

time  you withdraw it, it may be worth only $500.

If a reasonable rate of interest is paid, then the

money will not depreciate in value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is this. When a person is sick,

can he withdraw a certain amount of money from the

fund  in  order to look after his illness and  see

him  through? Suppose he has no other  member  of

the  family who can look after him, and he may not

have   reached   the  age  limit,   and   suppose,

unfortunately, he dies of the sickness, what  will

happen to him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The Member for Delta has

asked whether the money paid into the C.P.F. will

earn  any  interest. The answer  is  yes.  At  the

present moment, the interest in the C.P.F. is  at

the  rate  of 5� per cent per annum,  and  we  are

going  to  increase it to 5�, per  cent  for  the

account in 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other question whether a man can

withdraw  his money if he is sick, the  answer  is

again no. If he is sick



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



and   really  destitute,  I  think  our   hospital

facilities are so good that he can just get in and

stay  in a free ward. This is again another excuse

to  get  the  money out, and I do not  think  that

should be allowed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we have had enough debate

on this topic. Mr Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

head 1103.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be 0901 be reduced by $10

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, amendments (2) , (3)

and (4) .



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Sir, I am not moving

<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1251.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relates to the Registry of Citizenship. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  every  week during  my  "Meet  the

people  sessions",  about  20  per  cent  of   the

applicants  come  up  with problems  relating  to

their  citizenship applications. You  can  broadly

divide  the  category of people  into  three.  The

first  are those who have been in Singapore for  a

long time - 15 or 20 years - and who want to apply

for  citizenship.  The second category  are  those

whose  parents  have  become  Singapore  citizens,

whose  brothers and sisters who were subsequently

born  after  them were born in Singapore  and  are

Singapore  citizens. But unfortunately the  eldest

child was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



not born in Singapore but was born at the hospital

in  Johore  Bahru. He came to Singapore  within  a

month  of  his birth and he has been in  Singapore

ever  since. He is not a Singapore citizen and  he

has   applied  for  his  citizenship.  The   third

category  are  those students who want  to  pursue

their higher education and apply for what is known

as  junior  citizenship. In almost  every  one  of

these  cases,  they  had been interviewed  by  the

Registry  of  Citizenship  from  between  six   and

eighteen months, and up to date they have not  had

any  reply, either of rejection or acceptance. Can

the  Minister  let us know whether  some  form  of

procedure  can  he  devised  so  that  people  are

categorised, and those people  who  ought  to  be

given  citizenship or ought to  be  considered  as

quickly as possible are considered first and  some

kind of decision is made in these cases.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The Member for Bukit Panjang

has raised this matter about citizenship. It is  a

rather   delicate  and  complicated  matter.   The

granting  of  citizenship to a person  is  a  very

important  matter. Citizenship in any  country  is

not  freely  given. It confers certain rights  and

privileges on a person. In our case, it gives  him

the  right to work, to apply for a house,  to  get

places  for  his children in our schools.  It  ako

imposes  certain obligations on him to the  State.

We  do not want citizens of convenience. There are

people   who   want   Singapore  citizenship   for

obtaining travel documents. They always  rush  to

the  office  and  say that they  want  to  have  a

passport and that they want out citizenship. There

are  also  others who want citizenship  to  obtain

social  benefits  like housing, education,  public

assistance and jobs. The Registrar of Citizens has

to  process every application for citizenship very

carefully  to  determine that the applicant  not

only    possesses   the   necessary    residential

qualification,  but  also  that  he  is  of  good

character  and  is prepared to  be  loyal  to  the

Republic, and is not just a citizen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



of  convenience.  It  takes  time  to  investigate

thoroughly   each   and  every   application   for

citizenship. Therefore, the delay in many cases is

unavoidable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also rather difficult to categorise, as

the  Member  has  suggested,  because  it  is   so

difficult  to determine the urgency of each  case.

So we would rather that they take their turn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Sir, I share the same

sentiments as the Member for Bukit Panjang. In  my

"Meet the people sessions", I have 50 per cent  of

the people talking about citizenship. In his case,

he  has  got only 20 per cent of the people trying

to apply for citizenship. From all these cases we

know that most of the applicants have applied  for

more  than  one year, or sometimes more  than  two

years,  without  being granted  citizenship.  From

what  I  know,  they  really meet  the  conditions

stipulated and some members of their families  are

citizens. For instance, the applicant's father  is

a citizen whereas the mother may not be a citizen.

So   I  hope  the  Minister  can  look  into  this

situation and urge the Registry of Citizenship  to

pay  special attention to this matter. Just as the

Minister  has said, with citizenship a person  can

have  a  lot of rights. Will it not give people  a

wrong  impression because there is  an  increasing

number of citizens? If there are more citizens  in

the making, then our Government will have to spend

more money with the added burden of having to look

after  them.  So  we make use of  this  tactic  of

delaying  to  avoid this issue. Can  the  Minister

clarify  whether it is because of this that  there

is a delay in granting citizenship?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the applications

should go through a thorough investigation. But  I

would  like to know whether, in actual fact,  this

has  taken  place, because sonic  applicants  have

waited  for  so long and they have not  even  been

called  for interview. How do we know whether  any

actual  investigations have been carried out?  Can

the Minister explain?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, as I will not be moving my

amendment  No.  (6)* pertaining  to   the   same

subject,  I  would like to speak on amendment  No.

(5)+ now.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment No. (6) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be reduced by the whole sum in respect of subhead 1251.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Amendment No. (5) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1251.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quite understand and appreciate the

difficulties in obtaining citizenship as explained

by the Hon. Minister for Labour. My two colleagues

have  brought up almost identical points and  they

are  centred on the time it takes for a person  to

acquire   his  citizenship.  We  all   know   that

citizenship  is  priceless in that  it  accords  a

holder all the privileges pertaining to the  State

he  lives  in.  I  have just one little  point  in

addition  to  what  the  other  two  Members  have

brought up. I am given to understand that  when  a

person,  who  is eligible to apply  for  Singapore

citizenship,  goes r0 the Registry of  Citizenship

to make a formal application, all he is given is a

blank form and he is asked to pay a certain sum as

stamp  fee  and  told to come back much  later.  I

would suggest that before such a form is handed to

an applicant, an explanation is given to him as to

what he is expected to do with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also given to understand that there have

been cases where the officers in the Registry have

been  discourteous to the public. Of course,  here

again,  Sir,  I anticipate that the Minister  will

say,  "Will  the Member for Punggol  name  me  one

instance where such an incident happened?" I think

I  am  quite  prepared for it because  one  of  my

C.C.C, members  was involved when  he  brought  a

friend  along. It appears to me that  it  was  not

discourtesy  but the attitude of the  officers  in

the  Registry,  and  I  would  like  this  to   be

rectified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, will it be possible to minimise any

undue  delay? I shall be grateful if the Minister

will  give  details of the number of  applications

received by the Registry concerned and the  number

approved in respect of months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, my complaint against the

Registry  of Citizenship is somewhat different.  1

think  there  is or there has been  a  controversy

between  the  Registry  of  Citizenship  and   the

immigration Department. A number of applicants for

citizenship  certificates apparently are  able  to

meet   the  qualifications  laid  down   in   the

Citizership    Ordinance   such   as   residential

qualification, language test and  so  on  and  so

forth. But the applicant has received a reply from

the Registry of Citizeiship to the effect that  he

has  got  no  family roots, which means  that  the

applicant  is  a bachelor and, therefore,  is  not

entitled  to  a  citizenship certificate.  On  the

other  hand, Sir, I think you are aware that  last

Friday,  the Minister of Defence, who is  also  in

charge  on  immigration, stated that  he  is  not

going to allow young women or even women of 83  to

come  in.  But  the  applicant for  a  citizenship

certificate has his wife in China or in Hong Kong.

Apparently under the circumstances, this applicant

has to divorce his wife and get himself married to

a   local   girl  here  before  applying   for   a

citizenship  certificate because the  Immigration

Department  will  certainly refuse  to  allow  his

original wife to come into Singapore. How is  this

man  going to establish his family roots? This  is

really very absurd.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, allow me to say a few words. It is really

very   difficult   for   people   to   apply   for

citizenship.   I   do  go  to  the   Registry   of

Citizenship and ask the officials why  so  and  so

has  applied for citizenship for so long  and  the

matter  is not finalised yet. But the reply  given

is  that  it is a C.I.D. matter. Because of  this,

the  leople hate the C.I.D. The investigations  of

the  C.I.D. are entirely wrong and have  adversely

affected many people. As a result, applicants find

it  difficult  to get citizenship. So  the  people

turn  round and hate the P.A.P. Government  for  its

inefficiency. I suggest that if the C.I.D.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



is  incapable  of investigating the character  of

the  applicants, then I think it is better to hand

over  these  duties to the Citizens'  Consultative

Committee concerned so that within one  week  the

committee will be able to finish off this work of

investigation. Some people have been  waiting  for

four or five years and yet the reply given is that

the  matter  has not been investigated  yet.  This

being the case, why should the C.I.D. earn  their

living?  The  people  will only  hate  the  P.A.P.

Government.  I suggest that if the C.I.D. or  the

immigration  Department  cannot  carry  out  their

duties, then they had better hand over the  duties

to  the  Citizens'  Consultative Conimittee  which

will be able to finish off the job in less than  a

week.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, those people from the Federation of

Malaysia  who  do not have Singapore  citizenship

cannot come here to get married and cannot  pay  a

visit  to  their parents. So the members of  these

families hate the P.A.P. Government. This state of

affairs should be rectified. Facilities should  be

given  to  these  people to make periodic  visits

here,  say, two weeks or so. How can you  disallow

them  to come here? This would be creating a  very

bad   effect   and   would   be   strangling   the

Government's own neck. If people want to come here

and  get  married, you should allow  them  to  get

married.  Why  do  you  delay people's  auspicious

occasions? What state of affairs is this? You  say

the  Government is good. Wherein lies the goodness

of the Government?



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Let me deal, first of all,

with  the  complaint of the Member  for  Sembawang

that  he  is  plagued by non-citizens  during  his

"Meet  the people sessions". He has said  that  50

per cent of the people coming to see him in these

sessions  are non-citizens asking for citizenship.

I  would have thought that Members elected by  the

citizens  of  Singapore are solely responsible  to

their  electorate  and that  when  they  meet  the

people, they should spend most of their time  with

their electorate and not devote 20 per cent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



or  50 per cent of their time to non-citizens  who

do not have the vote. These people do not count at

all when the ballot boxes are opened. So I just do

not understand why Members are so excited over the

non-citizens.  Of  course, we,  as  human  beings,

sympathise  with  them but we as  elected  Members

also  have  our  duties to our citizens  who  have

elected us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

clarification. In many instances, the persons who

come  to  see us are, in fact, Singapore citizens.

Let   nie   give  an  illustration   by   way   of

amplification.  What really  happens  is  that  a

father  comes  to  see me. He  and  his  wife  are

Singapore citizens. Three of his children are also

Singapore  citizens because  they  were  born  in

Singapore.  But the fourth one is not a  Singapore

citizen because of the fortuituous circumstance in

which  he  was  born across the  Causeway.  The

father wants to know wh this fourth son cannot  be

a  Singapore  citizen, although  he  has  been  in

Singapore  ever since one nionth after his  birth.

We  must look after the interests of these  people

as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> For that matter, many of us

have  sisters, brothers and friends all  over  the

Federation  of  Malaysia and, in  fact,  all  over

South-east  Asia. Are we able to give  citizenship

to all of them? We may have a relative or a friend

in  Johore  Bahru. Must we immediately give  them

Singapore   citizenship  just  because   we   are

Singapore citizens'?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang suspects that it may

be  due  to  the  delaying  tactics  that  we  are

adopting.  But I can assure him that this  is  not

the  case,  because  the Citizenship  Registry  at

present has a very small staff. In fact, the staff

has  not been increased for the last three or four

years  in  spite  of  the  increasing  number   of

applicants. There are at present more than 159,000

noncitizens  in Singapore holding blue  identity

cards,   not  counting  those  holding  Federation

identity  cards.  You cart just imagine  how  much

tinie it will take for the staff to deal with  all

these people rushing in to get citizenship!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of rudeness in the

Citizenship  Registry raised  by  the  Member  for

Punggol,  I do not think the rtaff of the Registry

are unduly discourteous. But I suspect that it  is

because  they  have to say 'No' all the  time  and

that  when  they  do  so,  their  faces  may  look

somewhat   unpleasant  and  this  may   evoke   an

emotionally adverse reaction from the  applicant.

I do not think we can avoid that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru suggests that the

delay was due to the C.I.D. -

persuade  Members  to shorten  their  speeches  in

order  to  give  others  who  want  to  speak   an

opportunity, and in reply they say, "Three minutes

more,"  or  "Two sentences more," but they  go  on

speaking  much  longer. Last Friday,  I  faded  to

persuade  Members. I see little  point  in  trying

now.  I will let them speak until they have spoken

for 15 minutes or we reach guillotine time. I will

then  enforce Standing Orders to the  letter.  Mr

Jek.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am more

frustrated than the Members themselves because  I

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



prepared a lot of notes which I have not been able

to disclose to Members!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the point made by the Member for

Tiong Bahru. He suspects that the delay is due to

the C.I.D. I do not think so. I do not think it is

wise  to let our Citizens' Consultative Committees

handle all the citizenship investigations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the introduction of the new identity cards, many Singapore

born   citizens  have  lost  their   rights.   For

instance,  those  born  in  Singapore  after  1948

received  cards  showing that  they  were  British

subjects.  Possibly there were some who were  born

during the Japanese occupation, but their identity

cards or birth certificates were lost. When these

people  went to exchange their old identity  cards

for  new  ones, the National Registration  Office

issued  them  with blue identity cards  indicating

that  they  are  non-ciizens who have  lost  their

citizenship  rights. So I urge  the  Minister  to

look into the cases of those people who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



were   born  after  1948.  If  they  can  produce

evidence  to  prove  that  they  have  not   left

Singapore  during the last ten to  twenty  years,

they should be issued with red identity cards  so

that  they  can  obtain work  permits.  The  blue

identity cards were issued only at the beginning

of last year, it has only been one year since the

issue  of  the new identity cards. On  the  other

hand, those born in the Federation -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chow, I do not

want to cut you short now. But will you please try

to listen to Madam Chan's plea?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock:</b> Sir, I have only one or two

sentences to complete my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i>: A number of citizens who have

come  from  the Federation and stayed here  for  a

certain  period have been given work permits,  but

those who have stayed here for a longer period and

who possess blue identity cards have not been able

to get work permits. If we have already recognised

them  as permanent residents of Singapore and have

issued them with blue identity cards, we must also

let them have work permits so that they can make a

living in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The only solution for those

born  in  Singapore who hold blue  identity  cards

because they do not have birth certificates is  to

apply  for  citizenship  in  order  to  get   pink

identity  cards. I do not see any  other  possible

solution  for them, because they must  prove  that

they  were  really born in Singapore in  order  to

qualify  for  citizenship. If such  proof  is  not

available, I do not think there is any other

way  by which we can issue them with pink identity

cards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret to say that we cannot relax the

regulations regarding the issue of work permits at

the present moment. In view of the retrenchment of

workers in the British Bases, the issue of work

permits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



will be more strictly administered. I  am

afraid  I  have to say 'No' to the Member's  plea,

though very reluctantly. But this is something we

have to do to ensure the survival of our citizens.

The employment opportunities in Singapore are very

limited,  and  if we do not confine  them  to  our

citizens,  I  am  afraid Members  will  face  more

trouble during the elections.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock:</b> I beg leave to



withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that the P.A.P. Government is a

pro-labour Government and because of this it  had

received the support of the people of the  middle

and  lower income groups from 1959 to 1963. It has

issued   a  series  of  booklets  outlining   its

policies in various fields and I quote:

Government ---

Would Members like to continue with the debate  on

the  Ministry of Labour tomorrow at the  cost  of

the debate on the Industrial Arbitration Courts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are about ten minutes left

It is up to hon. Members to decide how

to share that time among themselves. So I will

not conclude the debate on the Ministry of

Labour. I will deal with the point first thing
