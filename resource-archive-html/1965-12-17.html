<div align="center"><b>SECOND CLASS HACKNEY CARRIAGE DRIVING LICENCES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister (a) if he will explain why there are only 3,213

Second  Class  Hackney Carriage Licences  issued  up  to

August  1965, as against 13,032 Hackney Carriage Driving

Licences issued up to the same month; (b) whether he  is

aware  of  hardship caused to holders  of  Second  Class

Hackney Carriage Driving Licences by this imbalance, and

(c) if he will undertake



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



to  stop issuing further Second Class Hackney  Carriage

Driving  Licences,  and increase the  number  of  Second

Class Hackney Carriage Licences.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (for the Deputy Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in July 1959 the

issue  of taxi driving licences was stopped. Four  years

later  in 1963, representations were made by taxi owners

that there was difficulty in looking for taxi drivers to

man  their  vehicles. Petitions had also been  submitted

from  members  of the public asking for a resumption  of

the  issue  of taxi driving licences. Because  of  these

petitions, a Committee was appointed by the Deputy Prime

Minister in 1963 to ascertain the correct ratio of  taxi

drivers  to the number of second class hackney carriages

(i.e., taxis).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1963, there were 3,185 motor vehicles licensed as

second class hackney carriages, i.e., as taxis. If it is

argued  that  all these vehicles were operating,  and  2

drivers  are required to operate one taxi during  a

24-hour period, then the total number of taxi drivers would

be  6,370. This simple arithmetic, however, does not fit

into  the actual requirements of the taxi business. Taxi

drivers,  like all other workers, must have  their  rest

days  in any week, and it is not always possible  for  a

taxi  driver  to  remain at the wheel  continuously  for

periods as long as 12 hours at a stretch. Therefore, the

total  number  of  persons that  would  be  required  to

operate  the  3,185 taxis is actually  higher  than  the

figure  of 6,370, and a ratio of 3 drivers to  one  taxi

would  probably  be more correct, giving allowances  for

sick  leave,  resignations, etc. This should  bring  the

figure  of  persons  holding taxi  driving  licences  to

9,555.  In  actual fact, at the end of 1963  there  were

9,841  persons holding taxi drivers' licences.  However,

the  Committee found that not all these licence  holders

were engaged in driving taxis as a full-time occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was ascertained that a great number of these

licence holders either were not engaged in driving taxis

at all, or were only engaged in driving taxis as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



a  part-time occupation. Some of these licence  holders,

according  to  the evidence submitted to the  Committee,

are   shop   assistants,  hawkers,  lorry   drivers   or

attendants, bus drivers or conductors, subordinate staff

in  commercial firms, and even Government servants. They

drive taxis whenever they can during public holidays  or

during  their off-duty hours to earn some extra  income.

There  are other licence holders who, although they  are

at the moment not engaged in driving taxis at all, renew

their licences year after year with a view to making use

of  them  in  case they lose their present jobs.  Yet  a

number of the licence holders are garage owners or motor

mechanics who require these licences to drive taxis  for

the purpose of testing the vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these various reasons, it was decided to resume

the issue of taxi driving licences but only to those who

were   unemployed  and  had  registered  at  the  Labour

Exchange. At present, l3,414 taxi driving licences have

been issued, but this figure is small in comparison with

the  total number of ordinary driing licences  which  is

368,408.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem does not lie in the number of holders of

taxi  driving  licences  but  in  the  number  of  taxis

permitted  to  ply on the roads. At present,  there  are

3,193  taxis.  The Government had in the Past  indicated

that  the number of taxis plying on the roads must  have

relationship to public demand and that the number  would

be reviewed from time to time. It is my intention now to

review the position of public transport and I shall  set

up a Committee to investigate and make recommendations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, can the Minister indicate when he intends to set up

this Committee and if he will include the Singapore Taxi

Drivers' Association on it?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): This matter will be

considered  and  even  if they  are  not  selected,  the

Committee  will still receive opinions which  they  hope

may be constructive in nature.

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRES AT JALAN PENGGAGA AND GEYLANG SERAI</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister of

Defence  (a) whether Government has any plans to improve

the  community centre at Jalan Penggaga and to construct

additional  ones in the Geylang Serai Constituency;  and

(b) when will such plans be implemented.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the community

centre  at Jalan Penggaga is housed in a building  which

is  rented from one person who is not in Singapore,  and

the  land belongs to another party. Therefore, it is not

advisable  to  spend money on structural improvement  in

these   circumstances.  Improvement  of  all   community

centres  in  other respects is continually attempted  by

way  of  recruitment of better qualified staff, training

of  staff and appointment of management committees.  The

Assemblyman  of the area is usually invited  to  be  the

adviser  of  the  management committee  and  it  is  his

responsibility,  as much as that of the  Government,  to

improve   the  amenities  and  activities  of  community

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the second part of the question, the

Government   plans  to  build  another   standard   type

community  centre  at Geylang Serai.  In  fact,  it  has

already acquired a site. But we do not have enough money

for the construction of this centre until sometime after

1966.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): 1

wish  to inquire of the Minister, since the P.A.P. came

to  power,  the  Government has been building  community

centres throughout Singapore. This is a matter of pride.

But  it  is a pity that after the P.A.P. came to  power,

there has been no project for Geylang Serai -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member has a supplementary

question to ask, he may do so. But he must not embark on

a speech. A supplementary, please.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Rahamat(In Malay): This is related to my

question.   May   I  inquire  why  the   Geylang   Serai

constituency does not have a community centre as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



other constituencies have? Is there something wrong  why

there is no community centre in Geylang Serai?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, there is one community centre.

As  I  said,  this  is in a rather ancient  building  of

wooden  structure.  The owner of  the  building  is  now

staying,  I  am  told,  in Indonesia.  The  landlord  is

somewhere else. Obviously it is a risky thing to  effect

improvements to this particular place. Geylang Serai, of

course,  is  fortunate in having at least one  community

centre. There are three other constituencies which  have

none   whatsoever,   and   the   Member   is   therefore

comparatively fortunate. After 1966, as I said,  we  can

look  forward  to having another one. He  must,  in  the

meantime, contain his soul in patience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRE AT JALAN SEMBAWANG KECHIL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister of Defence

whether  the  Government has any  plan  to  construct  a

community  centre  at Jalan Sembawang  Kechil  (formerly

known  as  Ulu Sembawang, Indian Village, 12  m.s.)  and

when such plan will be implemented.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, the Government has no

plan  to  construct  a  community centre  in  the  place

mentioned  by  the  hon. Member, as a  community  centre

already  exists some 500 yards away. There  are  already

eight   community   centres   in   the   hon.   Member's

constituency. He is, therefore, comparatively  well  off

in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to ask a supplementary question. According to

what  I  know, there is a regulation stipulated  by  the

Government  that  if  there are 200  families  they  are

entitled  to one community centre. I would like  to  ask

the  Minister  whether  he is going  to  implement  this

policy according to the regulation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am not aware of such a

regulation. I think what the hon. Member is referring to

was a statement of intention made sometime I think after

the referendum - 1962 is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



it?  - when the Government made a statement saying  that

if there are more than 200 families living in a village,

we  will  try  to  build a rural type community  centre.

Preference,  of  course, will be given  to  the  Barisan

areas  where  their  influence is strong,  so  that  the

population may be instructed in the correct way in order

that  falsehood may be confronted with truth.  For  this

reason, during 1962 and 1963, there was quite an  active

programme  of building rural community centres,  and  we

laid down as the minimum criterion that unless there are

at  least  200  families, then  we  would  not  consider

building  a  community centre. This does  not  mean,  of

course, that there must be a community centre for  every

200  families. If, in fact, we take this literally, then

we   will  have  in  Singapore  something  like  200,000

community centres.

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRE IN MOULMEIN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mrs Devan Nair</b> asked the Minister of Defence when a

community  centre can be provided for the  residents  of

the Moulmein Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The hon. Member will be pleased to

know  that  her  constituency ranks  very  high  in  the

building    programme   of   community   centres.    Her

constituency,  as  well as Anson and Cairnhill,  is  the

only  constituency  without a single  community  centre.

They  have  priority  over  other  constituencies.   The

trouble,  of course, is to get land. If the hon.  Member

can  help  the People's Association in finding  suitable

land  which is available at a reasonable price, she will

be performing a service to everybody.

<div align="center"><b>(Inadequate hospital clothing)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mrs Devan Nair</b> asked the Minister for Health if

he  is  aware  that third class patients in the  Kandang

Kerbau  Maternity  Hospital are provided  with  hospital

clothing  that is so inadequate as to improperly  expose

portions   of  their  bodies,  and  if  he   will   give

instructions that this state of affairs he  remedied  as

soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr

Speaker, I have been asked by the Minister to answer. It

is  not  true that patients in Kandang Kerbau  Maternity

Hospital are being provided with hospital clothing which

is  inadequate.  The clothing provided  for  female  `C'

Class  patients in this Maternity Hospital are  standard

type,  that is, white bajus and red sarongs, similar  to

those  for  other Government hospitals. It is  possible,

however,  that  some patients who are not accustomed  to

wearing  sarongs may inadvertently expose themselves  on

change of posture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambulant patients (i.e., those who can walk on their own) whilst on their way to and from operating theatres

or  labour  wards  are provided with kimono-type  gowns.

Patients  on  stretchers are clothed in maternity  gowns

and always covered over by a blanket.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only time where patients may expose themselves is

in  the labour ward, i.e., when patients are already  in

labour.  However, in this section, only doctors,  nurses

or midwives are present. Visitors are not allowed inside

the Labour Ward.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Devan Nair (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to ask a supplementary question.  The

Parliamentary Secretary has said that kimonos are  given

to  those in the wards after surgery. Does he know  that

some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



parts  of the kimonos have no buttons - open at the back?

Some  do  not have elastic bands. Does it not appear  to

the  Minister that the patients have to hold on  to  the

dress  with their hands where-ever there are no buttons?

Male  attendants laugh at the patients. Is the  Minister

not  aware  of this? Will he do something to remedy  the

situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I think the patients are in a

position  to  look after themselves at that stage.  They

are not entirely helpless. If the kimono has not got any

buttons - I do not know; there may well be cases where the

buttons  come off in the laundry and they have not  been

replaced. But I should imagine they will be replaced  as

soon  as  they  are discovered missing. If the  patients

will take a little bit of care, I do not think this sort

of thing will happen.

<div align="center"><b>HOLLAND ROAD MARKET</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether and when a new market will be constructed at the

5th  mile  area  in  Holland Road; or alternatively  the

present  market be renovated to serve the needs  of  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr

Speaker, the present market at Holland Road of 43 stalls

is  considered adequate for the needs of the hawkers and

residents  in this vicinity at the present  time.  As  a

result  of  recent re-siting of 76 hawkers  outside  the

market,  some market stalls have been taken up. However,

there  are  still  4 market stalls and 18  open  pitches

which are vacant. There is, therefore, no immediate need

to  build  a new market. The question of renovation  and

improvements to the present Holland Road Market could be

looked into when the need arises. There is no scheme for

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As Mr Poh

Ber Liak is absent, I would like to put the question to

the Minister for Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I am grateful to the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  for giving me this opportunity to expose  one

of  the  wrong  doings of the Communist  unions  in  the

labour  field. It is rather surprising that  the  Member

for Tampines should have originally tabled this question

regarding the so-called strike at the Hup Seng  Bee-Hoon

Factory,  for in this particular case it is he  and  his

Communist  friends, or rather the union which  is  under

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



control,  that should make a statement to the public  as

to  why  they  should not be condemned for  causing  the

unemployment of 18 workers and the closing down  of  the

factory. These workers worked in the factory premises of

Hup  Seng  and  Company in the manufacture of  bee-hoon.

Amongst them they had their own head, a man named Low Ah

Seng.  They  worked on a tonnage basis of $6 per  picul.

The   system  appeared  to  be  that  all  the   workmen

collectively participated in manufacturing the  bee-hoon

and  then  shared the earnings equally among themselves.

The  factory premises and the equipment belonged to  Hup

Seng  and  Company, and the rice for the manufacture  of

bee-boon  was supplied by the Company. The workmen  made

the  bee-hoon in their own time. They were not under the

direct  supervision of the Company. In fact,  they  were

what is normally termed "independent contractors". There

was  no  written agreement between the Company  and  the

workers.  The  Company had never paid Central  Provident

Fund contributions in respect of any of them. The C.P.F.

Board  had investigated into this matter in August  1964

and  was satisfied that the Company was not an employer.

These  arrangements had been going on for some ten years

until  September 1964, when a Communist-dominated union,

the  Singapore Commercial Houses and Factory  Employees'

Union,  came into the picture. It created a dispute  out

of  a  case where the Company was reported to have  told

one  worker  to  stop  work. There were  two  unfruitful

meetings   in  my  Ministry.  The  Company  refused   to

negotiate with the Union on the ground that the  Company

was  not  the employer. This led to a strike in  October

1964.  The Union, on the advice of their learned lawyer,

Mr  T.  T. Rajah, tried to force the case in the Labour

Court.  But  the Labour Court decided that no

employer-employee  relationship existed between the  Company  and

the  workers. This decision was later upheld by the High

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the Company was strike-bound for months. It

finally had to close down in February 1965.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case was simple. Since there was no

employer-employee  relationship  between  the  Company  and   the

workers, there could not be any industrial dispute.  The

system of production prevailing in this Company has been

existing  in Singapore for years, especially  among  the

smaller  factories. Because of the unnecessary militancy

and  the  stupidity of the Communist-dominated Singapore

Commercial  Houses  and  Factory  Employees'  Union,  18

workers lost the opportunity to earn their living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration has been given to proposals for overhead

pedestrians crossing the road at this point, but  it  is

not  likely  to  be  a measure that will  contribute  to

alleviating  the  traffic congestion. It  is  also  very

doubtful if the pedestrians will use the overhead bridge

when  they can quickly cross the very narrow stretch  of

road.  The  question whether overhead bridges should  he

constructed  at this and similar junctions in  Singapore

is  under serious study. A few overhead bridges will  be

built to test reaction and, if found inappropriate, will

be   dismantled.  One  such  overhead  bridge  has  been

proposed at this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department has been working on a

proposal  to ensure the smooth flow of traffic  at  this

junction  by  widening that stretch of  Upper  Serangoon

Road  between Paya Lebar Road and Yio Chu Kang  Road  to

partly  to Upper Serangoon Road towards Paya Lebar  Road

to  meet  that  road near the Singapore Telephone  Board

commencement  and  termination  of  school  hours,   and

whether  the Government has any plan to widen that  road

to eliminate the traffic congestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that there is

traffic congestion at Tanjong Katong Road during  school

hours.  This congestion is aggravated to some extent  by

cars  which stop to let down or pick up school children.

This problem has been looked into and it is proposed  to

widen  the actual roadway in order to provide  a  lay-by

lane  for  cars  bringing school children  to  and  from

school.  The  road will be widened by  six  feet  for  a

length  of  more than 1,000 feet at the  cost  of  about

$7,500. This proposal will be submitted to the Urban and

Rural   Services   Consultative   Committee   for    its

consideration  and approval, and as soon  as  funds  are

made available, the work will be carried out.

was  a  12-inch sewer built in 1938 up to the  Singapore

Swimming Club only. In 1964 plans were drawn up  by  the

Public Works Department for the extension of this  sewer

up to Rhu Cross. The estimated cost of this extension is

about  half  a million dollars. This is a large  sum  of

money relative to the number of people that will benefit

from the project. There are many areas in Singapore with

denser  populations and more urgent needs, and  so  this

project has to be given low priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working drawings are ready and it is hoped that

funds  will he available within the next five  years  to

proceed with this project. But I would like to point out

to   the  hon.  Member  for  Mountbatten  that  all  the

factories  and  many private houses in  that  area  have

their own septic tanks and only about 60 premises depend

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> At the close of yesterday's sitting, the

Minister for Foreign Affairs was addressing the House.

Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  yesterday I indicated  why  it  was

necessary  for us to stick to a policy of non-alignment,

because   to  be  aligned  to  any  big  country   would

eventually have meant the loss of our freedom of  action

even in domestic fields, because foreign policies are in

fact   an  extension  of  domestic  policies  into   the

international field. And therefore I said that  was  why

we refused to join any anti-Communist crusade because we

are non-Communist. We are socialists at home because  we

believe that the non-Communist policy is the best way of

dealing  with  our  domestic  problems,  including   the

Communist  problem  in  Singapore.  We  cannot  be

non-Communist at home and anti-Communist abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason we have resisted demands that we

should  align  ourselves with the Communist  bloc.  This

demand  has in fact come from the Barisan Sosialis  for,

when  all  their verbal disguise is removed,  what  they

really  want us to do is that we should align  ourselves

with  one  of  the  Communist blocs.  This  was  clearly

revealed  in  the  foreign  policy  motion  which   they

originally  submitted for our consideration last  August

when,  as a test of the genuineness of our independence,

they  specified  the  countries  with  which  we  should

immediately establish diplomatic relations.  There  were

only  two countries, Peking and Jakarta. Since then they

have  amended  this  motion,  but  I  do  not  wish   to

anticipate the debate to which we are looking forward in

the coming days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us then, non-alignment means avoiding

entanglements  in what are essentially  power  conflicts

even  though these conflicts may be wrapped up  in  such

highly moral terms as the struggle for a free world, for

the liberation of oppressed people as a struggle against

Communism,  capitalism, neo-colonialism  and  what  have

you.  We are intelligent and hard-headed enough to  know

that  these fine slogans are merely cloaks to cover  big

power  national  interests, and  these  are  not  always

identical  with ours. To align ourselves  with  any  one

power bloc is to add to its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



potential  strength. And having regard to the  strategic

value  of Singapore, we will he adding decisive strength

to one side. This, far from contributing to stability in

this area, will do just the opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this, 1 think it is in the real

interests  of  the  big powers themselves  to  see  that

Singapore  is non-aligned. If the big powers are  really

interested  in  averting a major conflict in  South-East

Asia,  they  should  accept and ensure  the  non-aligned

status   of  Singapore.  Since  Singapore  is  genuinely

convinced  that a non-aligned policy is the correct  one

for itself and for the peace of South-East Asia, a major

power  need  not  fear  that the strategic  position  of

Singapore would he exploited to its disadvantage by  one

of its rivals. Our policy will be to ensure, to the best

of  our ability, that Singapore remains the still centre

in the power storm raging in South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, non-alignment does not mean indifference on

our  part  to the real issues of peace and war  in  this

region  or even feigning blindness as to what  is  right

and  wrong.  A  non-aligned policy, in  fact,  gives  us

greater  freedom to make pronouncements or adopt  stands

purely  on  the  merits,  as we see  them,  of  specific

international issues. An aligned position on  the  other

hand obliges us automatically to take the stand that our

major  and  more  powerful ally takes on  any  important

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inevitable that Singapore's stand in specific

international  issues  will  he  coloured   heavily   by

national  interests. The promotion of national interests

is  the  essence of the foreign policy of all countries,

big  and  small. Only a country aligned to a big  power,

whether  as a colony or as an ally, may he compelled  to

sacrifice  its  national interests where these  conflict

with those of its major partner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the pursuit of national interests cannot be

absolute   in  a  world  where  the  fact  of   national

independence has to he balanced against the reality of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



interdependence between nations. Even big  and  powerful

countries  like the United States and the  Soviet  Union

cultivate  allies and friends in order to safeguard  and

promote   what   they  believe  to  he  their   national

interests. Interdependence implies give and take between

the  partners involved. Interdependence cannot therefore

be  on  the  basis of unrestrained pursuit  of  national

interests  without regard to the national  interests  of

one's  partners and friends. There will arise  occasions

when  we may have to make some sacrifice of our national

interests  for  the long-term interests of  the  nation.

This  need  not give rise to insurmountable difficulties

if  there  is  broad  coincidence of views  between  the

partners as to their ultimate national interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, our ultimate national

interests  are the preservation of the essential  values

on   which  our  society  is  founded.  We  believe   in

democracy. We believe in the establishment of  a

multi-racial  non-communal society. As Socialists, we  believe

in  the  eradication of poverty, ignorance, disease  and

other forms of economic and social injustice. We believe

in  "a more just and more equal society", a slogan which

does   not   always  give  reassurance  to  some   other

countries.  We  believe in peace between nations  simply

because we have nothing to gain by war and, in any case,

we have not the capacity or the resources to make war on

others We covet no people's territory. We have no desire

to  save  other peoples by interfering in their affairs.

They must save themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the elements which constitute our

national  interests, out of which our national interests

are compounded. These, I submit, in no way conflict with

the   national   interests  of  those  countries   which

genuinely want to live in peace with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If other countries understand that these constitute

our  national  interests and that  the  preservation  of

these  are  the  only objectives of our foreign  policy,

then they will put a kinder construction on many of  the

things that we do, including the existence of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



British  base in Singapore, unlike the Barisan  Sosialis

who put a different construction on the existence of our

base. In the light of what I have said so far and in the

light  of  what  are our true national  objectives,  the

bases  are  here  not for any aggressive or  imperialist

purposes   but   for  the  defence  of   Singapore   and

Singapore's national interests. We are realistic  enough

to  recognise the limits to our capacity to be  able  to

defend ourselves against external threats. We shall,  of

course,  build  our own defence forces  to  the  fullest

extent we are capable of. But what we are interested  in

is  the  defence of Singapore in the context of a  major

conflict   in   regard  to  major  and   more   powerful

neighbours. We are in no position to build or finance an

army  capable  of defending Singapore in a  conflict  of

this kind. Even big powers with far greater resources of

money, men and material plan their defence on the  basis

of  friends and allies. That goes for the Soviet  Union.

That  goes even for the United States. So it  is  sheer

madness  for  certain  people  in  Singapore,  like  the

Barisan  Sosialis, to advocate that Singapore should  be

self-sufficient  in regard to defence. But  the  Barisan

Sosialis know that self-sufficiency in defence is merely

another  way of leaving Singapore defenceless, and  that

is what they really want. They know that their prospects

of   capturing  power  by  constitutional  and  even  by

unconstitutional  means  are pretty  dim  in  Singapore.

Therefore, their only hope of seizing power  is  by  the

arrival  of  rescue  parties from outside  Singapore.  A

defenceless Singapore is therefore their dream and  hope

and  the objective of their foreign policy. Getting  rid

of British bases, they well know, does not mean no bases

at  all  in Singapore. Even if the British were to  quit

the   base,  the  strategic  value  of  Singapore  still

remains. Many countries outside of Singapore know  this.

What is likely to happen if the British were to pull out

is  that  there  will be a scramble by other  militarily

more powerful countries to get control over the base  in

Singapore.  In  such  a scramble  of  elephants,  it  is

Singapore  which  is  going to  be  trampled  to  death.

Because of this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



we  would  like the British base to be here  until  such

time  as  we  can  find other more  effective  and  more

practical  ways of ensuring our defence. For one  thing,

the  British base is already here and it has  been  here

for  decades.  So there is no question of  any  scramble

starting for possession to control the base, which there

must  be  if  the British were to quit it. However,  now

that  Singapore is a sovereign and independent  country,

we  can  take  steps  to  make it  clear  to  those  who

genuinely fear that the base is an imperialist base  and

that  it  is  a base for aggression against  them,  that

their  fears  are  unfounded. We have  no  intention  of

allowing the base to be used for aggressive or so-called

neo-colonialist ends, simply because it is  not  in  our

national  interest  to  encourage  aggression  or

neo-colonialism. This assurance is a firm one and it can  be

an  effective one. Because, as you know, Sir,  the  base

cannot  in a sovereign country be effectively  used  for

purposes which the Singapore Government believes  to  be

against  the national interest. We all know that without

the  goodwill  and  support of  the  government  of  the

country  in which the base is, a modern base  cannot  be

operated  effectively, if at all it can be operated.  Of

course, those who have designs of their own on Singapore

will  persist  in  believing that the  base  is  a

neo-colonialist  threat.  There is  nothing  we  can  do  to

persuade them otherwise except not to be needled by such

charges  into abandoning such arrangement  as  we  think

necessary for our defence for our national interest. Our

responsibility is not to any outside country but to  the

two  million people who have entrusted their welfare and

safety  to  us, and we will ensure their safety  by  the

most  practical  and most effective means  we  think  is

necessary to secure their defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been independent for just under five

months and our foreign policy, though still rough  about

the edges, has won regard as well as friends for us. The

essential thing is that we have not been isolated as the

local  Communists and others who are not Communists  had

hoped we would be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



There  are  people,  Communists and non-Communists,  who

thought  that  Singapore, by  the  manner  in  which  it

achieved   independence,  by  openly   proclaiming   its

intentions  that the base would remain, would  never  be

accepted  by  the  Afro-Asian  countries  as   a   truly

sovereign  and independent country. Sir, though  we  are

new  to  foreign  policy,  it  is  the  measure  of  the

effectiveness of our foreign policy that  we  have  been

accepted as a sovereign independent country despite  the

British  bases  by  nonaligned countries,  and  even  by

Communist  countries.  Therefore,  it  is  not   a   bad

beginning for our foreign policy. It only underlines the

effectiveness of our foreign policy. We have made a good

start.  We  have made a start in the right direction  by

adhering  to  a  non-aligned  policy.  The  process   of

consolidating the friendly relations we have established

with foreign countries will take time and money. It  may

not  be feasible to establish missions in every friendly

country because we cannot mobilise the personnel and the

money  to  do  this. So friendly contacts  with  foreign

countries will have to be maintaned and consolidated, in

some  cases,  by  establishing  overseas  missions.   In

others,  by  official visits and,  for  the  most  part,

because there are 116 nations, by working together  with

all countries in the United Nations to help build a more

peaceful and more prosperous world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is our intention first to establish

missions   in   some  ten  countries.   These   are   in

alphabetical  order: Australia, Burma, Cambodia,  India,

Japan,  New  Zealand, Thailand, the U.A.R.,  the  United

States and the United Kingdom. These will be, as I said,

the first of our overseas missions and we hope to set up

most,  if  not  all, of them during the  course  of  the

coming year. They will of necessity be initially  on  an

austerity basis. There may be some countries where there

will  he  just  the  Ambassador  and  nobody  else.  But

whatever it is, we have to make a start, and this  is  a

start.  With  some  of  these countries,  we  have  very

substantial and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



close   trade   relations.  With  others,  identity   of

political  interest and aims counts for more than  trade

interests.  And  with  the  rest,  trade  and  political

interests happen to be equally important. These are,  as

I  said,  Sir,  the first of our overseas  missions.  We

shall  set up others when we can find the personnel  and

the  money  or  when political and trade  considerations

justify  their  being set up earlier. The  promotion  of

trade with as many countries as possible will he a major

objective of foreign policy I should like to state  here

that  ideological differences will not be made  barriers

to  trade  between  us  and other  countries.  The  only

criterion  for  trade  is  whether  trade  with  another

country  is in our economic interest, because  promotion

of  our  economic interest is promotion of our  national

interest.  There  may,  of  course,  be  occasions  when

economic   interests  may  have  to  be  sacrificed   to

safeguard  some important political interests the  total

ban  on trade with Rhodesia recently is a case in point.

But,  generally  speaking, ideological differences  will

not  he made obstacles to trade, i.e., legitimate trade.

We  shall take care to see that trade does not become  a

cover  for  political  manipulations,  interference   or

attempts to control us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of trade brings us to the most important

aspect  of  our  foreign  policy,  our  relations   with

Malaysia.  I  have  kept this to the  last  because  our

relationship  with  Malaysia is of  a  special  kind.  I

confess, Mr Speaker, that I find it difficult to keep a

straight face in talking about a foreign policy  towards

Malaysia.  There  is  something  unreal  and  odd  about

lumping   our  relations  with  Malaysia  under  foreign

relations. But then some rather odd things do happen  in

the  history of peoples and countries. All that  we  can

then do is to accept the oddity as something not of  our

making  and  try  to make the best of an odd  situation.

Because  the situation is odd., we should be  more  than

usually  careful  to  devise  rational  and  intelligent

policies  in  regard to Malaysia. In  theory,  i.e.,  in

regard to the Constitution, the relationship between  us

and Malaysia comes under the category of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



foreign  relations.  So we set up a High  Commission  as

part  of  the necessary formalities between two  foreign

countries, and the machinery functioned efficiently when

on  occasions the two Commissions had to exchange formal

diplomatic protest notes. However, constitutional  forms

are  one thing and the hard facts of history, geography,

economics and demography are another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these latter factors underline not the

separateness or foreignness of the two territories,  but

the  oneness of the people in the two countries.  People

on  both sides of the Causeway have not since 9th August

even begun to treat one another as foreigners. And I  do

not think they ever will. This is a hard fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may be permitted a personal note. I have my

parents  and a brother in Malaysia. Though I have  tried

very  hard  to  keep  up  with  the  appropriate  spirit

demanded  by the Constitution, I could not bring  myself

to  regard them as foreigners. I am quite sure this goes

for  hundreds of thousands like me on both sides of  the

Causeway. So one cannot talk of a foreign policy towards

Malaysia  in  the same sense as we would  in  regard  to

other  countries.  It  must be a  foreign  policy  of  a

special kind, a foreign policy towards a country  which,

though constitutionally foreign, is essentially one with

us and which, when logic and sanity reassert themselves,

must  once more become one. It must be a foreign  policy

based on the realisation that Singapore and Malaysia are

really  two arms of one politically organic whole,  each

of  which  has,  through a constitutional  proclamation,

been  declared separate and independent. True a Minister

in Malaysia not so long ago did say that on 9th August a

diseased  arm was cut off. I do not think that  anything

was  cut  off,  in  fact, fortunately  for  us.  I  say,

fortunately,  because if one of the arms is  really  cut

off,  it  must result in the whole organism bleeding  to

death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foreign policy is based on an awareness of not so

much the constitutional fact as the fact of what is real

-  the  reality of the thing. The survival and

well-being of Malaysia is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



essential  to  Singapore's  survival.  Conversely,   the

survival  and  well-being of Singapore is  essential  to

Malaysia's survival. We should not, however, confuse the

survival of the peoples in the two territories with  the

survival  of governments and political parties,  because

political  parties and governments come and go,  as  the

mood  and  aspirations  of peoples  change  and  as  the

political environment changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this broader background in mind, we in Singapore

have  to  accept the fact that we and Malaysia  are  two

sovereign States compelled to move, by different routes,

towards  the  ultimate destiny of  one  people  and  one

country.  We have chosen our route towards this ultimate

destiny even if we have to do so, now, as an independent

and sovereign State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one way, Sir, this may not be a bad thing because

we have the freedom now to choose our route towards this

ultimate and inevitable goal. We live the way we want to

live,  the  most effective way. I believe, Sir,  victory

goes  to  the one who chooses the route and successfully

reaches the goal set for it by destiny. When we were  in

Malaysia, we chose the route of a Malaysian Malaysia  as

our  objective,  and that resulted in many  difficulties

and ultimately in our receiving a quit order or else. We

were  told  never to darken Malaysia's  door,  and  they

exhorted us to set up house on our own elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, so be it. We are now an independent State. True

it is no longer within our power to help in the building

of  a Malaysian Malaysia. But it is within our power and

within our rights to build what I would call a Malaysian

Singapore - not a Singaporean Singapore but  a  Malaysian

Singapore. The essence of a Malaysian Malaysia was  that

it   was  possible  to  build  a  just,  prosperous  and

progressive nation in a multi-racial society only on the

basis  of  a  non-communal and a non-racial approach  in

policies  and  in economics. When we were  in  Malaysia,

this  thesis  was  rejected as not only impractical  but

also dangerous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So since 9th August we have had the opportunity and

the freedom to show in Singapore that such a society for

which  we struggled in Malaysia can be made to  work  in

Singapore;  that a multi-racial society founded  on  the

concepts  of  democracy, social equality  and  socialist

concepts of economic and social justice is the only safe

and  practical  way  of building  a  united  nation,  of

building a nation out of many races, and of solving  the

economic and social problems of peoples of all races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the time being, all we ask of our neighbour in

Malaysia  is  that having insisted that we should  be  a

sovereign  State, they should treat us  as  a  sovereign

State  and  allow us the rights and privileges  that  go

with  sovereignty, because we concede to them the  right

to  behave like a sovereign State. We are resentful when

they  behave towards us as though Singapore is  still  a

State within Malaysia. And Malaysia can be assured  that

we  will  not use our sovereignty in such a  way  as  to

jeopardise their interests - their genuine and  ultimate

interests - because we are well aware that we have  a

vital  stake in the well-being and security of Malaysia.

We  cannot  do them in because eventually  we  would  he

doing ourselves in. Malaysia is for us a sovereign State

but not a foreign country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall always bear this in mind in our relations

with  them.  All we ask is that they should  reciprocate

this attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall have more to say about the particular

aspects of our foreign policy when we come to debate the

Barisan Sosialis' amended motion on foreign policy. I do

not  wish  to anticipate the motion or their  return  to

this  Chamber. All I wish to point out now is  that  the

course of a foreign policy is never smooth. It is  never

a  straight  line  between two  points.  There  must  he

changes,  of  course,  as  the  international  landscape

changes. The fact that the Barisan Sosialis had to amend

their  motion  within  a period of  a  few  months  only

underlines my point that the world, and particularly our

part of the world,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



is  changing  rapidly,  and a  foreign  policy  must  be

flexible enough to meet these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragic weakness of the Barisan Sosialis - that is,

tragic for them but good for us - is that the more  the

world changes the more they remain the same old hunch of

tenderfoot Marxists.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Devan Nair</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, with

regard  to  the Motion of Thanks to the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  for  his  Address, I wish first  to  express  my

thanks for being granted this opportunity to participate

in this debate. The policy speech of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara is giving confidence and hope to everyone.  I  am

also  pleased with that speech. At this juncture, I wish

to give some of my views to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all our citizens should be given

adequate  employment opportunities. That  is  our  basic

task.  The employment exchange is not functioning  well.

That is what I have gathered. There are some people  who

have  registered with the employment exchange  for  many

years,  but  they  have not been able to  get  any  job.

However, those who have newly registered have been  able

to  get  jobs. I hope the Minister for Labour will  look

into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our nation has four official

languages. All of them have the same official status. It

is  remarkable and praiseworthy that all of them  should

be  given  equal status. We do not have  the  policy  of

having one language, one religion and one race. We  have

quite  clearly declared our policy. Democrats  who  have

the  interest of the people at heart should accept  this

objective.  This policy of multi-lingualism is  accepted

with much pleasure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture when we are practising multi-lingualism in our society, I should mention one

important  matter. There have been some defects  in  the

working out of this system. The Tamil language is  being

very  adversely affected. It is my duty  to  point  this

out. Notice boards at Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



offices are written in all the four languages. But there

are  too  many errors in the Tamil language version.  In

some  places there are only three languages.  Tamil  has

been  omitted. In some Ministries there are  not  enough

officers  in certain departments for the Tamil  section.

Therefore, the sections do not function well. I hope the

departments concerned will take adequate steps to remedy

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamil is used in the Tamil secondary schools. However,

there  are  no opportunities for these students  in  the

secondary schools to continue with their education. They

have  no  means  to continue with their  education  even

though  they may have the desire to do so. Opportunities

and   facilities  should  be  made  available  for  such

students.  I  feel there is a shortage  of  teachers.  I

appreciate that. There is the Teachers' Training College

to  train  teachers. Even though there are Tamil-trained

men  in  the  College,  not enough graduates  are  being

produced. I feel that immediate steps should be taken to

rectify  this situation. Those who have passed well  and

with  credit  in the secondary schools should  be  given

bursaries.  They  should be sent  to  India  for  higher

education.  On  their return in a few years'  time,  the

pressing  shortage  of  trained  staff  will  be  eased.

Meanwhile,  officers on contract could be  brought  from

India.  They  can be appointed for teaching appointments

at  the  Teachers' Training College. In this connection,

the Ministry of Education should take adequate steps  to

implement this proposal. I would request them to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy of the Government to

protect   the  interests  of  the  minorities  is   most

gratifying. The minorities will have full confidence  in

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to point out one fact. In any

democratic  society  Opposition  Members  should  always

bring  up  any  points on which they disagree,  in  this

House. They may even walk out if they wish to do so. But

our  Barisan Opposition Members have chosen  to  boycott

this  Session altogether. This shows that they  have  no

faith in the democratic system. At the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



same  time, they must realise why they have been elected

by  the people. They have forgotten the duty which  they

owe to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to associate myself with the Motion of Thanks

to the Speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as you are well aware,

ten years have elapsed since the publication of the last

edition of the laws of Singapore. During the latter part

of   this  period  Singapore  became  a  State  of   the

Federation of Malaysia, as a result of which many of our

laws  were either amended or repealed, and many  Federal

laws were extended here. On the 9th of August this year.

Singapore became separate from Malaysia, and though  the

Separation  Agreement makes provision  for  all  present

laws  in Singapore in force immediately before Singapore

Day to continue to have effect according to their tenor,

some of these laws will now have to be changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publication of the new edition of our laws at the

earliest  possible  moment has now become  a  matter  of

necessity  and  some urgency. The work of reviewing  all

existing  legislation  with the object  of  making  such

modifications  as are necessary to bring the  laws  into

conformity  with  Singapore's status as  an  independent

Republic,  as  well as fusing amending legislation  with

principal   legislation,   would   constitute   a   real

contribution to those who have to find their  way  about

our  laws.  To read the law as it is at present  is  now

often  a  tiresome task, involving references to several

books or documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government, therefore, intend

shortly to introduce in Parliament a Bill to provide for

the  appointment of a Law Revision Commission whose task

will be to prepare and publish a Revised Edition of  our

laws.  This will afford us an opportunity to take  stock

of our legislation by briefly surveying our laws as they

existed  from  the days of the Straits  Settlements  and

through the period when Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



formed  part  of  Malaysia to the present  day  with  an

indication of law revision plans for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government of the Straits Settlements Act,

1866, was brought into force in 1867 by an Order of  the

Queen-in-Council, certain islands and territories  which

were  previously  under the East India  Company  jointly

became   a   separate  colony  known  as   the   Straits

Settlements.  The  first  meeting  of  the   Legislative

Council was held on the 1st of April, 1867, when certain

laws  were passed. And in the following year was enacted

the  interpretation (Amendment) Ordinance,  1868,  which

provides  that  the legislation of the Colony  shall  be

called  Ordinances. The Ordinances of  the  Colony  were

reprinted by Government in two volumes in 1886 and again

in  1898. In 1910 a thorough revision of the whole  body

of  written law was begun, and a Commission appointed to

prepare a new and revised edition of the Statute Laws of

the  Colony.  The  new edition, which was  published  in

1920, dealt with all legislation from 1835 to the end of

1919 exclusive of war and emergency legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Revision of the laws of the Colony was

published  in 1926 and contained the law's  enforced  on

the 31st of December, 1925. The Third Revision, the 1936

Edition, was prepared under the authority of the Revised

Edition  of the Laws Ordinance, 1935, and contained  the

Ordinances  amended to 31st December, 1935. The  current

edition  of the laws of Singapore, which run into  eight

volumes, was brought into force from the 1st July, 1956,

and  annual supplements for the years 1956 to 1962  were

subsequently  issued. This then, Mr  Speaker,  was  the

position prior to Malaysia Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could have been said that whilst the laws were not

available in one set of volumes, they could at least  be

ascertained   with   reasonable  diligence   and   care.

Unfortunately, with the coming of Malaysia, the position

was  worsened and it has become more and more  difficult

to   ascertain   the  law  through  the   multitude   of

Modification Orders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



issued  mainly  in Kuala Lumpur, but also in  Singapore,

and  the various amending Acts and Ordinances that  have

been enacted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysia Act, as well as the Constitution of the

State  of Singapore, provided for the continuity of  all

laws  which  were in force or which had been passed  but

not  brought into force before Malaysia Day.  After  the

establishment of Malaysia on 16th September, 1963,  laws

which  could not be enacted by the Singapore Legislative

Assembly in so far as they were laws which could not  be

passed after Malaysia Day by the State Legislature, were

treated  as Federal laws by virtue of the provisions  of

section   73   of   the  Malaysia  Act.  The   Malaysian

Government, acting under powers given under  section  74

of  the  Malaysia  Act,  made  amendments  by  means  of

Modification Orders to such of the laws of Singapore  as

were  treated as Federal laws. In the same manner,  laws

which  before the 16th September. 1963, had  application

only  to the States of Malaya were extended to apply  to

Singapore  with or without amendments. Certain Singapore

law's  which  were  treated as Federal  laws  were  also

repealed by such Modification Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government, in exercise of powers under

Article  105  of  the  Constitution  of  the  State   of

Singapore,   made  consequential  amendments   to   such

Singapore  laws as were treated as State laws  to  bring

them  into  conformity  with  Singapore's  status  as  a

component part of the Federation of Malaysia.  The  laws

enacted  by  the  Malaysian Parliament  up  to  the  8th

August.  1965, which had application to Singapore,  also

form part of the laws of Singapore at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the result of all these changes and

manipulations is that our laws are by no means as  clear

or  as  easily ascertainable as they should  be.  It  is

inevitable that mistakes are being made not only by  the

administration  but  even by trained  lawyers;  and  the

layman  has  every reason to complain that  the  law  is

veritably an ass. In these circumstances, it will be one

of the major tasks of my Ministry and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



of  the  State Advocate-General's Department to  try  to

bring some order, coherence, and certainty to our laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic of Singapore Independence Bill provides

that  all existing laws shall continue in force on  and

after  Singapore Day, and that they shall be  construed

as  from that day with such modifications, adaptations,

qualifications, and exceptions as may be  necessary  to

bring  them into conformity with the Act and  with  the

independence  status of Singapore upon separation  from Malaysia.  The  Bill also provides that  the  President

may,  by Order made any time during the period of three

years  after  the  Act  comes  into  force,  make  such

modifications  in  any written  law  as  appear  to  he

necessary  or expedient as a result of the  passing  of

the  Act  and  in  consequence of the  independence  of

Singapore upon separation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "modification" in this context includes

amendments, adaptations and repeals, and in relation  to

any  law  of Malaysia or of the United Kingdom  for  the

time  being  in  force in Singapore, includes  power  to

declare that such law shall cease to apply to Singapore.

In  anticipation of the enactment of this provision, the

State  Advocate-General has already commenced  preparing

Modification Orders to restore the laws to the  position

in which they were before Malaysia. These Orders cannot,

of  course,  be  published until after the  Independence

Bill has been enacted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to facilitate the reading

of  the laws modified during the Malaysian period and in

consequence  of our Independence Act, it is proposed  to

publish reprints of such laws incorporating not only all

such  modifications but also all amendments made to them

whether before during, or after the Malaysia period,  so

that  any  reprinted  legislation  may  be  read  as   a

connected  whole without reference to several  books  or

documents.  The  Interpretation Bill provides  for  such

reprints, and many of these reprints will form the basis

of  the  next Revised Edition of the laws of  Singapore,

provision for the preparation and publication  of  which

will be made in the Revised Edition of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



the  Law's  Bill. The need for a new Revised Edition  is

apparent even if for no reason other than that a  decade

has passed since the publication of the last edition  of

the   laws   of   Singapore   during   which   momentous

constitutional changes have taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the State Advocate-General and I ate

mindful  of  the task of providing the Bench,  the  Bar.

Government  offices, and  the  public  generally   with

readily  available  laws in a connected  readable  whole

with  the  inclusion therein of all the  amendments  and

modifications made to-date. It is for this reason,  Sir,

that  the  publication of every Modification Order  made

under  the  Republic of Singapore Act is to be  followed

shortly,  after  by  a  reprint of  the  legislation  in

question.  These reprints will form the prelude  to  the

Revised  Edition  of  the laws,  and  when  the  Revised

Edition  is  completed.  Singapore  will  have  a

self-contained consolidated compendium of all statutes. It is

the  Government's intention, as stated in the speech  of

His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, to set up  a

Constitutional  Commission to  consider  the  safeguards

which  should be inserted in the Constitution to protect

the  rights of minorities and to ensure that the  rights

of  all citizens shall be equal not only in law but also

in   practice.   Pending  the  deliberations   and   the

conclusions  of  this Constitutional Commission,  it  is

proposed  that  the  provisions of the  Constitution  of

Singapore  and  of  the  Malaysian  Constitution   shall

continue   to  apply  in  Singapore  subject   to   such

modifications,   omissions,  and   amendments   as   are

necessitated by the independent status of Singapore  and

its  ceasing  to  be a part of Malaysia. The  amendments

which the Government considers immediately necessary are

contained in the Constitution (Amendment ) Bill  and  in

the   Republic  of  Singapore  Independence  Bill.  And

further  formal amendments will be made by  Modification

Orders.   After   the   Report  of  the   Constitutional

Commission  has  been  received  and  considered,  those

provisions  which have been accepted by  the  Government

will become part of the Constitution.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am standing here to express my sincere

thanks to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for

his fine delivery of our policy Speech in the first

Session of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country is standing up in the turbulence of

South-East  Asia as an independent nation fully fortified

with the  determination to survive. As an independent  nation

in  the world, we are laced with some common problems in

life,  and  one of the problems is that we must  try  to

solve  our economic problem which represents two schools

of political philosophy. Mr Speaker, whether our people

will  have any well-being economically, can well he seen

from the non-Communist democratic socialist policies  of

the  Government.  The experience in  implementing  these

policies  is that the well-being of the people must  not

he sacrificed on the altar of a totalitarian government.

That  means their personal freedom and political freedom

must  not  he  sacrificed. In fact, whether politica1ly,

culturally or religiously, the people must be allowed to

progress in all respects. This means that the future  of

the  people  must of necessity depend on the  manner  in

which the people try to solve their economic problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to crave your indulgence to

speak  with  some  certainty that  in  an  ever-changing

developing     country    and    society,     obstinacy,

totalitarianism  and feudalism are  some  factors  which

will  arrest the progress of our society and will hinder

our endeavour to solve our own economic problems. So the

manner  in  which we try to solve our economic problems,

in  fact, is a reflection of the soundness of bankruptcy

of  our political and economic system. Talking about the

concrete contents of our political ideology, we can  see

very  clearly what kind of political line we are  taking

through our foreign policy and political contentions. On

the  other hand, we can also see our own political stand

from  the reflection and reception given to our  foreign

policy. These facts are very concrete and I believe many

of us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



have  already  been acquainted with them and  I  do  not

therefore wish to spend any more time in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, please allow me to speak as a

representative  of the people and, in this  capacity.  I

would  like to speak with some clarity and frankness  on

our economic future. I hope that by so doing I shall  he

able to correct the erroneous attitude and ideas of some

of  the  obscurantists in their attempt  to  hinder  our

economic  progress. I do not wish to spend the  time  of

this I louse in trying to recall the dramatic experience

that  we had in achieving independence. But I would like

to say that ever since we were forced to leave Malaysia,

there  have  been  some  feudalistic  rulers  who   have

harboured   the   intention  to  hinder   our   economic

development. They are of the opinion that  by  so  doing

they   will  he  able  to  make  it  difficult  or  even

impossible  for  Singapore to survive as an  independent

nation.  There are several reasons for them  to  harbour

this  idea. Firstly, they think that without  a  densely

populated market, Singapore would not be able to  strive

economically. As a matter of fact, we do not think  that

our  economic foundation depends on whether  we  have  a

densely  populated market or not. This fact of a densely

populated   market  is  not  the  important  factor   to

determine our economic progress and prosperity.  We  can

see  that  China  and India are very densely  populated.

They are, in fact, a densely populated market. But these

countries  do not enjoy a very high standard of  living.

What  is more important is that the mere existence of  a

densely  populated market is not the determining  factor

to  provide us with any economic prosperity. What is the

determining factor then? Let me tell you. Mr  Speaker,

it is the purchasing power of the people that counts.  I

would  therefore  warn  those  ultras  and  shortsighted

people that although the people of Singapore are without

natural resources or perhaps without a densely populated

market,  they have a higher purchasing power.  In  fact,

our  own  population can be considered a kind of natural

resources. These are the important factors by  which  we

may achieve prosperity and progress.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation is to be the base of our economic

progress. This, in fact, is a very important factor. But

that is not enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also have a very enlightened economic policy.

I  believe that with a very enlightened economic policy,

we  shall  be able to make progress with our  programme.

The   maintenance  of  a  good  labour  and   management

relationship  is very important too. We  must  also  see

that   the   purchasing  power  of  our   workers,   our

businessmen  and the whole society in general,  must  be

maintained.  In  this respect, I would like  to  mention

some  aspects  dealt with in the policy  Speech  of  His

Excellency.  We must make our goods competitive  in  the

international  market. Our prices  must  be  competitive

enough  to  enable  us  to  capture  some  part  of  the

international  market  to  provide  an  outlet  for  our

manufactured goods. This, of course, will depend on  the

political  consciousness as well as the  discipline  and

efficiency  of  our  workers.  They  should  have   high

efficiency  and effectiveness in their work. Given  this

effectiveness  and efficiency, I am sure they  will  put

forward  their  best effort so as to implement  what  is

being stated in the policy Speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main factor of our industrialisation is a big

consumer  market. Apart from this, we should  also  have

two  prerequisites. As stated in the policy  Speech,  we

must  establish  trade relations with all  countries  in

order  to  get a share of the international market.  The

only  correct policy in our trade relations is  that  we

want  trade, not aid. Internally, people from all  walks

of  life  should make a concerted effort to  ensure  the

success of our industrialisation and to take active  and

positive  part in all economic activities.  In  view  of

this,  I  am confident that in our economic development,

we  will  be  able  to bring about a better  and  higher

living  standard  for our people. This  is  not  a  mere

slogan.  I would like to make an earnest appeal  to  our

people  here  in  order to ensure our  independence  and

survival.   Our   entrepreneurs  should   have   a   new

understanding of their role. Mr Speaker, Sir, allow  me

to say that the entrepreneurs should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



not  be concerned with their own interests and their own

dividends only. They should also be concerned  with  the

overall interests of the whole society. They should  not

be  concerned with their market and the curve  of  their

production. They should take a similar interest  in  the

overall interest of our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the economic development problem, I am glad to note

that  certain  leaders in Malaysia  have  realised  that

closer economic relations between Singapore and Malaysia

is  a  necessity.  If  I  am allowed  to  quote  certain

statements made by the Malaysian leaders, 1 think I  can

make  clear  what I am going to say about  the  economic

relations   between   Singapore   and   Malaysia.   This

relationship  should  be based on  mutual  interest  and

benefit. The Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister on the 24th

of  November said that the Western countries should give

aid to Malaysia. Otherwise, they would lose their desire

for  the democratic way of living. If they have a better

living  standard,  they  would  not  turn  to  Communist

countries   for  aid.  Similarly,  on  the  relationship

between  Singapore and Malaysia, our stand  is  that  we

want  trade.  We  want to survive. If  our  neighbouring

country is not able to give us aid and, in fact, go  one

step  further to foil our attempt to increase our  trade

so  that  we  can  ease  our burdens  and  difficulties,

instead of incurring a loss of trade for ourselves. This

will only create instability and chaos. This will give a

very  good  opportunity to the Communists to  wreck  our

democratic  way of life. This is not only  a  danger  to

Singapore,  but  it  would also be  a  danger  to  other

countries in South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when Singapore was expelled from

Malaysia,  the  Malaysian  leaders  declared  that   the

separation of Singapore from Malaysia would bring  about

a  better understanding between the two territories.  We

agree  to  what  they said. But since we  have  achieved

independence,  what  is the true  situation?  It  is  a

matter  for regret that the Malaysian leaders  have  not

practised what they have said. I have to point out  that

since Singapore is a neighbour of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia,  the  relationship should be  close.  Anything

which  happens here will have repercussions in Malaysia.

Therefore, we should progress in a spirit of competition

arid  strive to achieve a common prosperity for the  two

territories by economic co-operation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the process of history is  relentless

and  continuing. We who are here today  as  the  elected

representatives  of our people never  did  hope  in  our

fondest  dreams  to be in this House today  to  run  the

affairs  of  an independent nation. We entered  Malaysia

because we believe in Malaysia - a re-unification  of  the

people  who  were artificially separated by  a  colonial

power  who  saw  in  separation the  way  to  successful

colonial  rule.  Colonialism  has,  however,  historical

limitations, for the process of time wears down colonial

domination. People elsewhere have achieved freedom  from

colonialism by revolution and counter-revolution. But we

in   this   part   of  South-East  Asia  have   achieved

independence  by nationalism against the colonial  power

that  knows  and understands the storms that nationalism

can evoke. Indeed, political and economic expediency saw

the  graceful withdrawal of colonialism from Malaya  and

Singapore,   and   what   we,  who   struggled   against

colonialism, achieved was a social and political  change

for the better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time we felt that we had found the answer to our

ills in Malaysia. But history had destined otherwise for

us.  Colonialism raised its ugly head with  obscurantist

slogans of one race, one language and one religion,  and

the  whole structure for which we fought collapsed.  Our

stand  for a nation of Malaysians, multi-racial,

multi-lingual  and multi-religious, foundered on the  base  of

racial  fanaticism and we were forced out of a  national

entity  which we sincerely helped to create and nurture.

What we were forced ho accept we have accepted. And  now

it  is  for us to show all concerned that we can  travel

the road of independence under our own steam



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



and overcome all difficulties. Indeed, we have travelled

a  long  and arduous road. We have overcome colonialism.

We  have exposed and isolated the anti-national elements

and  we  have  shown the communalists that we  will  not

stand any nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent Singapore is confident of building a

tolerant multi-racial nation which will be the pride  of

Asia  and the world. We are sure that our experience  in

tolerant  multi-racial unity will find its echo  in  the

neighbouring territories and lead to unity with our kith

and  kin elsewhere. In this sense our independence is  a

boon.  That  we  are independent and  sovereign  no  one

doubts, except the pro-Communist Barisan Sosialis.  They

have  boycotted this first session of the Parliament  of

Singapore and history will damn them for this stupidity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Afro-Asian world has acknowledged our

independence, and we have been admitted into the  United

Nations. But to the Barisan Sosialis our independence is

"phoney".  The term "phoney" has been so  much  used  by

them  for every conceivable reason that one wonders what

they really mean by "phoney". Indeed, I am beginning  to

think that the very existence of the Barisan Sosialis is

"phoney", because they exist not for Singapore  but  for

others  who  are  not interested in  Singapore  and  her

people.  But if they would really apply their  minds  to

what  has  happened to Aidit and the P.K.I., they  would

have enough time to mend their ways. Otherwise a similar

disaster can well befall them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Afro-Asian countries have accepted us as truly

independent and sovereign, committed to a policy of

non-alignment.  Even  Russia and Yugoslavia  - Communist

nations - have understood why we still require British

bases. We are a small nation and it is only natural  for

small  nations  to require assistance for defence  until

their  territorial  integrity can be  assured  by  other

means.  The  fact of life in a turbulent world  must  be

accepted  and South-East Asia is today a troubled  area.

It  would  be  foolish for us to say. "Out with  foreign

bases." The Barisan, however, use the existence  of  the

bases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



as  a weapon for malicious attack. Trincomalee in Ceylon

was for quite some time retained as a British naval base

after  Ceylon's  independence. President Nyerere  called

for  the  assistance of British troops sometime  ago  to

quell  a  rebellion,  and today  Zambia  is  asking  for

British  troops  to  guard the  Kariba  Dam.  Would  the

Barisan  say  that the independence of these territories

is  "phoney"  and neo-colonialist? The rub really  comes

when  the  Barisan Sosialis endeavour  to  dissuade  the

people of Singapore from joining the volunteer force for

their  own  self  preservation  and  security.  Can  the

Barisan Sosialis guarantee the people this by dissuading

them?  We  do not want large standing forces  because  a

small  nation  cannot afford to have them in  the  first

place,  as its primary duty is to ensure the social  and

economic  progress of the people. Again, we  cannot,  by

any  stretch  of  the imagination, be an aggressor.  Our

size  rules  that out completely. However, there  is  no

reason why we should not have a volunteer force. If  the

people  of  Singapore  can fight  and  win  against  the

colonialists,    the    anti-nationalists    and     the

communalists, the courage and quality of our youths  can

also   meet   the  challenges  for  our   survival   and

protection.  There  is  no doubt that  our  youths  will

respond to the call of duty and their responsibility  as

citizens  of  an independent country. The  Barisan  have

lost the battle to do Singapore in. Whatever they do  or

say,  they  cannot affect the future of  Singapore  -  a

nation  that  has the will to succeed  in  the  face  of

onslaughts from anti-national elements, communalists and

the  illegitimate children of both these  elements,  the

crooks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to associate myself

with  the  motion  which has been  moved  by  the  Prime

Minister.

<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>5.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I express my support for the  Motion  of

Thanks  to  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara for  his  policy

Speech.  In  the Speech it is stated that the Government

would  treat  all races equally, safeguard their  rights

and   interests,  and  realise  a  multi-racial,

multi-religious  and  multi-lingual society. I  fully  support

this  policy. Our country has been independent for  four

months  now  and  many  countries  have  recognised  our

independence and sovereignty. The majority of Afro-Asian

countries  have  established foreign or trade  relations

with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our purpose is to survive. In order to survive, we

have to get as many countries as possible to befriend us

and to open up international markets so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



we  can  maintain our economic standards.  International

markets  are very important to us. But the eight Barisan

Sosialis  Members opposite have chosen to  boycott  this

Session. They have denounced our parliamentary democracy

as false and our independence as phoney. I would like to

ask  them:  why do they not boycott their  allowance  of

$500  each per month? Just look at them. They  want  the

money   but  they  do  not  want  to  carry  out   their

responsibility or do any work. They are irresponsible in

this  respect.  There should he by-elections  to  decide

their  seats.  They  have all along  been  inducing  the

workers  to go on strike and to carry out all  sorts  of

activities   to   sabotage  our   national   development

programme and to overthrow our Government, so that  they

can  have  the  opportunity to take over  and  rule  the

country.  But  their  subversive  activities  can  never

succeed.  They  have  been saying this:  drive  out  the

British  bases here and make friends with Indonesia  and

the  Communists of other countries. If such actions were

possible, why have they failed? It shows that the people

are  very  discerning  and they have  seen  through  the

tactics  and intrigues of the Barisan Sosialis. That  is

why  they  have  met with disaster after  disaster  anti

failure after failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have also said

that   our  independence  on  the  9th  August  is   not

"correct". We should realise that Malaysia and Singapore

are  economically inter-dependent. One State  relies  on

the  other for existence, it is just like a human being,

made  up  of flesh and blood. So it is not possible  for

one  to  have only skin without flesh, or flesh  without

skin.  That  is  the relationship between Singapore  and

Malaysia.  The  logical conclusion,  therefore,  is  the

coming  together  of  the  two  territories.  Our  Prime

Minister,  and also our Minister for Finance, have  said

that  the  two  countries should co-operate economically

and work closely together in order to bring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



about a better standard of living for the two halves  of

one body of people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For next year there is about $500 million in revenue,

and expenditure will be slightly less than that, and  in

the  end, there will be a small surplus of about  a  few

million  dollars. From this, we can see that our economy

is stable. It is a sound economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in March this year the Ministry of

National Development sold the pre-war Tiong Bahru houses

in order to permit the people to own their own homes. As

one  who  resides  in this area, I wish  to  express  my

thanks on behalf of the residents in Tiong Bahru to  the

Government.  Talking of the rents  of  these  houses,  I

suggest that those who cannot pay the initial deposit on

rents  should  he  given  generous  consideration.   One

month's notice of such payment should be given to  these

people,  and only then can any action be taken. This  is

to  lessen the difficulties of the people concerned. The

practice at the moment is that a notice is issued  after

only seven days of the due date. Several days after  the

issue  of this notice, another notice is issued  to  the

occupier  to  quit  the house. The first  notice  is  to

demand  the payment of rent, and the second is to  evict

the  occupier and also demand the payment of  all  rents

due.  In  my  view,  this measure is a  bit  too  harsh,

because,  in addition to the arrears of rent, there  are

other  payments  to  be made on receipt  of  the  second

notice.  So  I hope that the Housing Board will  take  a

more  liberal  view in this regard and  not  just  issue

eviction notices which will affect the livelihood of the

people concerned. I hope the authorities will take steps

to  rectify  these  measures in  the  interests  of  the

people.



<br><br>5.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  let me first express my gratitude to the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara for his Speech to this House, which  sets

out  in clear terms the tasks ahead and the efforts that

have  to  be exerted by all of us in Singapore  for  the

future prosperity and happiness of our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the Business sessions having commenced for

several days now, I find it most difficult to comprehend

the  reasons for Members of this House in the Opposition

to  stay away, particularly when vital matters affecting

the  nation  and  the  future of our  people  are  being

discussed. Although confusion and uncertainty could have

led  to  their absence, I can only conclude  that  their

action   amounts   to  a  clear  abdication   of   their

responsibilities to the people of Singapore. These  men,

who  have  constantly spoken as if they, and only  they,

are the knights of freedom and democracy and leaders  of

the  people, have now demonstrated publicly that  it  is

part  of their creed to abdicate responsibility whenever

it  suits them - without even ascertaining the  wishes

of  those  who elected them to this House. To use  their

own  vocabulary,  I can only say that their  actions  in

this  regard are indeed phoney, particularly when it  is

abundantly  clear that these Members of  Parliament  are

abiding  by  the  wishes  of  Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh,  who

incidentally is not a Member of this House,  as  against

the wishes of those who elected them. It is obvious from

their  actions that it is they who are the  stooges  and

not us in the N.T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been given a glaring demonstration of their

intellectual dishonesty, I am sure that our citizens now

realise  that they have elected a bunch of men  who  are

prepared  to make unsubstantiated criticisms about  this

House after having been here for the past two years  and

not  forgetting the financial rewards they have  derived

from  its  membership. Be that as  it  may,  what  other

interpretation could we give to this insane move?  Could

they  have  exhausted their supply of

gramophone-record-like  speeches and remarks? Is it because they now  find

it  extremely untenable to continue as spokesmen for the

anti-national  forces, following recent developments  in

our  neighbouring country? Or can it be that, with their

channel of overseas instructions, which had served  them

well  during  the  few  years, now disrupted,  they  are

awaiting   fresh   channels  of  communication   to   be

established?  To my mind, it is this disruption  of  the

channel of communication



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



and  the delay in receiving directions from abroad  that

has  prompted them to stay away - lest any remarks  they

make  in this House prove to he contrary to instructions

that  may  yet come from their foreign masters. Whatever

it may be. I feel sorry for them today. The intelligence

and   political  awareness  of  our  people   makes   it

impossible  for them to play the role of  "Proxies"  for

overseas  masters, without being hounded from pillar  to

post, and life indeed must be difficult for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the policy Speech of the Head of State, reference

was  made  to the need for awareness amongst workers  in

Singapore   for  the  successful  industrialisation   of

Singapore and the creation of job opportunities. Mention

was  also made of irresponsible trade unionism and trade

union  actions  for  political motives.  First,  Jet  me

assure  the  House  that  the  democratic  trade   union

movement in Singapore, which today represents more  than

75  per cent of organised workers, is fully aware of its

responsibilities. It believes that it cannot operate  in

a  vacuum. As an organised part of society, it  believes

that it has a clear and positive role to play, primarily

to  safeguard the legitimate interests of labour and  to

fight  exploitation  of labour  in  any  form.  It  also

recognises  that  the economic stagnation  of  Singapore

must  inevitably  mean the emasculation  of  the  labour

movement,  and therefore its own future is  inextricably

tied  up with the economic future of Singapore. I  would

like  to  remind  this House that it is this  basic  and

fundamental realisation that has led workers, led by the

N.T.U.C.,  to  give  their full support  to  Singapore's

industrialisation programme. We fully believe that  this

programme must succeed and, we say here and now, that in

the  years  ahead, we will demonstrate our capacity  and

ability  to  adjust  ourselves  not  only  to  meet  the

challenges  but also prepare for some of the  sacrifices

which  the  pioneering years of industrialisation  ahead

will call for. But, lest it be mistaken, let me also say

that workers have no intention of giving any employer  a

blank cheque for exploitation. In this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



regard, it will largely fall upon Government to continue

to  ensure that employers make an equal contribution  to

the  national  development  and  share  our  trials  and

tribulations. We seek an assurance from Government  that

it  will  not  encourage employers to seek  refuge  from

their  obligations and use these economic  circumstances

to  exploit  and stifle the aspirations  of  workers  in

Singapore.  As my colleague, the Member for  Bras  Basah

has  already mentioned, employers in Singapore, like any

employers   elsewhere,  are  already  giving   different

unintended  interpretations to certain  remarks  of  the

Prime  Minister. We are also aware that some among  them

even  chose  this occasion to use our struggles  against

the  anti-national forces in our midst to  play  workers

against  workers,  thus hoping to deny  workers  in  the

democratic   trade   union  movement  their   legitimate

rewards.  To  those  employers,  I  give  notice   that,

notwithstanding  the need for stable  labour  conditions

for  our own economic future, we in the democratic trade

union  movement will not hesitate to make exceptions  of

such employers, regardless of Government's policies.  We

will endeavour, through sheer economic unionism and  not

political  motives, to teach them some  lessons  on  how

collective  bargaining  and labour-management  relations

should  be conducted in a free and independent  country.

In  welcoming this remark by His Excellency the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara. I hope that the Government will equally

ensure  that employers do not take this plea for  stable

labour  conditions to be an indication  that  Government

would  he  a  silent  spectator of the  exploitation  of

workers in the process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it was indeed heartening to note that our

foreign  policy  aims at having the  maximum  number  of

friends  and  the  least  number of  hostile  countries.

Speaking as a worker, I must say that this is indeed  an

enlightened  policy to follow. We workers  in  Singapore

have always recognised this need for positive neutrality

and  Afro-Asian solidarity. Unlike those absent  Members

from the opposite row, who preach a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



brand  of Afro-Asian solidarity which changes from  time

to  time,  the  workers  in  the  democratic  wing  have

consistently believed that positive neutrality  was  and

still is the correct policy for Singapore. We have never

supported  ideological  exclusiveness  and  have  always

adhered to establishing fraternal relations with workers

in  the  Afro-Asian world on the basis of mutual respect

for each other's approaches to fundamental problems.  As

evident  from  the  large number of fraternal  delegates

from  the  Afro-Asian trade unions who recently gathered

in  Singapore  for  the National Trades  Union  Congress

Annual  Convention and the international Labour Seminar,

these   policies  have  always  paid  dividends.  Having

succeeded  in  a small way in fostering this  friendship

among  Afro-Asian  nations for us in  Singapore  in  the

trade  union field, we naturally feel confident that  we

can  speak  from  direct personal  experience  that  the

policy  indicated in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech

is  the  right  one to adhere to. We should consistently

display our adherence to the principles of non-alignment

and  the  ideal of Afro-Asian solidarity, based  on  the

Bandung  principles.  Far from being  fence-sitters,  we

should  never  hesitate to make known  that  we  dislike

anybody  making up our minds for us. Speaking on  behalf

of  the workers of Singapore, I am indeed glad that  the

Government  has  seen the righteousness  of  this  trade

union philosophy in international relations and embodied

it  as  the  cornerstone of the foreign  policy  of  our

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as one who belongs to the democratic trade

union movement, let me assure the House that the workers

of  Singapore will stand resolutely by the Government in

the  years  ahead so long as it adheres to a  policy  of

positive   neutrality  in  international   affairs   and

respects  the institutional independence of the  working

class led by the National Trades Union Congress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit me, Mr Speaker, Sir, to close my remarks with

the expression that the workers of Singapore, with their

high  degree  of political consciousness, will  have  no

sympathy for those who have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



so  disgracefully  abdicated their responsibilities  to

the  people of Singapore and stayed away from the  open

argument  taking  place in this House,  to  decide  the

destiny of our nation.



<br><br>5.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Minister of State for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of

the  motion in the name of the Prime Minister  to  thank

His Excellency for his Speech in this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, speaking as the Member for Hong Lim, I

have  a  mixed  variety of feelings. The by-election  in

Hong  Lim has, to a certain extent, some connection with

the  independence of Singapore and the  emergence  of  a

Parliament in Singapore. If the P.A.P. had been defeated

in  the Hong Lim by-election, probably we would not have

had  an  independent  Singapore, to  say  nothing  of  a

Parliament.   Even  the  existence  of  the  Legislative

Assembly   would   have  been  in  doubt   under   those

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts show that after Singapore was kicked out of

Malaysia,  the  leaders  of our  immediate  neighbouring

country said openly that if Singapore had not agreed  to

leave  Malaysia, then probably repressive  action  would

have  had  to be taken, thereby giving rise  to  further

bloodshed. That clearly shows that they would  not  have

hesitated  to  do what they had said they  would  do  if

Singapore  had  refused to leave Malaysia.  Under  those

circumstances, if we had not left Malaysia, there  would

not be an independent Singapore nor a Parliament sitting

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, after Singapore was kicked out of

Malaysia,  what do we see with regard to the actions  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis? In page 1 of the  Barisan  Party

Organ published on the 11th of September, we notice  one

article  with  the title, "Where is Democracy?  An  Open

Argument".  In  this article, the Barisan  demanded  the

immediate convening of Parliament; and the article  went

on  to  say,  "The Lee Kuan Yew regime still refuses  to

call a meeting of the Legislative Assembly in spite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



of  the  repeated  requests of the Opposition  Members.

The Lee Kuan Yew regime seems to treat the question  of

independence  as  one  of  its  own  Party's  problems,

thereby  treating  the  Legislative  Assembly   as   an

expendable  showpiece." Mr Speaker, this  is  from  an

article  published in the Party Organ  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis wherein they made their demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Government was very busily engaged

in  setting up relationships with other nations  in  the

world,  laying  its  foundations  in  the  international

arena,  and  finding trading outlets for the  people  of

Singapore. So a Goodwill Mission under the leadership of

the Deputy Prime Minister visited countries in Afro-Asia

and  Eastern  Europe. We have made  friends  with  these

countries  and  we  have laid a new  foundation  in  our

international  relationships. The Goodwill  Mission  has

accomplished its task, and we are now in this House. But

we  are  facing  a boycott by the Barisan Sosialis.  Why

should they boycott the proceedings of this House?  Only

a  few months ago, Mr Speaker, they were clamouring for

an  immediate sitting of the Assembly. Why should  there

be  a sudden change now in their policy and strategy?  I

think  we  should review the circumstances,  and  I  can

offer   several  reasons  for  their  boycott  of   this

Assembly. Firstly, they are running away from facts  and

realities,  because they know by now that  more  than  a

hundred  nations  in  the United  Nations  Organisation,

including Russia which is a Communist country,  as  well

as   the  other  Communist  countries,  have  recognised

Singapore as an independent sovereign State; and if  the

Barisan Sosialis Members were to attend the sittings  in

this  House,  then  it would be difficult  for  them  to

reconcile the fact of their attendance with their slogan

of "Phoney independence! ". They would then be making  a

laughing  stock  of themselves. That is the  reason  why

they are not attending these proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason, Mr Speaker, is that there is now

an  internal  split in the Barisan Sosialis itself.  Dr

Lee Siew



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



Choh,  not  being  a Member of this House,  cannot  give

expression to his showmanship in this House  and  so  he

does  not  want Members of his Party to avail themselves

of the opportunity to do so. Neither is he in a position

to   gain  control  of  those  Party  members  who  have

divergent  views  and he is afraid  that  they  may  say

something  against him or his Party in this House.  That

again is another reason for the boycott.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason, Mr Speaker, and this is the most

important  one,  is  that some leaders  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  have already succumbed to the truth.  Some  of

them  have  openly shown their repentance and  confessed

that  they  have  made mistakes in the past.  They  have

criticised and even renounced Communism. Others  who  do

not dare come out in open criticism of Communism are  in

a  state of confusion, thereby making themselves fit for

psychiatric treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along, Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis have been

boasting  that  only their Party, the Barisan  Sosialis,

have  the support of the people. This is what they  have

been  claiming,  and  they say that  they  alone  really

represent  the  people.  But  look  at  the  facts,  Mr

Speaker;  the referendum in 1962, the general  elections

in  1963 and the Hong Lim by-election in 1965 all go  to

prove that the people are on our side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore support socialism, democracy

and  parliamentary procedure. They are in support  of  a

socialist  democratic Party, because they  realise  that

socialist  democracy  and a socialist  democratic  Party

like  the  P.A.P. can  bring  about  the  progress  and

prosperity  of  Singapore without  bloodshed.  They  can

raise the living standard of the people. The people have

realised that only by democratic socialism can they have

a  better future. Since the Barisan Sosialis have learnt

these  lessons from history, they have come  to  realise

that  it is impossible for them to capture power by  the

one-man one-vote system through peaceful means; so they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



have  no  choice  but  to change their  basic  stand  in

abandoning  the  line of capturing power  by  democratic

means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis have not been

genuine in their belief in the parliamentary system.  In

fact,  they  want to make use of this system to  destroy

the  system  itself  in order to establish  a  one-party

autocracy.  If they were really sincere in their  belief

in  parliamentary democracy, then as an Opposition  they

should have had some effect in this House, because it is

under  the  system of parliamentary democracy  that  the

Opposition is charged with the responsibility  to  guide

and  criticise the Government, to point out the mistakes

of  the Government, and to put the Government on to  the

proper path, so that whatever actions the Government may

take  or are taking will not be against the interest  of

the  people. But in spite of the responsibility  charged

upon  them,  they are now boycotting the proceedings  in

this House, thereby showing that they have forsaken  the

mandate given to them by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we support the bi-party system because we

are  of the opinion that, although human beings are  the

most  intelligent of all forms of life, they are  by  no

means   perfect.   Even  saints   themselves   are   not

infallible. So we cannot say that whatever we do is  not

without fault. That is why there is the necessity for an

Opposition  to  be  present here and this  is  part  and

parcel of our parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, under this parliamentary democracy the

Party  in power has to go back to the people every  five

years.  It  has  to return the power to  the  people  at

intervals of five years. Because of the existence of  an

Opposition and because of the fact of having  to  return

the  power to the people every five years, there is  the

necessity for the Government or the Party in power to be

very  careful in handling the affairs of the people  and

the nation. But today, because of the boycott staged  by

the  Barisan  Sosialis,  the P.A.P. in  this  House  is

without  a single opponent, a situation which  has  been

forced upon us. But in spite of all this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



Mr Speaker, and in view of our beliefs, our convictions

and our respect for the parliamentary democratic system,

we  are  encouraging our Back-benchers to  come  out  to

criticise the measures to be taken or have been taken by

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This again goes to show our sincerity in our belief in

the  socialist parliamentary democratic system.  If  the

people  have  lost  confidence in the  Barisan  Sosialis

entirely  so  as  to result in all the 51 constituencies

being  in  the hands of the P.A.P., thereby  making  the

P.A.P. a one-party autocracy, then whatever it  may  be

will  be achieved through the democratic process of  the

one-man  one-vote system, and this will  be  done  by  a

general  election.  The abandonment  of  the  democratic

struggle  by  the  Barisan Sosialis  is  worthy  of  our

attention, because we have to know what steps they  will

take  to achieve their aims. Will they, for example,  go

beyond the constitutional limits to resort to unpeaceful

and  unconstitutional means for their  revolution?  This

will  only be proved by time and history. We do not know

at  this  stage, but at any rate if they  choose  to  do

this,  then I can foretell their fate right now  -  that

they will only be digging their own graves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in order to have a Common Market we tried

very  hard  in  the past to secure a merger  by  way  of

Malaysia,  but  the Barisan at that time  were  shouting

that  merger  was phoney. If, assuming  that  they  were

right, that merger was phoney, that merger sold away the

interests  of  the people of Singapore,  then  today  we

would not have been kicked out of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the slogan of the Barisan Sosialis all

along has been that Malaysia is phoney, that Malaysia is

a  neo-colonialist plot, an intrigue, but  in  spite  of

their  slogan,  they sent three representatives  to  the

Parliament  of the Malaysian Federation. In  fact,  they

were  sworn in and demonstrated their loyalty by  taking

part  in  the swearing-in ceremony for Malaysia at  that

time. If Malaysia was phoney, then why should they swear

the  Oath of Allegiance to Malaysia? Now they turn round

and say that Singapore's independence is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



phoney.  This  is  the  biggest laughing  stock  in  the

twentieth  century.  This is  a  most  peculiar  way  of

talking  things in this century. Those who believe  that

Singapore's independence is phoney in fact require  more

psychiatric  treatment  than the inmates  of  Woodbridge

Hospital,  because  ever  since we  became  independent,

there  has  not been a single country which has  opposed

our  admission to the United Nations Organisation.  Even

Russia  has  not objected to our presence in this  world

body. In fact, Russia has agreed to send a trade mission

to  Singapore.  The same applies to some  East  European

countries which are Communist in nature. They  are  also

willing  to  come here to establish trade  relationships

with Singapore. If Singapore's independence were phoney,

then  the  more  than one hundred countries  which  have

recognised us, the people of these countries  must  have

been mad, but the fact is that those who have gone crazy

are  not  the  one hundred and more nations  which  have

recognised  us,  but  the Barisan Sosialis.  It  is  the

Barisan Sosialis that have gone mad. I say so because we

can  never  see  anywhere in the world  any  people  who

refuse  to  recognise  the  independence  of  their  own

country.  If  the  Barisan  Sosialis  still  refuse   to

recognise  our independence, then they must  also  admit

that  they are phoney citizens of Singapore. That  being

so,  they  are  not fit to be citizens of Singapore  and

they should not enjoy the rights of Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as we can see now, even Russia, China and

some  other  Communist countries have  recognised  their

independence.  They  recognised  their  sovereignty  and

their nations as such. The true disciple of Marxism  was

Trotsky  who  believed  that  the  revolution   of   the

Communist world must be above the national interest.  It

was  only  he  who  genuinely believed  that  after  the

successful  revolution  of  the  Communist  world,   all

nations  in the world would perish. Perhaps the  Barisan

Sosialis  is  the incarnation of the life  and  soul  of

Trotsky. And it will attempt to start a world revolution

in  the  Communist fold above the national interest.  In

the minds of people like Trotsky, nations are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



phoney;  it  is  revolution that is  genuine.  But  what

happens to this kind of people? They are either crazy or

they have committed suicide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eviction of Singapore from Malaysia is a temporary

result  of  the  battle  between  the  nationalist   and

communal forces. We have to avoid this type of cold war.

In  fact,  this cold war turned into a hot war,  namely,

bloodshed, as a result of communal strife. So  Singapore

was evicted from Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have faced many trials and

tribulations.  Those of us born and  bred  in  Singapore

cannot  forget  our  brothers  and  sisters  across  the

Causeway. In fact, the worst thing one can do is to  lie

to  oneself  and  say that the people of  Singapore  and

Malaysia  are  two different types of  people.  For  140

years,  the people of Singapore and Malaysia  have  been

under  the  rule of the British colonialists. They  went

through similar sufferings in both territories and  they

were  determined to strive for freedom and independence.

We  are  determined  to suffer and work  together.  This

spirit  of  sacrifice  and hard work  is  not  what  the

Constitution can provide. Neither can the constitutional

arrangements  stifle these qualities. In  the  last  two

years, we have felt the poison spread as a result of the

work  of  communal forces, and we hope that our brothers

across the Causeway will not repeat this foolish act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, Singapore suffered a great deal because

of  the  emergence of communal forces, and now  we  have

been  evicted because of the rise of communalism. We  do

hope that history will not repeat itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an island faced with trials and

tribulations. After the P.A.P. Government came to  power

in  1959, we went through serious troubles almost  every

year.  In  1960, there was Mr Ong Eng Guan who believed

in  individualism  and who liked  to  fish  in  troubled

waters.  In 1962, he revealed his hypocrisy. He  claimed

to serve the interests of the people, but in fact he was

a  pseudo-revolutionist. And in 1962, he was  busy  with

slogans of "phoney



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



merger", and he called for general elections. These were

the  years when we had Mr Ong Eng Guan and the  Barisan

incidents.  In  1963, there was a general  election.  In

1964, we participated in the Federal elections and there

were two riots in Singapore. In 1965, we were kicked out

by  the  racialists from Malaysia. It seems  that  every

year there are incidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., while undergoing all these difficulties,

has  been able to fulfil the Five-Year Development Plan.

Through  democratic socialist methods, it  has  resolved

the housing problem and has improved the living standard

and  safeguarded the welfare of the people. And we  have

established the basis for industrialisation.  All  these

achievements have been due to the support of the people.

Therefore,  these  achievements go  to  show  the

hardworking   spirit   and  intelligence  of   our   people.

Therefore, although independent Singapore is faced  with

all  these difficulties, I believe, in the end,  we  can

overcome  them  with the co-operation of the  Government

and  the industry of the people. The people will, in the

end,  overcome all these difficulties so that the Second

Five-Year  Plan can materialise. Economically,  we  need

new  markets  so  that  our manufactures  will  have  an

outlet.  We  need to build more factories  in  order  to

provide  more  employment  opportunities.  But  we  must

understand  that  in any newly emerging  country,  there

must  be  a period of trials and tribulations.  Germany,

which  was  a  defeated  country, went  through  various

trials   and   tribulations.   But   because   of    the

determination  and  hard work of the people,  they  have

rebuilt their country and their living standard has also

been  raised. There is a saying that whoever can  endure

extreme bitterness can become a man among men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the workers in Singapore can forge ahead and

consider  the  long-term  interest  in  order  that  our

industrialisation  programme can  materialise  and  that

they  would not just pay heed to the immediate  interest

and  forget  the  future. If they can do  so,  then  our

industrialisation programme will materialise earlier and

our better days will come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



earlier. We must always remember that although Singapore

is a tiny island with a small population, her importance

is  internationally recognised. We remember that  before

the  Second World War, there was a militarist  who  said

that  whoever  had control over Singapore could  control

the whole of South-East Asia. Our neighbouring countries

have recognised Singapore's strategic position. Although

the British bases are here to protect Singapore, we must

not  forget  our lesson in 1941. At that time  everybody

thought that Singapore was an impregnable fort, that  it

could  not  be  conquered, and that everybody  need  not

worry. Yet history has proved that in a short period  of

one  week, Singapore was taken like a split bamboo.  Why

is it that Singapore fell so easily? The main reason was

that  Singapore was then a colony. Nationalism  had  not

germinated, and Singapore was not defended  by  her  own

people. It was not backed by the people. We can learn  a

lesson  from  this. It is only through our own  strength

and  our  own efforts that we can truly defend  our  own

country and preserve our own security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some countries which are small, such as

Switzerland, but their citizens are patriotic. They  can

turn all their people into soldiers, so that even strong

nations  would not dare bully them. Although  there  are

many  soldiers with modern weapons in Vietnam, there  is

no  end  to the war there because they do not  have  the

support  of  the people. So we cannot fully depend  upon

the British bases to defend ourselves. We must depend on

our  own strength, and we must have the backing  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have been kicked out from Malaysia, the

two subsequent by-elections in Malaysia have proved that

the seed of nationalism has germinated and is coming  to

fruition.  We  also hope that with the  increased  trend

towards nationalism, Malaysia will in the end be united.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I have given the example of Switzerland. Such

countries  can  even defend their tiny  nations  against

strong nations when they have the support of the people.

Hitler was a very notorious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



dictator who looked down upon other nations. Yet in  the

end  he was defeated. So it is in Singapore. If all  the

people  are  patriotic  and  are  willing  to  sacrifice

themselves;  if they are solidly united and  willing  to

work  hard, then I believe no country in the world  will

dare to bully us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that in our multi-racial society, all the

races will be loyal and serve our country. We must  give

equal  treatment to all the races. We must have a

multi-racial  policy.  That  is why we  have  tabled  in  this

Parliament  the Republic of Singapore Independence  Bill

and   the  Constitution  (Amendment)  Bill.  They   have

provisions  to  safeguard the interests  of  minorities.

They  will  give freedom in language, religion,  culture

and   other  things.  This  is  a  basic  principle   in

democratic socialism. Based on this principle -

a multi-racial  society  -  there will be  peace,  progress  and

prosperity in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must understand that Singapore is situated in

South-East  Asia,  an  area  surrounded by  some

anti-Chinese countries.  Any  chauvinistic attempt to turn

Singapore into  a  third China  will only  bring about a major

disaster   and  tragedy  to  the  people  of  Singapore.

Singapore will be encircled by unfriendly forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us point out seriously that if there is an upsurge

of  racialism  in Singapore, then the consequences  will

not  be just one or two internal racial disturbances  in

Singapore,  but it will also have repercussions  outside

Singapore.  If we allow Chinese chauvinism to  rear  its

head,  then Singapore will easily be isolated in

South-East  Asia. It will be a country encircled by unfriendly

forces. They will then attack Singapore, which is a tiny

country.  Under  these circumstances, we cannot  imagine

that  we  can get help from Communist China or  anywhere

else.  The question is that, "The distant waters  cannot

be made available to quench the fire that is immediately

before  us." We have a situation in Indonesia where  the

Chinese  are persecuted. China could not send troops  to

Indonesia to protect the Chinese other than raise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



some  protests. The Indonesian Communist Party has  been

suppressed  by  the Army, and yet the Chinese  Communist

Party could not intervene. They could not send troops to

help the P.K.I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Small countries which can he

protected by China are, from the geographical  point  of

view, close to the Chinese border. "The near waters  can

he  made  available  to quench the immediate  fire."  Of

course, that is quite possible. There is the convenience

of  nearness.  Also,  if anything happens  next  to  the

Chinese border, assistance from China will be quick  and

immediate.   This   is  all  due   to   the   favourable

geographical position. But the situation in Singapore is

different.  The Barisan Sosialis' idea is to  set  up  a

Communist  Singapore  or a Chinese  Singapore.  Whatever

they  may  want Singapore to be, they will  finally  put

Singapore in a situation where it is surrounded by

anti-Chinese  forces.  Up  till now the Barisan  Sosialis  is

pursuing a foolish line - rash, reckless and dangerous

political adventurers - a line which will ultimately  lead

Singapore  into a situation which I have described  just

now.  I  hope  they will reconsider their step  and  not

allow  Singapore to come to an impasse.  Singapore  must

not be allowed to get into such a situation, a situation

in which she is surrounded by anti-Chinese forces. There

is  only  one  way out, and that is, to practise

multi-racialism  and democratic socialism, There is  no  other

alternative. This policy depends on the concerted action

of all the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister of State for the Prime

Minister's Department, Inche Yaacob, said that  we  were

faced  with  the  Ultras,  Malay  racialists,  who  were

persuading  the  Malays in Singapore to  go  across  the

Causeway. This is another manifestation and challenge of

racialism.   If  this  scheme  were  to  succeed,   then

naturally Singapore would become a Chinese State. But we

believe that this intrigue or scheme will naturally fail

because  the  Singapore  Government  has  shown  in  all

respects  that its policy is one of multi-racialism  and

that it alone can look after the interests of all races.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of Singapore depends on democratic socialism

and  a  policy  of  multi-racialism and a  non-Communist

society,  together with our non-aligned foreign  policy.

We  can  then  establish  friendly  relations  with  all

countries of the world, including the Republic of China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we want to establish friendly relations with

the  Republic  of  China,  we  do  not  propose  to  let

Singapore  become a third China, because this will  only

lead  to  suicide. This is a suicidal  attempt.  Only  a

policy  of  multi-racialism and non-alignment  can  lead

Singapore   to   the  path  of  peace,   progress,   and

prosperity, and this policy that we have is  not  unique

in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I have mentioned that certain countries are

able  to  prosper through two world wars. One example  I

gave was Switzerland, which safely went through two wars

and  yet was able to build herself up. This was all  due

to her policy of non-alignment and also to the fact that

no  other country wanted to bully her. It is because her

people  are  loyal  to  their Government  and  to  their

country. So in this situation the only sane thing to  do

is to look after the people and maintain their economic,

social, political and racial interests. Seventy-two  per

cent  of the Swiss people speak French, and 20 per  cent

speak  Italian. Also in other countries with  people  of

different races who speak different languages, there  is

no   hindrance   to   their  national  development.   In

Switzerland, the national languages are French, Italian,

Swiss, and German. This is so today. And the people  who

speak these different languages are liberal-minded. So I

hope   that  every  one,  particularly  the  people   of

Singapore, should he liberal-minded and should not force

others to speak only one language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we fear is the language policy adopted by our

immediate  neighbour.  We hope that  every  citizen  can

speak the national language. Nevertheless, the method to

be  adopted  should  be  one of persuasion  and  not  of

compulsion,  because history has taught  us  that  in  a

multi-racial society where one racial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



group  tries  to compel other groups to do its  bidding,

then there will be no peace, progress, or prosperity  in

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore feel that our policy of

multi-racialism is the right one, and there will be

safeguards written into our Constitution to preserve

the rights  of the  minority groups. In foreign affairs,

our policy  is one  of non-alignment. With all these policies

and  with the  support  of  the people, we can succeed  in

making Singapore  the Switzerland of the East in a  few  years'

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->"<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>: To ask the Minister for

Education  (a)  whether  the Government  has  given  any

financial aid to Ngee Ann College, and how much; and (b)

what is the amount of money actually spent in aid to the

Nanyang University since the Government had taken  steps

to reorganise it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Standing Order No. 20 (2), the Minister

for Education supplied the following answer:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. "(a) No, the Government has not given any financial

aid to Ngee Ann College yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) When the reorganisation of the Nanyang University

commenced  in  July 1964, the University  was  virtually

bankrupt owing to financial mismanagement by the  former

University administration. In particular, the  recurrent

expenditure of the University was repeatedly diverted by

the   former   Vice-Chancellor  as   payment   for   the

construction  of a cinema-like auditorium  costing  more

than $1 million. As a result, Government had to step  in

and  make  an  immediate grant of $200,000  to  pay  the

salaries of both the academic and non-academic staff  in

November 1964. A further advance of $660,000 had  to  be

made  soon after to meet the urgent students commitments

of  the  university, particularly in respect of payments

of  salaries  and  wages to the staff. Since  then,  the

Government has made another grant of $1 million to  tide

over the financial difficulties till the end of 1965. In

all,  since the reorganisation began in July  1964,  the

Government  has  made a total advance of  $1.86  million

towards  meeting  the  recurrent  expenditure   of   the

University.  This is in addition to the $1  million  for

the library, now under construction, which will be fully

expended in July 1966, when work on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



library  is  scheduled to be completed, and  another  $1

million  for scientific equipment and library books  out

of  which a sum of $30,000 will be spent before the  end

of  1965 for the equipment of a language laboratory  for

teaching  languages  with  a modern  approach.  On  12th

September,  1965,  the University authorities  published

the   Report   submitted  by  the   Nanyang   University

Curriculum  Review  Committee.  In  the  light  of   the

recommended  curriculum, it is  now  expected  that  the

purchase of scientific equipment and library books  will

be actively pursued. To summarise:-

assisting the Social Welfare Department in giving relief

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. "There has been no general increase of Temporary

Occupation Licence fees either in the Mandai area or in

any other area in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general practice Temporary Occupation Licence

fees   are  only  revised  whenever  the  licences   are

transferred   to  non-relatives  or  re-instated   after

revocation   for   breach  of  condition(s).   In   such

circumstances,  and  in cases of  the  grant  of  a  new

Licence the fee is computed as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Farming Use:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 2 per cent of the market value of land per acre per

annum for vegetable cultivation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) 4 per cent of market value of land per acre

per  annum  for  fruit cultivation. An  additional

fee  of  $12  per annum is levied for  each  house

erected on the holding and $24 per annum for  each

shop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Dwelling Use:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$12 per annum for each house on the holding plus $24

for each shop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Commercial Use:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 per cent of the market value per acre per annum.

This rate is also levied for houses let out for

profit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the revised fee is supposed to be based on

the  market value of the land, in practice the valuation

figure used in the case of licences for farming purposes

is  very  low, being $1,800 per acre (for underdeveloped

areas)  to  $3,600 per acre (for better  developed  land

with  good  access). `This is a very low  valuation  for

land  in Singapore as it is virtually impossible now  to

acquire land at these prices."

parts of Peng Ghee Road and Peng Ann Road and (b) repair

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Standing Order No. 20 (2), the Minister

for  Law and National Development supplied the following

answers:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. "Under the provisions of the Land Acquisition

Ordinance   whenever  Government  intends   to   acquire

compulsorily  any private land for a public  purpose  it

must announce its intention





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



and  the  public purpose for which such land is required

by the publication of a notification or a declaration as

the  case  may  be, in the Government Gazette.  In  this

case, Government would do likewise if it is intended  to

acquire the land referred to by the Member for Tampines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlers on land acquired for public purposes are

resettled or rehoused by the Housing and Development

Board. The service of notice to remove, payment of

ex-gratia payments and clearance all take place after the

State has taken possession of the land under the Land

Acquisition Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has not given any notice to the

occupants to remove."





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. "(a) The electrification of the upper parts of

Peng Ghee Road and Peng Ann Road will be included in the

next stage of the Electrification Programme for supplies

to  kampong  areas.  It  is  expected  that  electricity

supplies will be made available to the residents in this

area in 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The repair of Goh Hup Road has been approved by the

Urban and Rural Services Committee and the work will  be

carried out in 1966."
