<div align="center"><h4><div align="center"><b>LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY (POWERS AND PRIVILEGES) BILL</b></div></h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. J. Davies (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. J. Davies):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is perhaps a historic occasion, for it is

the  first time that a Legislature of this colony has

been empowered to determine and regulate, by law, its

privileges,  immunities and powers and those  of  its

Members. That power stems from the provisions of  the

Colonial  Laws Validity Act of 1865, and it has  been

expressly conferred on this Assembly by section 65 of

the  Singapore Colony Order in Council in  1955.  The

only  limitation on that power is that our privileges

and immunities shall not exceed those of the House of

Commons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



in  the  United  Kingdom, and it is  this  limitation

which   has  given  the  draftsmen  of  this  measure

considerable  anxiety  and concern,  because  Members

realise  the  powers and privileges of the  House  of

Commons  are  not  found concisely or comprehensively

set  out in any statute or, for that matter,  in  any

instrument.  They  have  been developed  through  the

centuries by trial and experiment, and they now  form

a  complex  law in which only experts  are  fully  at

home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore been compelled to look for some

statute  or  ordinance which defines the  powers  and

privileges of colonial legislatures, and we have been

advised   by   experts  on  Parliamentary  procedure,

particularly those officers employed at the Table  of

the   House  of  Commons,  to  take  as  models   the

ordinances  of Nigeria and Kenya which have  received

their  approval and, indeed, their blessing. We  have

accepted  this  advice, and the  provisions  of  this

Bill,   as  indicated  in  the  Objects  and  Reasons

attached  to  the  printed copy of the  Bill,  follow

those  models  very  closely with only  those  formal

adaptations  which are strictly necessary  for  local

application.   In   these  circumstances,   I   would

earnestly ask Members of this Legislative Assembly to

accept  the provisions of this Bill without  question

and without cavil, and I hope that that plea will  be

indulgently accepted by hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular provisions of the Bill are, I

venture  to think, fully and adequately explained  in

the  Objects and Reasons attached to the printed copy

of  the  Bill, and I venture to think and  hope  that

they require no further elaboration or amplification,

or, indeed, even more comment from me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would wish to seek clarification from the Hon. the

Attorney-General on clause 24 (1) (e)  of  this  Bill

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person who publishes any report of a Committee

of  the  Assembly  or of any evidence  given  or  any

documents presented to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



such  committee  or  extracts  from  such  documents,

before such committee has presented its report to the

Assembly, shall be guilty of an offence and shall  be

liable  on  conviction  to a  fine  of  one  thousand

dollars  or to imprisonment for twelve months  or  to

both such fine and imprisonment."



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, the debate should be on the

general  merits and principles of the  Bill  at  this

stage. Your point can be raised in Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Thank you, Sir. I am much obliged,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Nobody else wishes to speak? I will put

the Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Committee</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committee stage, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Davies -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davies:</b> Now, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> With your consent, gentlemen, I will

take  all  clauses in each Part together, instead  of

clause by clause. Have I your consent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts I to VI (Clauses 1 to 23 inclusive) ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII (Clauses 24 to 27 inclusive -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I wish to seek

clarification from the Attorney-General about  clause

24 (1) (e) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person who publishes any report of a committee

of  the  Assembly  or of any evidence  given  or  any

documents  presented  to such committee  or  extracts

from  such  documents,  before  such  committee   has

presented its report to the Assembly, shall be guilty

of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to  a

fine  of one thousand dollars or to imprisonment  for

twelve months or to both such fine and imprisonment."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Davies -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davies:</b> Sir, I am surprised that I am called

upon  to elaborate or explain language which,  in  my

submission , means exactly what it says.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I am interested at this stage as to the exact limits -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. Would you mind standing

up? In a Committee of the whole House I would like Members to stand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I would wish to make this

point:  that  the  rules  and provisions  which  will

regulate proceedings in this House, as laid  down  in

our  Standing  Orders,  say that  where  no  specific

provision  has been made, the proceedings  should  be

modelled on the practice in the House of Commons.  By

way of analogy, I have referred to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the House of Commons, as I understand it,

there  are  special committees to  which  things  are

usually  referred by the House - Select Committees  and

Standing   Committees.   And   there   is   a   clear

distinction,   as  I  understand  it,   between   the

proceedings of a Select Committee and the proceedings

of  a  Standing Committee of the House.  In  Standing

Committees  all deliberations are open to  the  Press

and  can be published day by day; but there has  been

no  such  distinction  made here,  perhaps  for  good

reason. But I would like to know why.



<br><br><!-- Mr Davies -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davies:</b> Sir, I am afraid I am not in a position

to  give any explanation. I have been guided  in  the

drafting of this Bill by advice from Members  of  the

House of Commons, particularly those officers at  the

Table.  I  do  not pretend for one minute  to  be  an

expert  in  the procedure of the House of Commons.  I

have  accepted the advice of an expert, and as  I  am

not  an expert myself - and I do not think anyone  here

is  an  expert - I have willingly accepted  it.  I  am

quite prepared to give this undertaking: that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



I  will refer the point to an officer at the Table of

the House of Commons, and if I have erred in any way,

I will move an amendment later.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, may

I  refer you to clause 2, Part I-[Interruption.]  No,

Sir,  my  reference  is to the meaning  of  the  word

"committee"  on  page  2 of the Bill  -'  "committee"

means  a standing, select, special or other committee

of the Assembly'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I must accept

the  explanation  given  by the  Hon. the  Attorney-General  and  I hope, at a later date, that  we  will

hear from his experts as to why that distinction  has

not  been made in this particular Bill. There is that

distinction in the House of Commons. The principle on

which  that  ruling was based is that proceedings  in

the  House,  in so far as it is possible,  should  be

completely open, should be fully reported if  anybody

should  care  to report it. It is only  where  public

interest  commands to the contrary  that  secrecy  is

maintained.  And I shall be obliged if,  at  a  later

stage,  we  will get clarification on why  there  has

been this departure from the practice in the House of

Commons.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Nobody else wishes to speak? I will put the Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 24 to 27 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII(Clauses 28 to 33 inclusive) ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported, without Amendment.



<div align="center"><b>Third Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Third Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Davies -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davies:</b> Now, Sir. I beg to move, Sir, "That the Bill be now read the Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LABOUR BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I took office as

Minister  for  Labour and Welfare,  I  inherited  the

Labour Bill from the previous Government. For a long,

long  time,  while  I  was  in  the  old  Legislative

Council,  I kept on pressing and pressing for  a  new

Labour  Code;  and therefore when I  found  that  the

Labour Bill was an accomplished fact, I lost no  time

in  introducing it for First Reading at  our  sitting

last month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went through the Bill, Sir, in greater detail

before  sending  it for printing, and  I  found  that

amendments are necessary in several of the provisions

to  meet  present-day requirements. These  amendments

are  under urgent consideration, and the matter  will

be finalised shortly. Under the circumstances, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Second Reading of this Bill be postponed to 29th June.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim Yew Hock, the Standing Orders

do  not provide for postponement of any Order of  the

Day.  The  only way to get round it, if  you  want  a

postponement,  is  to  have  the  general  assent  of

Members.  The  only way provided for  under  Standing

Orders  is  under  Standing Order No.  57  where  you

withdraw  it, unless, of course, the Members  of  the

Assembly consent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I therefore

crave  the indulgence of the Members of this Assembly

to  enable me to postpone the Second Reading of  this

Bill to the 29th June?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Have I the assent of Members?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Have I the assent of Members that that

motion be moved? Any dissenting voice?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no dissenting voice, the Question was proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Labour Bill has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>

been  in  the  hands of the Minister for  Labour  and

Welfare since the time he took office. Thereafter,  I

believe  at our first sitting, he had the opportunity

of  naming  the  date,  and he had  named  it  today.

Obviously,  Sir, before I knew that the Minister  for

Labour  and Welfare wanted to postpone it. I  thought

that  the Second Reading would have been done  today.

For  that  matter, Sir, I believe if it had been  so,

there would have been no time for considering such an

important  Bill. Such a Bill should be available  not

only to Members of this House, but also to members of

the  general  public for discussion,  so  that  their

views  can  be taken and expressed in this  Assembly.

Also,  for that matter, I feel that we have a  number

of  motions  drawn  up today for  which  I  think  we

received notice yesterday at about the lunch-hour.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Will you please keep to the motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I would like to point out, too.

Sir, that the Bill had not only not been published in

the  Gazette,  but also not circulated. The  Minister

for  Labour and Welfare has already given  a  reason,

and  I think I will accept that. However. I would beg

that, whenever there is opportunity, the Bill should

be given a longer time for discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Second Reading of this Bill be postponed to 29th June.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ALL-PARTY COMMITTEE ON CHINESE EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. I must

first  have the general assent of Members present  to

dispensation with notice under Standing Order No. 23.

Have I

your  assent  that this motion can be  moved  without

notice?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



rise to move the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a Committee be appointed with the following terms of

reference -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'to investigate the situation in Chinese

schools in Singapore and to make recommendations for

the   improvement  and  strengthening   of   Chinese

education  in the interests of Chinese  culture  and

orderly  progress towards self-government  and  ultimate independence in Singapore';



<br><br>that the Committee do consist of the following -

<pre>

  1. Mr Chew Swee Kee (Chairman)

  2. Mr Richard Chuan Hoe Lim

  3. Mr Wong Foo Nam

  4. Mr Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat

  5. Mr Lim Yew Hock

  6. Mr Lee Kuan Yew

  7. Mr Goh Tong Liang

  8. Mr Lim Cher Kheng

  9. Mr M. P. D. Nair;

</pre>

that the Committee have powers to send for

persons, papers and records;

<br><br>that 5 members of the Committee shall form a quorum;

<br><br>that the Committee do meet inside the Assembly House

building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members of this Assembly are, I am sure, aware

of  the fact that the situation in Chinese schools in

Singapore  needs an overall investigation  to  enable

the  Committee  to make suitable recommendations  for

the  improvement of Chinese education, so  that  this

Colony will move towards self-government and ultimate

independence in Singapore in an orderly fashion.  The

question  is  of such an important and  grave  nature

that  I  have  sought the assent of this Assembly  to

dispense  with the notice, with a view to  making  it

possible  for  the Committee to go into the  question

with all speed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Committee come from all political

Parties  that  are represented in this House,  and  I

believe  they  will  present  different  constructive

views. It is the Government's intention to seek views

from   public  bodies,  any  persons  interested   in

education, in fact, from all quarters, to enable the

Committee  to  make recommendations for consideration

by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that the schools concerned,

namely  the  Chung Cheng High School and the  Chinese

High  School, have now resumed normally and that  the

students have resumed their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



studies  in  a  normal manner. This will  enable  the

Committee  appointed to deliberate on whatever  views

are  submitted  to the Committee in an atmosphere  of

calm and goodwill.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek the privilege of seconding this

motion,  and  in  so  doing I  seek  to  clarify  our

position  and our attitude to the recent  conduct  of

students in certain Chinese middle schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have blindly supported and incited strikers

without  understanding the issues.  They  have  taken

part  in  demonstrations of defiance. Some even  have

been  party  to  acts  of  horrible  brutality.   And

finally, Sir, they have blatantly flouted constituted

authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Government moved to punish the immediate

culprits, these students organised wholesale defiance

and, working on the racial emotions of parents and of

labour,  they threatened further considerable  strife

without regard to truth or justice, or the welfare of

the  people  of  this  country.  The  manoeuvring  of

Communists   behind  the  scenes  had  succeeded   in

bringing  about among a decent people  strong  racial

emotions, blindly antagonistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a very high regard for the Chinese

parent, both the non-British and British subject.  He

is   usually  a  sober,  solid,  sensible,  peaceable

person.  That  these parents should have  been  drawn

into the vortex of blind emotions was a matter of the

deepest  concern  to  us.  The  punishment   of   the

immediate  culprits lost significance  in  the  wider

issue - the vital issue - an issue which every member  of

our  Chinese  population must now face  for  himself,

must  now  ask of himself: Is Singapore my  permanent

home? Am I going to respect the other communities  in

this  territory, and work in harmony  and  friendship

with  them,  to  build  a  glorious  new  palace   of

independence  of which I will be a strong  and  loyal

pillar? That is the issue, Sir, that we would like to

see  resolved  in  the  peace and  the  calm  of  the

individual's  own soul, free from mass demonstrations

and  mass  emotions.  It is an issue  which  must  be

clearly faced, and frankly answered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has been told - we have been accused - that

our   action,   and  our  inaction,  has   undermined

authority.  We  are told that our  son  has  publicly

cocked  his snook at us, and our other sons stand  by

wondering   at   our  forbearance,  perturbed,   even

dismayed. Some have cried out that we should use  the

whip.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our son is as one who is ill. He lies stricken

with  the chicken-pox, his body a mass of red  spots,

and  the  more we forbid him to scratch, the more  he

stubbornly  scratches, and the  more  those  spots suppurate. What would you have us do? Use a knife  to

excoriate  those red spots? Take down  the  whip  and

lash out in a frenzy of hurt pride, and then weep  at

the  damage we have done? This, Sir, is not the  time

for  the whip, or the knife. I have no pride  in  the

face of this illness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese people, Sir, are the very heart in our

body  politic.  They are the blood in our  veins.  To

harm them would destroy all. It would destroy forever

the  glorious future now within our grasp of  a  free

and  independent people, working together as brothers

in  love and in mutual respect. This, Sir, is a time,

in  our  view,  for gentle nursing.  Age-old  Chinese

wisdom   and   Chinese  stability,   working   on   a

constitution  that is basically sound,  will  restore

this  son  to  health, and we will be  proud  of  our

Chinese  son. Friends think us weak; others  call  us

cowards. They will not deflect us from our vision  of

a united people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task before us, Sir, is a tremendous one - a task

to win the confidence of our Chinese people, a people

who  have had considerable cause for complaint in the

past.  In  humility, and with all we have,  we  shall

seek  to  gain that confidence and to gain  that  co-operation  which  is  absolutely  necessary  for  the

welfare of all races in this territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a poet once wrote that "Thoughts in hours of

insight  willed can be in hours of gloom  fulfilled."

In  the  days of gloom through which we have  passed,

our  guiding light has been our firm desire to  bring

to our Chinese people a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



realisation  of  their great role in the  independent

Malaya of tomorrow, a realisation that the rich broad

river  of  Chinese  culture is  not  limited  to  the

present-day political manifestation of their homeland

which  is  based on foreign concepts. It is our  hope

that  they  will  realise their future  is  here,  in

friendship and harmony and loyal co-operation with all

races,  to build this new nation which is our deepest

desire.  It is in this spirit that the motion  before

you  is  conceived, and it is my privilege,  Sir,  to

second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we would like

to  assure  hon.  Members here that  the  Progressive

Party will do its utmost to promote Chinese education

and culture. This involves recommendations on a long-term  policy, and if the motion moved is strictly  in

accordance  with this aim alone, it will receive  our

wholehearted support. However, I must point out  that

the  motion  today  differs  from  that  of  a  Press

release,  issued by the Council of Ministers sometime

last  week.  With your indulgence, Sir, I shall  read

out the relevant part for purposes of comparison.  As

it stands today, the motion reads thus:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To investigate the situation in Chinese schools in

Singapore  and  to  make  recommendations   for   the

improvement and strengthening of Chinese education in

the interests of Chinese culture and orderly progress

towards self-government and ultimate independence  in

Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official release is as follows. This release is dated 19th May:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To investigate the situation in the Chinese

schools  with  a  view to making such recommendations

for  the  improvement of Chinese  culture  which  the

Committee  considers to be desirable in the interests

of   orderly  progress  towards  self-government  and

ultimate independence in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted, Sir, that instead of

investigating  the situation so as to  enable  it  to

give  recommendations on a long-term  basis  for  the

benefit   of  Chinese  education  and  culture,   the

Committee that is to be appointed will now  have  two

terms of reference. One, to investigate the situation

in Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



schools    in   Singapore;   and,   two,   to    make

recommendations.  We  would like  the  Government  to

clarify  this point and to state the reasons for  the

necessity  for  the  change of  phraseology.  Is  the

Committee  to be appointed now responsible  not  only

for  the  making  of recommendations on  a  long-term

basis,  which we gladly accept, but also for  dealing

with any situation that may arise from day to day? On

this point, Sir, I must point out that the day-to-day

administration   is   the   responsibility   of   the

Government. After all, I think I am right,  they  are

paid for the job!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government is a Labour Front Government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Coalition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - and not an all-party coalition,

and  any attempt to utilise the Committee that is  to

be appointed as a rubber stamp to justify its actions

will be resisted by my Party. I will repeat, however,

Sir,  that if the Government will clarify this  point

and state clearly that it is not the intention of the

motion  to  make use of this Committee as  such,  the

motion will then receive our support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, we would like to seek further

clarification on a few other points. Since the motion

is  one  that seeks an opinion, is the Committee  one

that is appointed by this Assembly, or is it one that

is  appointed by the Government? Furthermore, to whom

will  this Committee be responsible? And to whom will

it  submit  its  report? Will it  submit  its  report

direct to the Government or otherwise?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is

one  point which I want to bring to the notice of  my

hon.  Friend  the  Minister  for  Education  for  his

consideration.  He  stated  that  memoranda  on   the

subject  of this complex problem of Chinese education

sent in by responsible individuals and bodies will be

given every consideration by him and his Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to inform him that a number

of persons have expressed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



their  fears to me that many may refrain from sending

in  valuable contributions to the Committee if  these

have  to bear their signature. To take an example:  A

teacher  in  a  Chinese school,  with  firm  but  not

necessarily  popular ideas, might fear  repercussions

if he were to forward these ideas under his own name.

I  would  he the first to say most emphatically  that

such   fears  should  not  exist,  considering   that

memoranda  will be examined in secret  only  by  hon.

Members of this House. But, nevertheless, I think  we

must  not close our eyes to the fact that these fears

may exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, ask my hon. Friend to consider

the  advisability of announcing that he  will  accept

unsigned or anonymous memoranda so long as these  are

obviously  constructively and sincerely  written,  so

that   no   aspect   of   public   opinion   may   go

unrepresented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

congratulate  the  Minister for Education  in  having

improved the phraseology of the motion which now lies

before  this  House. Unlike the Member for  Serangoon

(Mr  Lim Choon Mong), I thought it was very  prudent

of  the  Minister for Education this morning  not  to

place before the House a term of reference which says

"to  improve  Chinese culture".  Sir,  I  have  great

regard  for  the ability and capacity of  Members  of

this  House  but  I should think the  improvement  of

Chinese culture is not one within their

power!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, Sir, like to take this opportunity

to express the views of the People's Action Party and

of  many  people, who are not members of the People's

Action Party, but who bear similarly strong views  on

this  subject of Chinese and vernacular education  in

general. In my opinion, if this Committee is not,  as

is feared by the Member for Serangoon, a rubber stamp

to  pilot  the Government through a somewhat delicate

and  difficult problem, if it is to be more - if it  is

to  approach a very difficult problem and try to find

a  long-term solution to this problem, then the terms

of reference should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



expanded. But before we expand the terms of reference

in which - [Interruption.] Before I seek to expand the

terms  of  reference. I must never  forget  that  the

Chief  Minister has got 18 votes in this  House!  But

before  I seek to expand it, I would like to seek  to

reduce  the  terms of reference "to  investigate  the

situation  in  Chinese schools in Singapore,  and  to

make   recommendations  for   the   improvement   and

strengthening  of Chinese education in the  interests

of Chinese culture and orderly progress towards self-government  and ultimate independence in  Singapore".

Now,  Sir, that runs against the whole grain  of  the

People's   Action   Party,  to  think   of   ultimate

independence in Singapore as divorced from the  wider

concept  of independence in Malaya, and I would  seek

to delete the words "in Singapore".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I would seek to add "and to review the whole

policy   of  English  and  vernacular  education   in

Singapore in   order   to  formulate   a   considered

linguistic policy for an independent Malaya".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister has referred to the fears

and uneasiness of a large section of the non-Chinese-speaking population in Singapore and in Malaya at the

happenings that he has referred to in recent  months.

I  think  there is one basic principle which we  must

resolve  if  we  are  to  convince,  what  the  Chief

Minister has said, the stolid, sensible and - I  forgot

his other "s" - the stolid, sensible and -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Solid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - solid parents if we are to win

these parents over and their offsprings, we have  to

face  a very important, if we do not like it, we  can

call  it prejudice - if we are not quite so prejudiced,

we can call it -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Predilection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - predilection; I thank the Chief

Minister  for his choice of words. But, nevertheless,

we  must face it. One of the greatest difficulties in

instilling confidence in Chinese schools in Malaya is

the fear that either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



the  conscious or subconscious policy of the  British

Government  in  Malaya  is the Anglicization  of  the

Chinese  in  this country - a policy which  may  reduce

Chinese  into  a  secondary  language  in  their  own

Chinese schools. It is this basic predilection, but a

fact  which  must  be faced, that  we  must  resolve.

Before we can resolve that, we must be able to review

the  whole position and then to decide whither we are

going.  All this talk of multi-lingualism,  all  this

demand   for   multi-lingualism,   has   got    wider

implications  than just voting people whom  you  like

into either the Legislative Chamber or, (now it would

appear  not),  the City and Island Council.  It  goes

right down to the root of our educational policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a free and independent Malaya in which every

Chinese, every Indian, every Malay, will no longer be

Chinese,  Malay or Indian but Malayan, what  language

or  languages  shall  they speak?  What  language  or

languages shall the Government use? What language  or

languages will be acceptable to the people? What  are

the  language  or  languages of  an  independent  and

democratic Malaya? They are thorny, delicate problems

which many politicians would prefer to defer to  some

other day, when the problem should again reappear  in

acute  form. But I feel if we are to face, to  solve,

this  situation, we must be able to clear our  minds,

and  the  minds of the public, in the  way  that  the

Chief  Minister has said. Where do we stand  in  this

independent  Malaya? The Malays  want  to  know.  The

Indians  want to know. And the Chinese want to  know.

They are all going to be Malayans in this independent

Malaya, or they will leave this country. But they all

speak  their own languages. They all have  their  own

bias.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of the colonial government

hitherto - perhaps   subconsciously,    perhaps    even

consciously - has    been   one    of    Anglicization.

Malayanisation has been equated to Anglicization -  to

produce  a Malayan nation by making them all English,

or  learn  English, or learn about Francis Drake  and

his bowls, and Sir Walter Raleigh and his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



cloak, and daffodils and buttercups, which they  have

never  seen. This policy I think we must review,  and

we  must reformulate. We cannot resolve the situation

in  Chinese  schools  as long  as  they - the  parents,

teachers, principals and students - feel that there is

a conscious or even subconscious attempt to introduce

more  and more English into the Chinese schools. They

fear  one day the Chinese language in Chinese schools

will  be  reduced  to  a secondary  language,  as  is

already  happening in Malay schools, where  there  is

this  new  policy  of  Malayanisation.  I  think  the

Minister for Housing can confirm this - that there  was

a  definite policy to introduce the English  language

to such an extent in Malay schools that Malay parents

were  alarmed that their children will no  longer  be

Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if we allow each community to go on its

own  way  and  stir up all these extreme  prejudices,

then we are going to have a very difficult problem of

synthesizing  or  composing various individual  units

which  may then never merge. But we, I think,  unlike

the  colonial  government, cannot  afford  to  ignore

basic  likes and dislikes - basic facts. One  of  these

basic facts is that no racial or linguistic group  in

this  country will give up its own language, its  own

culture,  its own traditions, completely  for  either

English  or  any  other Anglicized  form  of  Malayan

language,  culture, or tradition. But we  must  solve

it,  and  it can be solved. In fact, it is  the  only

way,  or  we must give up. If we cannot resolve  this

problem, then we must resign ourselves to a Malaya in

which there will be internecine strife for years, and

years,  and  years.  I believe  there  are  men  with

sufficient  goodwill and - if I may borrow yet  another

phrase  from  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister - men  of

stature, in the Chinese, in the Malay, in the  Indian

and  in  the other communities, who will be  able  to

rise up to the situation, to rise up to this problem.

If  you can resolve this point now, in the context of

an  independent  Malaya which we  are  all  going  to

build, then I say we are opening up the way, we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



blazing a new trail. If we cannot, then we have  just

kept  this  problem  for the  future  when  it  would

probably   reappear  in  an  even  more   acute   and

unpleasant  form. And it is for this  reason  that  I

seek  to  extend  the  terms  of  reference  of  this

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I must remind the Member for Serangoon that

there  is no danger of this Committee being made  use

of  as  a rubber stamp for the Government. Any member

of  this Committee who feels that the recommendations

and  deliberations are contrary to his belief, or the

belief  of  his Party, has got the right to  dissent.

But  if this Committee is to do more than just to try

and  patch up, or to bottle up, the present state  of

the  schools in Singapore, then it must resolve  this

problem.  Is  it  the  policy in  Singapore  to  have

English  introduced  more and  more  into  Malay  and

Chinese  schools? Is it the policy to  allow  Chinese

education  to  go  on  uninhibited  in  a  completely

Chinese  orientated way? Similarly,  with  Malay  and

Indian   education.  Is  that  the  policy  of   this

Government  of  the Singapore Labour  Front - U.M.N.O. - M.C.A. - M.I.C. and  Malay  Unions?  Or  is  it  their

policy,  with  the support of other Parties  in  this

House,  to formulate a policy which will last,  which

will lead us to an independent Malaya?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is to be the lingua franca - English? Have we

decided?  Have we made up our minds? Have the  people

of  Singapore  and  the people of Malaya  decided  on

that?  Is  the  introduction of multi-lingualism  the

forerunner  of riotous confusion, as the  Progressive

Party  so often so riotously expressed it? Or are  we

in  our  inarticulate ways trying to resolve  a  very

difficult  problem, a problem of  building  a  nation

where  there  are  diverse  linguistic  and  cultural

groups,     where     cultural     and     linguistic

susceptibilities are restricted, so that it  may  fit

within  the framework of national security,  national

aspirations?  I  would not like to suggest  what  the

languages   ought  to  be  at  this  stage   of   the

proceedings of a Committee which is yet to be formed.

The problem must be tackled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



now.  It  cannot  be resolved just by  subconsciously

carrying   on  a  policy  instituted  by  a  colonial

government of introducing English into all schools in

the hope that, thereby, English would prevail in this

country, and, thereby, we would all become Anglicized

Malayans.  I  know the Minister for Local Government,

Lands  and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat)

has  very  strong  views on this  matter.  I  do  not

believe  we  cannot resolve the suspicion in  Chinese

schools.  The  allegation, the charge,  is  seriously

meant,    seriously   intended - that   the    British

Government  is  destroying the Chinese  language  and

Chinese  culture in these schools. You have  to  face

them.  One  could shrug, one could laugh it  off,  as

completely ridiculous. But if one does not face  this

problem,  one will never resolve it. In  every  issue

which  arises  over  the schools you  will  find  the

management committees, the teachers, the parents, not

as  active supporters of - if I may borrow a phrase not

from  the Chief Minister but from His Excellency  the

Governor -  "constituted authority". If  you  want  to

find  them behind "constituted authority", then  they

must  be  satisfied that "constituted  authority"  is

behind the things which they so basically desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I myself have been extremely careful not to

commit my Party or myself to any preconceived notions

on  this  subject. All we say is that there  is  this

very delicate problem. It must be dealt with, and  it

is no use confining ourselves to purely temporary and

ephemeral measures which will bring about a  lull  in

these  schools, without resolving basic  causes.  And

this is one of the basic causes. There may be others,

I  do  not  know. The Committee has not  started  its

deliberations. But I am confident that this is one of

the  causes  and we must resolve it. Whither  are  we

going?  Is  it  going to be a Malaya  with  a  single

language imposed on all its subjects? Or is it  going

to be a Malaya where various languages are allowed to

foster  and  to  flourish, but with a  common  thread

running through them, with one lingua franca,  or  as

the Minister for Housing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



would have it, one national language? What is to be

that lingua franca? These are problems which I think

we should seriously start to consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that the Labour Front Government is

the  people's  government. I cannot agree  with  that

because,  as the Hon. the Chief Minister will  admit,

he   had,  in  what  I  consider  more  disinterested

moments,  expressed  a  contrary  view.  It  is  very

difficult for him but it is dangerous, this defending

of   a  constitution  which  was  once  described  as

outmoded, because that was the slippery slope at  the

bottom of which lies the mangled political remains of

his once political opponent in Cairnhill. If you want

the  people  to  believe those things,  then  certain

radical alterations must be made to the constitution.

Perhaps  we  might start now by trying to  show  them

that we are prepared, that the Chief Minister and his

colleagues  are prepared, within what I  surely  will

admit are very conscribed limits, to start tackling a

very basic problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move this amendment to the motion, and it

is  my hope that the Government will approach this is

amendment,  not  with an idea that the  P.A.P. seeks

political  advantage, but that the  P.A.P. seeks  to

help the Government resolve a very difficult problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

before I support the motion, I wish to make it clear

to the House -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you seconding this amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. I first want a seconder

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then I want a seconder to the

amendment, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to second the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question was, inter alia,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a Committee be appointed with the following terms of

reference -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to investigate the situation in Chinese schools in Singapore and to make recommendations for the

improvement and strengthening of Chinese education

in the interests of Chinese culture and orderly

progress towards self-government and ultimate

independence in Singapore';



<br><br>since  which amendments have been proposed to  delete

the   words   at  the  end  of  that  Question,   "in

Singapore",  and to add to the end of  that  Question

the  words "and to review the whole policy of English

and  vernacular education in Singapore  in  order  to

formulate  a  considered  linguistic  policy  for  an

independent Malaya".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me, hon. Members, that there are, in

fact,  two  distinct Questions. One of  them  is  not

completely dependent on the other. I, therefore, will

first   propose  the  Question - that  the  words   "in

Singapore" at the end of the Question be left out  of

the   original  Question.  However,  that  would  not

prevent Members from speaking on both of them. I hope

I  have made myself clear. The Question will be  that

the  words "in Singapore" proposed to be left out  at

the  end  of  the Question be left out.  Members  can

speak  on  that  Question, as well as  on  the  other

Question, which I shall put after we have disposed of

the  first Question. The Question, therefore, now  is

that the words "in Singapore" proposed to be left out

of the original Question, be so left out.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am happy, Mr Speaker, Sir, to

inform the hon. Member opposite that Government  will

be  delighted to accept the suggested deletion. It is

somewhat improved language with an eye to neatness. I

see  that  he  has  used  the  words  "in  Singapore"

repeatedly. Government does accept the suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You are speaking on the amendment, Mr Lim?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> No.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Nobody wishes to speak? Then I put that Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words `in Singapore' proposed to

be left out, be left out," put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question now is that the following

words be added to the original Question, which has

since been amended to leave out the words "in

Singapore". I read out now the original Question as

amended. The original Question, as amended, is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a Committee be appointed with the following terms of

reference -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to investigate the situation in Chinese schools in

Singapore  and  to  make  recommendations  for  the

improvement and strengthening of Chinese  education

in  the  interests of Chinese culture  and  orderly

progress   towards  self-government  and   ultimate

independence'.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question now is that the following words be

added to the end of that Question: "and to review the

whole  policy of English and vernacular education  in

Singapore   in   order  to  formulate  a   considered

linguistic policy for an independent Malaya".



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must confess

I admire the temerity of the Member for Tanjong Pagar

who  asks  us  to  lay down a linguistic  policy  for

Malaya without asking the Federation to assist us  in

that effort, but all seems possible to the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar.  He asks us to expand  the  terms  of

reference  of this Committee which is now,  with  its

limited  reference, viewed with suspicion.  It  seems

the  Committee,  if  given these  additional  powers,

would  be  beyond  suspicion  and  quite  capable  of

performing its duties but, with the sole question  of

reference being Chinese education, it must be  viewed

with suspicion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that as far as I can see, this

amendment  is  somewhat of a  quibble.  If  the  hon.

Member  would  look a little more  carefully  at  the

terms of reference, he would not ask these rhetorical

questions  with  which  we  have  been  this  morning

bombarded. Where are we going? Quo Vadis! What is our

aim?  Are  we going to have Anglicization?  Would  he

look at those last words, "in the interests of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



Chinese  culture and orderly progress  towards  self-

government and ultimate independence"? So the  effort

is not merely to strengthen Chinese education, but to

strengthen  it  in the interests of  Chinese  culture

within the framework of orderly progress towards self-government and ultimate independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee, Sir, was chosen with the assistance

and  at  the suggestion of the Committee of Selection

of  this  House,  with  the  particular  question  of

Chinese education in mind, and the terms of reference

were  so framed that I, for one, though not a Member,

would understand that the Members are completely free

and,  in  fact,  are compelled, in the  interests  of

strengthening Chinese education within the  framework

of  our  movement towards an independent  Malaya,  to

consider  not  only  Chinese  education  in   Chinese

schools, but the general education of Chinese  pupils

in   schools   teaching  Chinese,  and  within   that

framework,  it  seems to me, they would  be  free  to

consider  and  advise on matters of languages  to  be

taught in those schools other than Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my view, Sir, that to seek to burden the

Committee   with   parallel  issues   of   vernacular

education in other vernacular schools may impede what

we  desire  in the way of rapidity in recommendations

and their early implementation. It is unquestionable,

Sir,  that this House must be seized of the fact that

the  question  of  education in  vernacular  schools,

other   than  Chinese,  is  under  consideration   by

Government.   The  reorganisation   of   our   entire

educational  system is under consideration,  but  the

recent  unhappy  incidents, indicating  an  unhealthy

position in a very important sector of our community,

make  it imperative that we should now move with some

rapidity  in order to clarify the issue  and  to  see

wherein  lie  our  immediate  efforts  to  strengthen

Chinese   education  within  the  framework   of   an

independent Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)

expressed the fear that we may be seeking to use  the

Progressive  Party as a rubber stamp for our  day-to-day problems. Now, Sir, I will confess that I have  a high



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



regard for the abilities of the Progressive Party  as

a  rubber  stamp,  but I can assure them,  and  every

Member  of this House, that this Government does  not

use  rubber  stamps and has no need for them  and,  I

hope, never will. I am happy to inform the Member for

Serangoon    that   the   idea   is   for   long-term

recommendations   in  order  to  strengthen   Chinese

education,  to  strengthen  discipline  within  those

schools,  and  to  aim  at  fusing  strong  differing

cultures into one whole - what my friend opposite,  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar, describes as synthesising

the various cultures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess it is with some surprise that I heard

the  Member  for  Tanjong Pagar again  speak  of  the

suspicion that we seek to destroy Chinese culture  by

Anglicization. The Committee, Sir, consists  of  nine

members, of whom seven are Chinese, and eight of them

were  returned by the people in open elections. Apart

from  the impossibility of seeking to destroy culture

which has survived, I am reliably informed, for seven

thousand  years,  it  seems  to  me  the  height   of

absurdity  that  there should be  such  a  suggestion

levelled  against such a body, and if so levelled,  I

cannot  see  how  the  expansion  of  the  terms   of

reference would in any way give it a better basis for

working.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

I  did  not suggest that the suspicion exists against

the   Committee  which  this  House  will  this   day

constitute.  I say this suspicion existed  and  still

exists  against  the educational authorities  of  the

former  Colonial Government and the present  Colonial

Government cum Labour Front Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I must confess to a certain

amount  of,  shall I say, unhappiness at the  thought

that there is anybody of intelligence in this country

who  would, for one single moment, imagine  that  the

Coalition Government of this territory has  any  such

ideas  in  mind. All our efforts have  been  directed

toward  the interests of the people, and at no  time,

despite our short life, have we failed them or showed

any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



indication  of  what is called a colonial  Anglicized

outlook. However that may be, speaking now,  Sir,  on

the  amendment,  I cannot see that the  burdening  of

this  Committee with the additional terms  would,  in

any  way,  assist this body in coming to  some  clear

decision  on the policy it is necessary to  formulate

for  the  future  of  Chinese education  within  this

territory. I feel, and I hope hon. Members here  will

agree, that the terms of reference are clear and that

the Committee may, if it so feels inclined, recommend

features   of  education  in  schools  dedicated   to

teaching  Chinese students in Chinese as well  as  in

other  matters, that they can indicate the  languages

which  they think should be taught, and I am  certain

that   this  House  will  take  full  note  of   such

recommendations. Other vernacular schools, Sir,  will

come under review at a later date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

May I ask the Hon. the Chief Minister whether, in his

opinion,  the  terms of reference as they  are  would

include  the  consideration of the  teaching  of  the

Chinese language in English schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May it please you, Sir, I do not

know  if  there  is  such a  thing  as  a  "point  of

information"?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You need not answer, Mr Chief Minister, if you are not ready to answer.

Mr Speaker, Sir. I mean if there is such a thing  as

can  give my personal view, and it is: the answer is,

"Yes,   certainly."   You   are   to   consider   the

strengthening of Chinese education -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In English schools!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Naturally! The strengthening of

Chinese  education is Chinese education,  in  schools

dedicated to Chinese, and in all other schools.  Sir,

I  do  not  like to say, "Chinese schools",  "English

schools",   "Malay   schools".   May   we   say   the

strengthening of Chinese education in all schools  in

the Colony?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words 'and to review the whole

policy   of  English  and  vernacular  education   in

Singapore   in   order  to  formulate  a   considered

linguistic policy for an independent Malaya' proposed

to be added, be there added," put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Question, as amended, proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

support  the motion, I wish to make it clear  to  the

House  that  if this motion is approved and  carried,

despite  my appointment as a member of the  Committee

to  investigate the situation in Chinese schools  and

to  make  recommendations  for  the  improvement  and

strengthening  of  Chinese education,  etc.,  I  will

reserve  the right to express openly in this Assembly

all  my  Party's  views  on  educational  policy  and

recommendations made by the said Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope and plead that someone who is really

interested  in Chinese education, someone who  really

realises the importance of Chinese education in  this

country  should  come forward - I sincerely  appeal  to

these  gentlemen  to study and understand  thoroughly

the   problems  of  the  non-English-speaking  people

before  they  may reach any definite  conclusions  on

Chinese  education. I sincerely hope that this  House

will study and give us the full history of the growth

of Chinese schools in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I much regret the recent trouble over

the  closure  of  the  two  Chinese  schools.  In  my

opinion,  because  I  read  two  papers - English   and

Chinese - I  feel  that  there is  much  difference  of

public  opinion  regarding this matter.  I  sincerely

believe,  Sir,  that  merely  calling  those  Chinese

students "little red devils" will achieve nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Question, as amended, put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC PASSENGER TRANSPORT COMMISSION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

Commission should be appointed to examine the  Public

Passenger Transport system of Singapore and to advise

on its development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of this Government is to nationalise

passenger  transport, and I think  there  is  general

agreement  in  this House that that should  be  done.

Indeed,  more than agreement, there is impatience  in

some quarters that that should be done as a matter of

urgency.  Now, I am moving for a Commission to  study

the  matter before we go too fast into it, and  I  am

aware  that I shall be accused of going too slow  and

that  we  ought  to  go faster and instantly  sign  a

notice  to the Traction Company, saying that  we  are

going  to  take  them over. Perhaps, to  indicate  my

respect for Chinese culture, amongst other things,  I

might  here quote Confucius, "Do not try to do things

in  a hurry. Do not be intent on small gains. What is

done quickly is not done thoroughly. When small gains

are regarded, great things remain unaccomplished."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, since there has been expressed elsewhere a

sense  of  urgency and hurry in this matter,  I  feel

that   I  ought  to  justify  the  time  which   will

necessarily  be  taken  up  by  having  a   Transport

Commission  to examine this matter, and I  think  the

first  thing that hours of gloom fulfilled".  In  the

days



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



I  had  better deal with is the meaning of  the  word

"nationalisation",  or rather the  meaning  to  which

this  Government would wish to attach to  that  word.

There  are numerous meanings which you can attach  to

"nationalisation", not all of them ones which I would

wish  to support. It is quite clear from the way some

people   talk   that  they  do  not  appreciate   the

difficulties   involved   in  nationalisation.   They

envisage  nothing more than a simple  transaction  by

which  the State purchases an article and then  says,

"I  have  now nationalised it." If that was what  you

are  doing with a motor-car, it would, of course,  be

no more than a simple transaction. If the State wants

to  buy  a  motor-car, they buy it  and  it  is  then

national property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are nationalising industry, it is a very

different  matter.  You are not dealing  merely  with

rolling-stock  or  buildings  or  stores.   You   are

dealing, much more importantly, with human beings. It

is  not  the mere matter of a transfer of control  of

the  industry from private capitalist bureaucracy  to

public  state bureaucracy. Now, this is where you  do

want  to  be careful if you are a capitalist, because

capitalists  very often tend to talk pure  Communism.

It  is,  in fact, the Communist view that that simple

transfer of ownership is all that is necessary at the

first  stage. They do regard it simply as a  straight

development   from   private  capitalism   to   State

capitalism - I  shall come to that in due course - but  I

do  want  to  make  it clear that  there  is  a  real

difference  between nationalisation, as  we  envisage

it,  and nationalisation, as capitalist-minded people

often envisage it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend of mine was saying to me recently, about

two days ago, that he could see only a hair's breadth

of difference between social democracy and Communism.

Now,  if  he had said there was only a hair's breadth

of  difference  between capitalism and  Communism,  I

should  have  been very much inclined to  agree  with

him,  because both capitalism and Communism  seek  to

have a small powerful group, or gang, which dominates

the  economy  and  controls the State.  That  is  the

traditional  background of both  of  them.  They  are

sisters under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



the   skin.   Social  democracy  is   a   matter   of

distributing  freedom  and responsibility  throughout

the  social  system  as  far as  you  can,  and  does

envisage  not  the maximum control  by  the  smallest

group of the elite that you can get together, but the

maximum  distribution that you can  achieve  and  the

continually  developing distribution of  freedom  and

responsibility, so that you can, in the  end,  arrive

at  your  fully free, fully harmonious  society.  The

Social  Democrat must reject the Marxist  idea  of  a

vast lumpen proletariat and small cadres of the elite

who  organise  it into appropriate demonstrations  of

support  and,  if  necessary,  bludgeon  the   lumpen

proletariat into the policies that they want  carried

out.  So  that  in  this matter of  taking  over  the

Traction Company - and I am sure that there are  people

who, in spite of what I am saying, will want to go in

for  a  State capitalist type of transfer - I think  we

ought to examine the experience of other countries in

regard  to  State capitalism. And we  had  better  go

back, I think, to 1929 where Russia's First Five-Year

Plan  says  that the workers' present-day  needs  are

repudiated  in  the  name of a monumental  historical

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in Russia that the techniques of State

capitalism have been developed and it is, of  course,

in China today, where the Chinese People's Government

is seeking to follow in that line. In the 1949 Common

Programme  of the People's Government, you will  find

Article 31 which says that "the economy based on  co-operation of State capital and private capital is  of

a  State  capitalist nature. Whenever  necessary  and

possible,  private  capital shall  be  encouraged  to

develop  in the direction of State capitalism."  And,

of  course Li Wei-han, a veteran Communist leader  in

China,  said  the  same  thing again  in  1953 - "State

capitalism  is  the  first  step  in  the   socialist

transformation  of  private  industry   and   private

commerce."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communist view is that when you have completed

the  process of State capitalism, and taken over  the

whole economy under the direct control of the State



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



bureaucracy,  you  then achieve the  lower  phase  of

Communism  and  you will pass on automatically,  they

hope, into the higher phase of Communism, You can put

it  more  simply, if you like, by saying  that  their

view  is that you make the State machine all-powerful

and,  by doing so, you destroy it. This is not a view

that  I  can accept at all. It is armchair theorising

which  bears  no relation to the findings  of  modern

research.  The  whole error and  evil  of  capitalist

thinking - whether  it is private capitalist  or  State

capitalist - is that it values the machine too high and

the  human  being  too low. It is too  excited  about

technology and about the possible advances in the use

of  technology,  and it ignores the  rights  and  the

needs  of  the  human  beings  who  are  involved  in

technological change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this sociological ignorance, when

you  make  a transfer from private ownership - as  with

the Singapore Traction Company - to State ownership, if

you  make it in this simple State capitalist type  of

transfer,  you  are liable to run into  very  serious

difficulties in your labour relations. The State,  as

it  becomes  the owner, inherits all the  antagonisms

which  have  been built up under private  capitalism.

The   class  relations  of  private  capitalism  have

produced  certain attitudes in the workers - attitudes

of  suspicion,  attitudes  of  enmity,  attitudes  of

fear - and when, by a stroke of the pen and signing  of

a  cheque,  you  take  over this  private  capitalist

enterprise into public ownership, you are  liable  to

carry with your purchase all those ill-feelings which

can be so disastrous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Seletar (Mr M. P. D. Nair), in

our  debate on the Governor's Address, suggested that

the  essential test of socialism was whether we  were

prepared  to hurry blindly into State capitalism  for

this  matter  of transport. I hope I am  interpreting

him   correctly - he  will  have  an   opportunity   of

interpreting  his  own words later  on  if  he  wants

to - but he stressed that the true test was whether  we

got  on  immediately with taking over of  the  Singapore Traction Company, and if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



did not do so, he proposed to put up a motion that we

should do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the true test of socialism is not whether you

are prepared to jump into a thing without looking  at

it  thoroughly. There are two tests. I  think,  which

meet  the Member for Seletar's point. The first  test

of  socialism  is  that you have a  determination  to

secure  a planned economy; and the second test  is  a

determination that the plan should meet the needs  of

the   people   and  should  distribute  freedom   and

responsibility as widely as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I presume that there will still be speeches

in  favour  of State capitalism, and I  think  I  had

better  continue to outline some of  its  defects  by

practical  examples. I have already told  this  House

that,  under  the Russian theory of State capitalism,

the  present-day needs of the workers were, and to  a

considerable extent are, repudiated in the name of  a

monumental historical purpose. In theory, the workers

accept and endorse this repudiation of their present-day  needs. In fact, of course, very severe  coercion

is  needed  to compel the workers to accept  the  low

standard  of  living and poverty in  which  they  are

compelled to live, and I will give you a few examples

of some of the decrees which, from time to time, have

been  used. In 1929, there was a Russian State decree

imposing  a minimum of three years' imprisonment  and

the  maximum  of  death by shooting  for  people  who

damaged transport installations. I am sure that  some

of  the  more  excitable authoritarians of  Singapore

would  have welcomed the existence of such  a  decree

for  dealing with the people who damaged the Hock Lee

buses. In fact, there were people who were anxious to

have  the bullet take the place of persuasion, and  I

can  only say to the authoritarian-minded person that

a  good Social Democrat does not wish to fly into the

powers of coercion. Those powers must exist. You  may

always come across the man who is quite unamenable to

anything  except a sock on the jaw, and, if  so,  you

have to give him a sock on the jaw. But they are  not

normally  necessary and they should be  kept  in  the

background as far as they possibly can; and we look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



forward, of course, to a society some day in which

those powers will not be used and will not be necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order.

I will stop him if he is not relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I expected that somebody would

rise  to  object to this exposition.  I  expected  he

would    appear    from    the   capitalist    party!

[Interruption.] I expected that the capitalist  party

would fall into this trap! If I may look a little further ahead, I have provided

for  myself  to say that I expected that  there  were

Members  present in the House who were  not  familiar

with  this  sort of approach to industrial  relations

and  who  were  not  accustomed  even  to  listen  to

expositions of theory. But I have sought  to  justify

my  exposition of theory by indicating the nature  of

the  take-over  which ought to  take  place  in  your

nationalising an industry and by seeking to  indicate

the  defects  of  the  automatic take-over  of  State

capitalism,  as compared to the co-operative  type  of

take-over  of  the Social Democrat; and,  subject  to

your  stopping me, Mr Speaker, I will continue  with

my exposition of these facts, until you indicate that

I have exhausted your capacity for objections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 1940 decree - I am only quoting these instances to

indicate that when you take over industry under State

capitalist  methods, you do automatically  inherit  a

great  deal of labour difficulties, and I think  that

that is obviously a point which must be considered if

you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



are  taking over an industry - a 1940 decree in Russia:

two to four months' imprisonment for going out for  a

smoke,  or  for  going  to the lavatory  without  the

foreman's  permission; corrective labour and  25  per

cent  cut  in pay for coming twenty minutes  late  to

work.  Now,  that  sort  of  thing  does  indicate  a

tremendously  bad  state of labour relations  if  you

have  to  have penalties of that nature in  order  to

control  your  workers and keep them at  their  jobs.

Well, it is a horrible state of labour relations  and

they ought not to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the collective farms Mr Mgeladze reported in the

Georgian Soviet Republic that nearly 25 per  cent  of

the  workers were not completing their proper  number

of   labour  days.  And  in the  Chinese   People's

Republic, the Peking People's Daily lists some of the

means   of   conflict  employed  against  the   State

capitalist  system by workers who do  not  dare  have

recourse  to open sabotage. There again,  of  course,

the  workers  are  compelled to  obey  by  corrective

labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I will now pass on to the practical problem

before  us.  The  problem is to get  a  take-over  of

industry  in  which  you  will  not  have  a  head-on

collision  between the workers and the employer  who,

in  this  case, will be the Government. When you  had

the  recent  Hock Lee trade dispute, it was  possible

for  Members  of  the  Government  to  intervene  and

mediate. It would not be so easy for them to do so if

the  Government was, in fact, the employer.  This  is

not a matter of small importance but a matter of very

great  importance indeed, one which  should  exercise

the  minds  of  the  House.  The  problem  of  these

industrial  relations  will occur  anywhere.  It  has

occurred in the nationalised industries in the United

Kingdom,  and  is  occurring today in  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board.  The achievement of  good  industrial

relations  is  basic and vital but it  is  not  easy.

Incentive   schemes,  revisions   of   pay,   working

conditions, joint consultation, do not in  themselves

provide good industrial relations, nor, of course, do

the  capitalist  and State capitalist  techniques  of

coercion, repression, corrective labour, im-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



prisonment  and  shooting; it goes much  deeper  than

that.  So  I hope I have made it clear that I  reject

State  capitalism as the objective in taking over  of

the  Traction Company, and I hope, without prejudging

what  the  experts  will advise,  that  we  may  look

towards   what  Dr.  Ramanohar  Lohia,  the   Indian

Socialist, has called 'immediacy'. I am happy to  see

that the -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir, is the motion -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

Commission should be appointed to examine the  Public

Passenger Transport system of Singapore and to advise

on its development"



<br><br> - or  is  it  a  motion  on  a lecture  on  socialism,

capitalism,  State management, industrial  relations,

Communist Russia, or the People's Republic of  China? Which is it?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point has been raised, Mr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The point has been raised, but

unfortunately the Member for Tanjong Pagar was out of

the room! The point I am making, if I may go back  to

the  satisfaction of the hon. Member, is  that  I  am

afraid  that there may be Members here who will  wish

to  jump  into  what they will call 'nationalisation'

without   sufficient  thought  and   without   proper

planning, and I am trying to argue that that would be

a most dangerous thing to do and that a Commission is

necessary to advise us before we go too fast into the

matter of taking over transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I will pass on, if I may, to a point which

was  made  by  the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  in  the

debate on the Governor's Address, when he was dealing

with  this question of nationalised industry;  and  I

may say that, far apart as their political views are,

the  Member for Tanglin made a point of rising to say

that  he  fully agreed and endorsed the matter  which

the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar had put  forward.  The

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  directed  our  attention

primarily  to  the  profits which might  be  made - the

potential  profits  which might be  made-out  of  the

transport system if it was taken over by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



Government.   He   pointed  out   that   nationalised

transport   everywhere  else  in  the   world - so   he

said - made profits and we could make big profits  here

too. I was rather surprised at this because it seemed

to me to show much less than his usual clear thinking

and  careful study of the matter under consideration.

I  should like to say most definitely that the aim is

not  to  establish a monopoly to exploit the  workers

and  to  exploit the public. This is by no means  our

intention, and I hope that you will take note  of  it

and,  if  you have ever at any time thought  that  it

was,  that  you will duly repent. The aim is  to  end

exploitation and to produce an efficient  service  to

the  public, and I very clearly said so  when  I  was

replying  to  the Address. If we can end exploitation

and produce an efficient service, then the public and

the  whole  economy will benefit,  and  that  is  the

benefit  which you seek from nationalisation.  It  is

perfectly  true, probably, and I expect Members  will

agree,  that there is no reason, as far as I can  see

at present, why publicly-owned transport in Singapore

should   not   be,   in  fact,  a   sound,   economic

proposition. It should be able to pay for itself.  It

should  be  able to accumulate capital  for  its  own

development   and   expansion   and   extension   and

improvement,  and  it  may even  be  possible  for  a

Transport  Authority without exploitation to  make  a

contribution  to  general revenue.  But  the  revenue

derived  by  Government from  it  is  not  the  first

consideration; it is very far from being so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to give my most emphatic assurance again

that   there   is   no  intention  to   exploit   the

Government's dominance of the transport situation and

there  is no intention of repudiating the present-day

needs  of  the  workers  for a monumental  historical

purpose. So much for the Government attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that it is not enough for the

Government to have the correct attitude. The  correct

attitude   must   permeate  the  whole   nationalised

industry,  and  that  is the point  why  you  need  a

Commission, because these matters of labour relations

are  very, very badly understood in Singapore.  There

would not be half the strife that there is if there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



were  good  labour  relations on a proper  scientific

basis.  A lot of ignorant people and excitable people

involve themselves on the managerial side and on  the

workers' side, and muddle the situation up in a quite

unnecessary  way. I am not saying that everything  is

well  with  the  workers  or  with  management;   the

industries are not necessarily perfectly run.  But  I

do  say  that  the  methods  of  joint  consultation,

methods  of  industrial  democracy,  which  ought  to

exist, are by no means fully developed and until they

have  been  developed, you will not get  satisfactory

labour relations; and I therefore hope that we  shall

be able to get from this Commission some guidance and

leadership on the matter of how the labour  relations

problem  should  be  envisaged in  dealing  with  the

nationalisation of passenger transport.  It  involves

matters  of  training,  selection,  promotion,  joint

consultation,  all  kinds of  organisational  matters

which are highly technical and which I will not weary

this  House by attempting to expound. If anybody asks

me  to,  I will be very happy to say something  about

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is in the United Kingdom the London

Passenger  Transport Board. It is one of the  largest

industries  in that country and employs some  hundred

thousand   persons.  It  has  been   under   national

ownership  for  nearly a generation, and  it  has  an

excellent  record  both for technical  efficiency  in

providing transport services, and for efficiency  and

happiness and harmony in its labour relations. We are

hoping  to  get, as our expert, somebody  who  has  a

thorough  knowledge  of  the working  of  the  London

Passenger  Transport Board, and  of  other  transport

organisations,  who  will be able  to  bring  to  our

problems here the expert knowledge derived from  long

experience elsewhere. I hope that I shall be able  to

make an announcement about that shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will pass on to a matter I will deal with much

more briefly, because it is almost purely a technical

matter.  I have in my office a very nice map  showing

the  present transport system of Singapore Island - the

passenger transport system on the roads. I thought of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



bringing it into this Chamber and displaying it,  but

I thought it would only cause alarm and confusion. If

any Member would like to see it sometime, either call

at my office or I will bring it across to this House.

All  you  can say about it is that it is not easy  to

understand  how it arose or why it should  exist.  In

fact,  there  has  been  a long  outcry  against  the

present system of passenger transport in this country

by  the  public and by the workers, and  there  is  a

massive problem before us to bring order out of  this

state  of  confusion. This is a technical  matter  in

which  we must not seek to prejudge the advice  which

the Commission will give; it is a matter which should

be  considered  by  an impartial expert  and  not  be

bedevilled  by the various interests that do  operate

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say this, however, about the

transport  services - that in the  rural  areas,  there

does seem to me a very real need for an expansion  of

transport  services, and I am sure that many  Members

in  this House will agree with me. If you extend  the

map that I have - it does not cover the whole island - it

shows the core of the problem, but, of course, as you

extend  outwards, you get a thin line leading off  to

Johore and a thin line leading off to Changi, and  so

on,  and  then great masses of the country  have,  in

fact,  no  transport services at all. They  have  not

even  got  roads. All they have got are  tracks,  and

pretty  bad  tracks at that, and  I  hope  that  this

Commission  will  be  able to take  account  of  that

problem,  and  that we shall be able to do  something

for the rural areas as part of the general problem of

getting  the public transport system of this  country

both   into   a  rationalised  state   and   into   a

nationalised state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must, I suppose, deal briefly with the

financial aspects of the takeover. I shall move  with

the  greatest caution in the jungle of case law which

is  applicable  to such matters and  which  confronts

you, because, as soon as you pick up one word of  the

thing,  you  find  that  it  has  a  long  string  of

interpretations behind it which goes back to sometime

in the previous century or, possibly, to Magna Carta.

I think I had better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



perhaps read to hon. Members Section 29, because  the

newspapers do not seem to have read it, and  possibly

hon.  Members  are not familiar with  precisely  what

this   matter  of  the  take-over  of  the  Singapore

Traction  Company  is.  This is  Section  29  of  the

Singapore Traction Ordinance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Commissioners may within six months after the

fifth  day  of June, 1955 or within six months  after

the  expiration  of any subsequent  period  of  seven

years or within three months after the making of  any

Order by the Governor in Council under either of  the

two  immediately  preceding  sections  by  notice  in

writing  to the Company require the Company  to  sell

and   thereupon  the  Company  shall  sell   to   the

Commissioners  (that  is the City  Council  now)  the

whole   Undertaking,   land,  buildings,   generating

stations,  substations, car sheds, works,  materials,

stores, rolling-stock and plant of the Company  as  a

going  concern.  The  total price  failing  agreement

shall  be  fixed by arbitration, and in  arriving  at

such total price the Arbitrator shall have regard  to

the  fair market value of the Undertaking, as a going

concern,  but  without any allowance being  made  for

compulsory purchase."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. and learned Members of the House may wish to

put  their minds to work on what interpretation could

be  put on that Section when you are trying to fix  a

price  for  the  take-over of the Singapore  Traction

Company,  or  when you are taking over.  Or,  if  you

cannot  take  it  over  by  an  agreed  price,   what

interpretation  an arbitrator would  put  if  he  was

trying  to  decide  what the  price  should  be?  The

phrases  "the  whole Undertaking"  and  "as  a  going

concern"  are  not  as  simple phrases  as  they  may

appear,  and  I  am sure that the lawyers  will  find

plenty of employment in deciding what they mean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I might also, in regard to the financial

aspects,  quote from a Press cutting from  the  Stock

Exchange  Gazette. This has the rather rural  heading

of  "Magpie's Gossip". It is not at all rural in  its

contents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rather more than a year ago, I was able to pass on

the  news that the Singapore City Council had decided

to  adopt the Report of a Committee which recommended

the   purchase  of  the  Singapore  Traction  Company

undertaking. On the basis of this Report, the  shares

looked   a   most  attractive  proposition   at   the

prevailing  price  of around 26  shillings,  and  the

quotation, in fact, soon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



improved   to  well  over  30  shillings.  Legitimate

anticipations  engendered by the favourable  attitude

of  the  Council in the matter of nationalisation  of

the  transport company were, however, knocked on  the

head."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Progressives were in then!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Perhaps I shall, Sir, read the end of this article:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At their present price of 23 shillings and 3 pence

the  shares  provide a generous gross yield  of  over

eleven per cent. I have previously estimated the real

value  of  the assets as equivalent to  at  least  40

shillings,  and  one may reasonably assume  that  the

figure  has  been  enhanced during  the  past  twelve

months.  The  take-over prospect must now  be  viewed

with circumspection."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magpie's Gossip" will no doubt be receiving

cuttings of reports of this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not at all sure that this aspect of the

position should be completely set aside. The will to

transfer the Singapore transport services to the

basis of a public utility is obviously there, and

usually where there is a will, there is a way.

Furthermore, it may well be that last month's

Singapore elections, which have established the

Labour Front as the strongest Party, will have an

important bearing on future developments. At all

events, the Labour Party is strongly in favour of

nationalisation of utilities, including transport."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for "Magpie's Gossip". I do not know

anything about it at all myself. I do not deal on the

London Stock Exchange. I do not know who "Magpie" is,

and  I do not necessarily endorse what he says.  That

is  what the Stock Exchange Gazette has to say  about

the  profitability  of ownership  of  shares  in  the

Singapore Traction Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point that I think I might let

hon.  Members  know about, if I can  find  it  in  my

jumble  of papers. It is about the Singapore Traction

Company  Accounts for 1954. I will pass over most  of

them  and turn to the fixed assets which are recorded

at  the  head  of  the column: "Fixed Assets - Traction

Ordinance and Goodwill, �228,144". I leave it to hon.

Members  to  form their own opinions  about  that.  I

merely lay it before you as one aspect of the problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



which  exists,  but  that is the  Singapore  Traction

Company's estimate of the value of its Ordinance  and

its goodwill. I make no further comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have indicated, at rather great length perhaps,

that   there   is  a  need  for  expert  advice   and

consideration  before we hurry  too  fast  into  this

matter of nationalisation. We do not call in a doctor

and  then  decide what we are going to  tell  him  to

prescribe for us. I hope that Members will make  many

comments  and have many ideas to contribute  to  this

matter  of public ownership of the transport  system.

The  object of this motion is to provide Members with

an  opportunity  for  a  debate,  and  you  have  the

opportunity.  I  hope  you  will  take  the   fullest

advantage  of it. Speaking for myself, I  shall  most

certainly welcome all contributions that Members have

in  the  way  of  ideas,  or suggestions,  or  expert

knowledge,  and I hope that they will be  forthcoming

in large quantity.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> I thank the Minister

for  Communications and Works for  his  very  lengthy

lecture on social democracy, capitalism and what not,

but  I  must  confess that I have learnt very  little

from  it,  particularly when he tried to convince  me

that  democratic socialism is much further apart from

Communism  than  capitalism, and that the  difference

between  Communism  and capitalism  is  by  a  hair's

breadth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there is urgency in this matter, and that

has   been  definitely  stated  in  His  Excellency's

Address  when he says, "The unsatisfactory  state  of

public transport calls for early action, and to  this

end  the Government contemplates the setting up of  a

Transport  Authority  which  will  include   in   its

functions the allocation of routes and the fixing  of

fares."  It is well-known that Government, consisting

of  the  Labour  Front  and its  associate  coalition

Parties, has committed itself to nationalise the tran-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



sport   system.  So  why  wait  and  cause  all   the

uncertainty  of this unsatisfactory state  of  public

transport  that  is going on? We  all  know  that  no

public  company can run efficiently  if  it  has  the

Sword  of  Damocles  hanging  over  it,  a  cloud  of

acquisition  in a very, very short time.  This  cloud

has  been hanging over the Singapore Traction Company

for  many  years,  as a result of which  I  am  quite

certain  as much money as possible has been paid  out

in  dividends  or  in  other ways  instead  of  being

ploughed  back into the Company. That is one  of  the

reasons  why  I think the buses here are  now  by  no

means  a great credit to our City. We do not see  the

latest  types of buses which are being run in  London

by the Road Transport Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want Government to do is to acquire the

Singapore Traction Company, and you can take all  the

time you like to straighten out how to take over from

the  Company, and to go to arbitration for the  price

they  ask for. I admit I have not been able to  study

the  Ordinance particularly well, and  I  would  have

liked  an  opportunity to study Section 29 and  speak

after  the  Adjournment; but, to my mind,  all  these

things  can be worked out. There is no such thing  as

no  strikes  in a Government-owned transport  system.

When  the Labour Government in Great Britain  was  in

power, there were strikes also, and strikes will have

to  be  faced by the present Government if  it  takes

over the Singapore Traction Company. It has got to be

worked  out, either now or later on, and  why  should

you have all this uncertainty of the public having to

suffer  a  bad  transport system  which  we  have  in

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of Government proceeding to acquire this

Company,  it  has  now just asked for  permission  to

examine  the  transport  system  and  advise  on  its

development. It appears to me that this is an attempt

to build a "red-tape" for the Hon. the Chief Minister

to  practise, using the pair of scissors given to him

by  his electors. The urgency in this case is that if

we  do  not  exercise the right under Section  29  to

purchase the Singapore Traction Company, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



may   have  to  wait  for  seven  years  before   the

opportunity  arises again, and then  you  will  still

have  the  same  prolongation of the  uncertainty  of

acquisition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressive Party, on the other hand, knows its

mind  and  has  filed a motion in  the  City  Council

asking it to exercise its rights under the Ordinance.

That   is  our  complaint  today:  that  the   Labour

Government,  instead  of governing  the  country,  is

spending  its  time  trying to  form  committees  and

commissions.  Apart  from the Powers  and  Privileges

Bill,  there  are only three matters of substance  in

today's  agenda -  in two, Government  is  asking  for

committees  to  be formed, and in  the  third  for  a

commission. We want Government to govern us and carry

out  its  duties.  Do  not be afraid  to  do  things.

Acquire first, and then iron everything out later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very

unhappy  when I have to agree with any of the remarks

made  by some Members on my side of the House because

they often agree for very different reasons but I  am

pleased  to say today that the Member for Paya  Lebar

(Mr  Lim Koon Teck) has given a reason which I think

is  fairly  sound and fairly reasonable.  The  Labour

Front should make up its mind what it is going to  do

about  the  Singapore Traction Company. It  came  out

with  clear  and concise statements on  its  election

platform. If it was thought necessary that we  should

do   research   on   social   democracy,   industrial

relations,   the  United  States  or  the   Socialist

Republic  of Russia, all the rest of it, that  should

have  been  in  the election platform. The  long  and

short  of it is this - let us have a Commission because

we  really  do not know what to do about it.  Let  us

therefore take the ipse dixit of someone whom we  are

going  to  import from the London Passenger Transport

Board  and  "I will tell you who it is on some  other

appropriate occasion when I am in an awful  situation

and  then I will bring this rabbit out of the top hat

and  say, 'I have got the people.' If I have not  got

the answers I have the people who have the answers."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the Minister for Works was a

confirmed  Socialist. After what I understand  was  a

lengthy  recitation  on  many  other  topics  besides

transport, of which happily I was only able  to  hear

the tail end, I am quite confused now as to where  he

intends  going. Is he going to take the S.T.C. buses

and  settle  "Magpie's" doubts or is he  not?  Is  he

deterred  from  taking  over the  S.T.C. because  he

cannot understand Section 29? What is the difficulty?

Is  it  the  price fixing? If it is, well  the  price

fixing  can  always be settled as a separate  matter.

That has nothing to do with the principle whether  or

not the Singapore Traction Company should cease to be

a   private  monopoly,  and  become  either  a  State

monopoly  or  a State corporation. The  latter  is  a

completely different problem and when Members on this

side of the House also say that it should be so, then

I  think  the Labour Front should have confidence  in

going  boldly forward, quite certain that there  will

be  no  sniping  at  its flanks.  What  I  am  really

astounded  at is that the Member for Paya  Lebar  had

really given us, quite unintentionally I am sure, the

evils  of capitalism. When a company is faced with  a

situation  which  it knew must come sooner  or  later

when  it first started, when it must face dissolution

or nationalisation, it deliberately sends out capital

from the country, and runs buses which in his opinion

(and  I  am  glad to hear that he has good  taste  in

buses)  are  a  disgrace. Therefore this  disgraceful

capitalist  should be allowed to leave  decently.  He

should have all his doubts resolved now. Let us  take

them  over  and let us pay them the compensation  for

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure that "Magpie", whoever he is,

cannot  be  altogether  unaware  when  he  made   his

estimate  of the worth of buying shares in a  company

which is going to be taken over, cannot be altogether

unaware  that  the then Colonial Government  cum  its

Progressive  Party aides were favourably disposed  to

the  susceptibilities of employers who have  to  look

for  further  employment in some other  part  of  the

world.  I  do  not  understand  the  change  in   his

estimation at the tail end of "Magpie". I should have

thought that one of the reasons why the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Paya  Lebar is anxious  that  we  should

resolve  the  doubts of those who own  the  Singapore

Traction Company is that it is quite likely  that  if

the  matter  persists long enough the  situation  may

well  reach  that  point where,  after  an  intensive

course   of   lectures   on  socialism,   capitalism,

Communism and the differences between them all,  that

Transport Company will find that its balance sheet is

no  longer the test of the worth of the Company.  The

stocks and shares in the Stock Exchange may take very

rapid  turns long before the take-over.  I  think  we

should not be unduly constrained by the thought  that

if  we  miss  this opportunity we shall not  have  it

again for seven years. Laws are made to be unmade and

to  be  remade.  The  Hon. the Attorney  General  has

passed one this morning with the greatest of ease.  I

think we should not have the slightest difficulty  in

amending  Section 29. Let it never be forgotten  that

this  House  cannot bind itself. No  government  can.

Certainly I do not believe that any government should

bind  itself  on  the  question of  public  passenger

transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are in fact two very different problems,

one - public  passenger transport as depicted  in  this

beautiful  map with red lines and blue lines  growing

thinner  and  thinner as they depart  away  from  the

City.  Two,  the  problem of the  Singapore  Traction

Company. One is a long-term problem. The other is  an

immediate   one.  In  my  opinion  a  Commission   is

completely irrelevant in so far as it is to help  the

Government make up its mind on the Singapore Traction

Company. No one on this side of the House would  deny

the  Government  the assistance of  a  Commission  to

investigate  and  to explore the question  of  public

ownership  and public transport. Where the  Singapore

Traction  Company is concerned, that is  a  different

matter.  We,  on this side of the House,  hope  there

will be a clear and categorical statement of policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this debate

seems  to have degenerated into a question of whether

we  are  to  purchase  a certain commercial  concern,

which is very much concerned with being bought out at

the moment because, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



far  as  I  can discover, its shares stand at  a  low

price  and  because by the valuation which it  places

based  on  the  interpretation  of  the  section   in

question, the shareholders will get about four  times

the  money which they can now get in the open market.

I  think it can be easily realised why there is  this

anxiety  that  we  should buy the Singapore  Traction

Company shares. We have the City Council, Sir, coming

into  it  now.  They are going to buy  the  Singapore

Traction  Company with peanuts, I suppose. I  do  not

quite  know  how they expect to get the  money.  Only

this  Assembly  can  give them the  money,  and  this

Government is not going to give the City Council  the

money to purchase the Singapore Traction Company. Let

that be clear. The Singapore Traction Company is  not

going to be taken over at this juncture. We regret we

are   not  distributing  Hari  Raya  bonuses  to   the

shareholders in London or in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are accused of not running the Government, but of

merely   appointing  commissions.  We  do  not   need

commissions  to  help us make up our minds.  We  need

commissions  in  order  to  assist  us  to  put  into

operation the ideas which we have in mind. We do  not

know  all  the  answers, and we are  not  ashamed  to

confess it. We have our policies and they are  clear,

but we do need assistance in putting them in force. I

see no necessity for taking over the Traction Company

now.  We will take it over in due course, but we will

take  it  over as part of a whole, not piecemeal,  to

please any individual shareholder.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Thomas, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not feel that I need say

very  much, Mr Speaker, Sir, on what the Member  for

Paya Lebar said about the Sword of Damocles, and  not

the  sword  of democracy, hanging over the  Singapore

Traction   Company.  He  said  it   could   not   run

satisfactorily. Of course, the Committee that sat  on

the  Traction Company sat for three years holding the

Sword  of  Damocles  over their heads.  The  Traction

Company



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



does not itself hold the view on which the Member for

Paya Lebar feels so tenderly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am unable to say what the policy of the

Government  may  be  in regard  to  public  passenger

transport.  The policy we have adopted throughout  is

to plan ahead without reference to any possible take-over."  That is the Chairman's firm asseveration.  He

is not worried about the take-over. They are planning

ahead on the understanding that the take over may  or

may not come about. They quite recognise that they do

not  know what the policy might be; they do not  mind

about  it apparently in the least, and they are quite

happy to make 12 per cent dividend. If it is a matter

of  whether they are ploughing their capital back you

can  argue  about  that  if you  want  to.  They  are

ordering  40  Guy Arab single deck bus  chassis  with

Gardner engines, and pre-selector gear-boxes;  and  a

further  18 if they want them. So they are putting  a

certain amount more into action and, of course,  that

all  increases the price of the take-over if  you  do

take-over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with the argument that we should

acquire  first and iron everything out afterwards.  I

have  spent a long time in trying to explain  why  it

was  a  bad  thing to do. I am afraid the Member  for

Paya  Lebar  admitted that he had learnt very  little

from what I had said, and I will repeat the old crack

about "I can give you arguments but I cannot give you

brains  to  understand them." There is no urgency  to

make  up  our  minds right now as,  though  the  City

Council is rushing into a motion, we have right up to

the 5th December to do so. If you want to take it  up

under  Section  29  of  the Ordinance,  there  is  no

particular  hurry to take it up by  tomorrow  or  the

next  day. There is no reason why you should not have

the  Commission to give you advice in  three  months'

time  and you will still have plenty of time to write

a  letter  if you want to and arrange for  the  take-over.  It is not such a difficult matter as all  that

to write a letter to the Traction Company if you want

to; and I cannot think there is anything else much to

reply to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar seems, on the whole,

to  agree  with me. He seemed to start by disagreeing

and  to finish up by agreeing, I thought; but  I  did

not  quite follow his argument, except that he wanted

to indicate that we had not made up our minds, and  I

hope that he now realises that we have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

Commission should be appointed to examine the  Public

Passenger Transport system of Singapore and to advise

on its development.

<div align="center"><b>OF CITY COUNCIL AND RURAL BOARD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in rising to move the motion  standing

in my name, I wish to state that my colleagues and  I

do  not  feel  disposed  to  agree  with  the  Rendel

Constitutional Commission's recommendations on  local

government by which the City and Island Council would

become  a  single  local  government  authority  with

jurisdiction  over the whole island of Singapore  and

responsible  for  the  majority of  local  government

functions on an island-wide basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea of a single island-wide local authority in

Singapore,  with a large city population  and  a  not

inconsiderable rural population and its admixture  of

the  city  area and much larger rural area, does  not

adequately  fulfil  one of the primary  functions  of

local  government,  which  is  to  give  the  maximum

opportunity  for the largest number of the  community

to  take  part in local government. Local  government

service  is  the place where people learn,  and  this

political education is very necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



to   the  whole  process  of  the  democratic  state.

Therefore,  the  more  opportunities  people  get  of

taking part in local government, the better it  would

be for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, again, I consider that rural and urban

interests are conflicting and incompatible  and  that

it  is  hardly  expected of a small City  and  Island

Council  of 24 (32 if aldermen are included) to  hold

the balance between the urgent needs and interests of

the  urban  areas and those of the rural  areas.  The

ideals, ways of life and the conception of the art of

living of the urban dweller are diametrically opposed

to  those  of the rural dweller. To rural inhabitants

in  Singapore,  living in areas  far  away  from  the

centre of activity, the City and Island Council could

become an impersonal body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also advisable to consider whether it is

desirable  to have on this island two authorities - the

Legislative   Assembly  and  the  City   and   Island

Council - of  such  size  and powers.  The  concept  of

government  in Singapore, in my view,  should  be  to

establish  the  Legislative Assembly as  emphatically

the responsible body for the welfare of the island as

a  whole,  while  at  the same  time  bringing  local

government matters of suitable character much  closer

to the real control and interests of the rate-payers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in consequence of the foregoing reasons,

the  whole question of reform of local government  in

Singapore  should be considered afresh. To that  end,

my  motion indicates the lines on which the suggested

reforms should take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to appoint a committee to inquire

into  the  desirability of decentralising the  powers

and  functions  of  the City Council  and  the  Rural

Board,  and inquire into and make recommendations  on

the  desirability  of  setting up  District  Councils

appropriately   named  and  responsible   for   local

government functions in different geographical  areas

of  the island, having regard to the municipal status

of  the older parts of the city area. In my view, the

Royal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



Charter establishing Singapore as a city need not,  I

think, be a block to reorganisation of this kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the reorganisation, also, this committee

is   being   asked   to   inquire   into   and   make

recommendations  on the desirability of  establishing

statutory corporations responsible for the supply  of

water, electricity and gas and for any other services

now  performed by the City Council. I am  aware  that

the   Rendel   Commission  recommended  that   public

utilities like water, electricity and gas should, for

the  time being at any rate, be placed under the City

and  Island Council. But it is considered  that  this

aspect  of local government reform could be  inquired

into again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally also, in considering the reform of local

government in Singapore, it will be necessary also to

inquire  into and to make recommendations on the  re-allocation    of   the   functions   and    financial

responsibilities  between the  Government  and  local

authorities. Appendix One of the Rendel Report  lists

the  main functions proposed for the City and  Island

Council. It appears to me that a number of the larger

of   these  functions  could  very  appropriately  be

transferred to one or other of the Ministries,  while

other functions might be retained as municipal by the

local councils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in keeping with this Government's declared

intention  to  introduce  multi-lingualism  into  the

proceedings  of local authorities, this committee  is

being  asked to recommend the procedure to be adopted

and  also the languages in addition to English  which

should be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now formally move the motion

standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

Committee  should  be appointed to enquire  into  the

desirability   of  decentralising  the   powers   and

functions of the City Council and the Rural Board and

in particular:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to enquire into and make recommendations on the

desirability  of  setting up District  Councils

responsible  for local government functions  in

different geographical areas of Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to recommend names for such District Councils

and  the  boundaries within which  they  should

function having



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



regard  to  the municipal status of  the  older

parts of the city area;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to enquire into and make recommendations on

the   desirability  of  establishing  statutory

corporations  responsible  for  the  supply  of

water,  electricity and gas and for  any  other

services now performed by the City Council;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to enquire into and make recommendations on

the   re-allocation   of  the   functions   and

financial    responsibilities    between    the

Government and the local authorities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to make recommendations on the procedure to

be  adopted to allow the business of the  local

authorities  to  be conducted in  languages  in

addition  to  English and  to  recommend  which

languages should be allowed;



<br><br>and to report in accordance with the foregoing

provisions.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

second  the  motion moved by the Minister  for  Local

Government, Lands and Housing. As Members are  aware,

I  have  been for over four years connected with  the

City Council of Singapore as an elected Councillor. I

can  therefore  claim to have some knowledge  of  the

workings of local government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local government, by its very nature, is essentially

one that is closely connected with the daily life  of

the people. The decisions taken by a local government

body  regulate the day-to-day life of the  population

and  so  much so that they become part and parcel  of

the  life  and  habits  of  the  population.  It   is

therefore  very  desirable that the local  government

body  should  be brought as close to  the  people  as

possible,  and that the public in every part  of  the

island  should feel that they are closely  associated

with   and  are  themselves  responsible  for  taking

decisions  which  affect their day-to-day  life,  and

particularly   decisions  which  affect   their   own

locality.  A  system of allowing the people  in  each

district  to  regulate their own day-to-day  life  to

suit  their  own local conditions would be impossible

with   the  establishment  of  an  island-wide  local

government authority, as is recommended in the Rendel

Commission's Report. Such an island-wide  local  body

could, at its best, be only very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



remotely connected with the people, and I think  this

remote  connection  with  the  people  is  the   main

objection to an island-wide body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore have pleasure in seconding the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just heard

yet another invitation, this time from my hon. Friend

the Minister for Local Government, to avoid the awful

moment  of  decision  and at  a  time  when  we  were

promised  the  First Reading of the City  and  Island

Council   Bill,   to   join  a  committee   for   the

reconsideration  of  the  entire  problems  of  local

government.  The hon. Members opposite remind  me  of

the  words  of  the old hymn - "They  shivered  on  the

dreadful brink and feared to launch away."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> On Progressive waters!



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> This is the most astonishing about-turn that the Government has yet made in its short

life. At least on the question of public transport we

had  an  inkling of what was to come when an election

pledge  for  the  nationalisation  of  transport  was

watered down in His Excellency the Governor's  speech

to the establishment of a transport authority to deal

with  routes and fares, and thence by easy stages  to

the setting-up of a commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, however, remind the House of the statements

we  have  already had in this Chamber on  the  coming

City  and  Island  Council Bill.  In  the  Governor's

speech  we heard that "a Bill to establish  the  City

and Island Council will be ready for consideration by

the  Assembly in the near future". A few  days  later

the Hon. the Chief Minister, in opening the debate on

the Governor's speech, stated as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It had been hoped that today we would have at least

one  more  Bill  tabled, the City and Island  Council

Bill.  The  Government recognises how urgent  is  the

measure  and how important that we should not further

prolong  the  prolonged  life  of  the  present  City

Council."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following day the Chief Minister, addressing

the,  Member for Seletar (Mr M. P. D. Nair),  stated

that "there may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



be  room for pleasant surprise in the meeting to come

on the City and Island Council Bill." The surprise of

indecision and delay after so much promise of  prompt

performance  is an unpleasant one; all  the  more  so

because  we were only given 24 hours' notice of  this

retreat  from  a  prepared position. So,  instead  of

carrying on at once with what only a month ago was an

urgent  measure we are to go three or four  years  in

reverse to reconsider the ground covered by the  Hill

Report, the recommendations of the Rendel Commission,

and  all  the  committee reports and memoranda  which

have  been poured out on all these subjects. I  would

further  add  that  the  present  Government  has  no

mandate  for such a step from the electorate who  put

them in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose, Sir, to consider the various

questions raised by this motion in detail today,  nor

can  I be expected at 24 hours' notice to do so,  but

one or two points need to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the principles of decentralisation of

local  government functions, as advocated largely  by

Dr. Hill, it has to be remembered that we are dealing

with a small area of about 220 square miles. Will  it

be  economical, will it be expeditious,  will  it  be

efficient, to have numerous District Councils  dotted

over the island to carry on rural administration, and

what  will the effect be of making the City  Council,

or  whatever the Central Municipal Authority will  be

called in the future, even more powerful and more  of

the  'big brother' in its relationship with them than

is  the case with the Rural Board today? Shall we not

have  District Councils with different  policies  on,

say,   hawkers   or  attap-housing   or   water-borne

sewerage?  And  how are overlapping and  extravagance

and delays in administration to be avoided?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years we have had the example before us of

dual  control  in traffic matters, the  City  Council

being  responsible  for certain  aspects  of  traffic

control,   and   the   Government   Traffic    Police

responsible for others. And no hon. Member here would

care  to  say  that  that was an ideal  or  efficient

arrangement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in agreement with the view that the rural

areas will have a much larger share of responsibility

for  the  administration of the island at  the  local

government level through representation on  the  City

and Island Council, and they will have a large enough

proportion of the 24 seats on the Council  to  ensure

that their views are heard to good effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to paragraph (c) of the motion, the

question   of   establishing  statutory  corporations

responsible for the supply of water, electricity  and

gas - in  other words, the present trading  departments

or public utilities in the City Council - let me say no

more  than this: the present system is one of  public

ownership;  the  establishment  of  corporations   is

another  form of public ownership - a distinction  with

practically  no  difference. What,  then,  is  to  be

gained? - little or nothing! Indeed much is to be lost,

because  as soon as these public utilities leave  the

control  of  the  City  Council,  their  considerable

properties will be subject to assessment from payment

of which they at present enjoy complete immunity. The

obvious  result will be evident within six months  or

so  of the establishment of these corporations,  that

the prices of electricity, water and gas will have to

be  increased. It has been suggested on more than one

occasion  that  these  public  utilities  should   be

removed  from  political control, but  cannot  it  be

fairly  argued  that in the last few  years  politics

have  seen  to it that rates have not been  increased

despite  very  heavy  capital  expenditure  on  these

undertakings?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards paragraph (d) - the reallocation of the

functions and financial responsibilities between  the

Government  and the local authorities - I  am  informed

that   exhaustive  recommendations   were   made   to

Government  on the whole of this question  only  last

year.  Any  further survey of this field would  be  a

waste of time and effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the subject of multi-lingualism and the

procedure   for  its  adoption,  is  the   Government

seriously  implying  that it has  no  well-considered

plans on how this should be carried out, despite  the

fact  that it was an important plank in its platform?

Can it be that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



the Government, having found it difficult in the last

few weeks to make any firm decision of its own in one

language,  now  wishes  to  pass  on  to  others  the

responsibility of deciding how to conduct business in

four  or more? And indeed, Sir, is not this the  root

cause  of  this extraordinary eleventh  hour  motion,

namely,  that the hon. Members opposite have not  got

the  courage of their own convictions? I say to them,

"Get  on  and  govern."  If you  are  convinced  that

District  Councils and electricity  corporations  and

decentralisation   are  the  best   form   of   local

government,  then  it  is  your  job  to  draft   the

necessary legislation and bring it before this  House

and  use your majority to get it passed. But  do  not

expect  us to do the work for you, so that later  you

may  get  all the credit for work that goes on  well,

and pass on the blame to this side of the House if it

does not. We have the remarkable position whereby the

Government is trying to have the best of both worlds.

Policies  are  to  be worked out in committees  by  a

coalition of Parties, and executive action then taken

by the Government Party alone. This is not the way in

which  democratic institutions operate. This  is  not

the way in which party government operates. We reject

this  policy  of 'passing the buck' and  of  avoiding

responsibility  and  shirking  unpopularity,  and  we

oppose  this  motion. Let the hon.  Members  opposite

make  their  own  decisions and stand  by  them,  and

govern  as  a  popularly elected majority  government

should govern. And let them realise that there  is  a

growing  body of public opinion from every  community

and class throughout the country which considers that

their  actions show that they have been in power  for

seven weeks too long.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must also

regret  the  somewhat  hasty  about-turn  that   this

Government  has found necessary in a  matter  of  two

months. It is not a matter which should have been  so

lightly  reversed. When they drafted the  Address  by

His  Excellency the Governor, the Government had then

taken  stock  of the position and had  at  that  time

decided to go on with the City and Island Council



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



Bill.  We  must have more explanation why it  is  now

thought  necessary  that this whole  Bill  is  to  be

scrapped and a commission instituted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sympathise with them in viewing the City and

Island  Council provisions with a degree of suspicion

and  of unhappiness. That was, with the exception  of

the present Minister for Labour (Mr Lim Yew Hock), a

Progressive  Party  concept. It  had  its  attractive

qualities. It was neat; it was simple. You  drop  out

the  25th  constituency, and you have 24  nice,  neat

constituencies for your City and Island Council.  You

have  the  same  machinery  for  elections  and   you

transfer half, or more than half the functions  of  a

little   government  like  that  of  the  Colony   of

Singapore, to another semi-government body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a lot to be said - and I think it should

be said much more fully before this debate closes - for

reviewing  it  from  this point  of  view:  that  the

Government feels that a more democratic framework can

be  set up to associate more and more people with the

governing and regulating of their own lives;  and  if

Rural  District Councils is one method of  doing  it,

then Rural District Councils should be created. But I

think this matter has been viewed too lightly. It  is

not a matter that can be resolved just by a committee

or  a  commission, either of this House alone  or  to

include  outsiders. Before this motion is passed,  we

would like to have the Government state categorically

why  it was that, within these eight weeks, they have

decided that there were cogent and strong reasons  to

abandon  the  City and Island Council  Bill,  and  we

would wish to hear it now.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

received  this paper only last evening, stating  this

motion will be moved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on the Municipal Commission from 1938 to 1948. We had been always fighting to have co-ordination in this small island of Singapore between

the City Council, the Improvement Trust and the Rural

Board. In the post-war period we had the Hill Report.

Then we had the recommendations by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



Rendel Commission. The present coalition Ministry run

by  two Nominated Members and three Officials decides

to  put  this recommendation into practice and  bring

the motion before this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I will not like to take any interest in

this  motion  because  we  have  not  got  sufficient

notice.  If this coalition wants to run in their  own

way,  let them go on. How long can they go on in that

way?  Personally  I would side with  the  Member  for

Tanglin  and the Member for Tanjong Pagar. I  do  not

think  I  will take any interest. Let the  Government

carry on with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped

to  spare  hon.  Members  of  this  Assembly  further

addressing them today. I must confess that  the  plea

of   the   Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  for   further

information is, to my mind, a legitimate  one  and  I

would like to ask you - before I do so, I would like to

deal with the petulant Member for -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Telok Ayer?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Will you withdraw the

word "petulant", Mr Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I withdraw it, Sir. He seems to

blame  the Government for having received the motion

paper  somewhat late. I should not like to  put  any

blame  anywhere, Mr Speaker, Sir. It  seems  to  me

that  that  is  a matter within the jurisdiction  of

the  Speaker,  and were it out of order,  you  would

have  so ruled. I have no doubt, Sir, seeing  it  as

it  stands on the Order Paper, that it was given  in

time - sufficient notice according to  the  rules  was

given - and if the Member for -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Telok Ayer?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - Telok Ayer cannot gather his

thoughts  together  in 24 hours,  perhaps  he  would

like  to move that we should make special rules  for Members from Telok Ayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the somewhat abusive tone of the remarks

from  the  Member for Tanglin, I must  confess,  Sir,

that  I can find nothing constructive in them, and  I

find  it not necessary to consider them further.  But

the request for an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



explanation from the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  is  a

legitimate  one, as I have said, and  the  answer  is

this:  We were appointed as a Government on  the  7th

April.  In,  I  think, seventeen days we  had  to  go

through  a  great deal in order to acquaint ourselves

with  our  Ministries,  work  out  a  new  tradition,

organise  ourselves  as a team, because  it  must  be

remembered that it is not the Labour Front alone that

is  the  Government, nor the coalition  that  is  the

Government -  as my learned Friend keeps on  insisting

and  rubbing in to some extent truthfully - and we  had

to  learn to work as a team, and it was then that  we

understood that there was the City and Island Council

Bill  ready on the stocks which required but a little

amendment for the purpose of adding the multi-lingual

sections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when it came to consider other matters that may

be  cognate  to the multi-lingual sections,  I  would

like to reserve my position on what I had hoped would

be a pleasant surprise-and which I hope still will be

a  pleasant surprise - in matters in relation  to  the

Bills   that   would  be  introduced  ultimately   in

connection with the City and Island Council.  But  it

was   then  discovered  that  we  were  creating  and

perpetuating  and strengthening, in a  small  island,

two     bodies - the    Assembly    and    the     City

Council - independent almost of each other,  with  very

considerable  powers,  and  that  the  City  Council,

though  allegedly parochial in character, would  have

such  considerable authority that it could flout  the

decisions and impede the execution of the policies of

the Assembly. That is a dangerous position in a small

island, and we see, to some extent, how it is working

today  when hon. Members representing the Progressive

Party  talked blithely - may I say, to my mind, with  a

certain  sense of irresponsibility - about a motion  in

the  City  Council to purchase the Traction  Company,

without seeking to co-ordinate their action with  the

action  of the Government; without seeking to  inform

themselves  as to our views when, having issued  that

notice to purchase, they come along to us and ask  us

for money, and find they cannot have it! When City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



Councillors   can   descend   to   the   status    of

irresponsible  little children,  as  has  been  amply

proved here today by the words of the Members of  the

Progressive Party, you can appreciate how very really

dangerous  the position would be if the City  Council

were  given  powers independent of the Assembly,  and

authority which could flout our decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we have been attacked for having

commissions. One would imagine we had invented  them.

I,  for  one,  would not be ashamed to have  invented

commissions.  But having come to the conclusion  that

it  was  dangerous to have this island-wide authority

juxtaposed to this very Assembly, we then went to the

Rendel Commission which gave it birth, and from there

to  the Hill Commission, and from there to certain of

our own local experts. The problems are vast ones and

a  commission  can be very helpful,  not  seeking  to

avoid  our  responsibility, as has been so sneeringly

suggested,  but  seeking  for  the  welfare  of  this

country  that  all should be given an opportunity  to

co-operate.  We  have never sought to  make  political

capital - that  we leave to the Party  that  makes  the

charge - and  I  would like to add this:  that  if  the

Progressive  Party  and the party representing  Telok

Ayer  do not wish to take part in assisting in  these

deliberations for the formulation of a policy,  of  a

procedure  for  the  parochial  government  of   this

island, they would be very welcome to abstain - we hope

they  will have the courage to abstain - or disown  the

hon.  Member  who  has spoken so  sneeringly  of  the

commission. That is the explanation of the Government

for  what  is  called the volte-face.  There  is  no

change in policy.

<div align="center"><b>UNIVERSITY OF MALAYA (STAFF TRANSFER) (AMENDMENT) RULES, 1955</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection

(2)  of  section  11  of  the University  of  Malaya

Ordinance, 1949 (No. 12 of 1949), resolves that  the

University  of  Malaya (Staff Transfer)  (Amendment)

Rules,  1955, made on the 24th day of March,  1955,

and  published  as Notification No.  S  106  in  the

Gazette  Supplement No. 26 of 7th  April,  1955,  as

contained in Sessional Paper No. S.L. 1 of  1955  be

approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in comparison with the important public

matters that we have been debating today, the subject

of  my  motion  is of somewhat minor importance,  and

should any Members of the House wonder why it is that

they  have  to give their attention to it,  I  should

perhaps  explain at the start that it is because  the

Rule  of  which I am seeking approval is  made  under

section 11 of the University of Malaya Ordinance, and

subsection  (2)  of  section  11  of  that  Ordinance

requires  that  any  Rule made  thereunder  shall  be

approved by the Legislature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter, Sir, concerns the conditions of service

of a number of members of the staff of the University

of  Malaya. As the House is probably aware, when  the

University  was set up in 1949, the King  Edward  VII

College  of  Medicine - then a  Government  department - ceased  to  exist  and  was  incorporated  into   the

University.  That  meant  that  the  then  Government

servants  who  formed the staff of the  College  were

given  the option of remaining in Government  service

or  joining  the University; and it was necessary  at

that time to safeguard the right to pension and other

superannuation benefits which those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



officers  had. This was done by some Rules  known  as

the  University of Malaya (Staff Transfer) Rules, and

they  were duly passed and formally ratified. One  of

the provisions of those Rules was that an officer who

had been pensionable in the Government service should

continue  to  be eligible for his Government  pension

and for an additional pension for the period in which

he  was  serving  at the University  of  Malaya.  The

University, which does not itself pay pensions,  will

repay  to  the Government the cost of the  additional

pensions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, so good; but a number of difficulties were

then  discovered. One was that those  Rules  provided

that  the pension should be calculated on the  salary

the  officer  could reasonably have been expected  to

draw had he remained in the Government service. That,

we  have agreed, was not equitable, because it  meant

that,  in  fact, an officer who joined the University

and  subsequently obtained promotion, and thereby got

a very much higher salary, could not have his pension

calculated on that higher salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty was that these posts no longer

exist in Government service, so it is really going to

be  difficult in ten or fifteen years'  time  to  say

what salary the Government would have paid to a tutor

or  a  lecturer  if  the  Government  had  then  been

employing  tutors or lecturers, which it is  not,  in

fact, doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another difficulty arose out of the

apportionment between the Government of Singapore and

the  Government of the Federation and the  University

of the financial liabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the upshot of all these difficulties, and some

rather  prolonged discussions, has been that we  have

found  a  solution  which has been accepted  by  this

Government, by the Government of the Federation,  and

by  the  University, and is also  acceptable  to  the

people  concerned.  That solution  can  be  described

quite  simply:  it  is  that we  should  tackle  this

problem  in  the  same way as a  similar  problem  is

tackled  between different governments. We have  what

are known as the Colonial Mixed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



Service  Pension Rules, and they provide for  exactly

this  sort  of  difficulties  where  an  officer  has

service with more than one government; for example, a

man may serve in the Federation, or in Singapore, and

then  come  back  to  Singapore,  and  he  has  mixed

service. Those rules provide a satisfactory solution.

Without going into technicalities, they provide  that

when  the  officer retires, his pension is calculated

on his then salary, and it is apportioned between the

various   authorities   who   have   undertaken   the

liability.  This  proposal has been accepted  by  all

parties   concerned,  and  it  has   been   effected,

authorised,  by the Rules, to which I  have  referred

which  were  laid in Sessional Paper No.  S.L.  1  of

1955. And I now seek this Assembly's approval of that

Rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to add one further point, Sir, and

that is I am not quite clear in my own mind, Sir,  as

to whether it could be held that the Rule of which  I

am   seeking  approval  commits  the  Government   to

additional  expenditure. It will, in fact,  have  the

effect  of making some light increase in the  pension

bill -  it  is  extremely difficult  to  estimate  it,

because it depends on the age to which officers  live

and  the  salaries they draw, and how long they  live

drawing  their pensions. But, peradventure, Sir,  you

should  have any doubt as to whether, under  Standing

Order  No.  33  (2), this does involve a  commitment,

without  prejudice to your ruling  on  that,  Sir,  I

would  like to state that I have the consent  of  the

Governor to move this motion. I therefore move.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with sub-section

(2)  of  section  11  of  the  University  of  Malaya

<div align="center"><b>EXPENDITURE ON NEW SERVICES AND REVOTES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the Government

should  be empowered to authorise expenditure on  new

services  up to a limit of $10,000 in each case,  and

revotes  of provision approved in the previous  year,

pending the covering approval of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, in connection with new services:

During  the  course  of  the year,  the  Treasury  is

presented with numerous requests for small  sums  for

services  arising out of the day-to-day routine  work

of  government. These services refer to such  mundane

matters   as   the  purchase  of  office   equipment,

accounting machinery, unexpected repairs to vehicles,

the  purchase of new vehicles to replace those  which

have  become  unserviceable, donations to  charitable

institutions,  supplements to annual recurrent  votes

such   as  for  telephones,  light,  fuel,  municipal

services. The requests involve no principle which  is

novel  or  which  is  likely to be  contentious.  The

requests  are complete in themselves and  involve  no

continuing  or contingent liability. The amounts  are

small - $l0,000 would cover the largest of them, and  a

great  majority would be considerably less. I  cannot

say  that  any of these items are of extreme urgency.

On the other hand, they are all important. It will be

convenient, and the machinery of government will  run

more  smoothly,  if  they can be  approved  forthwith

pending the approval of the Assembly, and if they  do

not  have  to wait until the submission of  the  next

schedule  of applications for supplementary votes  to

the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, in connection with revotes: It

sometimes happens that capital projects such  as  the

building  of a school, a bridge or a road,  which  it

was  hoped to complete within one year, cannot be  so

completed. Financial provision for the project lapses

at  the end of the financial year, but the work  must

continue if loss and harm to the project is not to be

suffered.  Similarly, sometimes goods  and  equipment

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



ordered  for  delivery within a year,  and  for  some

reason   or   other  delivery  cannot  be   obtained.

Financial  provision lapses and delivery takes  place

perhaps  very  early in the new year. It  is  clearly

necessary  in such cases that the unexpended  portion

of  the  vote  should be immediately available.  Work

goes  on. Wages must be paid. Cost of materials  must

be   met.  Payment  must  be  made  when  goods   are

delivered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said it was clearly desirable that the

unexpended portion of the provisions for the services

should  be  immediately available, and  hon.  Members

will  appreciate that considerable difficulties might

arise  if  we  had to await the next sitting  of  the

Assembly   for  approval  to  incur  expenditure.   I

therefore   seek  authority  to  approve   unforeseen

revotes as and when the need arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection hon. Members will bear in mind

that  the projects to which these revotes relate have

been  considered by the Legislature in  the  previous

year  and funds have been voted. No new principle  is

involved; no new money is required. I would also  say

that  if  this  power is approved, it  will  only  be

exercised  in  connection with work  which  has  been

started,  or  in  respect of goods  which  have  been

ordered,  and  will  not of course  be  exercised  in

connection with work which, for some reason, has  not

been  started or in respect of goods which  have  not

been ordered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would say that if this delegation

of  authority is approved, the items for new services

and  revotes  which are approved under the  delegated

authority  will be included in schedules which  will

be presented to the Assembly for covering approval at

the earliest convenient opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let it be seconded first.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

Will   the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary   explain

whether,  in the first instance - the $10,000  for  new

services - whether  that money could  be  expended  for

emoluments or salaries of posts created for these new

services?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> No, Sir. This power will not be exercised

for  the creation of new posts. The creation  of  new

posts   would  involve  a  contingent  or  continuing liability.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

make it clear that we do not doubt the integrity, the

honesty,  and the careful discretion of the  exercise

of  this power which is being sought, but it is on  a

matter  of  principle that I seek, on  a  motion  for

amendment, to delete from this motion the words after

"in  each  case" the words "and revotes of  provision

approved  in the previous year, pending the  covering

approval of this Assembly".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the fundamental rights of

a  House  of  Representatives of the  people  is  the

control  of  finance,  and the  first  principle  any

student of constitutional law is taught is the  right

of a House of Parliament to control the Government by

the control of the purse. This is not to say that the

Government  will not exercise and conduct  itself  in

such a manner as to be almost beyond reproach, but if

the  House  of Commons in Britain does  not  find  it

necessary to have this practice of the revote,  I  do

not  see  why, however cogent, however convenient  it

may be, we should have this system in Singapore. This

is  a  carry-over of the old colonial system where  a

small Legislative Assembly would resolve itself  into

a Committee of Estimates; where a small group of four

or five unofficials sit on the Finance Committee, and

where  things are done conveniently as  part  of  the

colonial machinery. We are leaving behind that  past,

and  we  like to have this first right - on our way  to

becoming a House of the People, of representatives of

the  people - to  have  a say in every  expenditure  of

public funds. If a project



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



is  in  operation and cannot be completed before  the

financial year runs out, then it is the duty  of  the

Financial  Secretariat  and the  Hon. the  Financial

Secretary  to  see  that the matter  is  put  in  the

present year's Estimates, in time for that project to

go   on.  A  procedure  whereby  the  Government  can

continue with something it started last year on funds

which  were voted last year, in conditions which  may

have  radically altered, and in which the people  and

its  representatives may feel it necessary no  longer

to continue expending that money, is not one which  I

think should be continued.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words `and revotes of

provision  approved in the previous year pending  the

covering  approval of this Assembly' proposed  to  be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I am not an expert on the

constitutional procedure in the House of  Commons  in

the  United  Kingdom  but I suspect  that  work  must

continue  over from one financial year to another  in

the  United  Kingdom, and I also suspect, subject  to

correction,  that  provision is made  in  the  United

Kingdom  for revotes. Perhaps I should have explained

before what precisely a revote is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, we have a considerable

programme of capital expenditure each year. Sometimes

the  programme  of work laid down by the  Legislature

exceeds  the capacity of the Public Works  Department

to  complete,  but they do make an attempt  to  press

ahead  with  what  work they can  undertake,  and  it

sometimes  happens that, perhaps, a  school  budgeted

for  in the Estimates for 1955 cannot, for one reason

or  other,  be  started until July.  Perhaps  it  was

intended  that  it  should be started  in  March  and

finished by November. If started in July and  it  has

to  continue on till the next year it would be  folly

to  leave that school without a roof until such  time

as the Assembly met again and would approve funds for

the project.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very careful to point out, Sir, when I asked

for  this power, that it should be exercised with the

greatest  discretion,  that  no  new  principle   was

involved,  that  no  new  money  was  involved.   The

desirability   of  the  project  had   already   been

considered by the Legislature and funds approved, and

that  actually the work was in progress and  that  we

would  not  exercise the power except  in  connection

with  work which had to be started and which, in  the

interest  of  Government,  should  be  continued  and

completed without delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say no more, but I give that assurance. I am

as conscious as my hon. Friend the Member for Tanjong

Pagar, of the constitutional principles involved.  It

is,  in  fact,  my earnest endeavour  to  ensure  the

financial   procedure  under  this  new  constitution

follows as closely and develops along the same  lines

as  that  in the House of Commons. I can only  say  I

have   given  this  careful  thought,  and   I   feel

constitutional principle is not being  endangered  if

this  authority  is given, subject to the  conditions

which I have stipulated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other portion of the amendment,

namely   "pending  the  covering  approval   of   the

Assembly", I feel that it is constitutionally  proper

that,  whatever  action is taken  by  the  Government

under   this   delegated   authority   to   authorise

expenditure up to $10,000, if approved, it should  be

submitted as soon as possible to the Assembly for its

covering approval.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for one who

is  jealous  of  the  constitutional  rights  of  the

approval of this Assembly".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It was quite unintentional.!

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In that case, I would like to

say  this on behalf of the Government and in  support

of  my  colleague: that we are very  jealous  of  the

powers  of  this Assembly in controlling expenditure,

and  we  would remind you that it is the duty of  the

Assembly  to  control  expenditure.  It  would   make

government impossible if it were to hobble Government

to  the point of preventing the necessary revotes  at

the  appropriate  time  when  that  expenditure,  not

having been completed, the work continues, and  money

is  required.  Your control is always  in  this,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the control of the Assembly,  that  we

have  to  come  to  you  and ask  for  your  covering

approval. That is your control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I correct my

motion  for amendment? In my amendment, I  had  asked

for  the  deletion of the whole of the  phrase  which

follows "in each case", forgetting that "pending  the

covering approval of this Assembly", in fact, covered

both   the  first  clause - the  expenditure   of   the

$10,000 - and the revote clause. Now, I would ask  that

my  amendment  be  corrected  to  read  "delete  'and

revotes of provision approved in the previous year' ",

leaving behind "pending the covering approval of this

Assembly". That was the amendment I intended.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no provision in the Standing

Orders  to  amend an amendment like this,  but  since

there  has been an indication that some Members would

like  to  leave  in the words "pending  the  covering

approval  of this Assembly", I propose to  take  that

amendment in two parts, so that the Question which  I

will  propose  is  that "the words  'and  revotes  of

provision approved in the previous year' be left out"

in  the  first instance. That Question is now  before

the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I would propose an amendment to the amendment.

amendment, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I would add the following words after the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will you wait until I try and explain

it  to you? The Question now before the House is that

the  following  words  be left out  of  the  original

out, be left out," put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words 'pending the covering

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the object of this amendment is quite

clear, and I need not emphasise it. We want the -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have it in writing, please?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.

indicate which Assembly he means? Which word does

he mean - the first line or the last line?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> The last line, Sir.

before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move that

the Question be put.

Seletar.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is too late now. Is there anybody

else  who  wishes to speak on the original  Question?

should  be empowered to authorise expenditure on  new

services  up to a limit of $10,000 in each case,  and

revotes  of provision approved in the previous  year,

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, the business of

this  sitting  has been more expeditiously  completed

than   anticipated,  and  not  even  the  moment   of

Sir,  I  would ask your indulgence that the  relevant

Standing Orders be suspended, after the completion of

business,  in  order  to  enable  a  motion  on   the

Adjournment to be taken; and after the completion  of

the   business  of  this  sitting,  to   permit   the

required  to  enable  the Chief Minister  to  move  a

motion  that  at  the end of today's  business,  this

might say, will not prevent anybody from speaking  on

the  Adjournment when, after that proposal  has  been

made  and  is carried, another motion will  be  moved

that  the  meeting do now adjourn.  Can  I  have  the

general assent of Members?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion made, and Question proposed, -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That  this  Assembly  do now  adjourn."  (The  Chief

Minister).

<div align="center"><h4><div align="center"><b>PROCEEDINGS IN THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</b></div></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reporting and Scripted Speeches)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged for

having obtained the right to speak on the motion  for

the  Adjournment. The matter which I  wish  to  raise

before  this House is one of considerable  importance

not  only  to  this Assembly, but to  the  people  at

large.  There  are approximately not  more  than  one

hundred   people  at  any  one  time   watching   the

proceedings of this Assembly, and it is a  matter  of

vital  importance that a fair, impartial and unbiased

account of the proceedings of this Assembly should be

given  by  agencies which are within the  control  of

this  Government.  Neither the  Government  nor  this

Assembly have any right to dictate how our newspapers

are to give their accounts of the proceedings in this

House.  But  we  take  strenuous  objection  when   a

Government agency like Radio Malaya, both in its news

bulletins  and in its monthly accounts of proceedings

in  the  Assembly, gives an account which leaves  the

listener  with  an  impression  which  is  completely

different  from  that which a person sitting  in  the

Strangers' Gallery would obtain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that either the Chief Minister

or the Chief Secretary has in any way been personally

responsible for these reports. I would say that it is

part    of   the   legacy   of   a   colonial   past.

[Interruption.]    We   should    not    have    such

unparliamentary language from a person  who  occupies

so  high  an  office  in  this  country  and  in  the

hierarchy  of the colonial system. He should  conduct

himself  with more propriety and decorum.  He  should

remember   that   even  if  he  is   not   personally

responsible for these reports, he should not, as  the

Member  responsible for that branch, allow an agency,

which  in more democratic countries in the world  are

fair  and impartial corporations, to be an instrument

of government propaganda.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to go too far back into the past,

but  I  think  whoever listened to the 1.30  news  of

Radio  Malaya after the emergency meeting last Monday

would  have  believed that the House was filled  with

nothing  but a roaring peroration from the  Hon. the

Chief   Minister  reading  out  his  lurid   account,

unchallenged,  of what took place. [Interruption.]  I

beg  the  Chief Minister's pardon, but one  finds  it

difficult to overcome the habits of a colonial  past.

It  is not the Chief Minister. When one thinks of the

person in authority one always thinks of the colonial

official  as that person, the person who directs  the

course   of   affairs.  The  Chief  Secretary   spoke

approximately for some seventy minutes in this House.

I  could  not believe that report over Radio  Malaya,

and  I  therefore  went back to  check  my  facts.  I

discovered  that I spoke approximately  five  minutes

less   than  the  Chief  Secretary,  and  the   Chief

Secretary's  tirade received almost ten minutes  over

Radio  Malaya's  1.30 p.m. news, and the  Opposition,

the  answer  to his speech, was dismissed in  fifteen

seconds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if the English Press, or the Chinese

Press, or the Indian Press, were to do that, we would

make  no  complaint.  We  believe  in  Democracy.  We

believe  in the right of a free Press. But we believe

in  a fair, unbiased public radio corporation. We  do

not  want  the  wireless to become an  instrument  of

government  propaganda,  particularly  in   reporting

accounts of what took place in this Chamber. The only

way  in  which  a fair and impartial account  can  be

given, other than by the Hansard publication of  this

House  itself,  would be through an  agency  such  as

Radio  Malaya.  This  raises  important  matters   of

principle, which previous governments had neither the

inclination  nor  the will to face.  It  is  only  in

colonial  territories,  or in Fascist  countries,  or

totalitarian countries that radio stations  are  part

of  the  government machinery of propaganda. In  more

democratic countries they come under the control of a

board of trustees of impartial men of integrity,  who

run it in the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



interests. Whilst talking on this point, E would draw

the  attention of the Chief Minister to what he  must

know is a very important matter, which should receive

his  early  attention as soon as he has  settled  the

more  urgent  matters which now bedevil his  Cabinet.

But this is a matter which must be tackled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reliably understand that the present Director of

Broadcasting in Singapore is going home on leave  for

consultations  with  the Colonial  Office  about  the

creation  of  such  a  public corporation  for  Radio

Malaya.   It  is  a  good  sign  that  even  colonial

officials  can  learn  and can  try  to  live  up  to

democracy, but I think it is more important  that  we

in  this  Chamber, who represent the  people,  should

take  the  initiative,  and  not  leave  it  to  some

energetic colonial official.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to make another point in relation

to proceedings in this Assembly. The Public Relations

Office is rightly an instrument for the dissemination

of  the  Government's  point  of  view  and  for  the

providing of facilities to foreign correspondents and

other  newspapermen  just as the  Central  Office  of

Information    in   Britain.   But    when    foreign

correspondents, immediately after the debate in  this

Assembly,  go to the offices of the Public  Relations

Department, and can pick up the speech that was  made

by  the  Hon. the Chief Secretary, and pick  up  the

speech  that was made much later in the  day  by  the

Hon. the Chief Minister, but are unable to find  any

scripts   of   speeches  made  by  Members   of   the

Opposition, I think the process of using  the  Public

Relations  Office  as  an  instrument  of  government

propaganda  is  carried a little bit  too  far.  Here

again,  I wish to make it clear that I make no charge

against  either  the  Chief Secretary  or  the  Chief

Minister personally. But I wish to draw the attention

of  this  House, publicly, and on the floor  of  this

Assembly to say that that should not be the case.  We

are  not  saying  that  it was wrong  of  the  Public

Relations  Office to provide scripted copies  of  the

speech  made by the Chief Minister, nor that  of  the

Chief  Secretary, but they should not have done  that

to the exclusion of speeches



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



made by Members on the other side of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can quite believe that the Chief Secretary and

the  Chief Minister are completely unaware  of  this.

But I hope, now that I have brought these matters  to

their  attention, that such a very undesirable  bias,

both  in  Radio  Malaya and in the  Public  Relations

Office,  should not be allowed to continue. They  are

matters   which  relate  very  intimately   to   this

Assembly. I think the Assembly has the right  to  ask

the Government that all proceedings in this House, if

they  are reported in any way through any agency,  or

through  any  medium, over which this Government  and

this  Assembly have any control, however remote, such

reports should be fair, impartial and unbiased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say last week's Radio Malaya's commentary

on  the proceedings, where eleven speakers who  spoke

on  the  motion were dismissed in one line and  which

said "eleven other people spoke", is not one that can

be  called  fair or impartial by any stretch  of  the

imagination.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite

confident  that  the  Chief Minister  and  the  Chief

Secretary will look into these complaints, but  there

is  one  point I should like to mention, and that  is

that  it is not necessary that long speeches made  in

this House should be lengthily reported through Radio

Malaya  or in the papers. Long speeches which contain

long  repetitions  might be cut down  to  one  single

sentence,  and  a  short speech which  contains  more

substance  and  more facts might occupy  much  longer

space  both  through Radio Malaya and  in  the  local

Press.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It just occurs to me, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that this was the occasion,  I  think,

when the People's Action Party was unable to make  up

its   mind  and  had  to  abstain  from  voting.  If,

following  a  65-minute speech which  apparently  led

nowhere, neither he nor his Party knew which  way  to

vote  and  had  to  abstain, it hardly  seems  to  me

deserving of report in that case.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much of my thunder has

already  been stolen. I fully share some of the  view

expressed  by the Member for Tanjong Pagar  (Mr  Lee

Kuan  Yew)  that it is important that the proceedings

in  this  House  should  be  fairly,  accurately  and

impartially reported. It is particularly important at

this  time,  Sir,  when in certain quarters  of  this

country there is not that degree of freedom of speech

which  we enjoy here. I support that, and I am  quite

sure   that  you,  Sir,  will  be  jealous  of   that

principle, and that should you ever feel that  it  is

being  abused by any of those who sit in the Gallery,

you will not be slow to exercise the powers given  to

you under Standing Order 75.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Sir, I regret that the Member for

Tanjong Pagar should be so upset, not I think  really

at  his  lack of publicity, but at his bad publicity,

and that in his vexation he should feel justified  in

trying  to  put  the  blame on to two  really  fairly

innocuous Government departments. I realise that  the

colonial  legacy  hangs  round  our  necks   like   a

millstone, but I hope and trust that other Members of

this  House are not so obsessed by the bogey  as  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do assure you, Sir, and other Members of the

House that Radio Malaya seeks to cover the debates in

this  House  with a purely factual summary  of  those

debates.  It  refrains from opinion, and it  refrains

from  comment.  It endeavours to favour  neither  the

Government  nor the Opposition. Whether  or  not,  of

course,  it  succeeds in this, to me, very  difficult

task must be a matter of opinion, and I should expect

that  after  any  given debate the opinions  of  each

Party in this House probably differ.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After our sitting on the 26th of April quite a

number  of  people criticised to me the  then  report

given by Radio Malaya of our debate and made the most

unwarranted suggestion that the People's Action Party

had  got  hold of Radio Malaya. That was how  it  was

that  the  Member  far  Tanjong  Pagar  got  such   a

tremendous publicity. I had no hesitation  in  saying

then, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



I say now, that there was no question of Radio Malaya

being nobbled by the People's Action Party. They were

doing their best to give a factual report of what had

happened, and I think we are all agreed on  that  day

the hon. Member did put up a very good and convincing

performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now, after our last sitting apparently, he

does  not think he got sufficient publicity. He makes

the  suggestion  that  on the half-past-one  news,  I

think  it was, I got ten minutes, and lie got fifteen

seconds.  Well,  I would point out that  he  finished

speaking -  if  I  remember  rightly - at  about  twenty

minutes  to one of the clock in this House, that  the

bulletin put over on the half-past-one news had to be

prepared  and ready for that half-past-one news;  and

that  whilst it did naturally devote a good  deal  of

its time to a speech which had been completed in time

for  it to be summarised, the bulletin went on to say

that  a  full  report  would be given  later  in  the

evening.  So  that I would say that  they  did  their

utmost, again, to be quite fair. But I do not for one

minute  accept  the criterion that because  the  hon.

Member  speaks for sixty-five minutes the  length  of

coverage  in Radio Malaya or in the Press  should  be

directly  related to the length of time he  takes  to

tell us what is in his mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also a very real check. We are not solely

dependent on Radio Malaya. We have a very strong  and

representative  Press  section  to  listen   to   our

debates, and I think we can rely upon them to correct

any  unbalance or any human failure on  the  part  of

Radio Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Public Relations Department, as I

see  it  the  position  is  slightly  different.  The

primary  function of the Public Relations  Department

is  to  inform the public of Government policies  and

Government  decisions, and to  give  explanations  of

Government's actions. I think it is a well recognised

part  of  that function in most territories that  the

Public  Relations Department should endeavour to  get

out texts of important speeches made by Ministers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



I  know  this  is  not  an  easy  task  for  them  to

discharge. They did make a very creditable effort  at

our  last debate, and they managed to get out  fairly

full texts of the speeches made by my hon. Friend the

Chief  Minister  and by myself. It  would  have  been

quite  impractical  for them  to  have  attempted  to

perform  that  service  for the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar, and I do not think, Sir, that that is strictly

part of their functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, in conclusion, not I hope

appearing  to  be an arrogant colonial  official,  to

try,  if I may, to speak as one who has had now quite

a   number  of  years'  experience  of  speaking   in

Legislatures; somewhat rashly I would venture to give

three tips to the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tip is that he should not expect that the

coverage he will get in the Press and radio  will  be

related to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



the time it takes him to speak in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tip I would give him is that he should

endeavour  to marshal his arguments and his sentences

shortly, so that it is easy not only for this  House,

but  for  our guests to understand what he is driving

at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, thirdly, when he indulges in one of his cold,

penetrating  rapier  thrusts  at  Ministers  on   the

opposite side of the House to himself, he should make

certain,  when he drops his voice, that he  drops  it

into  the microphone and not on to the middle of  the

Table.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at 4.15 p.m. to</div>

<div align="center"><b>TRADE AND AGRICULTURAL FAIR</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and Industry whether, in view of Government's declared policy "to foster the expansion of our great

entrepot trade" and "to encourage in all practical ways the development of local industries", he will consider expanding the Agricultural Fair, announced to be held this year, into a Trade and Agricultural Fair, giving special emphasis to local agricultural and industrial products.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall:</b> While it is Government's policy to foster the expansion of our entrepot trade and to encourage the development of local industries, it is not considered that a combined Trade and Agricultural Fair is desirable. Participants prefer specialised Fairs catering for their specific needs. This approach is also more beneficial for visitors to the Fairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has already announced that an all Island Agricultural Fair will be held during the course of the present year. Plans are already in preparation for this Fair. Meanwhile arrangements have been made for an Agricultural Show at Bukit Panjang in July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful Trade Fairs require careful organisation and in most cases at least one year's notice is necessary in order to attract overseas participants. Local interests are at present endeavouring to arrange an International Trade Fair in Singapore during the coming year. The Government is anxious that this Fair should be organised in conformity with internationally accepted standards and the organisers have been assured that, subject to Government satisfaction that these conditions will be fulfilled, their plans will have Government's approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is anticipated that local industries would wish to be fully represented at an International Trade Fair and Government would wish to encourage their participation.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTORAL REGISTERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Revision)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Secretary what steps are being taken by Government to revise and improve in accuracy the present electoral registers; and whether he will guarantee that the necessary steps are taken before the City and Island Council elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> The following steps are being taken to revise and improve the accuracy of the present Legislative Assembly Electoral Registers: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Insistence is now being laid in respect of new registrations and notifications of change of address on Regulation 5

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) (ii) of the Emergency (Registration) Regulations, 1948, requiring residential addresses to be furnished rather than business or accommodation addresses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Examination is being made of all records of the acquisition of United Kingdom and Colonies citizenship from 1948 onwards to ensure that persons acquiring such citizenship are brought on to the Roll.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The polling cards sent to registered electors for the recent Legislative Assembly election and returned through the Post Office because the addressees are untraceable are being checked with details of notified changes of address to ensure the accuracy of addresses and also to obtain a provisional list of persons who appear to have left the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Registered electors who are reported by the Federation of Malaya authorities to have taken out Federation identity cards after being in possession of Singapore identity cards are being recorded on a list of proposed deletions for the next revision of the Register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major problem in ensuring the accuracy of the Register is to obtain information regarding registered electors who leave the Colony permanently. All Government Departments, public bodies and most major firms have been addressed so as to secure this information. Other measures to this end are being considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures indicated in paragraph 1 of this answer are already current and should result in an improvement in the accuracy of the Electoral Register before a City and Island Council election is held. It is, however, pointed out that there must inevitably be a period of time between the final completion of a register and the election for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



which it is prepared, and to this extent any register must be partially out of date. I would also observe that the accuracy of automatic registration is also dependent in very great measure on individuals themselves checking the lists open to inspection.

<div align="center"><b>HARD CURRENCY EARNED BY SINGAPORE AND FEDERATION OF MALAYA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> asked the Financial Secretary if he will state the combined or respective hard currency earnings of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya for the years 1952, 1953 and 1954, what amount was allowed to be spent by Singapore importers, whether the Colony derives any direct benefit by handing its hard currency earnings to the United Kingdom, and whether such earnings are credited at the current market rate so that Singapore and the Federation can benefit thereby. (Question No. 2, Official Report, 26th April, 1955; Volume 1, No. 2, column 1).



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> pursuant to his reply [Official Report, 26th April, 1955; Volume 1, No. 2, column 1] supplied the following information:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official records indicate that the value of exports to hard currency countries (American Account Countries and Canada) from Malaya, including re-exports, for the years 1952, 1953 and 1954 were as under: -

<pre>

     1952      M$792.1 million

     1953      M$590.0    "

     1954      M$585.4    "

</pre>

<br>There are also certain receipts from tourists, for services rendered, and in respect of personal remittances made to Malaya, but detailed information is not available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct imports into the Federation and Singapore from hard currency areas for the years 1952, 1953 and 1954 were as under: -

<pre>

     1952      M$172.7 million

     1953      M$ 87.5    "

     1954      M$ 92.7    "

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large remittances are made to American and Canadian Accounts in London for invisible imports. Film royalties payable to American companies represent a considerable item under this heading. These payments are of course the equivalent of hard currency expenditure. Arrangements have also been in force for a number of years to reimburse Indonesia in dollars for the re-export to the U.S.A. of rubber imported from Indonesia. Substantial annual payments are made under this heading. Finally, in order to obtain a complete picture of Malaya's dollar expenditure it would be necessary to take into account the hard currency content of manufactured goods imported by Malaya from other members of the Sterling Area. A typical example is tobacco. Figures for these are not available but it is certain that the gap between hard currency earned and hard currency spent by Malaya is much narrower than the figures for visible exports and imports suggest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no fixed allowance for such imports. The policy in the Federation and Singapore, as in other countries of the Sterling Area, is to permit imports from hard currency sources of any commodity regarded as essential for local economies. In the years in question, a wide range of manufactured products and materials for local industries and of general consumer goods have been purchased. Arrangements exist to enable specific items to be considered on the basis of individual applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sterling Area dollar pool is a central reserve maintained by the United Kingdom into which member countries credit their dollar earnings and from which they are provided with dollars on the basis of the particular needs of each territory. This procedure ensures that the essential hard currency needs of Singapore and the Federation are met, and that full use is made of the hard currency earned by the Sterling area as a whole.

and dollar reserves strengthens sterling, enhances its international status and brings nearer the prospect of full sterling convertibility. These factors are all of vital interest to an international trading centre such as Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian and U.S. dollar earnings which accrue to Malaya from the activities of individual traders are sold to banks in Singapore and the Federation at the official rate ruling at the time of sale. These rates are in fact the current market rates.
