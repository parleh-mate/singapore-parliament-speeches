<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the 18th of February, 1956, I

received  a message from His Excellency the Governor

in  connection with Bills which have been passed  by

the Assembly. This is the message:



<br><br>"Sir,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the honour to inform you that in accordance

with  the  provisions  of  Section  62  (2)  of  the

Singapore Colony Order in Council, 1955, I have this

day assented to the Bills intituled : -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>

Drugs  Ordinance (Chapter 191 of  the  Revised

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> asked the Minister  for  Local

Government, Lands and Housing if he will state  what

is  the  total  area  of land  in  Singapore  Island

occupied by Her Majesty's Navy, Army and Air  Force;

and  how much of this total area is owned by the War

Office in the United Kingdom.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  total area of land in Singapore Island occupied

by  Her  Majesty's  Navy, Army  and  Air  Force  is

approximately 14,402 acres of which 4,898  acres  is

held by the War Department.

<div align="center"><b>UNION WITH THE FEDERATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Sir, at

the  last  sitting I promised this House a statement

on  the state of negotiations with the Government of

the  Federation  on  the subject  of  union  between

Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the appointment of Tunku Abdul Rahman as

Chief  Minister  of  the  Federation,  some  of   my

colleagues  and I have been in constant consultation

with  him  and  his colleagues on this subject.  The

Chief Minister of the Federation and I are satisfied

that   a  union  between  the  two  territories   is

desirable.  The  paramount task  of  the  Federation

Government, however, the Chief Minister considers to

be  an  early  finalisation of the new constitution,

and  in order that there should be no suggestion  of

delay  or  limitation of the constitution that  they

hope for, we have agreed, at his suggestion,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>



to commence official discussions of a merger between

the   two   territories  after  the  new  Federation

Constitution has been finalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be glad to clarify any aspect of that

statement which may not be clear to the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Chief  Minister state whether we are  to  understand

that  the  crisis he referred to on his return  from

Switzerland has now been averted?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question does not arise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ALL-PARTY BRITISH PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(VISIT TO SINGAPORE)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May I make a statement, Sir, as

there seem to be no questions?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As you please, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> This is a subject, Sir, on

which hon. Members have had some information. I  did

advise this House in my report on our official visit

to London that we saw the British Prime Minister and

at  that meeting indicated to him that we thought it

might  be  helpful  if  an  All-Party  Parliamentary

delegation  was sent to Singapore to  judge  of  the

extent   and   genuineness   of   our   desire   for

independence.  Sir,  it was  our  feeling  that  the

British   public  should  not  be  left  under   the

impression that we were pleading a sectional case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to inform the House that, as a result of

this  request,  an  All-Party British  Parliamentary

delegation will be coming to Singapore, composed  of

three  Conservative Members of Parliament and  three

Labour Party Members. They are the Rt. Hon. Geoffrey

Lloyd, who is the leader of the delegation, the  Rt.

Hon. H. S. Morrison, Mr G. J. M. Longden, Col.  Sir

Leonard  Ropner,  Mr  A. J. Champion,  and  Mr  F.

Blackburn. They will be arriving in Singapore on Mon

day, 12th March, and will be spending



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>



some time in the Federation before they leave on 2nd

April.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive Committee has been appointed to

arrange appointments in order to give the delegation

the  maximum  possible  opportunity  to  assess  for

themselves  the depths and sincerity of  the  desire

for  independence in this territory. I  do  ask  any

organisation,   which  may  wish  to   invite   this

delegation or any of its Members for any discussions

or  meetings,  to write to the Reception  Secretary,

British  Parliamentary Delegation, at  the  Assembly

House.  It  is  our hope, Sir, that  the  people  of

Singapore  would  take  this  opportunity,  both  in

public  and  in private discussions, in  giving  the

fullest  possible  picture to  the  Members  of  the

delegation of the true position in the territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cognate matter, Sir. As Singapore is seeking the

status  of  an  independent member  of  the  British

Commonwealth,    the   Government   considered    it

appropriate  to  invite all Dominion Governments  to

send parliamentary delegations, and the term of  the

invitation is that they may have the opportunity  to

acquaint themselves fully on issues which may affect

them  arising  out  of our desire  for  independence

within the Commonwealth. The replies, Sir, have  not

as yet all been received.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, who is

responsible for their expenditure in coming  out  to

this country?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> They will be coming, Sir, if

and  when  they do come, as guests of the  Singapore

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> You may be responsible for their

stay  over  here. But who is going to pay for  their

passages to and fro?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I think, Sir, that in the

normal course - I would like to say this with reserve,

because  I  have  not made enquiries - their  passages

would be paid by their own Parliamentary Association

and we pay for their stay and entertainment here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>INTERIM REPORT OF THE MALAYANISATION COMMISSION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Secretary)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, the

Interim  Report  of  the Malayanisation  Commission,

which  is  confined  to the Government  service  and

consists  of  a majority and a minority report,  has

been submitted to His Excellency the Governor and is

now published for general information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the scope and complexity of the subject

matter  of the Report, it has not yet been  possible

for  the  Government to reach any decisions  on  the

recommendations  that have been made,  and  the  two

reports and their recommendations are being examined

by   Ministers   in  consultation  with   heads   of

departments. Pending such decisions, there  will  be

no  alteration  in  conditions of  service  and,  in

particular, promotions will for the present continue

to   be   governed   solely  by  considerations   of

experience,  official qualifications and  merit,  in

conformity with the assurances conveyed by the Chief

Minister  to this Assembly on the 24th of  November,

1955,  that  there would be no question  of  holding

back proper promotions at the proper time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> On a point of

information, Sir, was that intended as a booster  to

the Malayan Civil Service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no reply, <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> again rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Chief

Secretary  inform us when he expects his  Government

to  reach  some conclusions on the Report  that  has

been presented to this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, as I have indicated, these two

reports,  which are in disagreement, cover in  great

detail  the whole field of the public administration

of this territory, and the decisions that we take on

those  recommendations  will  have  the  most   far-reaching   effects  for  the  immediate  future   of

Singapore.  I would ask, Sir, that Members  of  this

Assembly would appreciate the prime necessity for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>



the   Government   to  give  careful   and   detailed

consideration before reaching any decisions. I  would

also  ask,  Sir,  that  responsible  Members  of  the

Assembly  would  do their utmost to  avoid  making  a

difficult matter more difficult by giving vent to any

mischievous statements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as when the Government will be able to

reach  final decisions, hon. Members are  aware  that

the  future  of  the public service  is  one  of  the

matters to be discussed in the April talks in London.

It  follows  from that that it is unlikely  that  the

Government  will be able to reach firm  decisions  on

policy until after those talks have been held.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, there was a report of a

similar  nature,  and the Chief Secretary  should  at

least indicate some time limit as to the finalisation

of decisions by the Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do we understand from that

statement  of the Chief Secretary that this  will  be

one of the bargaining counters in the April talks  in

London?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, as is well-known and as I have just

stated,  this is a matter which is on the agenda  for

the  talks  in  April, and I hope hon.  Members  will

appreciate  that  all the issues which  are  on  that

agenda will have to be considered as a whole and they

will  all form part of that whole. So quite naturally

the issue of the future of the public service will be

one of the issues which have to be tackled - I hope  in

a spirit of mutually trying to solve a problem rather

than in a spirit of bargaining, but it will be one of

the  issues  to be discussed and, I hope,  agreed  at

those talks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does not the Chief Secretary agree

that  the  Malayanisation of  the  civil  service  of

Singapore  is not a question of policy which  can  be

affected   by   any  other  issue?  We   believe   in

Malayanisation, I am told, willy nilly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no reply, <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> again rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Chief Secretary

appreciate  the fact that the minority report,  which

he  has referred to as another report, was, in  fact,

instigated,  written and signed by a  member  of  the

Malayan Civil Service?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a proper question. Mr Chew

Swee Kee, I think you have a statement?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ALL-PARTY COMMITTEE REPORT ON CHINESE EDUCATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Education)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> At

the last sitting I indicated that a White Paper would

be  tabled before this House in connection  with  the

educational   policy   to  be   formulated   on   the

recommendations  made by the All-Party  Committee  on

Chinese Education. That White Paper is in the process

of finalisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be appreciated that only recently I have

read in the local papers comments by certain sections

of  the  Chinese educationists, and I should like  to

give those comments their due consideration. When the

White  Paper  is  ready, I should like  to  table  it

through you, Sir, so as to give Members of this House

full opportunities to study it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also indicate to the House that I will have

that  White Paper translated into Chinese  and  other

languages for the benefit of the public. I will  give

full  opportunities for a debate on a motion on  that

White Paper.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be permitted, with the

assent  of  the  House, to move  without  notice  the

necessary  exemption to enable the  business  of  the

House  to  be concluded today? Sir, it is,  in  fact,

doubtful whether the business set down for today will

reach the moment of interruption,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>



but  I  do feel that hon. Members will not  wish  to

continue the sitting further tomorrow if it is  just

for a short duration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Sir, I beg to ask for the

assent of this House to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down for

this day be exempted from the provisions of Standing

Order No. 7.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is a business motion, Mr Lim Yew

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,  "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a measure designed to make

improvements  in  the  machinery  dealing  with  the

apportionment of rents for Crown leases.  Under  the

Apportionment  of Rents Ordinance, which  came  into

force  on the 30th of April, 1909, a lessee, or  any

person  interested, can apply to  the  Collector  of

Land  Revenue for the apportionment of rent  due  to

the  Crown whenever a portion of the land held under

the   lease  is  assigned.  Very  few  applications,

however,  have  been made and it is considered  that

the  Collector should be empowered to apportion rent

on a sub-division without application being made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>



to  him. This power will not only enable a purchaser

to  know the exact rental due to the Crown but  will

also   allow   the  Collector  to   clear   up   old

subdivisions and correct the records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Note to this Bill gives full and

adequate reasons and therefore I do not think it  is

necessary  for  me to spend any length  of  time  on

this.  No  radical  changes have been  made  to  the

Poisons Law, and the amendments are largely  in  the

nature of a tidying-up process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six short amendments to the 1938

Ordinance,  five of which are changes of wording  to

correct  and  modify the meaning of  the  respective

sections.   The   sixth  amendment   changes   three

subsections to section 21 of the original  Ordinance

where powers are prescribed for the making of rules,

and  these new subsections will allow the rules made

by  the  Minister  for Health  to  come  into  force

simultaneously  with  related  orders  altering  the

poisons  list which he makes at the same  time.  The

five changes are intended to regularise the position

with regard to the restriction of the sale of Part 1

Poisons  and the sale of poisons by wholesale.  They

also  modify without appreciably altering the  terms

of  the  retail shopkeeper's licence to provide  the

necessary widening of powers of police inspectors.

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, I have His Excellency s

permission  to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has four principal aims: firstly, to

assist  the mining industry in Malaya; secondly,  to

afford an additional measure of relief to the rubber

industry;  thirdly, to simplify the  provisions  for

the   assessment  of  income  from  dividends;  and,

lastly, to enable the Comptroller to obtain  a  full

disclosure of a person's total assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 is intended to give effect to the first

aim.  It  is  introduced in order to  encourage  the

search  for fresh mineral deposits in Malaya.  Under

the existing provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance,

relief  is  allowable  for moneys  expended  on  the

search   for   mineral  deposits  only  where   such

expenditure is incurred; firstly, by a miner  within

the  area  of  his  existing  lease,  regardless  of

whether  the prospecting is successful or otherwise;

secondly,  where the prospecting is  successful  and

mining  operations  follow;  thirdly,  by  a  person

carrying  on a trade or business of prospecting  for

mineral  deposits.  The expenditure  for  which  the

present  provisions of the Income Tax  Ordinance  do

not  give  relief  is  expenditure  on  unsuccessful

prospecting incurred outside the area of a  miner's

existing lease. It is considered that if relief  for

income  tax  purposes is given in  respect  of  such

expenditure,  the discovery and development  of  the

mineral  deposits  of Malaya will be  assisted.  The

clause  is designed to give such relief. It will  be

seen  that,  to qualify for relief, the  prospecting

expenditure   must   be  lawfully   incurred.   This

restriction  has been inserted to ensure  that  only

persons  who  are  duly  authorised  to  engage   in

prospecting  shall be in a position to claim  relief

for their expenditure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the next aim, hon. Members will

remember  that  one  of the recommendations  of  the

mission  of  enquiry  into the  rubber  industry - the

Mudie  Mission - was that all new capital  expenditure

on  estates  should be written off  for  income  tax

purposes over a maximum period of ten years.  Clause

4  is intended to implement that recommendation. The

relief which may be claimed under the provisions  of

clause  4  is  available to any  person  engaged  in

working  a  plantation.  The  word  "plantation"  is

defined in Section 2 of the Income Tax Ordinance  to

mean any land used for the growing and harvesting of

crops,  and,  accordingly, the  relief  proposed  is

equally available to the rubber, oil palm, rice, tea

and cocoa industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualifying expenditure will be divided into ten

equal  parts, and will be available for  relief  for

each  of the ten years of assessment following  that

in  which the expenditure is incurred. Paragraph (3)

of  the clause makes provision for the allocation of

the  relief as between the vendor and the  purchaser

where  land is sold, on which qualifying expenditure

has been incurred. Thus, if the whole or part of  an

estate  is  sold  within any  ten-year  period,  the

purchaser  is entitled to claim, over the  remaining

years  of  the period, the same amount of relief  as

was  allowed  annually to the vendor, provided  that

the estate or part of the estate purchased continues

to  be  used  as  a plantation. The relief  afforded

under  the  clause is generous, and it is considered

reasonable that where the whole or part of an estate

in respect of which relief has been given is sold or

transferred  for a consideration, the vendor  should

pay  tax on any sum which he recovers in respect  of

his expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proviso to the clause introduces two safeguards

for  the  taxpayer where the whole  or  part  of  an

estate is sold. Firstly, the sum recovered on  which

the  vendor is required to pay tax is restricted  to

the  amount of the allowances which he has  obtained

under  the clause. Secondly, the taxpayer  is  given

the option of having any sum so recovered treated as

income of the year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>

of  receipt,  or  spread evenly  over  such  of  the

previous  years  of assessment as are  in  date  for

additional assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (2) of the clause provides that capital

expenditure  on  the acquisition of land,  machinery

and  plant shall not qualify for relief. In the case

of  machinery  and  plant,  the  existing  rates  of

depreciation,  which  have been  prescribed  by  the

Malayan  Board of Income Tax, are considered  to  be

adequate, but Section 19 of the Ordinance gives  any

taxpayer, who is dissatisfied with these rates,  the

right  to  approach the Comptroller with  a  request

that higher rates should be allowed. Land used as  a

plantation  is  not considered to be a deteriorating

asset  and, for that reason, is excluded from relief

under the clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words on the provisions of paragraph (6) of

clause 4 may be of assistance to hon. Members. Under

the existing provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance,

capital expenditure incurred on the construction  of

industrial  buildings and structures on  plantations

qualifies for relief as follows - an initial allowance

of  ten  per  cent  is  given together  with  annual

allowances at the rate of two per cent for a maximum

period of 45 years. No relief is due for expenditure

on  clearing new areas or for original planting. The

whole  cost of replanting, on the other hand,  which

means  the  replacement of the crop on any  area  of

land by a similar or by an approved crop on the same

area  of  land,  is  allowable  as  a  deduction  in

computing   profits  as  and  when   incurred.   The

provisions of paragraph (6) of clause 4 of the  Bill

do  not  interfere  with the existing  treatment  of

replanting expenditure. The provisions do,  however,

enable  expenditure on clearing  new  areas  and  on

original planting to qualify for relief over a  ten-year  period; furthermore, the provisions  are  more

generous  in  the case of industrial  buildings  and

structures in that relief may now be claimed over  a

maximum  period  of ten years instead  of  over  the

existing maximum of 45 years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aim is carried out in clauses 5 and 6 of

the  Bill.  Clause  5  is  designed  to  remove  the

complicated     provisions     applicable      where

shareholdings giving rise to dividends are  acquired

or  are  sold  by  making all income from  dividends

assessable  on the basis of the amount  received  in

the  preceding year. At present, when a  holding  of

shares  is  acquired, dividends received during  the

first  or  second year of assessment may be assessed

to  tax  more  than once, and the tax deducted  from

such dividends by the paying company may require  to

be  set off for the purposes of collection or repaid

to  the taxpayer more than once. On the other  hand,

when a holding of shares is sold, the provisions  of

subsection  (7)  of  Section 31 of  the  Income  Tax

Ordinance   have  the  effect  that  the   dividends

received in the second last, or the third last, year

of  assessment are not assessed to tax at all.  Over

the   period  during  which  shares  are  held,  the

taxpayer  may be assessed in a greater  amount  than

the   aggregate  dividends  he  has  received.   The

provisions  of  clause 5 will ensure that  over  the

period during which shares are held the taxpayer  is

assessed  only  on  the exact  amount  of  dividends

received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 is intended to meet the request of several

members  of  the accountancy profession for  a  more

simple  procedure  in  the  deduction  of  tax  from

dividends   paid  to  shareholders.  The   practical

difficulties  encountered in the  operation  of  the

existing provisions of Section 40 are referred to in

the  Objects and Reasons attached to the  Bill.  The

broad  principle underlying the new clause  is  that

every company resident in the Colony is entitled  to

deduct  tax  from  dividends paid  to  shareholders,

regardless of whether or not the company itself  has

chargeable  income  for the year  of  assessment  in

which any dividend is paid, provided that the tax so

deducted from the dividends reaches the Revenue. For

this purpose, the excess of any tax paid on previous

profits   over   the  tax  deducted  from   previous

dividends  is available, along with the tax  payable

for the year of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>



assessment in which the dividend is paid,  to  frank

the  tax  deducted  from the current  dividend;  but

where  there is no such excess, the deficiency  must

be  made good by a direct payment to the Comptroller

of Income Tax. In effect, two running totals will be

kept for each company. One will be the total of  tax

paid each year on the company's income for all years

of  assessment from the date of the introduction  of

income  tax in 1948. The other will be the total  of

tax  deducted  from dividends in  the  same  period.

Provided  that  the total of tax  paid  exceeds  the

total  of  tax  deducted, the  company  will  be  in

perfect  safety in deducting tax from its dividends,

and only where the tax deducted exceeds the tax paid

will  the  company  be  required  to  make  up   the

difference  by a direct payment. This  procedure  is

perfectly reasonable when one bears in mind that the

tax  deducted from a dividend is available for  set-off  or for repayment when the relevant dividend  is

assessed  on  the  shareholder. Furthermore,  it  is

thought  that  the procedure will  prove  to  be  of

assistance  to directors and to company secretaries,

since they will no longer be uncertain whether  they

are entitled to deduct tax on paying a dividend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to remove from

Section 40 the restriction whereby the rate  of  tax

at  which  a company is entitled to deduct tax  from

dividends  is  reduced by any Double or  Empire  Tax

Relief received by the company. The amount of Double

or  Empire  Tax  received by any single  company  is

comparatively small, and the effect of reducing  the

rate at which companies may deduct tax - at present 30

per cent - to take account of such relief, is to bring

into  existence  percentages, for  example,  29.18%,

28.97%,   which  are  troublesome  to  compute   and

difficult to explain to shareholders. The removal of

the restriction will result in the total of tax paid

by any company receiving Double or Empire Tax Relief

being  correspondingly reduced for the  purposes  of

comparison with the total of tax deducted  from  the

dividends paid.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four amendments which I have mentioned have

been  considered by the Malayan Board of Income  Tax

who have advised that they should be introduced with

effect   from  the  first  of  January,  1956.   The

Federation Government has also accepted this  advice

and  proposes to include the same amendments in  the

Income  Tax Bill which is to be introduced into  the

Federal Legislative Council this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will no doubt be aware that one or two

points have been raised during the past few days  by

the   accountancy  profession  in  regard   to   the

operation of sub-clause (6) of clause 6 of the  Bill

to which I have just referred. These objections were

concerned  with certain results which, it was  felt,

might flow where a company had a surplus of tax paid

as  at  31st  December, 1955. It was  thought  that,

where  dividends had been paid partly out of profits

which  had  not suffered Singapore tax, or  where  a

dividend  had been paid during the period  when  the

rate  deductible was 20 per cent only, the provision

for grossing up at 30 per cent would have the effect

of reducing arbitrarily the credit balance of tax in

hand.  These  points have since been discussed  with

representatives  of the accountancy profession,  and

it  is proposed to amend the sub-clause in Committee

in  such a way as to remove any possibility of these

difficulties arising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of what should be done about companies

which,  in the past, had deducted tax from dividends

in  excess of the tax paid on their profits was also

raised,  and  I  am able to reinforce the  assurance

which    has   been   given   to   the   accountancy

representatives  that no action  be  taken  in  such

cases.  In  other words, such companies  will  start

afresh  as  from  the year of assessment  1956.  The

assurance which I have just given was recommended by

and agreed to at the meeting of the Malayan Board of

Income Tax at which the amendments embodied in  this

Bill were discussed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section - Section

6lA - into the Income Tax Ordinance. In the course  of

the debate on the Income Tax (Amendment)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>



Bill, 1953, a Select Committee was appointed in 1953

to  examine and report to the Legislative Council on

that  Bill. The Select Committee recommended - their

Report  is in Council Paper No. 73 of 1953 - that  all

the  clauses of the Bill should be accepted with the

exception of clause 8 which sought to introduce  two

new  sections  into the Ordinance, namely,  Sections

61A  and  61B. Clause 8 of the 1953 Bill  containing

these sections was accordingly deleted from the Bill

as  enacted.  It is not intended to reintroduce  the

provisions  of  Section 61B. Government  is  of  the

opinion, however, that the proposed new Section 61A,

which  is  contained in clause 7  of  the  Bill,  is

essential  if  the  attack  on  evasion  is  to   be

seriously  pressed. The clause gives the Comptroller

statutory  authority to require from any taxpayer  a

statement   containing  particulars  of   all   bank

accounts,  assets and any other facts  bearing  upon

his  income tax liability. The statement is intended

to  enable the Comptroller to compare the growth  of

the  tax-payer's  wealth over  a  period  with  his

declared  income in the same period. I would  assure

hon. Members that the section will be used only  by

the   Comptroller  or  by  senior  officers  of  the

Investigation   Unit  in  cases   where   fraud   is

suspected.  The section will not be used to  require

statements  of wealth from all and sundry,  and  the

honest  tax-payer need have no fear that  the  new

powers  will be used indiscriminately to compel  him

to supply information about his private affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the provisions of clause 7 in the

present  Bill were enacted in the Federation  Income

Tax  (Amendment) Ordinance, 1953,  and  are  in  the

meantime  omitted  from  the  Singapore  Income  Tax

Ordinance  has  proved a source of embarrassment  to

the officers working in  the  Investigation Unit in Singapore. This  Unit

has  recently been strengthened by the  addition  of

three  officers from the Board of Inland Revenue  in

the  United  Kingdom, and I feel sure  hon.  Members

will  agree  that Government is right in seeking  to

give  the  Comptroller  and to  these  officers  the

weapon  of the additional powers contained in clause

7 to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>



ensure  that  the  battle  against  tax  evaders  is

effectively  waged.  As  I have  already  said,  the

honest  citizen need have no fear of the  additional

powers:  only the evader need have cause for  alarm,

and he is undeserving of the sympathy of Members  of

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, with this new clause 61A, it

may  possibly be argued that since clause 69 (1)  of

the main Ordinance limits the Comptroller's power to

raise additional assessment to a period of six years

from the year of assessment in respect of which  tax

is  due,  logically  clause  61A  should  limit  the

Comptroller  s  power to call  for  a  statement  of

banking  accounts,  etc. to the  same  period.  This

argument appears to overlook the fact that clause 69

(1)   refers,   in   the  main,  to  straightforward

additional assessments whereas clause 61A  is  aimed

at  evaders of tax. It also overlooks the fact  that

the  proviso to clause 69 (1) already recognises the

fact  that the Comptroller should have the power  to

pursue  an evader of tax to the limits of the Income

Tax  Ordinance,  that  is,  to  the  first  year  of

assessment   under   the   Ordinance.    In    these

circumstances,  no justification  can  be  seen  for

attempting  to limit the exercise of the Comptroller's  powers under clause 61A to a period of six  years

preceding  the  year  in  which  evasion  is   first

suspected. It must not be forgotten that this clause

refers  to evaders of tax and not to honest citizens

who  have nothing to fear from this clause. I should

also  point  out that a clause similar  to  the  new

clause  61A  has been in operation in the Federation

since 1953, and no need has been felt there to alter

the date from 1st January, 1947.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it may be argued that since taxpayers had

the  right, under Section 31(1), to choose  1948  as

the  basis year for the year of assessment 1948,  it

should  be  made  clear  in  clause  6lA  that,  for

taxpayers  who  so  opted,  the  critical  date  for

purposes of clause 61A should be 1st January, 1948,

and  not  1st January, 1947. Here again, I must  say

that  the  Comptroller  must have  power  to  pursue

evaders throughout the whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>



period of the Income Tax Ordinance, and I should  be

unwilling to agree that any amendment should be made

in  this  respect.  As I have repeated  before,  the

honest  taxpayer  has  nothing  to  fear  from  this

clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, clause 8 provides for certain

consequential  amendments to the main Ordinance  and

these are described in detail in the Schedule.  Sir,

I beg to move.

United  Kingdom,  but  I  would  say  that  in  this

particular respect I see no reason why we should  be

guided by the practice in the United Kingdom.  After

all, Sir, the object of this legislation here is  to

meet  the  needs  of Singapore and  to  prevent  the

evasion of tax in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to make it clear that we are not against  this

Bill  in principle. Indeed we welcome any step which

would  encourage people to invest in  industry.  The

main  object of this Bill is to make our fiscal laws

more  in line with those of the Federation, and  one

can hardly object to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only doubt that I have in my mind is the

proposed amendment to Section 61A which the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary  has  just  mentioned.  No  one

objects  to more powers being given to the  officers

of  the  Income Tax Department in order  to  prevent

people from evading payment of their just taxes  and

making a full disclosure of all their properties. We

welcome  and warmly support it. But the  point  goes

beyond  that.  Under  this proposed  amendment,  the

power is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>



now  sought  for Income Tax officers to demand  bank

accounts and a statement of assets up to the 1st  of

January,  1947, which means, Sir, that as the  years

pass  by - 10 or 20 years - the unfortunate small trader

or  anyone  may be suddenly called upon to  disclose

his full assets. This means, in effect, that it will

not be safe for anyone to destroy the records of his

transactions  as  from 1947.  This,  I  submit  is  a

tremendous burden put on the innocent man.  You  are

penalising  him  as well as the  man  whom  you  are

chasing for not having paid his taxes. In the normal

course  of  events, I think people  have  relied  on

Section 69 whereby the Income Tax officer is allowed

to  ask for six years  assessment, but in this  case

there  is  no  limit. You have the  period  of  time

increasing,  and because we are giving extraordinary

powers  to the officers of the Income Tax Department

which  are  not included in the Income Tax  laws  of

England,  where  they have more experience  of  such

matters,  then, I submit, Members of  this  Assembly

must examine these powers very carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax officer has, at the present moment,

the  right  to call for accounts, and non-fulfilment

of  this  request  or refusal to  comply  with  this

request is not an offence under the Income Tax laws.

With  this proposed amendment, it becomes an offence

not to submit one's statement of account. The Income

Tax officer can, under the present law, make a heavy

assessment  on the taxpayer who will  then  have  to

justify his claim that his income is not as high  as

has  been assessed, and to be able to justify  that,

he will have to produce his books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the tax laws of the United Kingdom and

the  United  States of America, the period  for  the

Comptroller to assess and demand payment of  tax  is

limited to six years by Section 69, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where it appears to the Comptroller that any

person  liable to tax has not been assessed  or  has

been assessed at a less amount than that which ought

to  have  been charged, the Comptroller may,  within

the year of assessment or within six years after the

expiration  thereof,  assess  such  person  at  such

amount or additional amount as according to his judg-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>



ment ought to have been charged, and the provisions

of this Ordinance as to notice of assessment, appeal

and other proceedings... shall apply to such assessment...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in all wisdom, the practice of allowing the

Income  Tax  officer a free hand during this  period

has  been going on for hundreds of years in England,

and  where we are imposing a special law,  I  submit

that we should be guided by this section. The period

should be fixed - six years or ten years if you  like,

I do not mind - but I do not feel that a man should be

held to ransom in that at any time during the period

of  his  business life he might be  called  upon  to

disclose   his   accounts  which  he  has   probably

destroyed. It is intolerable to make a man keep  his

account books for the next 10 or 20 years. It may be

physically  impossible - he has not got the  space  in

his  shop - and  it  may not be possible  for  him  to

prevent  the  decaying influence of time  and  white

ants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the proposed amendment in asking for power

to  extend to the first of January, 1947,  does  not

make  provision for those who have elected  1948  as

the  first year of assessment instead of 1947, which

they  are allowed under Section 31 of the Ordinance.

If he has elected to be taxed on his 1948 account, I

fail  to  see how he can be called for his statement

for  1947.  Also it does not mean that, by  limiting

the  Income  Tax officer to a period of six  or  ten

years,  that  officer  is debarred  absolutely  from

further action. He still has his right to pursue the

taxpayer  under the law, as pointed out by the  Hon.

the  Financial  Secretary. During those  six  years,

surely if his work has been done efficiently or  his

office  has  been run efficiently, there  should  be

some knowledge of wilful non-return of a declaration

of  assets, and steps should have been taken to call

on  the  man to make a full statement of his account

and criminal proceedings instituted against him.  If

you  institute criminal proceedings and there is  no

time bar to that course being taken, then the Income

Tax  officer can apply to the Court for an order for

the  books  to  be examined or for  copies  of  bank

statements  to be produced by the bank. I therefore,

Sir,  give  notice that I shall move  the  requisite

amendment in the Committee stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Hon. the  Financial Secretary  has  said  that

Section  61A, quoted in clause 7 of the  Bill,  does

not  exist in the United Kingdom and yet Section 61A

is being introduced in this Bill. Sir, I am strongly

against  the adoption of this section for Singapore.

The  Comptroller should not be allowed  to  exercise

his  power under this section until he can establish

prima  facie  evidence  to  prove  that  the  person

concerned is evading taxation. We feel that, in line

with our concept of personal freedom in a democratic

country,  any  law that attempts to  limit  personal

freedom  should  not be enacted  except  under  very

special circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I think it is generally

recognised that the country is not getting  even  50

per  cent of the income tax to which it is entitled.

In  the  normal course, Sir, the citizen  has  every

sympathy with those who succeed in avoiding  payment

of income tax; but I say that in this country, where

income tax is so absurdly low, that it is not merely

a  criminal offence but it is a moral crime to cheat

the Government. The Government of this country, Sir,

has been cheated every year since 1947, and the bulk

of  its loss is not on the part of the small traders

for  whom  the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr  Lim  Koon

Teck)  has shown such concern. The bulk of the  loss

comes from the people whom we are now seeking to pin

down, and they are the very wealthy concerns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have added to our staff three experts from

the British Board of Inland Revenue in the detection

of  evaders. They are there now and they are set for

this  campaign to get back some of the dreadful loss

which  we  have suffered, and also in order  to  see

that   in  the  future  that  loss  is  considerably

limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full sympathy with the principles of both

the  objections  raised - on the one  hand,  Sir,  the

inconvenience   of  maintaining  records   over   an

indefinite  period; on the other hand, the  question

of the violation of individual liberty without prima

facie  evidence. But we have before us, Sir, special

circumstances - circumstances which are freely acknowledged - and the

blame for these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>



circumstances has been primarily laid at  the  doors

of  our  own  Income  Tax  Department.  I  say  that

Government has done its share in strengthening  that

Department, and we ask the assistance of this  House

in giving us the powers to see that these large fish

no longer escape their very moderate contribution to

the  expenses of working the administration of  this

Colony.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we had all

hoped  that  everybody had become comrades  in  this

House when our friends to the right on this side  of

the   House  decided  to  call  themselves  Liberal-Socialists,  and  we were told that henceforth  they

were going to represent the workers, the people, the

masses.  Today, on this small issue of the  proposed

Section  61A,  under clause 7 of the Bill,  we  have

clear  evidence - if  evidence is needed - more  than  just

prima  facie  evidence what particular interests  the

Liberal  Socialists represent. I am certain that  it

is  not  just mere coincidence that our  friend  the

Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) should  find

himself  so close to the Members for Paya Lebar  and

for Tiong Bahru.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plain fact is this. Everybody says tax evasion

is bad for the Government. Every accountant has, and

I should imagine the Hon. the Minister for Education

himself  has,  personal knowledge of the  great  joy

with  which  this  sport  of evading,  lawfully  and

legitimately,  the income tax laws is  indulged  in.

But  what  we object to is not the sport of  dodging

the  income tax man within his rules and regulations

but  of having more than one set of accounts. It  is

also common knowledge that many business enterprises

in  Singapore keep three sets of accounts. I thought

there were two. As a matter of fact, I suggested  to

the  proprietor of a particularly large concern that

perhaps what he was offering to the union might  not

be  the accounts which he offered to show his  wife,

for  instance,  or  his brother!  Then,  with  great

indignation,  he  said that  that  was  the  set  of

accounts with which he had satisfied the Income  Tax

Department! On leaving the premises of the employer,

my  union  friend turned round to me and  said,  "Of

course, you know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>



he  actually has another set of accounts,  and  this

one  he only shows to himself! The one that you were

referring to he shows to his partners! The one  that

he  was  referring  to he shows to  the  Income  Tax

Department!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are glad that the Member for

Paya  Lebar has raised his objection purely  on  the

ground that it might be impracticable for the  small

business  man to have large storage space for  three

sets  of  accounts since 1947. But we  are  somewhat

taken  aback  when the Member for Tiong  Bahru  (Mr

William Tan), speaking for the same Party now,  says

that he objects to the whole principle of it. "Prove

me  a crook first! Give me some prima facie evidence

that  I am a crook, and then you can call for  these

accounts!" Sir, I thought the whole purpose of  this

operation is to get prima facie evidence that he  is

a  crook,  or that someone is a crook! The People's

Action Party says, "Let the Government have all  the

powers  to prove as many crooks guilty as  they  can

get their hands on!"



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

had  not  intended to speak on this issue  since  my

colleagues have already spoken, but my Party  having

been  referred  to by the P.A.P., I think  I  should

take  the Floor to make our stand clear. We  do  not

just represent the big business people. We represent

the small business people. But we also represent the

working people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Everybody!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, indeed, we represent

everybody!  In  this country, if you  represent  one

class and instigate that class against another, then

you  are  doing Singapore no good. If you  represent

one   race  and  you  instigate  that  race  against

another, then you will also be doing Singapore a bad

turn.  We stand for racial harmony and we stand  for

inter-class co-operation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is right!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Now, I am also wondering why an

hon.  Member in this Assembly, protected by all  the

privileges,  should  cast aspersions  and  say  that

certain  members  of  the public  are  cheating  the

Government. I feel that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>



that  is not the right way to tackle things.  If  we

have  a  case against a tax evader, if we know  that

such conditions exist, it is our duty, especially so

as  a Member of this Assembly, to bring the facts to

the Income Tax Department and have him hauled up. We

want  more  money,  legitimate  money,  from  tax  - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Continue, Mr Lim Choon Mong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> What I think, Sir, and what I

would like to speak now is this. We have a law  that

is meant for everybody. We in this House say that we

are going to enact this law to catch the big fish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It does not say so.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It has been referred to by the Hon. the Financial Secretary and the Chief Minister.

I  agree  with  that stand. We must  catch  the  big

people who try to evade tax, but once this provision

becomes law, I am afraid that not only will the real

evaders get it - probably they may not get it - but  the

small man might get it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Evasion means cheating, and he

deserves it!



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Shut up!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Obviously so! [Interruption] I

have mixed with a large number of small shopkeepers - shopkeepers  with probably a capital  of  $2,000  to

$5,000,  doing their business as a family affair.  I

have  known that tax forms have been sent  to  them,

and  in  many cases many of these people  have  been

hauled  up  to  show cause why they  should  not  be

assessed at a big sum, and later on again to say why

they  should  not show their accounts further  back.

Sir,  if  you compare the number of cases where  the

big people and the small people have been hauled  up

by  the Income Tax Department, I think you will find

that it is the small people that have been hauled up

very much more often. Again I would put this to you,

Sir. In quite a number of cases, a small shopkeeper

has  been  hauled up and after his income  has  been

examined, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>



found  that he is not taxable. Now such cases  waste

the  time  and, money of the Government,  and  such

cases, too, give opportunities to quite a number  of

people in Singapore to get some money out of them by

way  of  what we call "rendering a service". I  feel

that when we think about a provision of this nature,

which we hope will affect only the big fish, we must

also  make sure that the very small shopkeepers  are

not going to be inconvenienced unnecessarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hart, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mention has been made, Sir, of the fact

that  a provision of this nature does not appear  in

the  United Kingdom law, and I did say in reply that

we  were  more  interested in what was  required  in

Singapore  than  in  what was  done  in  the  United

Kingdom.  I should, perhaps, amplify my remarks.  In

1952  we  managed to secure the services of  a  very

senior  member  of  the Board of Inland  Revenue  to

study and report on the question of evasion. He  had

served  upwards of 35 years on the Board  of  Inland

Revenue.  One of his main recommendations  was  that

this  particular section should be written into  the

law  of the two territories. There was  man of great

experience  of income tax law and procedure  in  the

United  Kingdom recommending that this provision  is

required and is necessary in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, points have been made about the trouble which

will be entailed in keeping accounts back to 1947. I

myself  do  not see how the anxieties of which  hon.

Members  have spoken  in the debate can  arise.  Any

honest  citizen who keeps his  books in  the  normal

way and pays his tax when it is due, need do no more

than  conduct his business operations in the way  he

has always done, destroying the books as and when  he

thinks fit, because he will be certain in  his  own

mind  that the Income Tax Department will never,  in

any  circumstances, have reason  to  call  for   his

accounts.  The only people who will  be  placed  in

some doubt as to what they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>



should  do with their accounts are those people  who

either  have  evaded tax or who  have  been  on  the

borders  of  evasion and they certainly should  keep

their  accounts right back to 1947. But  as  regards

the  large  body of honest citizens, this provision,

as far as the keeping of accounts is concerned, will

cause   no  trouble  whatsoever.  They  will  merely

continue to organise and conduct their business, and

keep  and  destroy their accounts in the  way  they

have always done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the question has been raised - as I suggested

in  my  speech that it might be raised - that, because

the powers of the Comptroller under Section 69  (1)

are  limited to a period of six years, logically the

powers of the Comptroller under this new Section 61A

should be limited to a similar period. The argument,

in my opinion, is fallacious, Sir, because there is

no   connection   between  the   two   functions - the

functions  of the Comptroller under Section  69  (1)

and  the functions of the Comptroller under this new

Section  61A. Under Section 69 (1), the  Comptroller

merely  raises  additional assessments  in  a  plain

straightforward  manner in plain straight  forward

cases.  But you will note, Sir, that under  Section

69  (1)  there  is a proviso which says  that  where

there   has  been  fraud  or  wilful  default,   the

Comptroller may pursue his enquiries right  back  to

the  beginning of the Income Tax Ordinance. In other

words, the Legislature has in the past admitted  the

right,  in  the  case of evasion or  fraud,  of  the

Comptroller to pursue his enquiries as far  back  as

he  may  go.  Correspondingly, when  we  suggest  in

Section 61A that he may pursue his enquiries back to

the  first  of January, 1947, we are doing  no  more

than  stating  once  more the  power  which  he  has

already been given under this particular section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there is the question - as I again

suspected might be raised - that if under Section  31

a taxpayer has opted that 1948 should be regarded as

the basis year of assessment, the Comptroller should

be precluded from investigating back to the first of

January, 1947. The answer to that argument,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  is  that  if there is evasion,  it  should  be

tracked  down  to  the limits of the  Comptroller's

power.  That  is  the  crux of the  matter,  Sir - the

prevention and detection of evasion - and in so far as

we here represent honest citizens and not evaders or

wrongdoers,  this  section of the  Ordinance  should

receive  the  full support of the  Members  of  this

House. Sir, I beg to move the Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I have an amendment to propose to

sub-clause  (6) of clause 6. I think, Sir,  that  the

amendment  which  I propose has been  placed  before

hon.  Members, but perhaps I could read it  out  for

the  purposes  of  the record. The amendment  is  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 7, to leave out lines 10 to 19 and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the purposes of this section, where any

dividend  has  been paid without deduction  of  tax,

such dividend or part thereof, from which there  was

a  title  to  deduct tax, shall be deemed  to  be  a

dividend  of such a gross amount as after  deduction

of tax at the rate deductible at the date of payment

would  be  equal to the net amount paid; and  a  sum

equal  to  the difference between such gross  amount

and the net amount paid shall be deemed to have been

deducted from such dividend or part thereof as tax."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not go into any detailed explanation of

this  sub-clause,  Sir. It  is  a  complicated  and

difficult  matter  and I might get  into  very  deep

water if I tried to explain in simple language  what

it  is  about. I have, however, in the course of  my

introductory speech given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>



the reason why this sub-clause is substituted and  I

think  I said that it has the full support not  only

of  the  Income  Tax authorities  but  also  of  the

accountancy  profession, and the  sub-clause  itself

has  been  drafted  by  the Law Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out, be left

out," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be inserted,

be there inserted," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 8, to leave out lines 13 to 16 and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that such notice may be given only in

respect  of a period of six years prior to the  year

of assessment."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That will take us to 1941.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> No, 1949.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. Perhaps the hon. mover

of the amendment will explain later. The amendment is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I do not propose to speak

very  much on this point. I think it has been fairly

well  debated  and  ventilated so  far.  There  are,

however,  one  or two points that I  would  like  to

make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is this, Sir. The Hon. the Financial

Secretary  has  said that under Section  69,  as  it

stands  at  present,  there is power  given  to  the

Comptroller  to  pursue any tax-payer  suspected  of

evasion to the limit. If that is so, I really cannot

see  why there is any objection to a limit being put

here, where we are giving him excess power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I want to make is this - that

under  my  amendment, the year will not be 1941,  as

the  Chief Minister indicated just now, but it  will

be  1949. My amendment says that the power  to  call

for  these  accounts  and  statement  of  assets  is

limited  to a period of six years prior to the  year

of assessment. The year of assessment is always



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>



the  12  months  preceding that  year  when  tax  is

leviable.  Take,  for example, this  year - 1956.  The

year  of  assessment is 1955, and a six-year  period

will take it up to 1949.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main purpose in asking for a limited period is

that  I  feel sure that by such a limit the officers

in  the Income Tax Department will be kept on  their

toes  and  be  very  thorough  and  quick  in  their

examination  of accounts, instead of letting  things

slide   and   taking  them  up  many,   many   years

afterwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think I

have  indicated  that Government is seeking  at  the

present  moment  to  tighten very  considerably  the

methods  of collection and to try to plug  the  very

considerable evasions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I can cap the story told by the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  (Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew)  from  my  own

personal  experience. It occurred in my  own  office

where  a person charged with a crime put up a story,

and I said, "If this is true, it will help the Court

immeasurably  to believe it if you can produce  your

accounts."  And  through my clerk, he  said,  "Which

set,  Sir?" Very naively, I said to the clerk.  "Oh,

no,  not  really!  He  does not  have  two  sets  of

accounts!" And this, Sir, actually came back through

the  clerk,  "I have three sets - one for myself;  one

for   my  partner;  and  one  for  the  Income   Tax

Department!" That did occur!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very large-scale evasions are taking place.

Government is at the present moment considering  the

question  of  publication,  by  authority  of   this

Assembly, of the names and the income totals of  all

the  income  taxpayers in the hope that the  general

public,  reading that book, would be able to  assist

the Income Tax Department in pointing out the under-declarations   therein  indicated.   You   will   be

surprised to learn, Sir, that there are,  out  of  a

total  of  1,200,000  people  in  Singapore,  20,000

taxpayers  and a large proportion are  the  salaried

men.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask that the measures which Government

requests  of  this House be accorded it  for  a  few

years  in order to see to what extent we can succeed

in  stemming  large-scale  evasions.  It  is  hardly

probable  that there will be any abuse of the  small

man.  I  do not deny that there is a possibility  of

the   eventualities  indicated  by  the  Member  for

Serangoon.  The possibility does exist, Sir,  but  I

say  that it is hardly probable that the Income  Tax

Department,  which has been called upon  to  tighten

its  procedure and its methods in collecting  moneys

due  to  Government, would waste time with the  very

small trader. I say let us have these measures which

we seek of you, and if in the course of the next two

or three years there are indications of abuse, then,

by  all means, on evidence thereof, limit them.  But

if  you ask us to limit now to 1947 - although frankly

I  feel  that  the proviso is a little  too  vaguely

worded  to carry out that intention - but if  that  is

the  intention,  then you are really  preventing  us

from asking a person, whose guilt is, say, evidenced

in  transactions  in 1953, to produce  his  accounts

which  we  should  like  to trace  as  far  back  as

possible.   You   are   quite  unnecessarily   there

assisting  those who shamelessly refuse to  carry  a

very  moderate burden in respect of the  maintenance

of  the  services of this country. I say, Sir,  that

the  time may well come when the limitations  sought

by  the hon. Member would be justified, but the time

is not now.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I think there is some

misunderstanding   about   the   purpose   of   this

amendment.  It  has  been stated, entirely  rightly,

that  under  Section  69 of the present  Income  Tax

Ordinance there is provision that where there is any

form of fraud or wilful default, the Comptroller may

assess  such  person at any time, and therefore  the

amendment  does  not arise in the  case  of  such  a

person.  The Government has already had the  powers,

and  why,  therefore,  is the  Government  concerned

regarding this amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause 7, as it stands, enables the

Comptroller  to  require  particulars   of   banking

accounts, etc. from any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>

person, not necessarily  fraudulent persons back  to

1947, which  means, in effect, that  such  accounts

must  be  kept  indefinitely by everyone  liable  to

income  tax, whether now or in the future, on  the

off  chance that they may be called upon. It may not

be intended, but this is what it states. The purpose

of  the amendment is quite clear, Sir. Whereas under

Section 69 of the main Ordinance the Comptroller may

only make additional assessment for a back period of

six  years, so should he only be permitted  to  call

for details of accounts, if necessary, for a similar

period. It is logical. It is reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very well for the Hon. the Financial

Secretary to assure us that the honest man cannot be

affected. The innocent have suffered with the guilty

before  now,  and the former deserve the  protection

which  this  amendment  will  afford  them  in  some

measure. The latter, under Section 69, in any  case,

will  not  escape,  and we do  not  desire  them  to

escape.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Sir,

I  would  just  like to speak, quite briefly,  on  a

point which has been made by the Member for Tanglin.

I  think  he  said - and I am speaking now  because  I

think  he  is wrong in saying so - that the  Financial

Secretary   has  stated that there are  already  the

powers  which this new Section  61A will confer  and

therefore  it  is  not necessary that  those  powers

should  be expressly conferred , in the new section.

What  I  think  he had in mind, when he  was  saying

that, was the proviso to Section 69 of the Ordinance

which  the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck)

did not read out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the real position is this: that Section 69

recognises the principle that where there is  fraud,

the  Comptroller can assess back beyond the ordinary

limiting period of  six years. That section does not

give  him  the  powers which the  new  section  will

confer upon him. It does not give  him the powers to

demand  the  production of accounts, a  statement  of

assets and so on. The principle is recognised in Section 69 and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>



this  principle is incorporated in the proposed  new

Section 61A which will give the Comptroller  the

powers which, in fact, he has not at present got.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out,

be left out," put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<div align="center"><b>WAR DAMAGE (WINDING UP) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time.",



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be recalled that after considerable

discussion   in  Joint  Select  Committee   of   the

Legislatures of both Singapore and the  Federation,

the   War Damage Commission and Fund was established

by  Ordinance  in  both  territories  in  1949.  The

Commission   was  set  up  in   Kuala   Lumpur   to

investigate claims for compensation for war damage,

and  to  make  payments from the Fund in  accordance

with the principles laid down in the law. This work

has   continued  steadily  since  1950.  A   great

majority of the assessed claims



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>



have  been  paid.  Staff has been  steadily  reduced

over the past 18 months.  The time has now come when

an   approximate  limit  can  be placed  on   the

existence of the Commission and when it is necessary

to make all arrangements for its winding up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill, therefore, is to make

provision for the winding up of the War Damage Fund,

the  abolition of the Commission, and the repeal  of

the  War   Damage Ordinance. The various clauses  of

the  Bill  will  come  into force  on  dates  to  be

determined by His Excellency the Governor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides a bar to legal proceedings in

respect  of  any claims or awards or  in  connection

with the winding up of the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, which deals with the application of the

Fund  and   the  transfer of its  assets,  provides

that, in the event of any award being in dispute  at

the  date of the commencement of the Ordinance,  the

Commission may pay the award into Court, or make any

other provision for payment as it thinks fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides for the ultimate disposal of the

Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 prescribes that the accounts of the

Commission  shall  be audited as  soon  as  possible

after  the  application of the Fund. A copy  of  the

accounts and of the Director of Audit's Report will

subsequently be tabled in the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides for the disposal of the

documents  of  the  Commission   and  against  legal

proceedings  arising  from  the  disposal  of  these

documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 provides for the abolition of the

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 provides against proceedings directed

against  Government, the Commission, and any officer

of these bodies  in respect of war damage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 indemnifies Government or any officer of

the,  Government against any act done in good faith

after the first of January, 1950.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 seeks to amend subsection (1) of Section

10  of  the War Damage Ordinance. Paragraph (a)  has

never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>



been put into effect, and it is not intended to pay

the expenses of the previous War Damage Claims

Commission out of  the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clause 12, Section 11 (1) of the

Ordinance  confers an absolute right of  payment  in

certain cases and, before commencing the winding  up

of  the  War Damage Fund, it is necessary to  repeal

this  subsection.  There are  no  outstanding  cases

covered  by  the  subsection which  clause  12  (1)

accordingly  seeks to repeal. The remainder  of  the

War  Damage  Ordinance  will be  repealed  when  the

provisions  of clauses 8, 9 and 10 of the  Bill  are

brought into force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill are straightforward and

will,  I  think,  be generally acceptable  to  hon.

Members. A similar Bill is being introduced  at  the

next meeting of the Federal Legislative Council.  It

is  hoped  that  the  Fund will  be  wound  up,  the

accounts  and the Report tabled, and the  Commission

abolished by June of this year. Sir, I beg to move.

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read  a

Ordinance,  1951, provides that two members  of  the

for  the Governor in Council to take over the  power

of   appointment  to  statutory  bodies   from   the

Legislature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is, therefore, to provide

for   the   Governor  in  Council  to  replace   the

nominated Trustees on the Nature Reserves Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 10, to leave out the word "Minister" and

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The reason is this, Sir.

Previously,  such  powers have  been  given  to  the

Governor for appointing members to different bodies.

In  practice, I understand the Governor consults his

Executive  Council. If I am to understand that  this

is  taken to mean the Council of Ministers,  then  I

have  no  objection; but if that is not  so,  it  is

better  that the appointments should be made by  the

Council of Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I think it may be that the hon.

Member moving this amendment has overlooked the fact

that  this Committee of Appeal is formed by quite  a

number of authorities. Under Section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>



21 (1) (a) of the Cinematograph Films Ordinance, the

first  authority  is that there  are  three  persons

appointed  by the Governor, and under paragraph  (b)

there are three persons appointed by the Legislative

Council. Now, it is (b) which the present Bill seeks

to  change, so that if the Bill, as now worded,  was

accepted  by  the  Assembly, we  should  have  three

persons  appointed by the Governor and three persons

appointed by the Minister. I do not know whether the

hon.  Member moving the amendment would like to give

further  thought to it. I do not think it  would  be

satisfactory drafting to suggest that three  members

should  be  appointed by the Council  of  Ministers,

because  I  think  I  am right in  saying  that  the

constitutional  position is that it  should  be  the

Governor  in Council - which is, in fact, the  Council

of  Ministers - so that his amendment would therefore,

I  think,  give  us three persons appointed  by  the

Governor and three persons appointed by the Governor

in  Council. There are obviously slight anomalies in

having  those  two  in  such  close  association.  I

should,  however, like to make it quite clear,  Sir,

that  from the Government side of the House, we have

no  objection in principle to accepting an amendment

which  will  give  this power  to  the  Governor  in

Council  and  not  to  the  Minister.  There  is  no

objection  in  principle at  all.  It  is  merely  a

question  of neatness of wording. Possibly the  hon.

mover of the amendment would like to speak again.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I accept the wording

"Governor   in  Council"  instead  of  "Council   of

Ministers".



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will come to that. The Question

before   the  House  is  that  the  word  "Minister"

proposed  to be left out, be left out. If that  word

is  left  out,  then, of course,  there  may  be  an

amendment  to the amendment moved by the Member  for

Telok Ayer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Could I make it clear, Sir, that on this

side  of the House we accept the amendment "Governor

in Council", so that Members may know when voting on

what it is proposed to leave out?

and substituted another amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, but the amendment is already

before the House. I would prefer another hon. Member

to move an amendment to this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move that, in

place  of the words "Council of Ministers" proposed

by the hon. Member, the words "Governor in Council"

be substituted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is a simple and non-controversial

one  which  seeks to make the Governor  in  Council,

instead  of the Legislative Assembly, the  authority

for   the  appointment  of  seven  members  to   the

Committee   of  Management  of  the   Fund.   This

principle,  Sir, has already been accepted  by  this

House  in  the consideration of the Nature  Reserves

(Amendment)   Bill   and  the  Cinematograph   Films

(Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Silver Jubilee Fund was established by the

Silver  Jubilee Fund (Singapore) Ordinance, 1936.  The

Fund  was raised partly by public subscription  and

partly  by grants from Government and the Municipal

Commissioners.  The Committee of Management  manages

and  spends  the  money  entrusted  to  it  by  the

Trustees  of  the  Fund It enquires  into  cases  of

distress   and   gives   appropriate   relief    and

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the present time the laws of the Colony

are,  for  the  most  part, contained  in  the  1936

Revised  Edition  of  the Laws  and  in  the  Annual

Supplements  to  that Edition-Annual Supplements  of

both  Ordinances  and subsidiary  legislation  which

have been published since

1936.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think hon. Members are aware - indeed I think

a  question was put down on the subject a few months

ago - that the printing of a new 1955 Revised Edition

of  the Laws is now nearing completion and there  is

good  reason now to hope that the 1936 Edition  wil1

be replaced by the 1955 Edition in the very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>



near  future. The present position therefore is that

the preparation of further Annual Supplements to the 1936 Edition has become unnecessary and the purpose

of  this Bill is, therefore, first of all, to  repeal

the legislation under which I am required to prepare

those   Supplements - the  Supplements  to  the   1936

Edition - and,   secondly,  to   make   legislative

provision  for  the preparation and  publication  of

Annual  Supplements  to the 1955  Edition.  Briefly,

therefore,   Sir,   this   Bill   anticipates    the

replacement of the 1936 Edition of the Laws  by  the 1955 Edition and will enable Annual Supplements  to

that Edition - the 1955 Edition of both Ordinances and

subsidiary  legislation - to be prepared.  I  beg  to

move.

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read  a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1952, the Municipal Ordinance and the Singapore

Improvement  Ordinance were amended to  provide  for

the   payment   of  assessment  by   the   Singapore

Improvement Trust to the City Council in respect  of

Trust  properties  used  for  profit,  and  for  the

payment  of an improvement rate by the City  Council

to  the  Singapore Improvement Trust in  respect  of

properties vested in the City Council and  used  for

profit.  Until  then, there had been a  gentlemen's

agreement  between the two Authorities that  neither

side should pay its dues to the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Authorities have been paying their

respective dues to each other since 1952, except for

the  payment  of  an improvement rate  by  the  City

Council in respect of the year 1952. The reason  for

this non-payment is that doubts have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>



arisen  as  to  whether  the  Singapore  Improvement

(Amendment)  Ordinance, 1952, makes clear  provision

for  such  rate  to  be  paid  in  respect  of  that

particular  year. However, the Singapore Improvement

Trust  and the City Council have now finally  agreed

that  the  amount of such rate for  1952  should  be

$84,189.14 and the purpose of this Bill is to enable

the  payment to be made to the Board. Sir, I beg  to

move.

the  City Council for the purposes stated and  under

the conditions specified in Sessional Paper No. Cmd.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the Sessional Paper, this money is

to  redeem  the  Singapore  Municipal  5  per  cent

Debenture Stock, 1926, on the 1st of May, 1956,  and

the  City  Council proposes, in the first  instance,

to  offer approximately $18� millions of  this  new

loan  to the external holders of the 5 per cent loan

of  1926 as a conversion operation. This offer  will

be made at par. It is hoped that the offer will meet

which may remain after this conversion operation has

been  dealt  with, will be offered to institutions

and the general public in one or more instalments at

a time or times to be agreed.

<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that an

Ordinance to provide for the compulsory registration

of  Hindu  Marriages in Singapore and other  matters

connected  therewith in accordance  with  the  Hindu

Religion, customs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>



and  manners acceptable to all Hindus is  necessary;

and   that  the  Government  should  introduce   the

necessary  legislation as early as  possible,  after

consultation with the Hindu public opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a meeting of representatives of Hindu

organisations  held on 5th February,  1956,  in  the

Seletar  Division  at  which  I  was  present,   the

question  of Hindu marriages was raised and  it  was

decided that I should take this matter up with  the

Assembly. The representatives unanimously approved a

draft  resolution which has been presented by me  to

the Clerk of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from those received from members of the

Hindu  community  in  my own  constituency,  I  have

received  several  letters from Hindus  outside  the

Seletar  Division. Representations were  made  to  me

from   the  Hindu Sabhai, Singapore.  Among  matters

discussed  at their annual general meeting affecting

their   interests,  this  organisation  raised   the

question   of  Hindu  marriages  in  Singapore   and

approved a resolution as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To press the Government to bring into law the

proposed Hindu Monogamous Marriage Bill at an  early

date as it is long overdue."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a letter addressed to me on 7th February,

1956, the President of this Association wrote to  me

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Committee feels that, being the only Hindu in

the Legislative Assembly, you alone are competent to

raise  the issue in the Assembly. Perhaps you  would

consider introducing a motion in the Assembly with a

view  to  bringing  pressure on  the  Government  to

reintroduce  the  Hindu  Monogamous  Marriage  Bill

which has been shelved."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also have received letters from the Malayan

Tamil Association, Kuala Lumpur, informing me of its

endeavour  to introduce similar legislation  in  the

Federation Legislative Council. They have asked  for

my co-operation in the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, the Dravagalagam, another Hindu

organisation in Singapore, in a letter addressed  to

me on 27th February, states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Committee wishes to place on record its deep

appreciation and gratitude for your efforts  to  get

Hindu  marriages  registered, which  is  overdue  in

Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir I have also received another letter from the

Malayan Tamil Association,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>



Singapore, which is also in accordance with my aim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have had consultations with the Secretary of

the    Tamil   Representative   Council,   Mr    G.

Sarangapany,  who  also agreed to  the  text  of  my

resolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I have also discussed this

question  with another leading member of  the  Hindu

community in Singapore, Mr C. R. Dasaratha Raj, who

was  responsible for the introduction of  the  Hindu

Monogamous Marriage Bill in 1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of Hindu marriages and its legal

recognition  is not my own idea. Nor  is  it  a  new

thing  in  Singapore. I do not, for a  moment,  Sir,

like  to  take credit for the work which I am  doing

today  in this Assembly. In the previous Legislative

Council in 1954, my friend, Mr C. R. Dasaratha Raj,

introduced  a Hindu Monogamous Marriage  Bill.  This

Bill,  which came up for its Second Reading in April

1954, was referred to a Select Committee as some  of

the provisions were controversial. I was a Member of

this Select Committee and we discussed the matter at

considerable  length,  but it was  unfortunate  that

this  Committee was unable to make a Report  to  the

Legislative Council as it was prorogued prior to the

General Elections in April

1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, members of the Hindu community find things

extremely  difficult  when  disputes  arise  between

husband and wife, in particular, disputes in respect

of maintenance for the wife and inheritance, because

the  Courts  of the Colony are reluctant  to  accept

Hindu  marriages  as  valid for  want  of  proof  of

marriage. At present. Sir, Hindu marriages performed

in  the Colony are not required to be registered. It

is  also  difficult, Sir, to prove  Hindu  marriages

performed  outside the Colony. Since 1933  or  1934,

Sir,  several  pleas have been  made  by  the  Hindu

community in Singapore to the proper authority.  The

Hindu  Advisory  Board also have taken  considerable

time  in  expounding this cause and I am  glad  that

they have taken up the matter very vigorously at all

stages.  Hinduism being a religion, members  of  the

Hindu   community  would  prefer  to  have  separate

legislation to validate marriages between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>



Hindus, and matters incidental thereto, just  as  we

have the Muslim Marriage Ordinance and the Christian

Marriage   Ordinance  for  Muslims  and   Christians

respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second part of my motion, which requests

Government  to introduce the necessary  legislation,

is  designed  to  enable the  Bill  to  be  as  non-controversial as possible. At present, I  understand

there  are  differences of opinion among  Hindus  in

Singapore  as to the question of certain  provisions

in  the Hindu Monogamous Marriage Bill. A section of

the  Hindu community contends that there is no  need

for  the provision of divorce in the Marriage  Bill,

while another section contends that since Hindus are

monogamous, there should be provision for divorce in

the  Marriage  Bill. That section of  the  community

which  wants  divorce provisions in the Bill  argues

that  Government employees who are  members  of  the

Hindu  community  are unable to  contribute  to  the

Widows'   and Orphans'  Fund. There seem to  be  these

differences,  Sir,  and  I  feel  that,  instead  of

attempting to introduce a Marriage Bill which  again

would  be very controversial in nature, I had better

leave   the  whole  matter  in  the  hands  of   the

Government  which can iron out the differences  with

the  aid  of public opinion in Singapore.  There  is

also a section of Hindus in Singapore, Sir, who feel

that  marriages should be performed  in  a  reformed

style,  but I feel, Sir, that both the old style  of

marriages   and   the  reformed  style   should   be

recognised in any Marriage Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why I want the Government to go

into  this matter has already been mentioned  by  me

earlier.  I would suggest, Sir, that the Government,

if  my  motion is accepted, call a meeting  of   all

representatives  of  Hindu  organisations  and  then

appoint  a working party, with the aid of the  Hindu

Advisory  Board, of course, to go into this question

very thoroughly, so that whatever little differences

they have amongst themselves can be ironed out and a

Bill  which  is  acceptable to  all  Hindus  can  be

introduced into this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my motion, as it stands today, is absolutely

non-political  in  character and  I  am  placing  it

before the Assembly in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>



the  hope  that Members will rise above their  Party

level and give it the support that it deserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take this opportunity, Sir, of thanking

the Hindu Sabhai, the Malayan Tamil Associations  in

Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, the Dravagalagam, Mr G.

Sarangapany   (the  representative  of   the   Tamil

Representative Council) and Mr C. R. Dasaratha  Raj

for giving me their advice, guidance and cooperation

in my endeavour to introduce this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to congratulate publicly those

organisations in my constituency for their sense  of

social  consciousness  and readiness  to  co-operate

amongst themselves for the sake of social reform  so

necessary when the people of Singapore are  marching

towards self-government and independence. Sir, I beg

to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have great

pleasure  in seconding the motion before the  House.

It is very necessary that a married couple must have

a  marriage certificate. It has been most disturbing

to  the  Hindus  that  there is  no  such  machinery

existing in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Bill was introduced in the previous

Legislative  Council  by  an intelligent  local-born

gentleman, Mr Dasaratha Raj. This Bill was referred

to  a  Select Committee. As the mover of the  motion

has said, owing to the General Elections, the Report

of  the  Select Committee was not submitted  to  the

Council.  I do not know why this was so. A year  has

passed since this Assembly came into existence,  and

I  do  not  know  why Government has not  taken  the

responsibility of picking up the threads left by the

previous Legislative Council - threads which are  most

important   to   a  very  important   community   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar has spoken at length on this

subject   and   has   told   us   of   the   various

representations received by him and by  many  of  us

here  on  this side of the House. I hope, just  like

the  Muslims  Bill,  Government  will  devote  their

immediate  attention  to  putting  an  end  to  this

troublesome matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

strange  as it may seem, as a non-Hindu  I  rise  to

support  the  motion. I have always maintained  that

religion  should not come within the four  walls  of

this  Assembly and should not prejudice  us  in  any

decision where religion is concerned. I do not  like

to  discuss the merits or demerits of the motion, as

it  only  calls  upon Government to  introduce  such

legislation as early as possible, but I  would  like

to  congratulate the Member for Seletar, who is  the

only   Hindu  Member  in  this  Assembly   who   has

initiative to move the introduction of such a motion

in  this  Assembly  in the social interests  of  the

Hindus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own Division, at least about 30 per cent of

my  electorate are Hindus, and when this motion came

into my hands after being circulated, I consulted  a

number  of them and they told me that this Bill  had

been   far,   far  delayed.  It  should  have   been

introduced  when  this Assembly met  in  April  last

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am all for any legislation in social reform and I

fully  support the motion introduced by  the  Member

for Seletar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has

considerable sympathy with the views which have been

expressed,  both by the hon. mover  of  this  motion

and  by  those  who  have supported  him.  I  think,

however, that it is only right that I should sound a

note of caution on the difficulties that face us  in

considering  the  motion.  I  was  hoping  that,  in

speaking  to it, we should get a clear lead  exactly

what  is  required, because, with all  respect,  the

wording  of the motion leaves the issues very  broad

and very indefinite. We are asked to provide for the

compulsory  registration  of  Hindu  marriages  "and

other  matters  connected  therewith",  and  if  the

Government is to legislate on a matter which is  one

of   considerable  religious  controversy,   it   is

important  that we should have a clear lead  exactly

what  is meant by the "other matters connected  with

Hindu marriages".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar, in moving his motion,

referred  to the desire to have marriages registered

and   he  referred  to  the  desire  to  have  Hindu

marriages made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>



monogamous.  Now, he did not make  it  clear  to  me

whether he was speaking as a member of that religion

who  thought  it right that, by statute,  we  should

compel  Hindus to be monogamous. That is one of  the

first  important  questions  that  have  got  to  be

decided   before   we  can  proceed   to   introduce

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have referred to the fate of a

previous attempt to introduce legislation concerning

Hindu marriages, and it has been suggested that  the

Bill  introduced in the previous Legislative Council

was unfortunately brought to nought by the expiry of

the  time of that Council. As another Member put  it

rather more colourfully, it was brought to nought by

reason of the elections - a somewhat strange cause.

But, in fact, a contributory cause to the failure to

get  that Bill on the statute book was that  it  did

arouse  very acute controversy amongst those persons

who   profess  the  Hindu  religion,  and   my   own

impression of it is that if we are not careful,  the

same  fate will befall any new legislation which  we

may  introduce. We must try to ensure that  it  does

not  founder on acute religious controversy  amongst

the very people whom we are trying to help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the present position to be that a

number  of  Hindus,  including  the  Hindu  Advisory

Board, do want legislation to be introduced to  make

the  registration of Hindu marriages compulsory;  to

legislate that Hindu marriages should be monogamous;

to make provision for divorce; and to make provision

for  the  ages at which Hindus shall be  allowed  to

marry.  From the representations we received on  the

previous  occasion,  there are  a  number  of  other

organisations in the Hindu community  some  of  whom

support  some  of  those points  and  some  of  whom

support  only  one; but there is, in particular,  an

organisation known as the Tamils Reform Association,

and  that  Association has on two occasions produced

an  alternative  draft Bill with  the  request  that

their draft Bill, which they claim is a simple Bill,

should  be introduced without any further  delay  to

settle   the  other  very  much  more  controversial

issues. In their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>



draft Bill, they merely ask that the registration of

Hindu  marriages  should  be  compulsory  and   they

suggest  that,  if legislation is provided  to  make

registration   compulsory,  that  could   meet   the

greatest and the common need of the Hindu community.

They  are against embarking on further controversial

matters such as provisions for monogamy, for divorce

and  other connected matters. When those views  were

produced   two  years  ago - I  think  it   is   about

that - there was very considerable criticism by  other

members  of  the Hindu community who said  that  the

Tamils  Reform Association was really an Association

of  Tamils and not an Association of Hindus, and  it

was  not  representative of Hindu  opinion.  Whether

that is a valid criticism or not, I am sure I do not

know,  but the point I do want to emphasise is  that

this  is  a  matter which has, in the  past,  roused

great  public controversy between persons professing

the  Hindu religion, and unless we can get some lead

which  appears to be unanimous or nearly  unanimous,

it  is  going  to  be  extremely difficult  for  the

Government,  with  the best will in  the  world,  to

draft  legislation which will be acceptable  to  the

majority of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was, I think, suggested that there was no way at

the present moment in which a Hindu marriage can  be

registered.  It is true that there is  no  provision

for registering Hindu marriages as such, but I think

it  is  possible  for Hindus who marry  to  register

their  marriages under the Civil Marriage Ordinance.

That,  I know, is not what is asked for but it  does

provide some facility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make it clear, Sir, that the

Government  has,  as  I think  I  have  said,  great

sympathy  with this request on behalf of  the  Hindu

community for legislation to enable their affairs of

marriage to be more satisfactorily regulated, and  I

am  quite  prepared to give an undertaking  that  we

will give facilities for legislation; but I think  I

must  say that before we can make any real progress,

it will be necessary for the leading members and the

leading organisations of the Hindu community to  try

to reach some measure of agreement on precisely what

legislation  would  be acceptable  to  them  at  the

present time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>



Provided  that the Hindus can make it  clear  to  us

what they want and we can have a reasonable prospect

of  drafting and introducing legislation which  will

not  provoke intense religious controversy,  then  I

can  assure  you that the Government  will  be  very

ready to examine this question in consultation  with

Hindu public opinion. But we do not wish - and I think

the House will agree that it would be ill-advised - in

trying  to help the Hindu community to get ourselves

involved in perhaps a bitter religious controversy.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  not a Hindu but I am interested in this problem,

and  it  seems to me rather amusing that a  bachelor

like  the Member for Seletar should be so interested

in  the question of marriage and divorce. Whether he

is contemplating marriage in the near future or not,

he  has  not informed us. Whether there  is  a  girl

behind  the  throne  who  wants  to  compel  him  to

register  their impending marriage, he has also  not

informed  us.  But  I never like  to  make  anything

compulsory.  If  registration of marriages  for  the

Hindus or for any other race is necessary, it should

be  voluntary  and not compulsory. The  Hindus  have

customs  as  old as the Chinese or other communities

of  Singapore, and they may like to stick  to  their

customs  and  not want to register their  marriages.

So, on the question of compulsory registration, I am

not in favour of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with

considerable  hesitation that I  voice  my  Party's

opinion  on this motion. One of the reasons why  the

British  has survived for so long in their  colonies

is   because  they  never  tamper  with  deep-seated

loyalties  and prejudices, loyalties to a particular

religion,  a  particular mode of life, a  particular

mode   of   conduct.  This  policy  of  the  British

Government, which has worked so successfully in  the

past,  has led us into curious situations. We  have,

for  instance,  in Singapore today polygamy  legally

recognised  because, at the time  when  the  British

first came here, the people who then lived here  had

polygamous institutions brought from the country  of

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>



origin.  Time has marched on in India and in  China,

but  time  has stayed still in British Malaya.  This

has  created urgent social problems. Today a Chinese

can have ten wives and fifteen concubines in Malaya,

but  if  he  were to go back to China, he  would  be

promptly put into gaol and his wives freed to  marry

others who can more satisfactorily look after  their

welfare. So it is that the Hindus in Singapore  have

been  allowed to carry on their religious  practices

without any let or hindrance from the Government. So

long  as the practice did not hamper the development

of   rubber  and  tin  and  such  other  useful  and

profitable   pursuits,  there  was  no  reason - quite

rightly,  the British thought - to interfere with  all

these human activities. But I am sure time must have

moved  on  in  India, and a great deal of  what  the

Indians   consider   to  be   the   less   desirable

characteristics of Hinduism, like a  widow  flinging

herself  on  her husband's funeral pyre,  have  been

completely  abolished  in  India.  But  I  think  in

Singapore - in law anyway - there is nothing to  prevent

a  widow from having a funeral pyre, upon which  she

can  immolate herself. So it is that the Member  for

Seletar  is concerned with the unsatisfactory  state

of the law relating to Hindus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not versed in Hindu law. It is one of

those subjects which I thought too erudite, and I am

still in a state of comfortable vagueness about  the

customs of the Hindus. But I do appreciate, from the

points  made by the Member for Seletar and supported

by  the  Muslim Member for Telok Ayer, that  certain

changes  have become necessary. But it seems  to  me

that the policy of separate legislation for separate

religions  may raise difficulties. I am  not  saying

that  it  is wrong. I am not saying that  we  should

oppose  it.  But we must consider the problem  which

this  kind  of legislation would create  for  us  if

every   religious   group - Taoists,   Buddhists   and

Confucians - were  to come before  this  Assembly  and

say,  "We believe in cutting a cockerel's neck  when

we  take  our  oath in the witness  box.  Therefore,

could you kindly provide for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>



such  ceremonies  to be performed  in  all  the  law

Courts of the Colony of Singapore?" The result would

be   that  we  might  have  in  Singapore  the  most

wonderful crystallisation and mummification  of  all

the  various cultures, customs and prejudices of the

peoples that ever settle here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole problem has to be carefully surveyed and

reviewed. One of the planks of several of the  women's  sections of political parties represented in this

Assembly  is the institution of monogamy.  Even  the

Malay community - I do not know if it is Kaum Ibu, but

it is some Malay women's organisation - have advocated

that  polygamy  be  abolished and  that  the  Malays

should  practise monogamy. There has  been  a  great

deal  of male resistance to this suggestion and  the

matter  is still unresolved. But for large  sections

of  the  population, particularly the  Chinese,  the

position is thoroughly unsatisfactory and completely

reprehensible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, one has in Singapore the curious spectacle

of  the  English law of intestacy of the  eighteenth

century  embellished  and  embroidered  to  fit  the

polygamous  institutions of China of the  eighteenth

century. When a man dies leaving ten wives  and  ten

children, those ten wives can all go to Court to get

probate in order that they can share what in English

law  has  been set aside for the widow - one-third  to

the widow, two-thirds to the children. The Courts in

this  Colony  administering English law  in  such  a

curious  position have said, "One-third to  all  the

widows, and two-thirds to all the children." This is

a  matter which should receive comprehensive review.

No  single political Party could brave the storm  of

religious protest and resistance, but if we  made  a

serious  attempt  to  reconcile religious  practices

with  modern-day  needs in a  modern-day  world,  we

might  then first decide whether special legislation

for  each religion is the answer, or whether omnibus

legislation  covering  all  religions,  except   the

Muslim  religion  which  is  an  almost  established

church in the Federation, might not be a better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>



answer than the proposal of the Member for Seletar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here, Sir, an amendment to move to this

motion  which  I  understand is  acceptable  to  the

mover, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

Committee   be   appointed  by  the  Government   to

investigate  the  need for and  advisability  of  an

Ordinance to provide for the compulsory registration

of  Hindu  marriages in Singapore and other  matters

connected  therewith in accordance  with  the  Hindu

Religion, customs and manners acceptable to all."



<br><br>The rest of the paragraph is left out.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Is that not fantastic?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have that amendment in writing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I heard an

involuntary  ejaculation from  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister. I do not know if my friend the Member  for

Seletar  is  in  agreement  with  my  amendment.   I

understood  that  he  was, but  if  anything  should

appear fantastic to anybody, let me be the first  to

withdraw. I wanted to be helpful, but if  I  am  not

helpful  then  I would like to have it  pointed  out

where  I  was wrong. I am only suggesting  that  the

matter should be carefully looked into. If there are

controversial points, it can be argued  between  all

those  worthy organisations to which the Member  for

Seletar has referred and by all the worthy and civic-conscious  leaders  of the Tamil  community.  Rather

than  have the forum here in this Assembly, we might

have  it in some discreet part of the building where

a   Committee  could  sit  with  relative  calm  and

composure to hear opposing and conflicting points of

view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.

anything further in respect of his amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment

in  no way detracts from the original motion. All it

does is to get the ground cleared first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> May we hear the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>



the motion, as amended, would read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

Committee   be   appointed  by  the  Government   to

investigate   the  advisability   of   enacting   an

Ordinance to provide for the compulsory registration

of  Hindu  marriages in Singapore and other  matters

connected  therewith in accordance  with  the  Hindu

Religion,  customs  and manners  acceptable  to  all

Hindus and to make the necessary recommendations  to

the Government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not detract from the original motion except

that  it  provides for machinery whereby differences

of  opinion  as  to the content of such  legislation

could be more effectively resolved in Committee. Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> I second the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original motion was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that an

Ordinance to provide for the compulsory registration

of  Hindu  Marriages in Singapore and other  matters

connected  therewith in accordance  with  the  Hindu

Religion,  customs  and manners  acceptable  to  all

Hindus  is necessary; and that the Government should

introduce  the  necessary legislation  as  early  as

possible,  after consultation with the Hindu  public

opinion.



<br><br>Since  when an amendment has been proposed to  leave

out all the words after the words "opinion that"  in

the  original  motion  and to insert  the  words  "a

Committee   be   appointed  by  the  Government   to

investigate   the  advisability   of   enacting   an

Ordinance to provide for the compulsory registration

of  Hindu  marriages in Singapore and other  matters

connected  therewith in accordance  with  the  Hindu

Religion,  customs  and manners  acceptable  to  all

Hindus and to make the necessary recommendations  to

the Government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to make

two observations on the proposed amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is to draw attention to the fact that the

amendment makes a very substantial change, and  that

is  this.  The  original motion put forward  by  the

Member  for  Seletar  expressed  the  opinion   that

legislation  is  desirable,  whereas  we   are   now

proposing to set up a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>



Committee to discover whether or not legislation  is

advisable. I am not saying that it is not  a  better

way  of approaching the problem, but it seems to  me

to be fundamentally different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I should like to put forward

for the consideration of the House is that there  is

in  existence today, and it has been for many years,

what  is  known  as the Hindu Advisory  Board.  That

Board  consists  of  a  number  of  Hindus  who  are

appointed  for the express purpose of  advising  the

Government  on  precisely  such  matters  as   this,

namely,   matters   affecting  Hindu   customs   and

religion. It would appear, at first sight, though it

may  not  be the intention of the Assembly, that  by

appointing  a Committee we indicate that  the  Hindu

Advisory  Board  is not the most  suitable  body  to

advise us on this question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I am really at a loss to know what

is  in  the mind of the Government. Originally,  the

Hon. the  Chief  Secretary stated  that  the  Hindu

Advisory Board has made certain recommendations  and

the Tamils Reform Association are against them. That

would mean substantially that the recommendation  of

the  Hindu Advisory Board is not really the view  of

Hindu  public  opinion  in  Singapore.  I  find   it

difficult to reconcile the two arguments, and  I  am

inclined  to  accept the amendment because  of  this

reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I had made a good case for my original

motion when I had explained the whole circumstances,

and  it  would  appear that, because differences  of

public opinion among Hindus exist in Singapore,  the

Government  could  do  very little  in  the  way  of

promoting  legislation. Now, I think the  suggestion

made  by  the  mover of the amendment clearly  shows

that  if  there  are  such differences  and  if  the

Government  cannot tackle them,  then  it  would  be

necessary  to appoint a Committee to find  out  what

public  opinion is in regard to Hindu  marriages.  I

feel  the  Government must accept the situation  one

way  or  the  other, and I can only  hope  that  the

alternative suggestion put before the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>



House, would be accepted by Government,  otherwise

they would have accepted my original motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,   there   is  no  difficulty  in  understanding

Government's  attitude. It seeks at  all   times  to

meet  the  legitimate requirements of the people  of

the  country.  There is no question  but   that  the

Hindu  population,  as I understand it, desire  some

sort  of legislation but the unfortunate part  about

this  motion, and one that has taken us by surprise,

is  that  it  seems  to  have been  so  inadequately

prepared.  It is true that legislation is  required,

but  the  hon. Member who has proposed it  does  not

seem to have delved sufficiently into the background

to  enquire into the possibility that there could be

any  question of unanimity on the part of the  Hindu

population in respect of the matter which  he  seeks

to  raise.  Sir, we could introduce  the  Bill,  and

fairly  soon,  for  the compulsory  registration  of

Hindu     marriages   which   might   find   general

acceptance,  but the other issues which many  Hindus

feel  should  be  tackled  at  the  same  time   are

extremely difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Hindu Advisory Board has been referred to,

and so that there should be no misunderstanding that

it is this Board that the hon. Member wishes to have

represented,  I should like to say  that  it  is  in

existence  and should be named; but  if  it  is,  in

fact,  not named, then Government would be  free  to

appoint  to  this  Committee members  of  the  Hindu

Advisory Board as well as others who would not  have

been appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say, Sir, that in respect of the

exclamation which the Member for Tanjong Pagar seems

to have taken  resentment to -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Your resentment to -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - the fact is that at that time

I found it somewhat fantastic because I was drafting

an amendment almost identical to the one he moved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Great minds think alike!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am so happy to see my friend

flattering himself!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say this on behalf of the

Government.  We  will appoint this  Committee  with

pleasure. We can but hope that it will produce  some

degree of unanimity. We hope that at  least on  some

aspects,  particularly on the aspect of  compulsory

registration,  we shall have a firm  recommendation.

We accept this recommendation, Sir, contained in the

amendment  as  being a helpful  one,  and  we  shall

certainly  vote  in favour of it. But  from  what  I

understand,  Sir, it is going to  be  a  matter  for

prominent members of the Hindu community to try  to

sink  their  differences if there  is  going  to  be

anything worth  while produced by Government by  way

of an Ordinance following on this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the

Chief Secretary, in replying to the original motion,

said that the last attempt at legislation could  not

be   brought  into  being  because  of  the  various

differences  of opinion existing amongst  the  Hindu

community  and their various bodies. This  amendment

has  solved  his  troubles.  The  Government  should

appoint  a Committee and all these bodies will  come

before the Committee and present their views.  Where

they  are  unanimous  on, say, the  registration  of

marriages, that may be accepted. Other things,  like

the age of the marriage or the divorce, can also  be

tackled by that Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I can understand, the difficulty really

is  this - that a married couple require a certificate

to prove that they were legally married. This is the

actual trouble that is going on in Singapore and the

Federation.  This is actually what is required,  and

if  the  points  that  these people  give  in  their

evidence  are unanimous, then the Government  should

at  least help them by bringing in such legislation.

I think this amendment solves the question by having

a Committee appointed and this Committee can examine

all these matters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> We had the Committee before.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak with

great timidity on this sort of subject because I am

a  religious man myself, and I should hate to  have

my  religion  interfered with;  but I feel  that  we

are  hopefully   looking forward  to  an  increasing

national   unity  which  tends  to   mean   national

uniformity  in behaviour and standards and so  on - that people more  or  less  behave in the same  kind

of way, which is the Malayan way, and not any other

kind  of way. But the way  to achieve that sort  of

national  unity and national  uniformity is  not  to

try  to  get  large-scale  legislation  which  makes

massive   changes   rather  rapidly.    That    does

possibly seem to be implied in this motion. I am not

sure.  The "other matters" are unspecified and  they

might  merely be whether you register your children

as  well or whether you do not do not know what  the

"other matters" might be, but it obviously could  be

very  far-reaching  in matters  connected  with  the

Hindu religion particularly almost anywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sort of thing that seems to me to be desirable

is  that we should accept for practical purposes the

fact  that,  here and there, everybody  accepts  the

same law. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary can

correct me if I am wrong, but I think that no matter

what  your  religion is, as far as  the  Income  Tax

Ordinance  goes, you are only allowed one wife.  Mr

Speaker, I do not know whether I am correct or  not,

but that is my understanding of it. That seems to be

the  way  in  which we should go to work to  produce

national uniformity. [Interruption.] If you have  not

got a wife, you cannot claim for her as well!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You need a certificate too!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> That seems to me the way in which we

should go to work. I am a little doubtful about this

amendment because it does reproduce a certain amount

of  the difficulty which was in the original motion.

"acceptable to all Hindus" - I just do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>



believe,  I  am afraid, Mr Speaker,  that  you  are

going  to get something which is acceptable  to  all

Hindus  or even  to the massive majority.  There  is

sure  to be some influential society or group  which

says, "No, we think the opposite." It is always like

that   in  human  affairs,  whether  it  is  Hindus,

British,  or  anybody else, and I  prefer  the  much

simpler  motion  "to study the needs and  wishes  of

the  Hindu  community with regard to Hindu marriages

and  to make recommendations" which would leave  you

without these rather restrictive clauses about being

in  accordance with the Hindu religion, customs  and

manners acceptable to all Hindus. But I will save

time and assume that this will be read in a generous

light by the Committee and I will not move a further

amendment to this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

regarding  this question, I think it is better   for

me,  in  supporting this amendment, not to  add  any

word,  because, as I understand, this amendment  has

been  actually  brought  up  by   two  of  the  most

brilliant Members in the Assembly. I would, however,

like   to  point  out  that  the  Government  should

recognise  and  admit that such a  Bill  is  already

overdue and that immediate action should be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out

in  the  original  motion, be left  out,"  put,  and

agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question now is, "That the words

proposed to be inserted, be there inserted." For the

benefit of the hon. Members, I will read those words

again. The words are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"a Committee be appointed by the Government to

investigate   the  advisability   of   enacting   an

Ordinance to provide for the compulsory registration

of  Hindu  marriages in Singapore and other  matters

connected  therewith in accordance  with  the  Hindu

Religion,  customs  and manners  acceptable  to  all

Hindus and to make the necessary recommendations  to

the Government."



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to take the

opportunity of elucidating a phrase which is  in  my

motion,   and  that  is,  "other  matters  connected

therewith  in  accordance with the  Hindu  Religion,

customs and manners acceptable to all Hindus".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this motion has been so worded is to

satisfy  both sides. If I had only said "registration

of  marriages" and then stopped there,  we  would  be

getting a lot of representations from people who also

wanted some other religious matters incorporated into

the  Marriage Bill. So I thought that, side  by  side

with having registration of Hindu Marriages, it would

be  advisable  for the Government to  consider  other

aspects  connected with Hindu marriages and religion.

Therefore,   I   added   "other   matters   connected

therewith". When I said "therewith", it does not mean

Hinduism and its law in all aspects, but I only  said

"connected  therewith". That means  only  Hindu  laws

affecting marriages. So you appreciate, Sir, that the

question   which   the   Hon. the   Minister    for

Communications  and  Works has raised  in  regard  to

Hindu  law does not arise. It only affects marriages.

In  Hindu  law,  there are only certain  cases  which

affect  religion,  just  like the  sacred  ceremonies

which  are  held.  One  side says,  "We  want  sacred

ceremonies to be held." Another side says, "No, we do

not  want  any  sacred ceremonies. Just  call  a  few

people  and have a feast and then that is the end  of

the  marriage." That is the main reason, Sir,  why  I

inserted this particular phrase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that everybody is agreed on this motion, I do

not  wish to say too much on this except to leave the

whole matter in the hands of the Committee which will

consider the other relevant matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be inserted,

be there inserted," put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question now is the original

motion, as amended, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

Committee   be   appointed  by  the   Government   to

investigate the advisability of enacting an Ordinance

to  provide for the compulsory registration of  Hindu

marriages  in  Singapore and other matters  connected

therewith  in  accordance with  the  Hindu  Religion,

customs and manners acceptable to all Hindus  and  to

make the necessary recommendations to the Government.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a

Muslim  myself, I think this motion before the  House

should  be  given full support, because we are  fully

aware that some religions have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>



not been brought up to date. This is the time that

religions should be respected and I hope all Members

of the House will support this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

Committee   be   appointed  by  the   Government   to

investigate the advisability of enacting an Ordinance

to  provide for the compulsory registration of  Hindu

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly do now adjourn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<div align="center"><b>COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Forthcoming Visits)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the subject I

wish  to  raise on the adjournment is the forthcoming

visit  of  Commonwealth Parliamentary delegations  at

the invitation of the Hon. the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that an all-Party delegation is coming

shortly from the United Kingdom and that one  of  the

objectives of this delegation is, in the words of our

Chief Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They would meet all sections of the people,

political Parties, unions and representatives of  all

communities  to  assess  the  people's  desire   for

independence."



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, the British Government spends  a

great  deal  of  money on intelligence  sources  like

Phoenix Park and such agencies. I am certain that the

Rt.  Hon.  Mr  Alan  Lennox-Boyd is  not  altogether

ignorant  of the powerful, if sometimes inarticulate,

desire   of   the  people  to  be  rid  of   colonial

domination.  However,  a  delegation  is  shortly  to

arrive in Singapore and I hope that we shall all take

advantage of the opportunity to bring home to the six

Members  of Parliament the urgency of the problem  in

Singapore. It may be true that both the Labour  Party

leader of the delegation and the Conservative Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>



leader  of  the delegation - the Rt. Hon. Mr  Herbert

Morrison, P.C., M.P., and the Rt. Hon. Mr  Geoffrey

Lloyd, P.C., M.P. - are persons who have perhaps known

better  political times in their careers, but  I  am

sure  they  are not altogether without influence  in

their  Parties and we may be able, through them,  to

influence  the  policy  of  their  Parties   towards

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what indeed alarmed me was a news report in the

Straits Times of the 28th of February. On the  front

page of that newspaper it says:



<br><br>"AUSSIES TO ASSESS MERDEKA PLAN



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia and New Zealand are expected to join in

the  test  to  find out if Singapore  is  ready  for

Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Britain, these countries are planning to send

all-Party parliamentary delegations to the Colony to

assess Singapore's fitness for independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is unlikely that their delegations will

arrive   here  before  the  Colony's  April   self-government talks take place in London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because of the short notice given to the

governments of the two countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The likely acceptance of Australia and New Zealand

to  participate in the Merdeka test was announced in

Singapore  last  night  by  their  External  Affairs

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr R. G. Casey (Australia) and Mr T. L. MacDonald

(New  Zealand) are on their way to attend the  SEATO

conference at Karachi."



<br><br>Sir,  there  has been no denial of this report  from

the  Office of the Commissioner for Australia or New

Zealand,  and  I have to take it that the  newspaper

has   accurately   reported  the  External   Affairs

Ministers  of the two territories. I can  only  say,

Sir,  that there is no better way than this for  the

Australians  and  the  New Zealanders  not  to  make

friends  and influence people in South-East Asia.  I

do  not understand how a small nation of ten million

people  in  an  enormous  continent  can  have   the

impertinence and the impudence to come along  in  an

all-Party  delegation for a few weeks to assess  and

to  examine my fitness to be my own master in my own

home.  We  all  understand that the Australians  are

anxious  about the position in Malaya, because  they

are  anxious about their own defence position in the

Pacific. They have joined in a military



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>



alliance   called   the   South-East   Asia   Treaty

Organisation  in  which they have persuaded  certain

Asian countries to join them. We also know that they

are extremely anxious to get Malaya and Singapore to

join in this South-East Asia Treaty Organisation. In

fact,  they wanted to send troops to the  Colony  of

Singapore,   until  the  Hon. the  Chief   Minister

indicated  that it would not be wise.  But,  however

imperative  their  own need for  a  defence  outpost

several thousand miles away from their own homeland,

it  is  unforgivable arrogance on their  part, when

they  are not even the colonial power in Malaya,  to

say  that  they  are coming, like  the  British,  to

assess Singapore's fitness for independence -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Moment of interruption.

The  motion for the adjournment has lapsed.  I  need

another motion for the adjournment, please.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly do now adjourn.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, "That the Assembly do

now  adjourn." The Member for Tanjong Pagar has  the

Floor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

that  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  was  somewhat

confused  as  to  the  likely developments  of  this

debate. I am sure that he will agree with me that if

some  outsider - and an Australian is an  outsider  in

the  Malayan  context - comes along and says,  "I  am

going   to  see  whether  you  are  fit  to   govern

yourselves independently of Britain", all that I can

say to that Australian is, "Hands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>



off  Asia!  If  you  do not want to  antagonise  six

million Asians in Malaya, better Press relations and

better  and  more sincere professions of  friendship

and co-operation should be made manifest."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Hon. the

Chief  Minister  invited certain other  Commonwealth

countries,  notably India, Pakistan  and  Ceylon.  I

have  not heard the replies from either the External

Affairs  Ministers  of  these  territories  or   the

Commissioners that these Commonwealth countries have

in  Malaya.  It  would  appear  that  they  have  no

intention  of  coming  to  assess  our  fitness  for

independence.  They, being Asians,  would  know  the

feeling,  the temper and the attitude of  a  subject

people. On behalf of the Asians in Singapore, I tell

the  Australians and the New Zealanders that if they

think  they are coming here to share in the colonial

tutelage  of this country, then they are making  one

of  their greatest political blunders in the history

of  the  Pacific. We all know that the British  want

gently  to  ease  themselves out. Australian  troops

have  appeared.  The last time they  appeared  here,

they  left in a great hurry, including their  Major-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, indeed. But let me tell

them this, that if they want to make friends - and  we

want to make friends with everybody - then the way  to

do  it  is  not to come and assess our  fitness  for

independence. "Come, visit us, be our friends,  send

us  reconstituted milk plants if you will.  Send  us

the  free  powdered  milk to work the  reconstituted

milk  plants if you like." But if they come to  test

the  fitness  of  our people for independence,  they

will  not find the friendly response which  as  good

neighbours they would wish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to this report, they

are  not likely to come before April because of  the

short  notice  given to them. I  do  not  know  what

useful  purpose would be served if they  came  after

April  to  judge  our fitness for  independence.  By

then, certain  matters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>



would  have  been  settled between the all-Party delegation from Singapore  and the  British  Government in the Colonial  Office  in

London. If they must send a delegation, let it be  a

delegation  to  foster trade between  Australia  and

Malaya,   to  foster  more  friendliness  and   more

contacts between Australians and Malayans,  but  let

it   have   nothing  to  do  with  our   fight   for

independence, because they are not our  masters  and

we will have none of them.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, in our struggle to

achieve  freedom  from  colonialism  and  to  attain

independence, we now and then get sharply pulled  up

with   a  shock  by  conduct  which,  to  us,  seems

incompatible with basic human decency. I  know  that

the people of Singapore are a peaceable and a decent

people.   I   often  wonder  why   some   of   their

representatives are what they are. I know  that  the

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar is  one  of  the  ablest

debaters, with a tremendous appreciation of his  own

oratory; and I would willingly move that for 29 days

out of 30 in every month he should have the whole of

this   hall  to  himself,  to  speak  to   his   own

delectation,  if  we could have  avoided  this  most

unfortunate, most untimely, most improper  and  most

unfair   attack  on  neighbours  who   are   seeking

genuinely  to be nothing more than our  friends  and

our  supporters. At a time when we in Singapore need

every  one who is a friend to stand by us,  that  we

should in this fashion slap them in the face because

of  a report which does not even report in the first

person,  is,  Sir, a gratuitous insult.  Sir,  there

might   even   have   been  an   excuse   for   this

extraordinary  tirade, but I said to  this  Assembly

this  morning, in the clearest possible words,  that

the   only   term   of  the  invitation   to   these

Commonwealth countries with whom we aspire to be  in

partnership was, as Singapore is seeking the  status

of    an   independent   member   of   the   British

Commonwealth,  that  the  Government  considered  it

appropriate  to  invite all Dominion governments  to

send parliamentary delegations so that they may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>



have the opportunity to acquaint themselves fully of

issues  which  may affect them arising  out  of  our

desire for independence within the Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the invitation went from this Government, and

it  is  because we seek to be their equal and it  is

because, in seeking to be their equal, if we  should

attain  that status, it would affect each and  every

Commonwealth member, that we thought it only  proper

to give them the opportunity, should they so desire,

to  come  here  and  judge of the issues  which  may

affect  their own status in accepting an  additional

independent member of the Commonwealth. No statement

that I know of has ever been made by Mr Casey or by

Mr  MacDonald, but the Straits Times  has  reported

that  they  are here. The Straits Times  itself  has

misunderstood. The purpose of this visit, as I  say,

might  have  been the occasion for a  question, but

after it had been made clear to this House that  the

purpose was no more than that these Dominions should

have  their  rightful opportunity to  judge  of  the

issues  which  might affect them  in  taking  in  an

independent  member into the Commonwealth, such  an

attack, Sir, is utterly unreasonable and one that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>



most  unfortunate  in its timing when  we  need  our

friends;  most unfortunate in indicating that  there

is  in this territory a group whose anti-white  hate

goes  beyond the bounds of logic and may spill  into

completely unreasonable conduct, an example of which

this  Assembly  has seen here this  afternoon.  That

such  an  unnecessary, such a gratuitous insult  and

attack  should have been made by the  leader  of  an

allegedly responsible Party that pretends and  hopes

one  day  to  rule  Singapore, that  terms  of  such

violence  should have been used, because a newspaper

has  seen fit to speak of their coming here, in this

fashion   is   most  improper,  Sir,   and   it   is

regrettable.  And I would like to  say,  Sir,  as  a

representative  of a section of the people  of  this

country, that I find in the highest degree repulsive

the  action, the motives and the language which have

prompted the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the Assembly do now adjourn," put,

and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
