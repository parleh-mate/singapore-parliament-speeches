<div align="center"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT INTEGRATION BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I lay upon the Table a Certificate

of  Urgency signed by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  in

respect of the Local Government Integration Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it that hon. Members are in

possession  of printed copies of the Bill.  If  they

are  not,  the  Clerk will, supply the  copies.  The

Certificate is in order. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been referred to Select Committee

twice  and as this Assembly is to meet for the  last

time  on Thursday, a Certificate of Urgency has been

obtained  from  His Excellency the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara to enable proceedings on tie Third Reading of

the Bill to be taken today which would not otherwise

have  been possible in view of the period of  notice

required by the Standing Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unanimity was reached in Select Committee on

the  amendments which have been made  to  the  Bill.

There were two important amendments: one to clause 5

to  provide that City Council properties should vest

in the Government on integration subject to existing

rights and obligations; and the other to clause  179

to provide a period of limitation of three years for

bringing  proceedings against any  breaches  of  the

Ordinance  and  the Regulations.  The  rest  of  the

amendments were minor drafting amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this Bill becomes law, the legal work

concerning the integration of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



the  City  Council departments with  the  Government

departments  will  have been  accomplished  and  the

Local  Government Ordinance of 1957 will  have  been

repealed in toto. The winding up of the City Council

and  the Rural Board was one of the major planks  in

the  platform  of  the P.A.P. in  the  1959  general

elections,  and I am glad to report that  this  work

has  been completed today at a time when the  P.A.P.

Government is about to seek a fresh mandate from the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of senior Government officials have spent

a  lot  of time and study on the work of integration

of  the  City Council departments and the Government

departments,  and I should like to place  on  record

our  deep  appreciation of the good work  they  have

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

(30th July, 1963).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That in pursuance of the resolution of this House

taken on the 10th June, 1963 that there should be an

early settlement fair and just to both sides on  the

basis of the terms of the White Paper (Paper Cmd. 33

of  1961) and mindful of the long and arduous battle

for merger, this House



<br><br>WELCOMES   the  successful  outcome  in  the   final

agreement reached in London on 9th July. 1963, which

agreement contains the terms in the said White Paper

with  amendments  made  on  a  quid  pro  quo  basis

into the Constitution in return for a percentage  of

Singapore's revenue of national taxes instead of  an

annual lump sum as contribution for Federal services

in Singapore, and

ADOPTS  the constitutional provisions and amendments

contained  in Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963.".  -(The  Prime

Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  the House rose last night, I was talking about

the  P.A.P. propaganda play-up on the supposed 1,300

acres  of  land that the Prime Minister of Singapore

is  supposed to have got back for Singapore from the

British War Department. I was telling the House  how

he  even  said that if he had only stood his  ground

for  another 24 or 48 hours he would have got Duncan

Sandys  down  on his bended knees before  the  great

anti-colonial P.A.P. hero. But the letter  from  Mr

Duncan  Sandys clearly states the position.  Blakang

Mati  with its 658 acres will not be released  until

1966 and the Sembawang land will not be released  at

all. Even Fort Canning will be released only if  and

when  - these are very important words, Sir, "if  and

when"  - the  British do not want it and  only  after

adequate   compensation  from  the   Government   of

Singapore  has been paid. The Prime Minister  claims

he has obtained from the U.K. Government $10 million

as payment for illegal occupation of Singapore land.

But  let us be very clear what the money is for.  It

is not for rent or compensation of the land occupied

by  the military forces. Any rent payable is only  a

nominal sum of $1 per site. The Singapore Government

under the P.A.P. can be extraordinarily generous  to

the colonial Government - their colonial masters - but

not  to the people. And only licence money collected

from farmers cultivating land now illegally occupied

by  the British military forces will be made payable

to  the  Singapore  Government.  That  amount,  Sir,

cannot  amount  to very much. The $10 million  which

the U.K. Government will make available to Singapore

is   only   meant   "for  raising,   equipping   and

accommodating the Second Battalion of the  Singapore

Infantry  Regiment  up to 31st  August,  1963,  when

Singapore's   financial   responsibility    ceases."

Therefore, we hear right from the horse's mouth that

the money is only for raising



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



the  Second Battalion, which we all know  is  to  be

used  by the colonial Government for the suppression

of  the  hopes and aspirations of the people in  the

region. P.A.P. propaganda has created the impression

that  the money is payment for compensation of  land

now  occupied  by the British military  forces.  But

this  is not so. The Prime Minister may say anything

in his own letter to Mr Duncan Sandys, but the fact

remains  that  the  $10 million given  by  the  U.K.

Government  is  given only for the  raising  of  the

military forces. We hope the P.A.P. Government  will

have  enough guts to tell the people all this.  Tell

them  the  truth. Do not hide. Anyway, however  much

the P.A.P. may want to hide, we will expose them. It

is  time  that the P.A.P. realise that  they  cannot

deceive the people all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, we may ask, if the military forces

really are in illegal occupation of Singapore  land,

why does the P.A.P. not use its police and courts to

evict  the British forces from occupation? The brave

P.A.P. has done this often enough but only  against

poor,  defence-less men and women who  cannot  fight

back  against the police and the troops.  Would  the

P.A.P. dare  to  take  action against  the  British

forces?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the matter of the loan of $150 million for

the development of the Borneo territories, the Prime

Minister  tries a face-saving device by asking  that

50  per  cent of the labourers who will be used  for

such  development should be supplied from Singapore.

He  claims that these terms are written on the  back

of an envelope and allegedly signed by the Tunku. He

claims  that  50 per cent of labour, including  even

contractors, must come from Singapore in the use  of

the  $150  million  loan. Here  we  see  the  absurd

position  of the P.A.P. On the one hand,  the  Prime

Minister  said that he had "insisted" that  the  so-called  common  market terms  be  written  into  the

Constitution  and that nothing else  would  be  good

enough.  He  repeatedly said during his constituency

tours that the M.C.A. in the Federation is trying to

soak  the  people of Singapore and that, because  of

that, the common market



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



arrangement  must be written into the  Constitution.

Yet, on the other hand, the Prime Minister tells  us

that  something scribbled, rather illegibly at that,

on  the back of an envelope is as good a bond in the

conduct of affairs of State. Is this not evidence of

the Gilbert and Sullivan cuckoo-land of Lee Kuan Yew

and his Ministers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is today published in the Nanyang Siang

Pau   a  letter  with  the  scribbled  envelope   in

photostat  for all to see. We can see  a  few  words

scribbled and clown below some more scribbling  with

big  crosses all over the place. In a statement,  it

says  that the Tunku's signature on the back of that

envelope  means  only acceptance of the  points  for

discussion  and that the envelope cannot be  treated

as  an official document. They even complained  that

the  action  of the Prime Minister of  Singapore  in

raising  this matter for open discussion is  just  a

little  hit  too much. I wonder if you can  see  all

this, Sir, from your place -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Could the hon. Member say whose

opinion  he  is  quoting?  Is  it  an  authoritative

opinion?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is from the Federation

Government. Sir,I will give you the translation  of

the  headlines. "Tunku and Lee Kuan Yew - negotiations

in  England. Loan -" I think your interpreter may do

it  better  than I can. Can I just read these  words

out in Chinese so that he can -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already ruled that if

the   hon.  Member  wishes  for  a  passage  to   be

translated  by  the  Simultaneous Interpreters  from

Mandarin into English, he ought to supply them  with

a  copy  in advance. Otherwise, he must do his  best

and translate that passage himself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It says, Sir, the Tunku and Lee

Kuan Yew -negotiations in England, and the signature

about  the  loan  is not an official  document.  The

Federation   Government  does  not  recognise   open

discussion.  Those  are the  headlines,  Sir,If  I

translate  the  whole statement, it  will  take  too

long, so I will leave it at that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we see the ridiculousness and the absurdity of

the  Singapore P.A.P. Government claiming all  these

lots of things. Last night, I remember I pointed out

that the Prime Minister also claimed 1, 2, 3, 4,  5,

6,  7,  8  - many, many points in his letter  to  Tun

Razak.  Tun  Razak merely answered with  a  six-line

letter  to  his  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  words,

indirectly, giving a slap in the face to  the  Prime

Minister  of  Singapore. This is what has  happened.

Such  being the case, it is no wonder that there  is

such  a  strong  protest from Mr  Donald  Stephens,

Chief Minister-designate of Sabah, and also from the

Sarawak  politicians about this 50 per cent  labour.

Mr  Donald Stephens and the politicians in  Sarawak

are  not  slow in quoting the constitution on  their

State  powers over immigration. On the  other  hand,

Sir, search as we might, we cannot find anywhere  in

the  Constitution this 50 per cent labour  provision

which  the Prime Minister of Singapore wants  us  to

accept.  It  is no wonder that we see the ridiculous

situation in which we find the Deputy Prime Minister

of the Federation, Tun Razak, having to write on the

18th of July to the Prime Minister that there was no

use  to  reply  further  to  his  letters,  and  was

therefore returning all those letters to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, to Paper Misc. 5 of 1963, the

last  letter but one, dated 18th July? It is  only  a

few lines and it is worth reading, Sir. It reads:

<pre>

`Dear Prime Minister,



 You  will remember that shortly before the  signing

of  the  formal  agreement for the establishment  of

Malaysia  in London on 8th July. 1963, you forwarded

a  number  of  claims  on behalf  of  the  Singapore

Government  in the form of letters. As a  result  of

the  discussions between Tunku and yourself and  the

understanding reached between you it was agreed that

there was no need to reply further to these letters.

I am, therefore, returning them to you herewith.



                  Yours sincerely,

             (Sgd.) TUN ABDUL RAZAK BIN HUSSAIN AL-HAJ'.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not a slap in the face, what is? Has the

Prime Minister still face to tell us that he has got

this and that for the people of Singapore? The whole

trouble is that although he receives slaps and kicks

from  the Federation Ministers, the P.A.P. dare  not

answer back. In fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



they  are depending on the Federation Ministers  for

their  survival  today. I will come to  that  later,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these letters returned and not even a reply or

mention  of  the  claim  put forward  by  the  Prime

Minister of Singapore. It is pathetic that the Prime

Minister has to swallow his pride with words, "I  am

happy to leave it at that" when he never got what he

wanted to set. I refer you to the last letter of the

same   Paper,  the  last  sentence  of  the   second

paragraph. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am happy to leave it at that.'



<br><br>Because he cannot have anything else -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate interrupting the hon.

Member,  but  I do not think he should just  take  a

sentence  out  of context. I think the whole  letter

should be read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will, Sir. The letters reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have your letter of 18th July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can ignore the letter containing

the  eight  points because the note which the  Tunku

signed said that the last part of this letter  about

the   Inter-Governmental   Committee   was   to   be

cancelled. This will make no sense unless the letter

is  in fact published. As for the other points,  you

have  agreed  to  them, although they  will  not  be

enshrined in the Constitution. I am happy  to  leave

it at that.'



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> That

is better.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The other two letters have been superseded by this

signed note and can be ignored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enclose copy of the letter which I wrote to the

Tunku  enclosing a photostat copy of the note  which

he signed on the night of 8th July.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, Sir, you can see that although the Prime

Minister of Singapore lays so much stress on getting

the  terms  of  the Common Market enshrined,  as  he

says,  in  the Constitution, yet now he is happy  to

leave  it at that. Of course, the P.A.P. cannot  get

anything out of the Federation. What else can he do?

He must of course leave it at that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident, however, reveals the desperate

situation in which the Prime Minister found  himself

in London. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



was  pressured right and left and had to  sign  away

the  rights of the people of Singapore in order that

he might still have a hope of saving himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident also reveals another aspect of

politics in Malaya. That the Prime Minister  of  the

Federation could make such arrangements that binds a

State  without  prior consultation  with  the  State

concerned,  that  is,  if  the  Prime  Minister   of

Singapore's  allegation was true, shows how  readily

the  Central  Government ignores the wishes  of  the

people   of  the  various  states  of  the  proposed

Malaysia.   This  is  an  example  of  great   power

chauvinism which will always place the interests  of

the  Federation above the interests of other smaller

States. However, to come back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 50 per cent labour and contractors' claim of

the  P.A.P., if true, would, of course, be  able  to

benefit Singapore a bit, just a little, and  only  a

little. Only artisans and skilled workers will  have

the  chance  and  they are not  many  in  number  in

Singapore.  But  it is pertinent  to  ask,  Sir,  if

indeed  the $150 million loan was used for  economic

development, which we doubt, and so provide jobs for

the  people  of Singapore, why then has  the  P.A.P.

Government  not  used the same  money  in  Singapore

itself?  Why have jobs to be provided for in Borneo,

1,000  miles away, and not here in Singapore itself?

Would it not be possible then to use not 50 per cent

labour,  but 100 per cent labour from Singapore  and

really  give  thousands  of  jobs  to  our  tens  of

thousands of unemployed? What is the answer to this?

The P.A.P. will not be able to answer -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> shook his head.





<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He shakes his head, Sir. He

cannot answer -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.





<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the four to five times the

amount  of the loan in Singapore today is for  sheer

capital development projects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know what explanation

that  is. I asked a simple question, Sir. I said  if

the   money  was  really  going  to  be   used   for

development  and  for  the  employment  of  men   in

Singapore,  why cannot the development  projects  be

started  in Singapore itself? Why have 50  per  cent

labour  to be sent to Borneo when we can jolly  well

have  100  per  cent  labour provided  in  Singapore

itself?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He does not understand. Can I

make  it  so simple that a seven-year-old child  can

understand? $150 million spread over five  years  is

$30  million a year. Would the Member for Queenstown

agree  to this? That is correct - $30 million a year.

We  are spending in Singapore on the various capital

projects of the Government, of the Housing Board, of

the  Harbour Board and of the Public Utilities Board

and  so on, somewhere within five or six times  that

amount. So the answer is, we are spending more money

than  the  money that we are lending to  Borneo  and

Sarawak.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Unfortunately, the Minister for

Finance has not answered my question.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us get on with the debate.

We  are not in Committee. We are in the Assembly.  I

am  sure  the Minister for Finance in his time  will

answer all questions raised.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this is very important,

because unemployment is daily growing more and  more

acute   in   Singapore  as  a   result   of   P.A.P.

incompetence.  Forty thousand young  men  and  women

leave  school  every year. Where are  the  jobs  for

them?  Why does the P.A.P. not use the $150 million

to  help  our own young men and women? Why  loan  to

Borneo?  And  why on such terms? Singapore  borrows

from  the World Bank on terms which the people  call

humiliating  but  which  the P.A.P. considers  very

fair. The World Bank, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



giving  a  loan  of only $45 million  to  Singapore,

requires  that  the  Singapore  Government  enact  a

special  law  in order to enable the World  Bank  to

exact  those humiliating terms from Singapore.  What

is  worse,  all  our Municipal property  worth  many

times  the  $45 million is mortgaged for that  small

puny  loan.  So what happens? If Singapore  has  to

loan  $150  million, surely some form  of  terms  as

imposed  by  the World Bank should he considered  if

the P.A.P. Government considers those terms fair and

just.  I  might  ask,  Sir, if  the  P.A.P.  Finance

Minister  realises  what the interest  of  the  $150

million  will  mean to the people of  Singapore.  We

already know, Sir, on 5� per cent interest, the $100

million  of  the  $150 million loan will  fetch  $55

million in ten years. But if Singapore has to borrow

money - let us assume that it is only on 5� per cent;

in  fact, it is more - in order to use that very  same

money to lend interest free to another country, then

in   fact   the  loss  incurred  by  the   Singapore

Government  would be twice $55 million.  It  becomes

$110 million in ten years.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I seem to recollect that the hon.

Member  did give these figures yesterday. I  do  not

wish  to  stop  the hon. Member because  this  is  a

debate of some importance. But may I remind him that

he  has now been speaking for five hours and  if  he

can  try  to avoid repetition, we might be  able  to

carry on with this debate more expeditiously.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir. I have no intention of

repeating  anything. But this is a new  point  which

has  just  occurred  to  me on  seeing  the  Finance

Minister in front of me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think my recollection is

quite  correct.  I  think these figures  were  given

yesterday. If I am wrong, I apologise. But if  I  am

right, that is repetition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It would be repetition, Sir,

only in regard to $110 million, as I was saying. But

there is another aspect of it, Sir. The other aspect

is  this, It means to the people of Singapore  this.

There  are 600,000 citizens in Singapore today.  Try

and divide $110 million by 600,000 citizens. If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



Minister for Finance's arithmetic is good enough, he

will  find  that it works out to $200  per  citizen.

That  is the amount of money that each citizen  will

lose  as  a  result  of P.A.P. generosity  with  the

people's  money.  Sir, this $200  means  money  from

every one of us.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Go back to primary school.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we have seen how the P.A.P.

has  step  by  step surrendered the  rights  of  the

people  of Singapore to the Federation. In so doing,

the  P.A.P. has sold Singapore completely  down  the

drain, lock, stock and barrel The terms as laid down

in  the  White Paper are unequal and unjust  enough.

But  the  terms in the Malaysia Agreement signed  in

London on the 9th July, 1963, are even more so.  The

Prime  Minister himself knows this. That is  why  he

said  he signed because of the Tunku, hoping to  use

the  Tunku's name as a shield against all criticism.

And he also said over T.V. that he signed because he

was  asked to show face to Tan Siew Sin. "Oh,  never

mind," he said. He sounded very apologetic over T.V.

Never  mind with the people's money? I remember  how

when he similarly gave a T.V. show in his address to

the  Singapore Harbour Board workers. He related the

story  of  how the Manager of the Singapore  Harbour

Board  consulted him about a certain worker, and  he

said - it  came very clearly over the radio and  T.V.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "Sack him. The Manager consulted me and I said,

`Sack  him'."  How very strong and  powerful.  "Sack

him," he said. But not with the people's money.  Not

with  the Tunku. He would not dare. The P.A.P. never

really  consider  the interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore.  He  does  not give any  thought  to  the

interests of the people of Singapore. If he had done

so,  he would not have signed away the rights of the

people  of  Singapore in this easy manner.  Just  to

give  face  to  this person or that person.  However

pretty  a face may be, I am sure it is not worth  so

many millions of dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister had also boasted at one stage that he was not the Sultan of Brunei. Of course, different meanings can be read into those words; it depends on whether it is meant to be derogatory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



or  otherwise. We have seen today that the Sultan of

Brunei at least has the guts to say No. He has shown

that  he  has more guts than our Prime Minister.  He

has  enough guts to stand up for his rights and  the

rights of Brunei, in spite of all the pressure  from

the  British.  Has Lee Kuan Yew similarly  withstood

the pressure from the British and the Federation? He

has not. Why has he not? The reasons are not far  to

seek. Lee Kuan Yew and company -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think Mr Lee Kuan Yew should

be  referred  to  in  this  Assembly  as  the  Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister and his

Ministers could not fight back and had not the  guts

to  fight back because they do not have the  support

of  the  people; and because they do  not  have  the

support of the people, they do not have the strength

of  the  support of the people behind them.  If  the

P.A.P. Ministers had, the result of the whole merger

negotiations would have been entirely different. The

British  and  the  Federation  negotiated   on   the

strength  of their guns and their jets.  The  P.A.P.

has  no  such  strength. It does not  even  have  an

audience for a P.A.P. mass rally, except when P.A.P.

Ministers use Government pressure on certain  people

and   when  the  Work  Brigade  boys  are  specially

directed  to  attend  these so-called  rallies.  The

photos in newspapers that show a crowd listening  to

the Prime Minister speaking are all taken at wayangs

and  variety shows where in between items and scenes

the Prime Minister comes out -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> To perform.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes. He comes out to perform.

That is the exact word. "Perform". He has a prepared

audience all ready for him. But now we see the Prime

Minister  begging  the Tunku for  the  combining  of

forces - that is one of the phrases I picked out from

the exchange of letters - to fight his phantom enemy,

the  Communist bogey. How can there be a combination

of  forces when the Prime Minister himself is not  a

force and he does not represent a force?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this point, let me say something about the

political force. A political force must represent  a

political movement that is really representative  of

the  people. It must be deeply rooted in at least  a

section of the people whose interests it represents.

It  must  be  able  to exercise influence  over  the

people,  lead them and mobilise them to  action,  so

that the political aims and ideals may be realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today superficially the P.A.P. appears to be a

"force".  It  is still the Government. Yes.  It  can

still  use  the Government machinery for  its  party

purposes.  Yes.  It  can  still  pass  laws  in  the

Assembly,  that is, so long as those laws correspond

with the interests of a section of the Opposition in

this  Assembly. It can still monopolise the  use  of

the  radio and television. Yes. And it can still nut

pressure  on the Singapore newspapers. Yes.  It  can

still   use   the  Police  Force  on  its  political

opponents. Yes. It can still make use of  the  civil

service to help the Party work. Yes. It can use  the

courts   to   prosecute   and  persecute   political

opponents. Yes. It can even bring up fictitious  and

frivolous  charges  of breach of  privilege  of  the

House  against political opponents. It can  pressure

people  into "welcoming" the Prime Minister. It  can

order  school students to line the streets.  It  can

intimidate  and bribe certain people into supporting

the  Government.  But all power and  strength  comes

from  the control over the State machinery, and  the

P.A.P. has  this power because of its control  over

the  State  machinery. Bu: iii  terms  of  the  real

meaning of a political force, i.e. whether or not it

represents the people, the P.A.P. is not a political

force.  The Prime Minister may bluster and  posture,

beat his chest, heat his drum, shout and talk tough,

but he and the P.A.P. Ministers themselves know that

the  P.A.P. is not a force. It does not  even  dare

hold  a  mass rally, as I have said. We could  count

the  number  of people who attended the P.A.P. mass

rallies during the referendum campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. came to power by posing itself as a left-wing Party representing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



the  interests of the workers of Singapore.  It  was

largely  due  to  the  support  of  the  workers  of

Singapore that the P.A.P. came to control the  State

machinery.  But  this posturing of P.A.P.  Ministers

was  soon  exposed  and  the P.A.P. has  completely

betrayed  the people who brought it into power.  But

so long as the system of one-man-one-Vote exists and

still operates, however inadequately, those who  put

the  P.A.P. into power can similarly take away  that

power from the P.A.P. political opportunists. It  is

just  a  question  of time. That is  why  the  Prime

Minister  condemned this one-man-one-vote system  in

his  talk  to  the  civil servants last  year.  That

system  still works however inadequately today,  and

it  will  become the undoing of the  P.A.P.  And  in

spite of the P.A.P. Ministers' love for power,  they

will  not  be able to prevent this power from  being

taken  away  from  them. Knowing  this,  the  P.A.P.

Ministers   have   nightly   been   sleeping    with

Machiavelli  to scheme out plans to keep  themselves

in  power.  Hence the undemocratic clause 29:  hence

the dishonest and undemocratic Referendum: hence the

amendments  to  the  Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections  Ordinance; hence the Singapore (Elections

to the Federal House of Representatives) Bill. Both

these Bills have now been defeated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite all the Prime Minister's blustering

about  going  back  to meet the people, the  P.A.P.

Ministers are still doing their best to cling on  to

power  for  as long as possible, because  they  know

that  the  moment  they lose control  of  the  State

machinery, they will not be able to use the power of

the  State  represented by the police,  troops,  the courts,  the  prisons; and this is  very  important,

Sir, the power of deprivation of citizenship and the

power  of  banishment.  When that  time  comes,  the

P.A.P. Ministers will sink into oblivion, buried  by

history  - according  to  the  words  of  the   Prime

Minister.  It will be the end of an era - again  the

words  of  the  Prime Minister - the  P.A.P. era  of

arrogance, bully, and Fascist dictatorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., as I have said, is not a political

force. The Ministers know it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



and   they   are  making  full  use   of   all   the

opportunities  to  travel  about  and  to  live   in

grandeur while the going is still good, so to speak.

The  moment general elections take place, the P.A.P.

Ministers will be habis. The Ministers will have  to

look  for new jobs, and the Back-benchers will  have

to  find new moorings. That will be the end  of  the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of real political strength, the

Alliance  is  today  stronger than  the  P.A.P.  The

Alliance    has    consistently   represented    the

reactionary   forces  in  Singapore   and   in   the

Federation,  whereas the P.A.P. Ministers  are  only

opportunists  who  came to power  on  the  Left-wing

support  of  the workers, and who for the  last  two

years  have  been clinging on to power on Right-wing

support.  You  will remember, Sir,  last  night  the

Prime  Minister  talked  very  glibly  of  the  four

forces;   naming   the   British   Government,   the

Federation Government, the Singapore Government, and

the  Communists as the four forces. I do  not  know,

Sir,  but I think he must have been talking  through

his hat because that is mere wishful thinking. There

are  only  two forces as far as we can see  in  this

country  or  anywhere. They are the  forces  of  the

colonialists and imperialists and the forces of  the

people,  not  the P.A.P. Today it is the reactionary

forces  which are making use of the P.A.P. and  not

the other way round. The P.A.P. thought of itself as

being  indispensable to the Left at one  time.  That

has been proved false. Similarly the P.A.P. wants to

tell  the British who are the real force behind  the

Malaysia scheme, that the P.A.P. is indispensable in

the  fight against the Communist bogey. But  however

much the British may want to protect the P.A.P. for

just a little while perhaps, we have already seen in

this  House  that the moment the reactionaries  have

done with the P.A.P. -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture (Mr Rajaratnam): To join

you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - they will leave the P.A.P. to

fend  for itself, and will be doing everything  they

can indirectly to bring the P.A.P. down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have repeatedly said that the P.A.P. Government

today  is  a Government only on sufferance.  Without

the  reactionary prop, the P.A.P. will  tumble  just

like  a house built with a pack of cards. The P.A.P.

has no solid foundation, no reinforced concrete,  no

piling in its foundations, and it is going to  fall,

and  will certainly fall, very soon. A matter of one

or  two  months maybe, and that is all the Ministers

can  hope for. The reactionary forces have made  use

of  the  P.A.P.  The Prime Minister  thinks  he  can

calculate  but he forgets all the time - to  use  his

own  words  - the electronic computer which  has  300

years  of  experience  of  colonial  domination  and

exploitation behind it. This electronic computer  is

all   the   time  directing  affairs   quietly   and

unobtrusively  behind the scenes,  manipulating  the

stooges  and the puppets without even letting  these

stooges  and  puppets realise that  they  have  been

manipulated. The electronic computer encourages  the

feeling  of  egoism and opportunism of  self-centred

politicians, so that they begin to have the illusion

that what they were made to do and what they were in

fact  directed  to do were creations of  their  own.

Thus  it  is  that  the Prime Minister  thinks  that

Malaysia  is  his own creation. There is  a  saying,

Sir,  that  those whom the gods would destroy,  they

first make mad.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It seems to me that the P.A.P.

Ministers  must  be completely mad with  nuts  loose

here  and  there beneath their skulls  for  them  to

harbour  such  illusions that  they  themselves  had

suggested  Malaysia. But the ridiculous position  of

the  P.A.P. today  is  this:  although  the  P.A.P.

Ministers  have done everything possible  to  please

the Federation, they are nevertheless not trusted by

the  Federation. The Federation prefers  to  entrust

its interests to their own friends in the S.P.A. at

one  time  and  the Alliance now in  Singapore.  And

however  much  the  P.A.P. may  try  to  split  the

Alliance, one component from another component,  the

M.C.A. from the U.M.N.O. by denigrating the  M.C.A.

and the ex-S.P.A. and praising to the skies the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



U.M.N.O. and especially the Tunku, Tun Razak and Dr

Ismail,  the P.A.P. will not be able to  succeed  in

gaining the favour of the Federation. If anything is

left behind after the big feast, the crumbs will  be

left  to  the P.A.P. Ministers. The P.A.P. Ministers

will  only be able to get the crumbs from the table,

but unfortunately for them even these crumbs may not

be  given to them, who are waiting around the  table

with  open  mouths, like dogs for  food  from  their

master.  The Federation knows the true character  of

the   P.A.P.  Ministers  because  opportunists   are

opportunists. If the P.A.P. opportunists can  betray

the  Left-wing movement and the workers who put them

into  power, so these same opportunists can one  day

similarly    betray   the   Right-wing    and    the

reactionaries  if  the  P.A.P.  Ministers  find   it

necessary to do so in order to cling to office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is in a dilemma because of its own

opportunism. On the one hand, it is rejected by  the

working  class movement of Singapore, and indeed  of

the whole Malaysia region. We saw how the P.A.P. was

expelled  by the Conference of Socialist Parties  in

January 1962 in Kuala Lumpur. On the other hand, the

P.A.P. is  not  trusted  by the  reactionaries  and

communal forces in the region although made  use  of

by  them. That is the tragedy of the P.A.P. It  does

not   represent  the  interests  of  any  particular

section  of  the  people.  Today,  the  P.A.P. may

accelerate  promotions, give  medals  to  the  civil

servants and praise them. But other than for a small

number,  the  P.A.P. will not be able to  get  their

support. The P.A.P. remains a force only because  of

its   temporary  - that  is  a  very  important  word

- temporary  - control  of the  State  machinery.  The

P.A.P. is legally in power, but it has already  been

morally  discredited  and rejected  by  the  people.

Their position is not unlike the position of the Lim

Yew Hock Government just before the 1959 elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, knowing the situation, the P.A.P.

Ministers  use  Machiavellian methods  and  hope  to

survive  in  an  unsettled  and  unstable  political

situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



and  they survive by their skill in brinkmanship  by

playing  one  political force against another.  But.

Sir, opportunistic politics cannot last. History  is

not created by the so-called genius or brilliance of

a  few leaders. Opportunist leaders do not represent

the  people. They are on the stage for a  while  and

they  disappear. Opportunists do not  represent  the

hopes  and aspirations of the people. From this,  we

can  understand why the P.A.P. is cracking  its  so-called  cleverness and brilliance to twist and  turn

and  to distort. But one falsehood after another  of

the P.A.P. has been exposed. Their citizenship bluff

was  exposed. They have to change the name  "Federal

National"  into  the  words  "Malaysian  Citizenship

(Singapore)".  It is becoming more  and  more  clear

today  to  the  people of Singapore  that  Malaysian

Citizenship   (Singapore)  is  not   the   same   as

Federation Citizenship. In fact, a Singapore citizen

not only gets second-class citizenship in the P.A.P.

merger  deal, but he also stands in grave danger  of

losing    his    original   Singapore    citizenship

altogether. This is one aspect of the great sell-out

of  the P.A.P. In the P.A.P. merger proposals we  do

not  have a common citizenship. I have amply  proved

this  last night. The Federation, Sabah and  Sarawak

citizens  are  in  one group. The Singapore  citizen

stands isolated in another group. Then where is  the

common  citizenship?  Where is the  national  unity?

But, of course, the P.A.P. Ministers are very clever

bluffers and they even bluffed the Member for Anson.

But  anyway,  we  can take heart  that  this  P.A.P.

bluffing will be gone forever very soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister says we share a common fate with the Federation. Yes. I think we will. But in the present context, only insofar as our fate will be tied to the fate of the Federation if the unjust merger is pushed through. But we shall not share a common political life. The citizenship provisions and the restrictions on the freedom of travel will

see  to  that. We shall share a common fate  in  the

respect  that  we  in Singapore will  not  be  in  a

position to decide our own future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are part of Afro-Asia. We stand for

neutrality and anti-colonialism



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



and anti-imperialism. But the Federation policy, for

example,  is  tied to the chariot wheel  of  Western

colonialism  and  imperialism. Yet  because  of  the

merger  and Malaysia, we become tied hand and  foot,

at  least temporarily, and we cannot decide our  own

future as regards foreign policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis are entirely

different  from the P.A.P. We stand on the  side  of

the  workers,  the  exploited and  down-trodden.  We

represent  their  interests. They are  part  of  the

force  that  will decide the future of  mankind.  We

have  not  misjudged  any  situation  as  the  Prime

Minister has said. The Prime Minister gives  himself

too  much  credit. This is of course because  he  is

arrogant  as usual and imagines himself to  be  more

clever,  more brilliant, than the rest  of  mankind.

We,  on  the  other hand, practise humility  and  we

recognise  our limitations. We recognise  also  that

forever  we  shall be students of politics.  We  are

learning  every day. But we also see  the  situation

very  clearly.  We see the future very  clearly.  We

know what is coming. We see the march of history. We

see history progressively going forward from slavery

to feudalism, from feudalism to capitalism, and from

capitalism  to  socialism. This is  inevitable.  The

Prime  Minister does not know how to  use  the  word

"inevitable", Sir. This is inevitable.  History  has

proved   it.   Malaysia  is  not  inevitable.   That

Malaysia's  "inevitability" is all  propaganda.  The

P.A.P. says  this  to take away the  will  and  the

fighting  spirit of the people. The P.A.P. hopes  to

use this word "inevitable" to take away the fighting

strength  and resistance of the people against  neo-colonialist  Malaysia.  But Malaysia's  downfall  is

inevitable;  just  as the fall  of  colonialism  and

imperialism  is inevitable; just as the  triumph  of

socialism is inevitable; and just as the realisation

of  the  hopes  and  aspirations of  the  people  is

inevitable:  just as the victory of the people  over

all  reactionary forces represented in a  small  way

today in Singapore by the P.A.P. is inevitable. That

is  the meaning of the word "inevitable". The P.A.P.

has been using the word wrongly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. talks of chopping off of heads. But

history is not decided by the chopping off of heads.

Millions  of people have sacrificed their  lives  in

the past and millions of people will sacrifice their

lives  in  the future. But history marches  forward.

The  march may be slower at times and may be  faster

at  times. But history marches forward and advances,

and  no  force on earth, much less the  puny  little

P.A.P. infantile opportunistic force, can stop  such

advance. Today, the national liberation movement  is

steadily advancing and growing in strength the world

over.  We  have seen heads chopped off  and  put  on

spike  poles in Angola. When I was in London, I  saw

special  pictures of how the Portuguese colonialists

and  imperialists have chopped off the heads of  the

freedom  fighters in order to frighten  the  people.

But  today in Angola the lighting is still going on,

and  more  and  more  of the people  in  Africa  are

backing  the people in Angola helping them to  drive

out  the Portuguese imperialists. Chopping off heads

will   not   stop   history.  We  have   seen   more

unbelievable atrocities in other colonial countries,

but  history advances and socialism must  inevitably

triumph.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, therefore, not misjudged the situation. It

is  opportunists  like the Prime  Minister  and  his

other  Ministers who have misjudged  the  situation,

because  they  falsely  imagine  that  a  couple  of

individuals can thwart the march of history. We have

absolute confidence in the future, and we know  that

we  will win, whatever the P.A.P. may try to do. The

future   lies  with  the  people.  Let  the   P.A.P.

Ministers themselves not misjudge the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the predicament the P.A.P. is in, we

also understand why the P.A.P. acts in the manner it

does.  As  I have said, the P.A.P. has not the  mass

support.  It  knows it has sold the  rights  of  the

people  of  Singapore. But for its own survival,  it

needs  to cover the sell-out somehow, with  hope  of

gaining the support of the people. Hence the frantic

preparation  of the P.A.P. propaganda  machinery  to

give  the  traitor a hero's welcome and to build  up

the Prime Minister as a fighter for the interests of

the people. But this farce is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



now completely exposed. All Singapore knows that the

P.A.P. is going down as a result of the sell-out.  I

will not speak very much longer, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today Malaysia exerts an oppressive shadow over the

whole  of  South-East  Asia.  Pro-Malaysia  salesmen

shout  deceptive  slogans of prosperity,  happiness,

national unity, independence, stability and national

security  through Malaysia. But we  have  seen  very

clearly  before our eyes that instead of  prosperity

we  have promises of extra burdens and extra  taxes.

We  have  to  give thousands of millions of  dollars

away.  The Johore Causeway will remain a barrier  to

freedom  of  travel and also to trade,  if,  at  any

time,  the  Federation decides  to  levy  production

taxes   and  extra  duties  on  goods  produced   in

Singapore. Instead of happiness, there is repression

and  widespread bitterness and sorrow over the land.

No  greater  issue divides the people  of  our  land

today  than  the  issue  of  Malaysia.  Instead   of

national  unity,  there  is now  national  disunity.

Instead  of  independence  we  get  neo-colonialism.

Instead of stability and national security, there is

strife  and  tension, and today's summit meeting  in

Manila  will  decide whether or not  there  will  be

further  threats  to  peace in South-East  Asia.  At

present Malaysia can be born only on the support  of

British  might.  But  without  the  support  of  the

people, such military imposition on the people  will

not  make  Malaysia work. Malaysia  cannot  succeed,

therefore. Like the West Indies Federation  and  the

Central African Federation, Malaysia must inevitably

fail.  Pro-Malaysia  salesmen hope  to  make  people

believe  that Malaysia is formed to fight Communism.

They  say  that only the Communists oppose Malaysia.

This  is,  of  course, the pet excuse  used  by  the

colonialists and their stooges for every  aggressive

action  of  theirs  against staunch anti-colonialist

political  opponents. And to justify  their  Fascist

and  repressive  actions against  those  who  oppose

Malaysia, and especially those of us in the  Barisan

Sosialis, the British colonialists and their  P.A.P.

stooges  have  invoked  the  Communist  bogey.   But

curiously enough,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



those  who  oppose Malaysia most fiercely  and  have

even resorted to armed struggle against Malaysia are

the  Malays  in Brunei. And no one has  ever  called

them  Communists. From this alone, we  can  see  how

ridiculous and absurd the P.A.P. charges  are.  But,

of  course,  the  P.A.P. Ministers  are  experts  at

telling  falsehoods. I remember Senator Tan  of  the

Federation  saying this of the Prime Minister:  that

"he  is  capable of saying anything as  long  as  it

serves  his  purpose. Nothing is too low  for  him,"

i.e. our Prime Minister. However, to come back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is a neo-colonialist plot designed to

protect  British military, political,  and  economic

interests  in  the  region. It is also  designed  to

frustrate  the hopes and aspirations of  the  people

for  self-determination, democracy, and freedom.  It

does  not  represent the spontaneous desire  of  the

people  in  the region for a union.  It  is  a  plan

imposed  from  above on the people and  intended  to

make  the whole of South-East Asia a strategic  bloc

in  the  service of Western colonial domination  and

exploitation. Malaysia is only the political  aspect

of the British Far East Unified Command which covers

exactly the same area of Malaysia. In fact, Malaysia

will  only  be an extension of the working  room  of

SEATO.  Malaysia, therefore, in fact, is a  part  of

the  SEATO  bloc. In this connection,  Sir,  I  must

refer  you  to Article VI of the Malaysia Agreement,

page 2 of Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963. This Article is the

essence of Malaysia. Let me read it out, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Agreement on External Defence and Mutual

Assistance  between  the Government  of  the  United

Kingdom  and  the  Government of the  Federation  of

Malaya on 12th October, 1957, and its annexes  shall

apply  to  all  territories  of  Malaysia,  and  any

reference  in  that Agreement to the  Federation  of

Malaya shall be deemed to apply to Malaysia, subject

to  the proviso that the Government of Malaysia will

afford  to the Government of the United Kingdom  the

right  to  continue to maintain the bases and  other

facilities  at  present occupied  by  their  Service

authorities within the State of Singapore  and  will

permit the Government of the United Kingdom to  make

such  use  of  these  bases and facilities  as  that

Government may consider necessary for the purpose of

assisting  in  the  defence  of  Malaysia,  and  for

Commonwealth  defence and for  the  preservation  of

peace  in  South-East Asia. The application  of  the

said Agreement shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



be  subject  to the provisions of Annex  F  to  this

Agreement  (relating primarily to Service  lands  in

Singapore).'



<br><br>Sir,  this is the essence of the Malaysia Agreement.

If  this Article VI was not in this Agreement, there

would be no Malaysia. That is important. And for the

Prime  Minister  to say that he does  not  know  the

meaning  of "neo-colonialism", I would suggest  that

he  go  back to school and learn politics  all  over

again.  This Agreement was signed in London  on  the

9th July, and this Article extends the Anglo-Malayan

Defence  Treaty  to  the whole Malaysia  region.  It

gives the U.K. Government the right -mind you,  Sir,

the  right  to imperialists thousands of miles  away

- to  maintain bases and other facilities in the five

territories for so-called U.K. defence for which the

British  Far  East  Unified  Command  was  specially

created. If we want to understand Malaysia, Sir,  we

must   look  at  it  from  this  perspective.   Then

immediately  we can understand why all  the  neutral

countries in Afro-Asia are opposed to Malaysia.  And

we  will  immediately understand  why  Indonesia  is

opposed  to  Malaysia. We will also  understand  why

Britain,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  Japan,  Canada,

Italy,  France,  and, of course, the United  States,

support Malaysia. Then we understand everything. All

the  pieces in the jig-saw puzzle fit into place and

the  whole  picture is presented right  before  you.

However, within the proposed Malaysia region itself,

opposition to Malaysia has already resulted  in  the

Brunei  uprising  and  guerilla  warfare  over   all

Borneo.  The Government of the Federation will  have

to  expand very greatly their armed forces, and that

is  why  Singapore will have to pay so much annually

to   the  Federation.  That  is  why  Singapore   is

compelled  to loan - a very nice word euphemistically

- to  "loan"  $150 million to the Federation  not  so

much  for  the development of the Borneo territories

as  for  the expansion of defence - I think it should

be  offence - capital expenditure. It should  not  be

defence,  in  fact. For their own selfish  interests

today, the P.A.P. Ministers have signed the Malaysia

Agreement  which  seeks to push Singapore  into  the

Federation bound hand and foot. We have opposed this

all along but the P.A.P. claims that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



it  has a mandate from the people. The P.A.P. claims

that the White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 has been passed

in  this  Assembly,  and  that  it  has  later  been

endorsed  by  the people in the sham referendum.  Of

course, this is not really true. The P.A.P. has  the

so-called mandate only by the most undemocratic  and

dishonest  means. But even if what  the  P.A.P. has

claimed  was true, that claim cannot hold  true  any

longer  today.  The  P.A.P. has legal  authority  to

negotiate  on  behalf of Singapore only  within  the

limits  clearly  defined in  the  White  Paper.  Any

variation  and any departure from this  White  Paper

and  from  the explanations and assurances given  by

the  P.A.P. Ministers therefore cannot be valid.  It

becomes ultra vires in many ways of speaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already pointed out the many variations and

departures  from  Cmd. Paper  33  of  1961  in  this

Malaysia  Agreement. The P.A.P. has no  moral  right

and  even legal right to vary and depart so very far

from  the  White  Paper.  Any  wide  variation   and

departure    especially   involving   totally    new

principles  must  first have  a  mandate  from  this

House.  We  had  a  debate on the  progress  of  the

financial  talks  last month following  a  statement

from the Prime Minister. But the P.A.P. did not have

a  mandate  from this House to vary and depart  from

the White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961. Now since there are

wide  variations and departures from the White Paper

and since the P.A.P. did not have a mandate from the

House  to  vary  and depart from  the  White  Paper,

therefore, it must be condemned for signing such  an

Agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these variations and departures had been

advantageous  to the people of Singapore,  it  would

have  been  easier  to  accept such  variations  and

departures. But these variations and departures  are

completely  to  the disadvantage of  the  people  of

Singapore. In fact, more and more of our powers have

been  taken  away  and  all the  provisions  in  the

proposed Constitution merely seek to further enslave

the  people  of  Singapore. All the safeguards,  for

example,  for the protection of citizenship acquired

by the people not born in Singapore are now gone and

Singapore citizens can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



lose their own original Singapore citizenship if  at

any time the Federation politicians decide to cancel

the   so-called   automatic  Malaysian   citizenship

(Singapore).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then emergency powers are given to the Federation

to   impose   wartime  emergency   regulations   and

restrictions on Singapore even when all is peace and

quiet   and  when  there  is  no  war,  no  external

aggression and no internal disturbance in Singapore.

Then the people of Singapore have been squeezed  and

soaked.  Singapore has to pay more than $150 million

annually  to the Federation in order that  Singapore

may  serve  the Federation. A $150 million  loan  is

given   almost  completely  interest  free  to   the

Federation,  and  more  likely  than  not  the  $150

million  will also be gone with the wind. In return,

Singapore  has  obtained a common  market  in  which

almost  all  the  advantages are on  the  Federation

side.   Singapore  industries  will  not  have   the

protection  and safeguards for expansion.  In  fact,

the  common  market in which the Prime Minister  has

such  great  faith  will not encourage  and  promote

local   industries.   It  will   merely   facilitate

exploitation of Singapore by foreign capital through

the benefits of pioneer status, the exploitation  of

comparatively cheap local labour, and the escape  of

heavy taxes in the countries of the foreign monopoly

capitalists. This is the neo-colonialism  which  the

P.A.P. does not seem able to understand. But what is

worse,  the  free port status of Singapore  will  be

almost  completely lost in 12 years from  now.  This

can  only mean loss of trade, especially the tourist

trade,  with increased cost of living for the people

and  even  loss of employment for the thousands  now

gainfully employed. The exchange of letters  between

the   Singapore   Government  and   the   Federation

Government  and  the  Singapore Government  and  the

British  Government contained in  Misc.  5  of  1963

clearly  states the position. The P.A.P.  Government

cannot  bluff  the people that its own  claims  have

become part of the agreement when they in fact  have

not been agreed to by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



Federation and the British Governments. The Malaysia

Agreement  is  therefore completely unacceptable  to

this  House and to the people of Singapore. En fact,

the  whole Agreement is a sell-out of all the rights

and  interests  of  the  people  of  Singapore.  The

Agreement must therefore be repudiated and torn up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constitutional future of Singapore affects each

and  every  one of us in the country. The people  of

the  country must have their basic rights  of  self-determination  to  decide their  own  constitutional

future.  The 31st of August, 1963, is the date  that

has  been  set aside by the powers-that-be  for  the

incorporation   of  Singapore  into   the   proposed

Malaysia.  The  P.A.P. conducted a  sham  referendum

which  did not, and could not, reflect the will  and

desire of the people freely expressed. The people of

Singapore must therefore be given the opportunity to

truly  and  genuinely  decide on  their  own  future

before  the  date  set down for the inauguration  of

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government has been defeated on three

occasions in the past few days and the Leader of the

House has already solemnly said that there will soon

he  a  general election. It is clear that the P.A.P.

cannot  conduct a fair and democratic election.  The

sham  referendum is proof of that. The recent defeat

of both the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections

(Temporary  Provisions)  (Amendment)  Bill  and  the

Singapore  (Elections  to  the  Federal   House   of

Representatives)  Bill  further   prove   that   all

Opposition  Parties  cannot  trust  the  P.A.P. to

conduct  a fair election. The general election  must

therefore  be conducted and supervised by a  neutral

body.  We  suggest that such a neutral body  be  the

United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a precondition to the general election, of

course,    all   political   detainees    must    be

unconditionally   released   and    all    political

activities in Singapore normalised. The basic rights

and  freedoms of speech and publication, association

and  assembly must be restored. Once the people have

elected  their  new  representatives,  these   newly

elected representatives of the people can then  hold

fresh constitutional talks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



with  the United Kingdom Government. That,  Sir,  is

the way to allow the people of Singapore a chance to

decide on their own future. We ask the House to  let

the people decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few last words before I close. We want to warn

the  P.A.P., the Alliance and the British  that  the

arrests on 2nd February cannot and will not help the

reactionaries  and  the  colonialists.  As  I   have

already   pointed  out,  history  advances,  history

marches forward. No force can prevent or block  this

march  forward  of history. Arrests now  or  at  any

future  time  will not be able to  help  the  P.A.P.

Government  to cling to office any longer.  Many  of

the  Assemblymen  of the Barisan  Sosialis  will  be

prosecuted in the court by the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There can be no reference to

that case in this Assembly. It is sub judice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no intention of referring

to the actual court -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There can be no mention of the

case.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Whatever it be, the P.A.P. must

realise  that  they  are now a  Government  only  on

sufference.  They must not usurp the  power  of  the

people.  The  power must be returned to the  people,

and  the  people must decide their own  future.  The

people's  future cannot be left to a few individuals

although   they  may  think  that  they  are   super

brilliant  people.  At  any stage  of  history,  the

people  must  decide. Let the P.A.P.  Ministers  and

also P.A.P. Back-Benchers remember this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move my amendment* appearing on the

Order Paper.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was as appears

in  item  2  of  the  Order Paper.  Since  which  an

amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* to leave out from "1961)" in line 4 to the end

and insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"this House noting that the agreement made between

the  People's Action Party Government, the  United

Kingdom  Government and the Federation  of  Malaya

Government  in  London on 9th July,  1963,  is  at

variance with Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) condemns the Government for signing such an

agreement;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) demands that the Government immediately

repudiate the said agreement; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) urges that a general election be held fairly

conducted under the supervision of the  United

Nations  in  order that the people  may  elect

their    new    representatives   for    fresh

constitutional  talks with the United  Kingdom

Government.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members do know, there is going to be a

guillotine  on this motion and I propose  to  permit

the  leading speakers of the Opposition sections  to

speak  first - a speaker from the Alliance, a speaker

from  the  U.P.P. and the independent  Members,  and

thereafter  the  Government side will  be  given  an

opportunity of replying.



<br><br>4.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

listening to the Member for Queenstown, he took  the

Floor  yesterday at 5.30 p.m. and maintained  it  up

till midnight, which is, excluding the dinner break,

I  think  5� hours. And this afternoon from 2.30  to 4.15  p.m., which is a little under two hours, which

makes it 7� hours -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The arithmetic from this side

is 6� hours.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged for the

arithmetic - 6� hours. I think he has fallen short of

his past performance, which I think exceeded that by

one  hour.  But anyway, listening to the Member  for

Queenstown  -  and  I  have  listened  to  him  very

carefully  when  I have been in the Chamber  - I  was

reminded  of  the  statement  the  Hon, the   Prime

Minister  made just before he set off to London  for

the constitutional talks. I hope I am not misquoting

him,  but if I remember correctly, he said, "I shall

out-talk them; I shall out-squat them." Now, I think

the  Member for Queenstown has out-talked the  Prime

Minister  in  the length of time spoken.  Does  that

make  the Member for Queenstown the victor? I hardly

think so, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming back to the motion before the House.

Before I deal with the merits of the motion, I  wish

to make one matter very clear indeed to the House as

a  whole, Mr Speaker, Sir, more particularly to the

Government  as  the Government seem to  be  in  some

danger of getting their own party interests mixed up

with  what, in my view, are national interests. Sir,

my  Party,  the  Alliance,  and  I  personally  have

wholeheartedly been behind the People's Action Party

in   the  matter  of  Malaysia.  We  have  been   so

wholeheartedly behind the Government in this - and  I

recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I appeared on  the

same platform as the Prime Minister did, much to the

disgust  of  some  Members of my own  Party.  I  was

almost on the mat for it. It was by the skin  of  my

teeth  that I escaped censure proceedings. I escaped

it  on the basis that this was a national matter. We

from  the  Alliance and the P.A.P. spoke  the  same

language  in terms of effect, the words  might  have

been different. But in terms of effect, we spoke the

same  language. There was no divergence of views  on

this. Therefore, I really cannot understand why  the

P.A.P. Government, after Malaysia has almost  been

reached,  agreements concluded and  we  are  on  the

verge  of Malaysia, should accuse the Alliance Party

now of being against Malaysia. Surely, no one in his

right  senses  in  Singapore, no one  in  his  right

senses in the Federation, no one in his right senses

in the three Bornean territories can ever think that

we in the Alliance can ever be against Malaysia. Are

the  P.A.P. Government out of their senses?  Or  are

they trying to make political capital out of this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give full credit to the Prime Minister for having

brought  the  ship of Malaysia safely through.  Full

credit,  100  marks - I said it then, I  say  it  now

openly,  and  I will continue to say it  even  after

Malaysia. We in the Alliance provided him the  elbow

room   during   the  referendum  time   to   perform

adequately.  The stage was set, the  Prime  Minister

was on the stage. We left it uncluttered for him  in

order to give him plenty of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



elbow   room,   and  I  think  the  Prime   Minister

understands what I mean when I say we gave him elbow

room. If we had been harassing him on the stage,  if

we  had  been elbowing him from the stage, we  would

not  have got the 70 per cent votes that we  did  in

fact  get  in  Singapore. So never  let  the  P.A.P.

Government  forget that Malaysia  was  not  a  party

affair.  It  was  a joint affair by  the  people  of

Singapore  who  believed in Malaysia.  No  political

statement by the P.A.P. Government at this  juncture

on  the threshold of merger saying that the Alliance

is  against Malaysia will help them out. I am  sorry

that the P.A.P. Government should at this late stage

try,  because  of  certain actions which  they  have

taken,  which I propose to explain to the House,  to

suggest that we are against Malaysia or merger -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is not true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Of course, it is true. The radio has

said so; T.V. has said so; the papers are saying so.

T.V., the radio, the papers belong to the Government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not the papers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> They do, Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to

say. If you turn on the news at any time during  the

night  or  morning,  you will hear  that  the  Prime

Minister said this and the Prime Minister said that,

but  why  did  be say that? It was because  somebody

made  a  speech to which the Prime Minister replied.

But does the radio report the speech which motivated

the Prime Minister into making his reply? No. It  is

forgotten;  that is not reported. But the  whole  of

the speech of the Prime Minister is given. The other

side of the story is not given at all. The means  of

propaganda is at the disposal of the Government and,

therefore, it appears that they are going to use  it

to  hammer  all the other political Parties  out  of

existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what induces the P.A.P. Government to say that we are against Malaysia? What is it? Because last Thursday, when the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance were away, and I think since we are in a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



truthful  mood,  we might as well say  straight  now

that without the Prime Minister and the Minister for

Finance,  the P.A.P. Front Bench is quite  pathetic,

Mr Speaker, Sir. They really cannot think properly.

They cannot react at all. Because the Prime Minister

and  his  able aide, the Minister for Finance,  were

not  here,  they got into a complete and utter  mess

over the Federal Elections Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anybody is responsible for this present impasse,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, over the election of seats to the

Federal   Parliament,  then   it   is   the   P.A.P.

Government. What did we object to in that Bill,  Mr

Speaker?  Two  points of objection were  taken.  The

first point was procedural; the second point was one

of  substance.  The procedural point  was  that  the

presentation  of  the Bill to the House  was  wrong,

that  it should have come after this debate.  To  my

mind,  that was a valid point. The second point  was

that  the  P.A.P. Government was going to  draw  the

wards  in  the way they could, the way they  wanted.

Naturally, do you think we are going to allow  that?

We  are  political Parties. We want political  power

just  as  much as they do. We are not babes  in  the

political  wood.  We  know  that  if  we  give   the

Government  the power to delineate the  wards,  they

could  draw them in such a way that they  would  get

almost  all  the  15 seats. It is simple.  Let  them

allow me to draw the wards, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  I

will  draw them in such a way that the Alliance will

get  the  greatest number of seats. Give it  to  the

Barisan,  they  will  do it likewise.  Give  to  the

Member  for  Hong Lim, and he will do  it  likewise.

Each of four groups can draw the wards in such a way

that  each  group can get a majority of  seats.  The

fair  thing to do is to put the drawing of the wards

in  an  impartial  body. The Deputy  Prime  Minister

recognised  this in his statement to the  House.  He

said, "Yes, on second thoughts I now realise that 5-4  is  not fair; make it 4-4," showing that at  last

the light was beginning to dawn. The Member for Hong

Lim asked, what about the Chairman? The Chairman  is

important. If the P.A.P. Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



had  asked  for  or  if  they had  listened  to  our

suggestions, we might have suggested to them to  get

an  independent Chairman from the Federal  Elections

Commission in Kuala Lumpur. Let him preside, and  if

there is an equality of votes on any issue, give him

a  single casting vote. We would be happy. The  ball

is now at the Government feet. They can kick it into

the  Federal  Elections Bill goal  or  not  as  they

please.  So  let  them not blame  the  Alliance  for

making   it  not  possible  for  Singapore   to   be

represented in the Federal Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might I say this to the Government? Let them draw

these  election boundaries in a fair and  reasonable

manner. Mr Speaker, Sir, you know this business  of

introducing Bills, making amendments here, there and

everywhere piecemeal and getting the Assembly into a

state of non-understanding - that is the phrase I  am

thinking of. Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember the

Singapore  (Elections  to  the  Federal   House   of

Representatives)  Bill which has now  been  stymied,

but which still remains on the statute book with the

option  to  the  Government to reintroduce  it  with

suitable amendments if they want to. So let not  the

blame lie with the Opposition any more. I hope  that

responsible organs which are allowed in the Assembly

in order that what is said in this Assembly might be

carried  out to the public at large do their  public

duty.  Instead  of suppressing it, omitting  it  and

saying  "Oh,  we forgot. We did not think  that  was

important," I am suggesting, Mr Speaker, Sir,  this

is  absolutely vital. Let nobody misunderstand this.

You  will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in  this

Bill,  there is no provision as to how the electoral

boundaries would have been drawn - a serious omission

by the drafting side of the State Advocate-General's

Department.   They  bring  in  amendments   to   the

Schedule.  They set out the Schedule, then  set  out

the  amendments that they are going to make  to  the

Ordinance.  On the First Reading all the  amendments

were  not in. On the Second Reading, amendments were

brought in very cleverly to section 8 of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



the   Singapore   Legislative   Assembly   Elections

Ordinance. Now, section 8 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may from time to time by notification

in  the Gazette specify the names and boundaries  of

the  electoral divisions of the island for  purposes

of election under this Ordinance.'



<br><br>Originally,  Mr Speaker, Sir, when  this  Ordinance

was  passed, the phrase was "the Governor  may  from

time to time". You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that elections were first introduced in Singapore in

the  colonial days when power was with the  Governor

with  his  Legislative Council. Parties there  were.

But  the deciding factor, the person who decided the

electoral boundaries, was the Governor. In so far as

Parties   were  concerned,  the  Governor  was   not

interested. So he played cricket, not golf.  He  did

not  hook the hail. He played cricket. And he played

it  fair according to certain recognised principles.

There  are  certain recognised principles  when  one

draws  electoral boundaries. I know them. I  sat  on

one of them. Mr Thomson was the Chairman. They know

Mr Thomson. They trust him. I also trust him. He is

a  perfect gentleman. The first thing we did on that

Committee  was to agree on the principles  on  which

the divisions should be made. All the Parties agreed

that  there  should be certain principles applicable

in the matter of delineation of wards. Having agreed

on  those principles, each of us put our suggestions

based on those principles. That is how we did it. In

course of time, complete self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the word "Governor" has been changed to

"Minister".  The Minister does not play cricket.  He

does  not  play any game at all. But  he  plays  the

party  game.  So what is the Minister going  to  do?

"The  Minister may from time to time by notification

in  the Gazette specify the names and boundaries  of

the  electoral divisions of the Island for  purposes

of   elections  to  the  Federal  Parliament."   Mr

Speaker, Sir, he is not in this to do us justice  as

we  think it should be done. I would not blame  him,

if  he  drew it the way he wanted to; of  course,  I

would not. If we were fools enough to give him  that

statutory power,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



why  should  he  not use it? Surely,  the  Hon, the

Finance Minister would do it. The thing is we caught

you out. We were sufficiently -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Farrer Park in

his  excitement is forgetting that he should address

the  Chair.  I think he has made his point,  and  be

should not labour too much on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am sorry. The point k that we want to

make  our position quite clear, because the position

we  are  going to take today - I hope the  Government

are  not going to use their mass media of propaganda

to distort the stand we are going to take - is what we

think is in the best interests of Singapore, in  our

view.  They  might not agree. The Member  for  Anson

might  not agree. The Barisan might not agree.  But,

in  our  view,  the stand we are going  to  take  is

completely fair and completely just now,  today  and

tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What is it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It will come in good time. Sir, when

this Assembly debated the White Paper we were behind

the  Government. We voted with them. And  the  White

Paper after the resolution of the Assembly was their

mandate  for Malaysia. Anything outside that mandate

was  not within the competence of the Hon, the Prime

Minister and his able Finance Minister to talk about

in  London.  Even if they did talk  about  it,  they

should  have come back to us for approval  and  then

had  them  embodied in the Constitution.  The  whole

presentation  of  these papers in  the  debate,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I must say, has been pathetic.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Absolutely pathetic. This is a serious

debate  in which the future of the country is  being

considered and the decision taken here will  tie  it

up with the rest of our national life and beyond it.

Yet  the way in which the vital documents have  been

presented to this Assembly is absolutely pathetic. I

might  say,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that  the  procedure

adopted for the presentation of these papers in  the

Assembly, I think, has been determined by this - that

they did not want us to read the documents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Documents after documents came to us on

the last day, Mr Speaker, and amendments on top  of

amendments. Imagine our predicament. There are  some

more  to  come, I am told. The whole story  has  not

been  told  yet. And we are asked to  consider  this

rationally and give a fair and reasonable  appraisal

of  the  situation in such a manner that we can  all

come to some reasonable conclusion on this. What  is

this  game  the  Government are  playing?  Are  they

pushing  us into something which they think  we  are

going to go in without our knowledge? I think I have

spotted  some  defects. But I do not  claim  I  have

spotted  them  all. Maybe the Member for  Anson  may

have spotted some which I have not. I hope tile rest

will bring up these things before the House. But  as

I  see  the  Government's motion,  there  are  three

aspects to the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first aspect is the White Paper. The second

aspect  is  the loan agreement. The third aspect  is

the  common market. And there is a fourth aspect  to

it,  which  is  neither  here  nor  there,  and  the

Government  had hoped that we would not see  it.  We

have  seen  some  of it - some of us who  have  spent

sleepless nights, and I am quite groggy on my  feet.

But  we  have  seen some of it. But whether  we  are

sufficiently  compos mentis to make  our  points  as

logically  and  as coherently as we might  otherwise

have done is a matter for history to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the White Paper, as I have indicated, the

Government   has   a  complete  mandate   from   the

Legislative Assembly. I congratulate the  Government

on carrying it through very efficiently. On the loan

agreement,  there  was  no mandate.  On  the  common

market  there was no mandate. But I will not pretend

that I was not unaware of what Government was doing.

I  will not pretend. I approve of some of the things

which  they said and did. I think some of the things

which  they  finally did are wrong. But  it  may  be

purely  a  matter of personal opinion. They  may  be

right,  but  my  personal opinion is that  the  loan

agreement  was  wrong. That is my personal  opinion.

The Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



said  that the ten years that are to come from today

are  the vital years for Singapore. He is right.  If

we  survive the next five to ten years, we will have

turned the corner into an era of stability. But  the

first ten years is an unstable period, and the  boat

is  likely  to rock any minute. Somebody could  rock

it.  And, therefore, the State must be in a position

to  maintain  the  boat  on an  even  keel.  My  own

personal  view  is, give an outright  grant  of  $25

million maybe, but do not permit $150 million of the

taxpayers'  money  to  go  out  in  loans.  We   are

committing the money over a period of 10 years to 15

years.  I am not grudging the loan, because  I  know

that  any  money lent to Borneo, any  benefit  which

they  get,  Singapore  must  inevitably  benefit.  I

surely appreciate that. But while benefiting others,

I  think we should benefit ourselves first. I really

believe that if the $100 million or the $125 million

of   that  money  which  is  being  loaned  to   the

Federation  for  Borneo had been kept  with  us,  it

could  have  been utilised for social  services.  It

could have been utilised for a number of good things

which  the people in Singapore should have. And  the

more  they  have, the less liable  they  are  to  be

agitated  by the friends of the Prime Minister  whom

he  calls  the manipulators of the Barisan Sosialis.

That is the only point, Mr Speaker. I do not grudge

Borneo   the   money.  Good  luck  to  them.   Their

prosperity must inevitably be ours. The Federation's

prosperity  must inevitably be ours,  and  we  would

like to be in between two areas of prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not competent to speak on the common market. The Prime Minister has said that his able Finance Minister will explain the whole position to the House. He has not yet done so. No doubt when he does so, there will be other Members on my side of the House who will deal with the

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to deal particularly with the constitutional

aspect  of  the  merger agreement and the  documents

that have now been put before us. You will remember,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I said that there was  a  fourth

aspect to these documents. There were deletions here

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



there, amendments here and there; and everything was

crowded  on  to us within 24 hours, perhaps  in  the

hope  and  expectation  that  we  might  not  notice

material changes. But I propose to bring up some  of

the matters I have noticed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I wish to deal with is Article 69.

If I may refer to Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963, Article 69,

page  47. This is a matter which deals with  a  Bill

intituled  "An Act for Malaysia", and this  will  be

passed by the Federal Parliament. Article 69 of that

Bill  affects  Singapore. With your permission,  Mr

Speaker,  might  I  read it - at least  the  relevant

portions of it? Article 69:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) No amendment shall be made to the Constitution

without the concurrence of the Governor [the Goveror

here is the Yang di-Pertuan Negara] if the amendment

is   such  as  to  affect  the  operation   of   the

Constitution in relation to Singapore as regards any

of the following matters -'



<br><br>Now, constitutionally, in my mind, it means this: No

amendment shall be made to the Constitution  without

the  concurrence of the Government of  Singapore  if

the amendment is such as to affect the operation  of

the Constitution in relation to Singapore as regards

any of the following matters:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) citizenship of Singapore...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the constitution and jurisdiction of the High

Court in Singapore and the appointment, removal and

suspension of judges of that court;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the matters with respect to which the

Legislature  of  the  State  may  make  laws,   the

executive authority of the State in those  matters,

the borrowing powers of the State and the financial

arrangements between the Federation and the State;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the discharge of functions of the Public

Services  Commission or of the Judicial  and  Legal

Service Commission by a branch established for  the

State, and the constitution of any such branch;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) religion in the State [which the Prime

Minister  touched on yesterday],  the  use  in  the

State  or  in  Parliament of any language  and  the

special position of the Malays in Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) the allocation to the State, in any

Parliament  summoned  to meet  before  the  end  of

August, 1970, of a quota of members of the House of

Representatives  not  less, in  proportion  to  the

total allocated to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



the   other  States  which  are  members  of  the

Federation   on  Malaysia  Day,  than   the   quota

allocated to the State on that day.'.



<br><br>In  juxtaposition to that Article, Sir, may I  refer

you  to  page 161 of the same Command Paper - Article

90  of  our Constitution, because they both tie  up.

Article 69 is the Federal angle; let us now get  the

Singapore angle. Article 90 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Subject to the provisions of the Federal

Constitution and to the following provisions of this

Article, the provisions of this Constitution may  be

amended by a law enacted by the Legislature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A Bill for making an amendment to this

Constitution (other than an amendment excepted  from

the  provisions of this clause) shall not be  passed

by  the  Legislative  Assembly unless  it  has  been

supported on Second and Third Readings by the  votes

of  not less than two-thirds of the total number  of

members thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The following amendments are excepted from the

provisions of clause (2)  of this Article, that is to

say -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any amendment consequential on such a

law  as  is  mentioned in Article  23  of  this

Constitution;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any amendment the effect of which is to

bring  the  Constitution  of  the  State   into

accord  with  any  of the essential  provisions

contained  in  the  Eighth  Schedule   to   the

Federal Constitution.'.



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, you will notice that by virtue  of the  provisions of Article 90, any Second and  Third Readings on matters affecting the Constitution  must be by votes of not less than two-thirds of the total number  of members of the Legislature. Correct.  Now may I read Article 90 (1)  again?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of the Federal

Constitution and to the following provisions of this

Article, ..'.



<br><br>The operative words in this Article, to my mind, Mr

Speaker, Sir, are "Subject to the provisions of  the

Federal  Constitution".  Let  us  get  back  to  the

Federal   Constitution.  What   does   the   Federal

Constitution say? It says this - I am paraphrasing it

- there  is  a procedure prescribed for amendment  in

the  Federal Parliament. It must not be less than  a

certain  number  of votes, as we  will  have  it  in

Singapore.  So  the  amendments are  passed  in  the

Federal Parliament according to the minimum number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



of  votes required, affecting our Constitution.  The

Federal  Parliament  passes it by  two-thirds;  they

have  the  decency  to do that. But  what  does  our

Government  do? What does our Prime Minister  commit

us  to  by  the  back-door  method?  He  says,  "The

Government  will  agree to it; the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  will agree to it; the Cabinet will agree  to

it."



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I may be wrong, Mr Speaker, Sir, but I

would  be  happier  if  Article  69  (1)   read,  "No

amendment shall be made to the Constitution  without

the  concurrence of two-thirds of the votes  of  the

Legislative Assembly of Singapore.". I would then be

a much happier man, and I would sleep much better.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is what it is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Well, let us have it in black and white!

Let  us  not quibble about it in the Courts. Let  us

have  it  in  a language that we all can understand.

You talk about the Governor. If you were to read  it

again,  you might think one single man could do  it.

Then in order to find out who the "Governor" is, you

have to go to some interpreting section. And then we

find  that  the "Governor" means the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara.   And  then  you  get  to  know   from   the

Constitutional  experts that  the  "Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara" in the Constitution means the Cabinet. Now I

am told by the Front Benchers that the Cabinet means

the   Legislative  Assembly.  I  am  puzzled;  quite

frankly  I  am,  when  the  Cabinet  can  mean   the

Legislative Assembly. That really beats me. Let  the

Government  prove that the Cabinet equates  to  two-thirds  of the Legislative Assembly, and I am happy.

But until they can show it to me and to the Assembly

that  the  Cabinet does not equate to two-thirds  of

the Assembly - not a majority vote; we do not want  a

majority  vote. We might have a 26/25 Assembly  here

and  the  Government could put it through a 26-vote;

no,  we  do  not  want that. We  want  a  two-thirds

majority  of  the  Legislative Assembly.  The  Prime

Minister has quite rightly fought for certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



things to be put into the Constitution. He has said,

"I  want  the  Common Market terms embodied  in  the

Constitution."  I  agree  with  him  completely  and

utterly.  I am behind him because that is  our  only

protection. Once we have it in the Constitution, the

Federal Parliament Cabinet cannot alter it. We  must

have  protection,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  This  is  no

protection  to us. We will end up with  the  Federal

Cabinet   taking   away   all   our   constitutional

safeguards  and well be left naked,  high  and  dry.

That is the first point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is Article 30 (2) (b) of Paper

Cmd.  22,  at page 144 - Tenure of office of Members.

If I may read it, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Every Member of the Legislative Assembly shall

cease to be a Member at the next dissolution of  the

Legislative  Assembly after he has been elected,  or

previously thereto if his seat becomes vacant, under

the provisions of this Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The seat of a Member of the Legislative

Assembly shall become vacant -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if he ceases to be a citizen of Singapore; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if he ceases to be a member of or is expelled

or  resigns from the political party for which

he stood in the election; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if, by writing under his hand ...'.



<br><br>The  rest of the provision, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  as

it  is in our present Order in Council. Now, I am  a

member  of  a  political Party.  I  think  political

Parties  have  places in society,  especially  in  a

society  which believes in parliamentary  democracy.

But  I  do not think that a political Party has  any

place in the constitution of any country. No.  I  do

not believe it. It may be - if the Prime Minister  or

the   Minister  for  Finance  can  say   - that   the

constitution of some country has embodied the rights

of  political Parties in the Constitution.  I  would

like to be enlightened on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged. It might assist

the  Member for Farrer Park. In truth and  in  fact,

that   provision   is  not  in  the   constitutional

instruments, and Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963  is  a  false

document.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, I am much obliged. I was coming to

that. That is what I call a back-hand method. Or  is

it  a  back-door method - I do not know which is  the

more correct expression. Mr Speaker, Sir, I know of

no    constitutional   document   which   gives    a

constitutional  position to a  political  Party.  If

there is, I am willing to be enlightened. But as far

as  I know and as far as those whom I have been able

to  consult know, no. Can they advise me? We are not

aware of any such thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps before I begin to comment on it, we should

put  this in its proper perspective by referring  to

Paper   Cmd.   2094,  published  by  Her   Majesty's

Stationery  Office, which I believe deals  with  the

same topic as we but in certain vital issues we seem

to differ.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> An earlier edition?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Whichever edition it is, it is the

edition in my hands and I am going to quote from it.

If  the Minister for Finance has a later edition  of

this   Command   Paper  issued  by   Her   Majesty's

Stationery  Office, he is welcome to  quote  it.  On

page  146,  Sir, of the document quoted, Article  30

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every Member of the Legislative Assembly shall

cease to be a Member at the next dissolution of  the

Legislative  Assembly after he has been  elected  or

previously thereto if his seat becomes vacant  under

the provisions of this Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seat of a Member of the Legislative Assembly

shall become vacant -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if he ceases to be a citizen of Singapore; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if, by writing under his hand addressed to the

Speaker, he resigns his seat in the Legislative

Assembly; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if during two consecutive months in each of

which sittings of the Legislative Assembly  (or

any  committee of the Legislative  Assembly  to

which  he has been appointed) are held  ,he  is

absent  from  all such sittings without  having

obtained   from   the   Speaker   before    the

termination  of any such sitting permission  to

be or to remain absent therefrom: or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) if he becomes subject to any of the

disqualifications specified in  Article  29  of

this Constitution.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



So  the  clause which gives an honoured place  to  a

political Party in the constitution of our  country,

if  Government could get away with it, is not  here.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I am not very  knowledgeable  in

constitutional  matters. I do  not  have  the  State

Advocate-General to advise me. Even if I'  ring  him

up  for  information,  I do not  get  it.  You  will

recollect that the Prime Minister made an open offer

to  Members of the Opposition that if they  were  in

doubt  they could approach his Ministry or the State

Advocate-General.  I  availed myself  of  the  Prime

Minister's offer, and I rang up the State  Advocate-General's Chambers and I spoke to him. E said, "I am

in difficulties, Mr State Advocate-General. Can you

help  me?"  He  said, "Certainly." A most  courteous

gentleman. "Certainly," he said. And I said,  "Look,

the  Prime  Minister has indicated  that  the  White

Paper as published in England and the White Paper as

published  here differ. He has also  said  that  the

difference  occurs  (1)   at  the  instance  of   the

Singapore Government, and (2)  at the instance of the

Federation Government. So could you please  indicate

to  me  where  the  differences lie  and  could  you

separate  the differences under the two  appropriate

heads'?" I told him that otherwise I would  have  to

spend  hours  and hours comparing our document  with

the  English document. Each document runs  to  about

210  pages.  It  is  no joke.  I  do  not  have  the

assistance  of  private secretaries  or  able  civil

servants. I have got just myself to rely  on.  So  I

was very thankful to the State Advocate-General, and

I  asked  him, "When could you let me have  it?"  He

said,  "Well, if you will give me some time, I  will

let  you  have it before lunch." I said, "Thank  you

very  much.  I  shall not go out for lunch;  I  will

stay."  I stayed in but I did not get the documents.

I  came  here  at  2.30 p.m. and  I  saw  the  State

Advocate-General in the corridor during tea time.  I

said,  "I say, what has happened?" He said,  "You'll

get it soon," which meant I would get it soon before

the sitting rose. Well, it has neither come then nor

now. But that is the position, Mr Speaker, Sir. And

I was foolish enough to believe -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the hon. Member for

Farrer  Park  will be lucky during the tea-break.  I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed

to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we took the

adjournment  I was on page 144 of Cmd.  22  of  1963

dealing  with Article 30 (2)  (b). I referred  in  my

speech  to  the fact that this particular sub-clause

(2)   does  not  appear in the Annexure  to  the  Act

passed  by the British Parliament, and I was on  the

verge of raising the constitutional and legal issues

relating  to  these  differences  in  the  documents

presented  to  us and the document  which  has  been

passed in the House of Commons and afterwards in the

House  of Lords. Whether it has received Her Majesty

the  Queen's Assent, I am not in a position to  say,

but  I would think that once it receives Her Majesty

the  Queen's Assent, then the Annexure and the  Bill

itself  become  a statute and no provisions  of  the

statute  nor  any  part or portion of  the  Annexure

could  be altered without the consent of Parliament.

Then  the constitutional position would be that  Her

Majesty  the  Queen  would  formulate  an  Order  in

Council  which  would  then become,  [take  it,  our

Constitution.  Now the Government has  presented  us

with  Cmd.  22  of 1963 which diverges certainly  to

this extent in clause 30 (2)  (b)  which is not in the

English counterpart. I want a categorical reply from

the Government on this, assuming they get a vote  on

this  section, as to what is the constitutional  and

legal position. Would this supersede the Annexure to

the  British  Act which would become  the  Order  in

Council,  or would Parliament have to reconvene  and

pass the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



Bill all over again with a different Annexure, or is

the  Queen  competent constitutionally  of  her  own

accord  and volition to alter the Annexure  to  suit

the private wish of our Prime Minister and his party

colleagues, because he is afraid that one or two  of

his Back benchers might cross over. I am not looking

in  any  particular direction, Mr Speaker,  Sir,I

just  happened to look that way. [Laughter]  Is  the

Prime  Minister afraid that one or two  might  cross

over  and he might lose his majority? It could  well

be  that  it  is not so, but it does look  like  it,

because he is in fact with this problem very much on

his  lap; does he think that this is the way out for

him?  I  respectfully suggest to him that it  should

not  be  embodied  in the Constitution.  Perhaps  it

might be embodied in a local Act. That will be  just

between them and us for the moment. But to embody it

in  the Constitution of Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir,

is to embody it for the present and the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may read that paragraph

(b)  again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If he ceases to be a member of or is expelled or

resigns from the political party for which he  stood

in the election;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope you will forgive me for referring to myself. I am possibly the only Member in this Assembly whom this section will not catch. It will not catch me at all, because I contested the elections as an Independent and if I subsequently join a Party as in fact I have and resign from it,

this section does not affect me. So you will forgive

me  for suggesting to you that my speech on this can

be  completely  objective - no personal  motives,  no

personal  interests; I think I should be  given  the

weight that should be given to an objective point of

view,  and in this particular matter I am  the  only

person  in  this august Assembly who  could  express

that  objective  view, because  there  is  no  other

Member  in  this  House  who  was  returned  as   an

Independent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, could I refer you to page 165 of

the  same  Command  Paper?  Section  96 -  PART  VIII

TEMPORARY  AND  TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS  - marginal

note, "Legislative Assembly.". A very interesting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



provision, Mr Speaker, Sir. Some of us - not  me - are

going  to  be  very worried indeed  after  I  finish

reading it. I have no personal interests, as I  have

said. I will read it very slowly, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

so that it will sink in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Legislative Assembly established by the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order  in  Council,  1958,

(that  is,  our Constitution we arc now working  on,

Mr  Speaker]  shall remain in being  and  shall  be deemed

to be the Legislative Assembly established by this Constitution, and accordingly -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the persons who immediately before the coming

into  operation of this Constitution  hold  the

offices  of  Speaker  and  Deputy  Speaker   or

Members  of the Legislative Assembly shall,  on

the coming into operation of this Constitution,

continue to hold those offices...'



<br><br>You  are  all  right, Mr Speaker, Sir  - no  danger.

[Laughter] -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to hold those offices or their seats...'



<br><br>Ah, it is getting dangerous now:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or their seats as Members in accordance with the

provisions of this Constitution;'.



<br><br>So  their  seats can he held in accordance with  the

provisions of this Constitution. The submission, Mr

Speaker,  is  that  the  important  words  are   "in

accordance    with    the   provisions    of    this

Constitution".  Therefore,  let  us  at  this  stage

examine what are the - [Interruption] [Laughter]. You

see, how smart the Prime Minister is, Mr Speaker. I

take  off  my hat to him. If he were here,  I  would

like  to  pay him a public tribute for  the  way  in

which  he  gets rid of his opponents,  just  by  one

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, section 30 (2) (b) , Mr Speaker, on page 144

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`if he ceases to be a member of or is expelled or

resigns from the political party for which he  stood

in the election;'.



<br><br>Coming  back  again to section 96 on page  165  - "in

accordance    with    the   provisions    of    this

Constitution",  I  might as well read  on.  And  (b)

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the Legislative Assembly shall, unless sooner

dissolved, stand dissolved on the expiration of five

years  from  the  date of the first sitting  of  the

Legislative    Assembly    under    the    Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will be good enough to turn over

the page, it goes on to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(2) The Speaker shall not exercise the functions

of  his  office  and  no member of  the  Legislative

Assembly shall take part in the proceedings  thereof

after the coming into operation of this Constitution

(other  than proceedings necessary for the  purposes of  this  clause) until he has taken and  subscribed

before   the   Legislative  Assembly  an   oath   of

allegiance in the form set out in the First Schedule

to this Constitution.'



<br><br>I  had  better  read  out this Form  of  Allegiance,

because I think it will interest my friends  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  [Laughter] [Interruption]  I  am

coming  to  that. On page 169, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

will read it slowly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I, ...,[it could be anybody] having been elected as

a member of the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore,  do solemnly swear that I will faithfully

discharge  my  duties as such  to  the  best  of  my

ability,  that I will bear true faith and allegiance

to  the State of Singapore and to the Federation  of

Malaysia,  and  that  I will preserve,  protect  and

defend  the  Constitution of the State of Singapore.

So help me God.'



<br><br>That, Mr Speaker, is the oath that will have to  be

taken  by  each  and every one of us fifty  here.  A

heavy burden is being cast on you, Mr Speaker, I do

not  envy  your position, not at all. You  see,  Mr

Speaker, after Malaysia Day, the Constitution  comes

into  operation. After Malaysia Day,  this  Assembly

cannot sit without taking the oath under section  96

(2) .  Before  the oath is taken, you  will  have  to

consider  whether the Members here  are  sitting  in

accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.

If  any  of  them  have violated the  provisions  of

section  30 (2) , then, Mr Speaker, you will  either

have  to make up your own mind on this very delicate

matter, or you will have to get advice from possibly

the State Advocate-General, and do the best you can.

But  it could be that the factual position resulting

from  the 1st of September could be this. If  I  may

deal  with the Members on my left first. The  Member

for  Joo Chiat - now an Independent - returned to  the

Assembly  as a Singapore People's Alliance candidate

and  he will find that he is not sitting within  the

ambit of this Constitution and therefore -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Farrer

Park rather frightened the Speaker when he suggested

that   the   Speaker  has  to  make   constitutional

decisions.  Does  not section  32  of  the  proposed

Constitution at page 145 take the matter out of  the

hands of the Speaker?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any question whether -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any Member of the Legislative Assembly has vacated

his seat therein;



<div align="center"><h4>* * *</h4></div>



<br><br>shall be determined by the Legislative Assembly

whose decision shall be final:'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That takes you out of your difficulties!

The section you read just now - Article 30, sub-article (3) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person whose seat in the Legislative Assembly

has become vacant may, if qualified, again be

elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly...'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that the Member for -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Section 32.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon - section 32. I see,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`shall be determined by the Legislative Assembly

whose decision shall be final.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Sir, I appreciate your difficulties, but the

point  is  that before the Legislative Assembly  can

sit  as  a Legislative Assembly, they will  have  to

take an oath. And the only person who can administer

the  oath  is you. You see the predicament you  have

been placed in. Oh, a terrible situation. Sir, I  am

informed by the Front-benches that the Speaker knows

his  duty  and he will do it fearlessly and  without

prejudice. But the net result will be; if I may deal

with  the  left  first, the Member  for  Jon  Chiat.

Unfortunately, he is absent from the  House  at  the

moment. He contested the seat, unfortunately for him

as  a Member of the Singapore People's Alliance, and

subsequently  for reasons best known to  himself  he

has   resigned  from  the  Party  and  is   now   an

Independent.  He  is  in  the  tentacles  of   these

clauses.  Fourteen members in the  Barisan  Sosialis

will  also  have to take counsel's opinion  on  this

matter. The Member for Anson - the Workers' Party - he

has resigned. He is also caught. He too will have to

take counsel's opinion. My good friend from Hong Lim

[Interruption] Oh, that is right, he and I are the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



only safe ones in this matter. [Interruption] We are

on  common safe ground. No Assembly, no Speaker,  no

Prime  Minister can push us from pillar to post.  We

are  quite safe until May, is it? Mr Speaker,  Sir,

until May 1964 we are quite safe.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Would the Member for Farrer

Park like to expound the position of the Member  for

Aljunied?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember the Member

for Aljunied. I discussed the matter with my Leader.

And  I said, "What do you think I should say of  the

Member  for Aljunied?". Maybe he has a point in  his

favour. He is now in the P.A.P. I make a point - this

operation  of  law, once it starts to  operate,  you

have  had  it. So I suggested that having  left  the

P.A.P., having come to this side and then gone back,

it will not help him at all. That is my view. But I,

in deference to my leader, thought I might not raise

it.  The  Member for Aljunied also is in a  perilous

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No, no.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Constitutionally I mean.

Constitutionally  he is in a parlous  position.  Mr

Speaker. Sir, if he does not take counsel's  opinion

- I  am  afraid  you  might have  to  take  counsel's

opinion  [Interruption]. Of course, the  decent  way

out  of  the  situation would  be  to  dissolve  the

Assembly  straightaway,  then  these  constitutional

problems  would  not  be posed.  Perhaps  you  might

eventually be reduced to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Mr Speaker, Sir, how these things work.

You  tamper with one section, not knowing  what  are

the  full  implications. May I suggest to  you,  Mr

Speaker, how this has occurred? The English Order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The English Order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> You know. Mr Speaker, Sir, you were

once  practising  at the Bar,  and  all  of  us  who

practise at the Bar know this. The draftsmen in  the

State  Advocate-General's Chambers take as  a  model

the  English  Act.  And into the  English  Act  they

introduce one or two amendments - as has been done to

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



Order  in Council - not knowing sometimes that  these

amendments will cause dislocation and disruption  to

the whole - without having considered the whole system

worked out in the original English Act. Mr Speaker,

Sir, I had sleepless nights looking at this thing. I

do  not  see  why  I should not give  the  sleepless

nights to Members on the Front bench now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 167 of Cmd. 2094, which I have just quoted.

Article 96 is exactly identical with our Article 96.

There the operative words are: "...or their seats as

Members  in accordance with the provisions  of  this

Constitution;  ...".  There,  of  course,  it   is

completely  logical and it makes sense, because  the

whole  of  Article 30, reading it with this Article,

does not create any disturbance or violation as  our

amended Article 30.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the State Advocate-General's Chambers start to

tinker  with  the Order in Council  which  has  been

formulated   by  some  of  the  most  expert   legal

draftsmen in the world, and if they think  they  are

competent  to tinker with it, at least  they  should

take  precautions by consulting the London draftsmen

by  asking,  "I say, if we did this,  do  you  think

there would be any ramifications?" I think the State

Advocate-General -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to detract from the praise the Prime

Minister  has showered on him. He has  done  a  good

job. But even Homer nods. Well, there it is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now refer to page 145. Mr Speaker, Sir, i

might make the other point, that there is nothing in

the Federal Constitution similar to our Constitution

- Article 30 (2)  (b).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Oh, they are going to change it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not know whether they are going to.

At  the  moment  the  Federal Constitution  in  that

respect is utterly and entirely different from ours.

I think that is the point I must make to the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may read Article 33 in page 145:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever the seat of a Member has become vacant

for any reason other than a dissolution, the vacancy

shall  be  filled by election in the manner provided

by  or under any law for the time being in force  in

the State.'



<br><br>Now,  I  understand  that  the  counterpart  in  the

Federation is on pages 13 and 14 of this Cmd. Paper.

Is  it page 13? I understand in the Federation it is

six weeks from the date of vacancy.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sixty days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sixty days. I beg your pardon. Page 14 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(which requires a casual vacancy to be filled

within  sixty  days  from  the  date  on  which   it

occurs)'.



<br><br>Are you there, Mr Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, I am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Thank you. When I said, "Are you

there?",  I  mean  on this section.  You  know,  Mr

Speaker, we have a Jot of trouble in Singapore  over

the Sembawang by-election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> One year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> What I feel is this. That we should have

these  things written down in such a way that we  do

not  give people sleepless nights thinking over what

they  should  do and should not do. In other  words,

discretion. Too much discretion should not be  given

to  the Government. You see how much time they waste

thinking over whether they should have a by-election

in  Sembawang, whether it should be five  days  from

today,  or  whether  it  should  be  six  days  from

tomorrow. You see how much time and trouble we  will

save  the  Government if we put in an  amendment  to

Article 33 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the casual vacancy shall be filled within

sixty days of such occurrence.'



<br><br>The   law  then  would  take  its  course.  And  the

Government  would not have to make these very,  very

difficult  decisions. I do accept it. If I  were  in

the Government's position, I might be doing the same

thing.  But there is no reason why when I am in  the

Opposition I should not see that the right thing  is

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> When you are on the Government

side!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> We will one day, one day. Sir, that is

the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I think I should raise for

the record, which I should raise on the second point

I raised, that is on Article 30 (2)  (b). I apologise

for not having -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has also

referred  to  Section 33 of Cmd. 2094. Is  that  the

section being referred to?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Page 145, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Page 147?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon. Sir. In the English

Order, it is page 147. In our Command Paper,  it  is

145.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, page 147 -33.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Page 147 -33, Sir, is the blue book, if

I may use it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> 33, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> 33 - oh yes, Mr Speaker, I am much

obliged to you. Quite correct. Well, our article

reads -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever the seat of a Member has become vacant

for any reason other than a dissolution, the vacancy

shall be filled by election in the manner provided

by or under any law for the time being in force in

the State.'



<br><br>The  corresponding section in the English  Order  in

Council  which  appears in the English  Act  is  33,

which  I  will read very, very slowly in order  that

the  Government Benches might understand it.  Except

for  the  Prime  Minister and the Finance  Minister,

they might not have read it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever the seat of a Member has become vacant

for any reason other than a dissolution, the vacancy

shall within three months from the date on which  it

is established that there is a vacancy, be filled by

election,  in the manner provided by, or  under  any

law for the time being in force in the State.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We got caught again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is jiggery-pokery

of   the   Government.  These  are  all  substantial

amendments  to  the constitution  which  affect  the

vital  interests of the State. Yet  when  the  Prime

Minister made his speech, I think, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



fairness  to  the Opposition - now I understand,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  why  I  have not  been  given  these

differences. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have told you  that

I   had  requested  the  S.A.G. to  give  me  these

differences. I can now understand why I had not been

given  them. If the list had come to me  this  would

have been pinpointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the British Parliament, the Agreement between

our  Government, the Federation Government  and  the

British Government was clause 33 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever the seat of a Member has become vacant

for any reason other than a dissolution, the vacancy

shall within three months from the date on which  it

is  established that there is a vacancy,  be  filled

...'.



<br><br>What do we have in our Constitution? The present

position as existing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you know what happened to Mr Profumo. I am not thinking of his private life. I am thinking of his constitutional conduct - lying to Parliament. He went out. One can tell a lie positively. One can tell a lie negatively. If this is not positive, then it is the other thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you see, Mr Speaker, what a difficult position

we  are  faced with. We support Malaysia. We believe

in  Malaysia.  We fought for it with the  Government

side  by side; if the Prime Minister does not object

to  the  continuation  of the  simile,  shoulder  to

shoulder. And we, who have been fighting with him on

this   matter  on  a  national  basis,   have   been

unwittingly led along. I suppose the suggestion  is,

"Because it is Malaysia, the Alliance will not  dare

to vote against the motion. Therefore, let us put in

all  the  amendments which are  going  to  suit  the P.A.P."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot do it on the Alliance side. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  on the Alliance side we cannot accept  it.  We

regret it very much but we cannot accept it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I seek your guidance. I wish to

propose  an  amendment, and  if  I  might  read  the

amendment to you, and then hand out copies of it  so

that  you might give me guidance as to how  I  might

proceed in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Envelope handed in to Mr Rajah.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I open a document, Mr Speaker, which has just

reached  me? It is On Government Service,  addressed

to me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Envelope opened by Mr Rajah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The document in question [indicating] is a document

from  the  State Advocate-General which he  promised

me. But I am on the verge of finishing my speech.  I

think I have made enough points to satisfy even  the

most unwilling Front Bench. Some jiggery-pokery  is,

in fact, going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek your guidance, and if I might hand over the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The amendment reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, to add -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"save and except the following Articles therein:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Article 69 in page 47 (Safeguards for

constitutional position of Singapore);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Article 30 (2) (b) in page 144 (Tenure of

office of Members);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Article 33 in page 145 (Filling of

vacancies)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know. Mr Speaker, there is an amendment now

before  the  House, but how am I to  deal  with  the

situation,  may  I have guidance from  you  on  this

matter?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The position is that the debate will

continue on the main motion as well as the amendment

which   has   been  proposed  by  the   Member   for

Queenstown.  As  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  has

indicated  that he, at the appropriate moment,  will

wish  to  move a further amendment, therefore,  this

debate could range over this further amendment which

he  says  he will propose at the appropriate moment.

He  cannot  do so now because there is  already  one

amendment  before the House. So that at the  end  of

the  debate, what I shall do, firstly, is to put the

Question  on the amendment moved by the  Member  for

Queenstown, and thereafter, assuming that  it  might

not receive the agreement of this House,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



if  it  is  defeated, then we go back  to  the  main

motion  of the Prime Minister, and then I shall  ask

the  Member for Farrer Park to move simpliciter  the

amendment which he proposes to move. He must now say

what he wishes to say on that amendment. Copies  can

be distributed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of Mr Rajah's proposed amendment

distributed to Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, I am obliged to you for

your guidance in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be very long, but I wish to make the

position  of the Alliance very clear. Sir, there  is

no  question, so far as the Alliance is concerned of

the S.P.A. and U.M.N.O. The Government are trying to

divide  us.  They  keep  on  attacking  the  S.P.A.,

leaving  the U.M.N.O. out. For their edification,  I

might  say that the Member for Cairnhill, who is  an

Alliance member, is the leader of the Alliance,  and

the  Member  for  the Southern Islands,  who  is  an

U.M.N.O. Member, is the Whip of the Party.  And  any

action   taken  by  the  Alliance  is  after   joint

consultation. We are in this together. There  is  no

divergence  of views. So let not the Government  try

and  split us. It is quite unworthy of them. It will

not get them anywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all I wish to say is this. We are for

Malaysia.  I  ask  the Government  not  to  make  it

difficult  for us to vote with them on this  motion.

While  we are for Malaysia, we are even more so  for

Singapore. It is because we love Singapore  so  much

that  we  go  into Malaysia. Now, if in  going  into

Malaysia,  some  jiggery-pokery  is  going   to   be

perpetrated  against  Singapore,  to  preserve  some

party  interests, we are not going to be a party  to

that.  We cannot and we must not. The Alliance makes

this  offer  that if they support this amendment  we

will  whole-heartedly and with great  pleasure  vote

with  them on the motion, but if they deny  us  this

and  defeat  us on this amendment, it  is  with  the

utmost  regret  that we will have  to  refrain  from

voting  on  a  matter on which  we  are  so  vitally

concerned and connected. I hope the Government  will

not force us into that position.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

Malaysia  Agreement  is  a sell-out  by  the  P.A.P.

minority  Government. There is not  much  difference

between  the  Malaysia  Agreement  signed   by   two

Ministers who have lost their mandate in the country

and  the  same situation when the military  warlord,

Wang Tze Kai signed away China with 21 conditions to

Japan.  Both sell-outs happened more or less in  the

same circumstances, and in the same predicament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the principle of Malaysia, which is a

merger of the five territories of Malaya, Singapore,

Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei - a genuine merger of these

territories on fair and equal terms.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is bad luck.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> But the Malaysia Agreement signed

by  the  P.A.P. minority Government in  the  United

Kingdom   with   the  British  and  the   Federation

Governments  is not in concord with the  concept  of

Malaysia.  Singapore is relegated to a vassal  State

with  many  obligations  and  liabilities  and  with

little  rights. Singapore is a step-brother in  this

so-called family. Our rights have been sold by  this

P.A.P. minority Government down the gutter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 24th January, 1962, I said in this Assembly that we support the concept of Malaysia which will provide a bigger single political and economic unit for the benefit of the ten million inhabitants of this country, giving us wider opportunities for both political and economic

advancement.  But, as I said in my  speech  on  24th

January,  1962,  the  P.A.P. White  Paper  proposals

could not provide us with the opportunities for both

political and economic advancement for the people of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be two types of citizenship, one for the

rest  of Malaysia, and the other, an inferior status

of  Malaysian  citizenship, for us,  the  people  of

Singapore.  There will be restrictions  of  movement

within  the new Federation of Malaysia so  that  the

people  of  Singapore  cannot  exercise  their  full

rights  as  citizens  of  Malaysia.  The  people  of

Singapore are relegated to an inferior



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



class  of  Malaysian citizenship anti  their  rights

will  be  suppressed. This is not  the  Malaysia  we

want.  The present scheme is to suppress the  rights

of  the  people  of  Singapore.  Our  stand  on  the

Malaysian  issue  is  most constant  and  has  never

wavered, not even once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malaysia Agreement, which is a direct

departure from the Malaysia concept, and endorsed by

the minority Government of the P.A.P., is an act  of

treachery   perpetrated  against   the   people   of

Singapore.  The P.A.P. Government are so ashamed  of

this,  and that is why Opposition Members are  given

all  these voluminous constitutional documents  only

at the last minute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Malaysia Agreement containing 232 pages was given to me on Sunday afternoon. This is the document which will decide the destiny of 1.8 million people of Singapore, and also our children to come. This document is the most vital document ever produced in the State to decide

the  fate and the destiny of 1 .8 million people  of

Singapore  and their future generations.  It  dwarfs

the  importance of the Rendel Constitution  and  the 1958   Singapore  Constitution,  because  in   those

Constitutions  we were only provided with  temporary

Governments   for  fleeting  phases  in  Singapore's

history,  at  the most for four to five  years,  and

despite  that,  with  those two  Constitutions,  the

Opposition  and the people were afforded ample  time

and  opportunities to put forward  their  views  and

discuss   the   merits   or   demerits   of    those

Constitutions. But with the Malaysia  Agreement  and

the  new State Constitution of Singapore under  this

so-called Malaysia, documents which will decide  our

destiny for many hundreds of years to come,  let  me

ask  the  Government, how many people  in  Singapore

have  read  these vital documents?  In  my  opinion,

there are not more than 20 or 30 people in Singapore

who  have  read  these vital documents.  The  P.A.P.

Government  dare  not  even translate  the  Malaysia

Agreement into the vernacular languages and  publish

it  in  the  Press.  Whereas  in  the  case  of  the

financial    negotiations   with   the    Federation

Government, special long explanatory articles were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



written  by the Government and even translations  of

certain  documents on the financial agreements  were

made  and  published in the Press.  Of  course,  the

Government will give us the excuse that there is not

enough time to translate the Malaysia Agreement into

the various vernacular languages for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, shall we just pass this document which

dwarfs  all the sell-out treaties signed by  Chinese

military  war lords to imperialist powers when  only

at  the most 20 or 30 people in Singapore have  read

them?  Why is the Government so scared? Why has  the

Government  given  us so little time  to  study  the

documents, to debate them, giving us only three days

to   debate   - documents  which  would  decide   our

destinies  for  hundreds of years!  Giving  us  only

three days to debate and to inform the people.  Sir,

is  this not a sell-out? Is this not a genuine sell-out? And that is why they are so scared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must strongly protest against the manner in which the P.A.P. Government is treating the Opposition and the people. They are afraid that the people will know what goes on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 234-page Malaysia Agreement, that is, the Blue

Book, could be bought in the United Kingdom from the

British  Government Printing Office about two  weeks

ago  for about $6 per copy, and some Members of  the

Opposition managed to obtain several copies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the P.A.P. Government said that the

Malaysia  Agreement published by the United  Kingdom

Government,  which  is the Blue  Book,  is  somewhat

different  from the Malaysia Agreement presented  to

the  Singapore Legislative Assembly,  which  is  the

White Book.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the

Federation  Government is going to  present  to  the

Federation Parliament next month when they are going

to  debate  also the Malaysia Agreement.  I  believe

they use the Brown Book. Now the British passed  the

Blue Book, which is different from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



the  White  Book  passed by the Singapore  Assembly,

which  might be different from the Brown Book passed

by  the Federation Parliament. Mr Speaker, Sir, how

are  we going to run this country? Which book is the

right  interpretation of what  has  been  sold  out?

Would the P.A.P. tell us the whole truth? What  have

they  sold out? How much have they sold us out?  Why

should  we  have so many versions of what they  have

signed in England?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to seek clarification from the Government on

which is the genuine Malaysia Agreement. Why do they

not  produce  to us photostat copies of the  genuine

Malaysia  Agreement  to which this  minority  P.A.P.

Government have attested their signatures?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember after the P.A.P. special conference

of  19th  June,  1960, when I was  expelled,  though

there  was  not  such an item to  expel  me  on  the

agenda,  the  P.A.P. leadership produced  different

versions  of  the minutes of party proceedings,  one

version  for  the English press and another  version

for   the  Chinese  press.  Different  versions   of

proceedings  of one meeting. Now we  have  the  same

situation - different versions of what was  sold  out

in the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit, Sir, it is very difficult for us to

trust the P.A.P. leadership. We never know for  sure

to  what extent this minority P.A.P. Government  has

sold  out  Singapore. I wish to ask  the  Government

this  question.  Has  the Government  given  to  the

Opposition   all   available  documents   concerning

Singapore's constitutional future, or are these only

part  of the documents? Are there any more documents

relevant  to the constitutional future of  Singapore

which the P.A.P. Government has sought to hide  from

us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish the Government will clarify the matter later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minority P.A.P. Government must make available to the Opposition Members all the minutes and all the documents of their negotiations from 1961 onwards; then we will

know exactly the extent of P.A.P. treachery.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the papers on the financial

negotiations as contained in Misc. 4 of 1963 contain

only 77 pages. I am sure there must be thousands  of

pages  of  documents concerning just  the  financial

talks  alone. Why not give us the documents and  all

the  facts  so that we can gauge the extent  of  the

P.A.P. sell-out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have a feeling there are many things the P.A.P. Government is trying to hide from us and from the people. In order to conceal all its sins of betrayal and treachery, this minority P.A.P. Government produces photostat copies on scraps of paper, things written on the back of used envelopes, and telling us they are vital constitutional

documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, how can a constitutional document be written and endorsed at the back - with scribbled notes - of a used envelope, and produced as a part of the White Paper for debate in this Assembly? Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer to the notes scribbled by

the  Federation Prime Minister at the Ritz Hotel  on

8th  July, 1963. I am not sure whether it is the 8th

July,  1963, or the 7th July, 1963. There  were  two

dates  there. It could be either 12 midnight of  7th

July or 12.01 on 8th July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe they were only points of discussion

which the Federation Prime Minister scribbled on the

back of a used envelope which he happened to pick up

at  his  desk.  Is  that proof that  the  Federation

Government  had  agreed to all the  five  points  of

discussion scribbled on the back of a used envelope?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words scribbled on the used envelope are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) "Loans, labourers - not outside Malaysia - 50 per

cent  Singapore." Mr Speaker, Sir, what  does  that

mean to us? "Labourers - not outside Malaysia - 50 per

cent Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) "Singapore L. Assemblymen - resignation or

expulsion - vacate seat - so long as does not conflict

parliamentary practice." Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  is

more understandable although it is like a Morse Code

to us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) "Singapore Immigration and restriction order

movement.  Reciprocal." Reciprocal might  have  many

meanings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) "Singapore gangster." I could not read the

words.  It  looks  like O.S.K., a Japanese  shipping

line.  "Singapore gangster 0.5K. Detention  delegate

to us in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, this is the best joke of this

"vital constitutional document." "Detention delegate

to   us  in  Singapore."  This  is  signed  by   the

Federation  Prime  Minister.  In  other  words,  the

Federation  Prime Minister delegates  the  power  of

detention  to  the  Federation  Prime  Minister   in

Singapore. "To us in Singapore" - that is what he has

said. It does not say that detention delegate to the

P.A.P.  Government  in Singapore - to  the  Singapore

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the last point, Sir, is: "Singapore last part

out  - inter-government  committee."  This  makes  no

sense to me at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to mock all this P.A.P. propaganda, we have in

today's  papers, that is, 31st July, the  Federation

Government's straight denial that they  have  agreed

to these five points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to refer to page 9 of one

of  the  Chinese newspapers, the Nanyang  Siang Pau.

The Federation Government have come out with  a denial that

they have agreed to any of these points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think having sold away Singapore in

London  the Singapore Prime Minister became panicky.

He must have a guilty conscience. Before he departed

for  London, he talked big. He tried to play up  the

$50 million grant issue - to cover up the purpose  of

the  trip which was to sign away Singapore. That was

the genuine and the only purpose of the trip. So  in

order  to  cover  it up be used all the  weapons  of

propaganda  at  his disposal and  told  us.  "Fellow

countrymen. I am not the Sultan of Singapore;  I  am

not  going  to give away $50 million."  But  he  was

going  there  quietly to sign away  Singapore  lock,

stock  and barrel. Sir, he gave away $50 million  in

another form - in the form of interest-free loans for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



10 years - five years in the first instance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to Singapore he knew the big guns

of the Opposition would be waiting for him. Being  a

very  shrewd politician, he tried to catch the  bull

by  the  horns.  He  organised a  so-called  victory

celebration to cover up his sell-out and his  defeat

in  London. The crowd in the City Hall steps and  in

Hong  Lim Park attracted by the concerts turned away

when the Prime Minister began to speak. On the first

night  the  T.V. cameraman must have got a  scolding

for  turning his T.V. lenses on the dispersing crowd

as  the returned hero spoke. On the second night  in

Hong  Lim  Park the T.V. cameraman must have  learnt

his  lesson. The Work Brigade boys in front were  so

embarrassed as the T.V. lenses had only their  faces

to focus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister and the P.A.P. leadership

saw  it. The ground was cold. Nobody echoed  to  the

shouts  of  Merdeka despite the fact that the  Prime

Minister  tried to explain. The P.A.P. leaders  knew

they  were finished. They pinned their last hope  on

the  undemocratic  Federal  Elections  Bill  through

which they hoped they could rig the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. leadership had a feeling in London that things were not going too well. They have deceived the Chinese-speaking people in Singapore into believing that Singapore is going to have financial autonomy. Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, the Prime Minister has never mentioned

the  words  "financial autonomy" when  he  made  his

speeches  in English, but when he made his  speeches

in  Mandarin  or  in  Hokkien,  he  used  the  words

"financial autonomy" for Singapore. But I feel, Sir,

that  they made a grave tactical mistake in  playing

up  the  financial talks. They thought it  was  good

propaganda,  hoping  to  deceive  the  people   that

although  they  had endorsed the  White  Paper  they

still  had   the interests of the people of Singapore

at  heart - always defending their rights against the

encroachment  of  the  Federation  Government.  They

forgot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



the  old  saying,  "Who brought the  wolf  into  the

house?"  They  cannot  deliver  the  goods  on   the

financial talks which they played up. They were back

to  the same original position before they played up

the  financial talks. The whole propaganda  strategy

boomeranged against the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, they gave away $50 million in another form, in the form of an interest-free loan. The P.A.P. leadership knew they were finished. Sir, I say that they will not get more than five seats in the 51-seat contest if it is held in September, that is, two months from now, or only a few weeks from

now, and their five seats will diminish in number as

time  passes by as the people of Singapore  see  the

Malaysia  Agreement  and  the  new  Constitution  of

Singapore  work out in practice to the detriment  of

the  people. Therefore, the P.A.P. must do something

in  their power to save themselves after signing the

fatal  Malaysia  Agreement. Any straw  is  good  for

them; any straw is good for sinking people. It  must

have been somewhere near midnight when the Singapore

Prime  Minister -or was it about 9.30 - went from  his

Park  Lane  Hotel - I believe, Sir, it  costs �30  a

night  - to see the Federation Prime Minister at  the

Ritz  Hotel. The Singapore Prime Minister must  have

put  forward five items of discussion and begged the

Federation Prime Minister to agree. The first  point

on labour arising from Singapore's $150 million loan

to the Borneo State is to explain why Singapore gave

away  $50 million worth of interest. We have to  pay

$50  million worth of interest to get this loan  and

in turn lend it to the Borneo State. The other three

points  are  to  save the collapse  of  the  P.A.P.,

particularly asking for the rights to detain  people

under   the   Criminal  Law  (Temporary  Provisions)

Ordinance. The main purpose of this request is  that

the  P.A.P. Government will have the power  to  deal

with  political opponents since the Preservation  of

Public Security Ordinance has been given away to the

Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I can imagine that the Federation

Prime Minister was tired between the nocturnal hours of 7th and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



8th July. The Singapore Prime Minister can be a very

persistent  man.  He has the capacity  to  drum  his

views  into  a  person  for  hours  and  hours.  The

Federation Prime Minister requiring sleep must  have

listened  impatiently, and being a good-natured  man

and requiring more sleep because he is an older man,

could  have  nodded his head and  said,  "Yah,  yah,

yah,"  which  means nothing at all.  [Laughter]  Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is like the Singapore Minister  for

Finance. When he listens to a request for funds,  he

nods  his head, and all the time he says, "Yes, yes,

yes."  But  he does not mean that he agrees  to  the

request  for  funds.  The Singapore  Prime  Minister

could  have  then  taken away the used  envelope  on

which  the  Federation Prime Minister had  scribbled

some  notes on points raised by the Singapore  Prime

Minister.  He  therefore waited until  the  Malaysia

Agreement was signed on the 9th of July, and on  the

10th of July, he shot a memorandum to the Federation

Prime Minister hoping by this memorandum to get  the

Federation  Prime Minister committed. The Federation

Prime  Minister, being an equally astute politician,

did  not  reply and confirm the memorandum. That  is

why  in this exchange of letters as contained in the

White  Paper  Misc.  5 of 1963, in  this  bundle  of

Documents, we did not see any reply, any memorandum,

from  the Federation Prime Minister confirming  this

so-called agreement on the 5 points. Mr Speaker, is

this not unusual? The P.A.P. Government has a lot to

explain   to   the  people.  Today  the   Federation

Government have not only issued a denial  that  they

have  agreed  to  the  five points,  but  they  have

produced   a   photostat  copy  which  is   slightly

different from the photostat copy published  by  the

Singapore Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, we have  two

photostat  copies.  I  do  not  know  which  one  is

correct.  We  have  in  the Nan  yang  Siang  Pau  a

photostat copy which is more or less the same as the

photostat copy produced in the White Paper  Misc.  5

of  1963,  but  it seems to me that there  are  many

words  here with crosses and marks not contained  in

the Singapore photostat copy. Sir, I must admit that

I am getting more and more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



confused.  There  are two versions of  the  Malaysia

Agreement; there might even be three versions. There

are  two  versions of what happened in a bedroom  at

the Ritz Hotel on the night of either the 7th or the

8th  of  July.  Sir, these are vital  constitutional

matters and issues affecting the fate and the  lives

of  1.8 million people and our future. These are not

four-digit  lottery  numbers written  on  scraps  of

paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these constitutional documents are irrevocable. They will forever in perpetuity seal the fate of the people of Singapore. They are hundreds of times more important than the 1958 Singapore Constitution which is only for a period of a few years. Mr Speaker, Sir, yet when the 1958

Singapore  Constitution was  signed  in  the  United

Kingdom,  it  was signed by an All-Party  Delegation

and  it  had the backing of all the Parties and  the

people   in  Singapore.  The  broad  principles   of

constitutional  advancement were at first  discussed

at  an  All-Party  Conference  and  debated  in  the

Assembly and all Party delegations took part in  the

detailed   negotiations  on   the   1958   Singapore

Constitution in the United Kingdom. Draft copies  of

the  1958 Constitution were circulated to Opposition

Assemblymen  giving them ample  time  to  study  the

detailed  provisions so that they could  fully  take

part  in  the  debate.  But, Sir,  here  we  have  a

minority  P.A.P. Government which,  if  it  has  any

sense  of  decency left, should have  resigned  last

Thursday on the undemocratic Federal Elections  Bill

after  having  promised to do so. Here,  we  have  a

Government which has no majority, a Government which

has  lost  two  key by-elections, signing  away  the

rights  of  the people of Singapore.  How  can  this

minority   P.A.P.  Government  sign  on  behalf   of

Singapore?  They have lost their mandate  to  govern

long  ago.  Even in this Assembly which was  elected

more  than  four  years  ago  and  where  the  power

position  has shifted considerably since  1959,  the

P.A.P.  Government has suffered an ignominous defeat

on  the  vital  Bill, and they should have  resigned

there and then on their solemn undertaking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not understand why this Government want to linger on from clay to day in office like the Lim Yew Hock Government did before the 1959 general elections. Why do the P.A.P. Government want to commit the rights of the people of Singapore deeper and deeper down the drain?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the documents in the Malaysia Agreement must be looked at from two aspects. The first aspect is that it is primarily a sell-out treaty signed by two persons representing a minority Government of Singapore. The second aspect is that in consideration of hawking away the rights of the people the P.A.P. Government managed to get a few

concessions  here  and there for their  own  selfish

interest  which  they  hope  would  resuscitate  the

P.A.P., and if the Federation Government is prepared

to be the scapegoat for destroying P.A.P. opponents,

then the way is open for a higher ambition - the road

to  Prime  Ministership of Malaysia. Of  course,  we

know  that  that  is an idle, vain  dream.  At  this

moment,  if  the P.A.P. were to hold a clean  honest

election,  they would not get even  one  of  the  15

seats to the Federal Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us examine the sell-out aspect of the

Malaysia Agreement. First of all, there is the sell-out  on  citizenship rights. I have often said  that

there  will be two classes of Malaysian citizenship:

one  class  meant  for citizens of  the  11  Malayan

States  and  the  two Borneo States of  Sarawak  and

Sabah,  and the other class is an inferior class  of

Malaysian  citizenship  (Singapore)  meant  for  the 624,000  citizens of Singapore. The two  classes  of

Malaysian  citizenship  are not  interchangeable  by

moving  residence and this distinction  will  remain

for  ever, for many, many centuries to come. It does

not  only  affect  the  present  generation  of  1.8

million  people of Singapore but also  their  future

generations.  There is no provision in the  Malaysia

Agreement   to   provide  for  a   review   of   the

Constitution  at some future date, so that  the  two

classes of Malaysian citizenship can be abolished,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



so  that  one  class of Malaysian  citizenship  will

remain.  Sir,  in  other words, there  will  be  two

separate    compartments   in   Malaysia   - entirely

different  compartments - one compartment  comprises

the  11 Malayan States and the two Borneo States and

the  other  compartment is Singapore. The  Singapore

compartment is doomed for ever. Under the provisions

of   the   Malaysia  Agreement,  even  if  Singapore

citizens  increased greatly in number in  excess  of

its  present  624,000 citizens  to  even,  say,  one

million,  and  let us assume the other  compartment,

namely,  the  Federation and the Borneo States  have

not increased at all, yet Singapore's representation

in  the Central Parliament would always remain at 15

seats.  There is no provision for review  and  under

the Malaysia Agreement Article 31, sub-clause (1), a

Singapore citizen can only be elected as a Member of

Parliament. He cannot go elsewhere and vote or stand

for  election,  but in the case of  the  first-class

Malaysian  citizenship, he can go  anywhere,  stand,

vote and be elected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Not in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I

heard  an  interesting joke, that the  Minister  for

Home  Affairs did not even read the Constitution  on

the  citizenship issue. There is no  provision.  Mr

Speaker Sir,In that case, since the increase in the

number   of  Singapore  citizens  does  not   affect

Singapore's  representation of M.P.s in the  Central

Government,  then it should only be  fair  that  the

right  to  confer and deprive Singapore  citizenship

should rest solely on the Singapore Legislature  and

on the Singapore Government. But this is not what we

expect   in  the  Malaysia  Agreement.  The  Federal

Government  will  take  away  the  basic  rights  of

conferring   Singapore  citizenship  and   depriving

Singapore citizenship. The right to confer Singapore

citizenship by naturalisation goes to the Federation

Government under Article 27 (1)  (a)  (ii). Of course,

it  is  provided that the Singapore Government  must

concur.  The  Singapore Government has no  right  to

deprive the citizenship of a person naturalised as a

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



citizen  by the Federation Government. The Singapore

Government  has no right to deprive the  citizenship

of  a  person naturalised as a Singapore citizen  by

the  Federation Government. They confer on  somebody

whom  we  do not like, Singapore citizenship status,

and  we  cannot revoke it. The Singapore  Government

has  the  right to approve Singapore citizenship  by

registration   -only  by  registration.   But   such

approval  requires the concurrence of the Federation

Government. That is contained in Article 57  (1)   of

the    Singapore   Constitution.   The    Federation

Government can deprive any Singapore citizen of  his

Singapore citizenship by depriving the latter of his

second-class Malaysia citizenship under  Article  23

(3)  of the Malaysia Act. Mr Speaker. Sir, what will

happen  is  this. We will be Singapore  citizens  as

well   as   second-class  Malaysia   citizens.   The

Federation Government, by depriving us of our second-class   Malaysia  citizenship,  will   automatically

deprive us of our Singapore citizenship. Is this not

a  sell-out? I must refer you to clause  64  of  the

Singapore Constitution which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where a person who is a citizen of Singapore has

renounced  his  citizenship  of  Malaysia  or   been

deprived  of  his  citizenship of  Malaysia  by  the

Government  of the Federation such person  shall  be

deemed  to  have renounced or been deprived  of  his

citizenship of Singapore under this Constitution and

such   person   shall  cease  to   be   citizen   of

Singapore.'.



<br><br>Is   this  clause  not  unfair  to  the  people   of

Singapore? Why should the minority P.A.P. Government

commit  the  destiny of 624,000 Singapore  citizens?

The  Singapore Assembly and the Singapore Government

should  be  given  full  autonomy  on  questions  of

Singapore citizenship because Singapore is not being

accepted  in a genuine merger. Second-class Malaysia

citizenship  (Singapore) is  entirely  a  class  and

status  all  on  its own. Why should the  Federation

Government  be allowed to interfere in the  granting

and depriving of Singapore citizenship when the fact

is  that  whether  we have more  or  less  Singapore

citizens makes no difference to the number of  seats

in  the  Central  Parliament? Sir,  we  should  have

complete  autonomy  on  the question,  of  Singapore

citizenship, that is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



the  question of even controlling an inferior  class

of  Malaysia citizenship (Singapore) and that  right

is  now  denied  us. There is no autonomy  given  to

Singapore on Singapore citizenship. This should have

been the case since Singapore is to be considered  a

separate  unit  under the control of the  Federation

Government  and  not  fully  integrated   with   the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under the Malaysia Agreement the granting of

citizenship by registration requires the sanction of

both  the  Singapore Government and  the  Federation

Government.  This  is under clause  57  (1)   of  the

Singapore   Constitution.   Therefore,   Sir,   when

applying  for  Singapore  citizenship,  instead   of

having one hurdle to cross as at present, there will

be two hurdles to cross in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we must please both the Singapore

Government and the Federation Government in order to

acquire  Singapore citizenship, which  automatically

makes   us   a   second-class  Malaysia  citizenship

(Singapore).   Similarly,   both   the    Federation

Government and the Singapore Government have  powers

to  deprive Singapore citizens of their citizenship.

In  other words, Sir, one has to be nice not only to

the  Singapore Government but also to the Federation

Government. I refer you to section 61 and section 64

of   the   proposed   Singapore  Constitution.   The

Federation  Government can, on its own, without  our

consent, grant to Singapore citizens, as I have said

just   now,  the  status  of  Singapore  citizenship

through  the process of naturalisation. This  is  so

even  though the Singapore Government might consider

such  a person undesirable. To add insult to injury,

the  Singapore Government has no right to cancel the

Singapore  citizenship  of  such  a  person  who  is

granted   citizenship  by  naturalisation   by   the

Federation  Government. May I refer you  to  section

61(5)   of the Singapore Constitution? It is a  pity,

Sir, that this P.A.P. minority government give us so

little  time  to study the constitutional  documents

more carefully and in greater detail. Sir, may I ask

the P.A.P. Government what is going to happen to the

tens   of  thousands  of  applicants  for  Singapore

citizenship which are still pending?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure if more time is given to the Opposition

and  if  these  vital constitutional documents  were

translated  into  all the vernacular  languages  and

published  in the Press, the Government  would  know

the  temper  of  the  country,  the  temper  of  the

Opposition to these sell-out documents. What type of

merger  is this? What type of country are we heading

for?  Is  there any similar Federation elsewhere  in

the world?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 60 (3) of the Malaysia Act gives the

Federation Government the right to restrict  second-class  Malaysia citizenship of Singapore  travelling

to  or  residing in any part of Malaysia,  including

the Borneo territories. Sir, this is a shame. Why do

the  minority P.A.P. Government accept this shameful

condition? In other words, the Federation Government

can tomorrow, after Malaysia, close the Causeway and

prevent  the entry of second-class Malaysia citizens

of  Singapore. Likewise Sabah and Sarawak can forbid

entry   of   second-class  Malaysia  citizens   from

Singapore into the Borneo territories. Is this not a

complete sell-out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you to section 14 of the Immigration

Act  which  is  part  and  parcel  of  the  Malaysia

Agreement? Section 14 of the Immigration  Act  which

is  part of the Malaysia Agreement provides that  we

require a so-called internal travel document  to  go

to   Borneo.  Why  call  this  an  internal   travel

document?  Why not call it a passport and visa?  Mr

Speaker,  may I ask this P.A.P. minority  Government

whether  there  is any other country  in  the  world

where citizens in the same country are forbidden  to

travel  freely  within its national boundaries?  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, out of the hundred over countries  is

there any other parallel?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 6 of the White Paper has promised the people

of  Singapore that the fundamental liberties of  the

people  of  Singapore will be adequately safeguarded

in  the  provisions of the Federation  Constitution.

But  under  the  Malaysia Agreement our  fundamental

liberties   are  all  conscribed.   They   are   not

protected.  They are not safeguarded.  There  is  no

need for the Prime Minister to try to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



conceal   these  restrictions  on  the   fundamental

liberties  of second-class citizens of Singapore  by

making a Ministerial statement on religious freedom.

Why  does the Prime Minister not come here and  say,

"Countrymen, all of you have the freedom to  breathe

fresh air."? It is a right which we already have and

which  we  are  now enjoying. Why  does  the  P.A.P.

Government agree to all these conscriptions  of  our

fundamental liberties, of our freedom?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us compare our inferior citizenship status to

the  citizenship provisions accorded  to  Sabah  and

Sarawak. Their citizens will be treated as equals of

Malaysia  citizens from the 11 Malayan States.  They

will  have no distinction. They will have  the  same

type of citizenship. They will have the same status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the second sell-out of the P.A.P. minority Government is the number of seats which the Prime Minister has accepted in the Central Parliament. The first sell-out is on the citizenship rights. The second sell-out is on the number of seats in the Central Parliament. Article 9 of the Malaysia Act provides for 15 members from Singapore,

with 1.8 million people, compared to 16 members from

Sabah, with a quarter of Singapore's population.  We

have  1.8 million people and we have only 15  M.P.s.

Sabah  has  only 400,000 people and they  have  more

M.P.s  than  Singapore. Is this not  another  P.A.P.

sell-out? Sir, to make matters worse, this ratio  is

fixed,  under  the  Malaysia Act,  indefinitely  and

forever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no provision to review the position after

a  period of time where adjustments can be  made  to

rectify   the  wrongs  perpetrated  by  the   P.A.P.

Government.  I remember the Prime Minister  said  in

Bukit  Panjang sometime early this year  during  his

rural  visits that Singapore will have the right  to

review   the   position   and   can   increase   its

representation in the Central Parliament to even  40

or  100  seats if necessary when the time  comes.  I

have  searched through the documents and cannot find

such  a  provision.  It is my  belief  that  such  a

provision  does  not  exist.  The  minority   P.A.P.

Government  has  therefore not  only  sold  out  the

present generation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



lock,  stock and barrel. It has sold out the  future

generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister told the people that Singapore has accepted less seats compared to Sabah because it will have financial autonomy. He said, without financial autonomy the Federation can hold a future Singapore State Government to ransom. Sir, where is Singapore's financial autonomy? Can the P.A.P.

Government tell us Opposition Members where to  find

it?  I  have  searched  through  the  Constitutional

documents  during the last few days and I could  not

find  it.  There  is  no  such  thing  as  financial

autonomy for Singapore. The vital power to legislate

on  taxes  belongs  to  the  Federation  Government.

Monetary and fiscal policies to create prosperity or

a  boom  or  a depression are in the powers  of  the

Federation   Government,  in  other   words,   basic

financial   powers  on  legislation   and   policies

concerning   finance  belong   to   the   Federation

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Income Tax law, from 9th July, 1963, it is

written   into  the  Malaysia  Agreement  that   the

Singapore  Government will have no  more  powers  to

introduce  even new amendments. It is  not  only  on

Income  Tax legislation that the Federation Minister

of  Finance  is  given full powers.  The  Federation

Government  can actually at any time take  over  the

Singapore Income Tax Department; and even  for  that

matter  the  Customs  and  Excise  Departments.  The

Federation   Government  can  check   the   detailed

workings  of  the  Singapore Income  Tax  Department

through  its Comptroller-General of Income Tax,  and

also  the Customs and Excise Department through  its

special  inspectors. Mr Speaker, Sir,  relief  from

income  tax  on depreciation, and Orders made  under

the  Industrial  Expansion (Relief from  Income  Tax

Ordinance,  1959),  shall rest with  the  Federation

Government. These powers are important because  they

are relevant to industrialisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. On

Customs  and  Income  Tax the Federation  Government

would  not  only  have the power to  legislate,  the

power  to  fix the ratio of tax, the power  to  make

regulations, the power to send Federal  officers  to

inspect  the  day-to-day detailed administration  of

the  Singapore Income Tax Department and the Customs

Department,  but  the  power  to  take  back   these

departments any time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 5 of the Financial Agreement between the

Singapore   and   the  Federation   Governments   as

contained in Annex J of the Malaysia Agreement  lays

down clearly "executive authority in respect of  the

collection in Singapore of customs duties and excise

and  income tax shall be delegated to the  Singapore

Government." Mr Speaker, Sir, the operative word is

"delegated".  It  is  not the separation  of  powers

between Federal and State. It is different from  the

List of State powers enumerated, where the Singapore

Legislature  will  in future have jurisdiction  over

the  list  of enumerated State powers. The Singapore

Government's  running  of  Income  Tax  and  Customs

Departments  would  be delegated by  the  Federation

Government to the Singapore Government. Sir,  it  is

my  belief,  what is delegated can always  be  taken

back. Article 5 continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Federal Government may revoke this authority

if the Singapore Government fails to comply with any

direction  properly  given  to  it  by  the  Federal

Government for the collection or protection of these

taxes  or  shows  itself  unwilling  or  unable   to

discharge   these   functions   efficiently.    This

authority  may  extend to customs duties  and  other

charges  collected  in Singapore on  goods  exported

from   or  to  be  imported  into  Malaysia  outside

Singapore.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it shows clearly that on any reason given by the Federation Minister for Finance, they can take back the Singapore Income Tax Department and the Customs Department. They can ask the Singapore Income Tax Department to collect all 1964 revenue by 31st March, 1964, and if they find

that  it is a physical impossibility, they say,  "The

Singapore Government is not efficient enough," and by

the  exercise  of Article 5 they can  take  back  the

Singapore Income Tax Department -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Has the Member for Hong Lim

directed  his attention to Article 10* in  regard  to

disputes?

<hr size="2" noshade>

Article 10 of Annex J reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any dispute between the Federal Government

and   the   Singapore  Government   us   to   the

interpretation  or application of this  Agreement

may  be  referred  by either  Government  to  the

Federal Court for determination by that Court  in

exercise  of the jurisdiction conferred  upon  it

by Article 128 of the Federal Constitution.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir, but

disputes in these cases, I believe, will be mostly on

the  quantum of payments, whereas Article 5 will more

or  less  decide  on the machinery of  collection  of

taxes. I have studied Articles 8, 9, 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said in this Assembly before, what

the  P.A.P. Government has been fighting for and  has

been playing up its propaganda in the past few months

is  to  have  the  right to be a rent collector.  The

money  collected  by  the Singapore  Government  from

national  taxes,  according  to  Article  6  of   the

Financial  Agreement,  has  to  be  paid   into   the

Federation  Central  Bank which will  open  a  Branch

Office  in  Singapore.  In other  words,  the  P.A.P.

Government  is nothing but a rent collector.  If  the

rent  collector  behaves, or if the  boss  likes  his

face,  then he is allowed to collect rent,  and  this

rent is to be in the form of cheques, which will have

to  be  paid into the boss's banking account. If  the

boss does not like him or does not like his face,  he

will  dismiss him and collect the rent himself.  Sir,

for  every dollar of national taxes collected by  the

rent  collector, the boss will take away 40 cents  to

pay  for  the  cost of the Police, the Army  and  the

Prisons  to  make  the  people  of  Singapore  behave

themselves. The rent collector is allowed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



to draw 60 cents from the banking account of the boss

to  pay  for  the cost of schools, hospitals,  social

welfare and all the other services of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not believe that there is financial autonomy for Singapore, with legislative powers under the control of the Federation Government, fiscal and economic policies under the control of the Federation Government, 14 items of powers on finance under the control of the Federation

Government,  the  day-to-day  administration  of  the

Income  Tax  Department  and the  Customs  Department

subject   to   the   inspection  of  the   Federation

representatives. Moreover all these  departments  for

the collection of taxes can be taken back at any time

under  some  pretext given under  Article  5  of  the

Financial Agreement. I only refer to the main  powers

of  finance given to the Central - I am not  referring

to  the other 14 items of financial powers which  the

Singapore   Government   has   surrendered   to   the

Federation Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is  no

autonomy in finance. We will only be acting  as  rent

collectors. Sir, is this not another sell-out by  the

minority P.A.P. Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sell-out is citizenship rights: the

second  sell-out  is representation  in  the  Central

Parliament;  the third sell-out is financial  rights.

The  fourth  sell-out is on the List of State  rights

given   to   Singapore,  which  the  P.A.P. minority

Government  has accepted on behalf of the  people  of

Singapore.  If  we  compare  Part  I  of  the  Fourth

Schedule  to the Malaysia Act, which is State  rights

for  the  Borneo States, and Part II  of  the  Fourth

Schedule  to the Malaysia Act, which is State  rights

for  Singapore,  we will see that  the  State  rights

given  to the Borneo States and to Singapore  do  not

differ  very significantly. Not only so,  the  Borneo

States  during  the first five years after  Malaysia,

can  manage  to get substantial aid of $500  million,

and  Singapore will have to advance them more or less

an interest-free loan of $150



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



million.  Sabah,  with  one-quarter  of  Singapore's

population, gets more representation in the  Central

Parliament than Singapore. The Borneo States,  under

the  proposed  Immigration Bill,  can  restrict  the

immigration  of people from other parts of  Malaysia

into their territories. Mr Speaker, Sir, these  are

the State rights given to Sabah, almost equal to the

State rights given to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabah has more representation in Parliament

although  they only have one-quarter of  Singapore's

population; $500 million free financial aid to Sabah

and  Sarawak  in the space of five years;  and  $150

million  more or less interest-free loan which  will

cost  the  Singapore taxpayers $50  million,  to  be

given  to Sabah and Sarawak during the course of  15

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borneo States will have the right to restrict

immigration into Sabah and Sarawak. Under Article 60

(3)   of the Malaysia Act, the Federal Government can

restrict the movement of Singapore citizens into the

Federation.  Under  section 14  of  the  Immigration

Bill, Sarawak and Sabah can restrict entry of second-class  Malaysian  citizens  of  Singapore  into  the

Borneo  States. Sir, what happens? Under section  60

(3)   of  the Malaysia Act, the Federation Government

can  stop us from moving across the Causeway.  Under

section  14  of  the Immigration  Act,  Borneo  will

prevent  us from going to Borneo. What are we  like,

Sir?  Singapore citizens would be like turtles in  a

stagnant pond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have a closer look and compare the

respective  State  rights reserved  for  the  Borneo

States  and for Singapore? If we have the two Lists,

Part   I   and  Part  II,  of  the  Fourth  Schedule

enumerated  and  tabulated we  will  find  that  the

powers   given  to  Singapore  and  to  the   Borneo

territories are more or less similar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many powers exactly similar given to

both  places.  For  instance, medicine  and  health,

family laws, charitable trust, State elections for a

period  of  time.  Mr  Speaker,  these  powers  are

similarly reserved and accorded to both territories.

Then there are little sundry powers given to each of

the territories which are peculiar to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



each  of  them. For instance, Sabah will  run  Sabah

Railways, Singapore will run its own gas works.  Mr

Speaker,  it is of no use for Singapore to have  the

right to run the Singapore Railway because we do not

have  one. It is neither useful for Sabah to  run  a

gas works because Sabah does not have any gas works.

So Sabah will run the Sabah Railways; Singapore will

run Singapore's gas works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than all these, there are only two items of

importance  reserved  for Singapore  which  are  not

found  in the List given to Borneo, namely, the  two

subjects of education and labour. Sir, let  us  look

at  these two items more closely. Let us first  talk

about  labour.  In Singapore we face  a  surplus  of

labour; in Borneo there is a shortage of labour. Due

to the labour shortage there and therefore the rates

of  wages  there  are high - it is believed  that  in

Sabah a hard-working lumberman can get from $500  to

$700 a month - there is hardly any labour problem.  It

is  the  same  even  in Sarawak. There  is  not  the

pressing  necessity for a Ministry of  Labour.  They

therefore do not need so-called autonomy in handling

their  own labour problem, because they hardly  have

any  labour problem. Their main concern is  to  keep

away  immigrants, and the Immigration Bill contained

in  the  Malaysia Act has given them  the  right  to

prohibit immigrants from entering Sabah and Sarawak,

especially   immigrants  of  second-class   Malaysia

citizens from Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fact that we are supposed to belong to

one country - Malaysia - the people in Singapore cannot

go  to  Borneo  to  get jobs or do business  freely.

Second-class  Malaysia citizens from  Singapore  are

required  to  apply  for internal travel  documents,

even  to  visit Sabah or Sarawak. Which country  has

such  an absurd phenomenum? In other words,  on  the

question  of so-called autonomy in labour, Singapore

does  not get more than what the Borneo States  get,

because the Borneo States do not require autonomy in

labour. What they require is an Immigration Act  and

they have got it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, let us look at education. Due to the fact

that the Borneo States have not been so developed in

many  respects compared to Singapore, and  education

is one of them, there is not the problem relating to

the  question  of education as exists in  Singapore.

However,  on  the question of the use  of  language,

Article 6 of the Malaysia Act guarantees the use  of

the  English  language for a minimum  period  of  10

years  and the protection of native languages,  laws

and  customs.  The so-called autonomy  in  education

given  to  Singapore does not, therefore, make  much

substantial  difference  in  the  quantum  of  State

rights   given  to  respective  territories  between

Singapore   and  the  Borneo  States.  I   therefore

conclude  that the respective State rights given  to

the  Borneo States and to Singapore, if they can  be

measured  in  quantum, are almost equal.  Yet  Sabah

with one quarter of Singapore's population, gets  16

seats  in the Central Parliament, which is one  seat

more than Singapore's 15 seats. Mr Speaker, Sir, is

this not a sell-out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, four fundamental sell-outs. First

citizenship   rights;  second,   the   question   of

representation  in  Parliament;  thirdly,  financial

powers;  and, fourthly, State rights. Singapore  has

to  contribute each year 40 per cent of the national

taxes  or  28  per cent of all revenue collected.  I

believe  at one time the P.A.P. Government  told  us

that it was 25 per cent. Now it has increased to  28

per  cent. In other words, for every dollar of  tax,

customs  duties, traffic fines on poor taxi-drivers,

or fines on hawkers, fees from hospitals, and school

fees - all types of revenue raised in Singapore under

the  sun  from  every  citizen of  Singapore,  every

dollar collected in Singapore, we have to pay to the

Federation a tribute of 28 cents, 28 per cent of the

total  revenue  collected, or 40  per  cent  of  the

national taxes. The amount of revenue contributed to

the  Federation will increase year by year,  because

under  the Financial Agreement the percentage  basis

has been used. Moreover, Singapore has to give about

$150  million loan, almost free of interest, to  the

Borneo States, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



will cost the Singapore Government about $50 million

to   raise  because  interest  has  to  be  paid  by

Singapore  on  the loan. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  have

computed  a  small table with the little information

and  the little time available to me because we have

only a few days to study these vital Constitutional

documents. I have computed that if we were  to  give

$100  million  free-interest loan to the  Federation

Government  - a $100 million 15-year loan,  starting

with  $20 million in 1964, $20 million in 1965,  and

$20  million in each subsequent year ending in  1968

- we  would  have to pay $48 million in  interest  to

those  persons  from  whom we have  to  borrow.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this is the greatest  cheat  of  the

P.A.P.  Government. The Singapore Government, before

they  went  to  London to sign the sell-out  treaty,

told  us  that the main fight was on the $50,000,000

gift  to  the  Borneo States. They  went  there  and

signed  this sell-out treaty. They gave more than  a

$100  million  contribution  as  a  tribute  to  the

Federation  Government each year. In addition,  they

are  giving  an interest-free 15-year loan  of  $100

million  with a proviso of reviewing the loan  after

five  years,  whether interest  should  be  paid  in

subsequent  years  or not; but  the  proviso  is  so

flexible, that it seems no interest will be paid  to

Singapore.  The  payment of  interest  to  Singapore

hinges  on Singapore's prosperity - Singapore  always

prospers,  even  without  Malaysia.  It  is  just  a

natural  process.  If we compare the  budget  of  10

years  ago  with the budget of today, Singapore  has

prospered  many times over. And, therefore,  because

of  that fact, it looks likely that the interest for

the  subsequent  live years will be  waived  to  the

Borneo  States.  Mr Speaker, Sir, working  on  that

basis.  I  have computed that the cost on the  loans

which  the  Singapore Government have to  raise  for

Borneo,  paying an average of six per cent  interest

on  a $100 million loan, comes to about $48 million.

And  if this includes the cost of raising the  loans

and  the  administrative expenses, which I  estimate

at,  say, $1 million or $2 million, it makes a grand

total of $50 million. It therefore comes to the same

thing.  A  face-saving  device  whereby  the  P.A.P.

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



can come back and deceive the people again. But, the

people will not be deceived. The people have no more

trust  and  no more faith in the P.A.P.  Government.

The  P.A.P.  Government tried to explain  this  huge

interest-free  loan by saying that half  the  labour

used for the loans would be obtained from Singapore.

Now,  the  Federation Government have  denied  today

that they have ever agreed to that condition. Let us

assume  that  the Federation Government has  agreed.

Could  the  P.A.P. Government work out in  terms  of

quantity  of  labour how much labour  Singapore  can

export to Sabah and Sarawak under this loan? If they

are  going to build two gas works or a gas works and

an  electrical station which will eat away the  $100

million,  I think they will not engage more  than  a

few tens of workmen. Why does the P.A.P. not use the

$150  million to develop Singapore whereby Singapore

will  not only benefit from its development but more

labourers  will  be employed, more  shops  will  get

business.  This  is  what  we  call  the  multiplier

theory.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the $150 million loan is used in the Borneo

States  and  even if they recruit some  labour  from

Singapore,  it will only engage 30, 50  or,  let  us

say, 500 of Singapore's labourers; take away 500  of

Singapore's  unemployed labourers at a cost  of  $50

million.  Those  are all the benefits  we  may  get.

There is no provision that they must get contractors

from   Singapore.  Can  the  labour  recruited  from

Singapore and working in Sabah ring up Singapore and

order  coffee  and  tea, or buy shirts  from  Change

Alley? No, Sir, but if these loans are being used in

Singapore  for  Singapore's  own  development,  then

normally one cent of development expenditure  should

create  three or four cents of money in circulation.

A  dollar investment creates $3 or $4 or $5 in money

circulation, because the workmen will be able to buy

things  from the shops; the shops get more business;

they   buy   things   from  the   wholesalers;   the

wholesalers will make more money and order things



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



from  overseas; the Harbour Board will be busy;  and

everybody  will be active. But we are  not  accorded

these benefits. We are being sold away. If Singapore

has  so much money, why borrow a few million dollars

from the World Bank at 5� per cent interest? And  we

must pay � per cent to the World Bank even if we  do

not  draw  out the money. We must pay  5�  per  cent

interest with all sorts of strings attached. We have

been  sold  out to the World Bank for a few  million

dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenses incurred on the Police, the Prisons

and  the  Armed  Forces in the Borneo States  would,

like   Singapore,  be  incurred   by   the   Federal

Government,  instead  we  understand  that  the  two

Borneo  States  will  receive substantial  financial

aid,  as  I have said, to the extent of $500 million

for  five  years. Singapore has entered into  a  bad

financial bargain. The P.A.P. has sold us  out.  The

difference between Singapore's contribution  to  the

Central Government, and the Borneo States' financial

assistance received from the Central Government  is,

in  my  calculation, estimated  at  more  than  $200

million  per year. We have to give to the Federation

Government more than $100 million a year. The Borneo

States  will receive from the Federation  Government

more  than  $100 million a year. It makes the  total

difference to be more than $200 million a year.  And

this $200 million a year is enough for Singapore  to

build  about  40,000 S.I.T. flats a  year  or  4,000

clinics  or 4,000 creches. Once Malaysia  is  pushed

through  and  the  new  Singapore  Constitution   is

allowed to work itself for a few months, the  people

of Singapore will then see for themselves the extent

of  this sell-out Malaysia Agreement being put  into

operation with all the disadvantages working against

the people of Singapore. We have so much to lose and

so little to gain from the Malaysia Agreement. It is

therefore  based on this belief that  I  assess  the

general  elections for the 51 seats to  be  held  in

September this year. The P.A.P. Government will  not

want the people of Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Before the end of this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, even if

they  want  to continue until March next year,  they

cannot  do so. After this sitting is adjourned  sine

die,  there will be many more Back-benchers quitting

the  Government because they know they will  not  be

nominated   as  candidates  for  the  next   general

elections.  Many of them will not be  nominated.  We

know  who  are the people who are not  going  to  be

nominated.  Even one or two Ministers  will  not  be

nominated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You stack your chips on the

Barisan?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the

time  comes, it will not be just one or two  persons

quitting  the Party. It will be just like the  waves

rolling out into the ocean, leaving only one or  two

persons  who  have the stamina to stand  alone.  The

P.A.P.  Government  will  not  want  the  people  of

Singapore to see the practical workings of  the  new

Constitution  because that will be  adverse  to  the

PAP.  Instead  of  reading only in  cold  print  the

P.A.P. sell-out  schemes, the people  of  Singapore

will  be  able  to see and feel for  themselves  how

Singapore   will   suffer  under   the   intolerable

conditions of the White Paper merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the so-called Common Market agreed to in principle may also work against Singapore because its terms are unfavourable to Singapore. We support the principle of a Common Market, but the terms contained in the Malaysia Agreement must be fair and just to both sides.

Pioneer  Certificates granted by Singapore  will  be

subject  to the approval of the Federation  Minister

for  Finance - the Annex to Annex J of  the  Malaysia

Agreement.  Sir, this is vital. In other words,  the

Federation Government will have the final say in the

industrialisation  of Singapore.  If  the  Singapore

Government  issues  a  Pioneer  Certificate  to   an

industry  which the Federation Government  wants  to

establish  in  Petaling Jaya or  Johore  Bahru,  the

Federation  Government,  by  virtue  of  this  power

granted  to it under the Malaysia Act, will be  able

to block



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



Singapore's industrialisation programme by rejecting

Singapore's approval of that pioneer certificate. In

other words, if the Federation Government decide  to

have  a  tyre factory in Petaling Jaya  and  not  in

Jurong,  it can refuse, it can veto such  a  pioneer

certificate granted by the Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Federation Government can make things

tough  for  the Singapore Government, as the  P.A.P.

has  also  surrendered  other  rights  relevant   to

industrialisation  and industrial promotion.  Orders

made  under  the Industrial Expansion  (Relief  from

Income  Tax)  Ordinance, 1959, will  be  subject  to

approval  by  the Federation Minister  for  Finance.

Sir,  the  Tariff Advisory Board, which will  be  in

charge of Common Market problems and which will make

all  the vital decisions, will be controlled by  the

Federation  Government  - Annex  J.  Because  of  the

unfavourable conditions, the people of Singapore may

have to suffer an increase in the cost of living due

to   customs   duties  being  imposed   to   protect

industries  in  Petaling Jaya or Johore  Bahru,  but

without  Singapore receiving any benefits.  Is  this

not another P.A.P. sell-out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malaysia Agreement is meant to sell out

the  interests  of  the people of Singapore  and  is

signed  by  the  minority P.A.P.  Government.  After

signing  the  Agreement, the P.A.P. Government  just

wants  this  Assembly  to  endorse  what  they  have

already  ratified  and agreed upon.  The  Opposition

Parties were not consulted before the Agreement  was

signed.  The  draft Constitution was  not  discussed

with the Opposition Parties as was the case with the 1958  Singapore  Constitution. Everything  is  being

pushed  down our throats. Can the P.A.P.  Government

accept  all  the consequences? Can it shoulder  this

tremendous responsibility? But. Sir, what can we  do

to  a political bankrupt who incurs more debts after

his   bankruptcy?  He  is  already  a  bankrupt  and

therefore he has nothing more to lose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I read under section 104 of the 1958 Singapore Constitution that even if we are to amend a clause in this temporary and transitional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>1958  Singapore  Constitution, we will  require  the

consent  of  a two-thirds majority of the  Singapore

Legislature. With this Malaysia Agreement  on  which

hinges   the  destiny  of  1.8  million  people   of

Singapore and the generations to come, should we not

also have a two-thirds majority? We demand that this

Malaysia  Agreement  requires a two-thirds  majority

and  if  it  is only passed by less than  that,  the

Malaysia Agreement must be repudiated. This Malaysia

Agreement should have the minimum of 34 votes out of

50.  We  have  now 50 votes in this  Assembly.  Two-thirds  out  of  50 is 34 and the P.A.P.  Government

must muster 34 votes in order to convince us and the

people  that  even this out-of-date Legislature  has

approved this sell-out document.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said at the beginning of my speech that

the  Malaysia Agreement must be looked at  from  two

aspects. Firstly, it is basically a sell-out treaty.

Secondly,  in  consideration of  its  sell-out,  the

P.A.P. has  managed  to wriggle  out  for  its  own

benefit  with built-in safeguards and provisions  to

help  the  P.A.P. in the future, if it has any  more

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to read the dreams of a Japanese military

man  - I have forgotten his name, but I think it  was

Tanaka  - who  submitted his  dreams  of  a  Japanese

Empire  to  the Japanese emperor many  decades  ago.

Under   his  notorious  plan,  he  hoped   that   by

conquering Manchuria, which would be used as a  base

against  China,  Japan  would  be  able  from  there

onwards to create a Japanese-sponsored Greater East-Asia  Co-prosperity Sphere. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

our  Singapore Tanaka, who is not only  the  planner

but  the  prima donna, who is not only the  plotter,

but  the actor, has ambitions, however vain and idle

we  may look at them, to follow the path of conquest

envisaged by Tanaka many decades ago. The idea of  a

Cuba   in   Singapore  was  born  in   the   fertile

imagination of the Prime Minister. I heard of it  as

early  as  1959.  He coined the  words  "a  Cuba  in

Singapore". Nobody else coined those words. It was a

good propaganda



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



line to frighten certain people and those people,  I

must say, swallowed it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the White Paper proposals were conceived,

the  P.A.P. was in the doldrums. Since  then,  many

thanks  to the Work Brigade, the P.A.P. planned  the

visits  to the rural constituencies. I believe,  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, that lately not only the  Work

Brigade  surrounded the Prime Minister but at  every

visit  he requires about 150 plainclothes detectives

- this is what I have heard - and many members of the

Singapore Infantry Regiment -



<br><br><!-- Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat (Siglap):</b> Gila!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Chaps fired crackers!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The Member for Siglap should not

interrupt because her name, I believe, will  not  be

in the next list of nominations for candidature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. leaders thought that

there  was some chance of staging a  come-back after all this fanfare.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.P.S.O., the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,

the possible cancellation  of

Opposition  Party  symbols on nomination  day,  were

thought  to  be sufficient to crush the  Opposition.

Since  they have been slowly building up  a  ray  of

hope, however  faint  it  looks  to  us   in   the

Opposition, the P.A.P. leaders have strong powers of

auto-suggestion;  a  way must be  prepared  for  the

conquest  of  Malaysia should  such  an  opportunity

arise,  and  such  an opportunity  should  never  be

missed.   Like  the  Japanese  venture  into   world

conquest  step  by step, so is the  P.A.P.'s  future

dream  of conquering Malaysia also step by step.  In

10  years'  or at the most 15 years' time  when  the

Tunku  retires from active politics, the  course  is

clear  for  a  P.A.P.  Prime  Minister.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  what  vain and childish  hopes!  They  are

nothing  but  a pipe-dream. The P.A.P. cannot  even

hope  to go as far as the Japanese did. They reached

the  Australian  coast and nearly conquered  Hawaii.

But  in  the  first  step of the P.A.P.'s  dream  of

conquest, which is contained -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> How far is yours?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> First, my dream is to knock out

the  P.A.P. In the first step of the P.A.P.'s  dream

of conquest, which is contained in Article 95 of the

Malaysia  Act,  the  P.A.P. was  defeated  in  this

Assembly  last  Thursday. Mr Deputy Speaker,  there

are  many hundreds of additional steps to go. In the

first  step, Article 95, which the P.A.P. Government

traded  for selling out the rights of the people,  a

special  exception was made to the P.A.P. Government

to   conduct  the  Federal  elections  under  P.A.P.

control. Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, even in the  first

step,  the P.A.P.'s dream was smashed. That  is  why

they have been so demoralised these few days -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Most cheerful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The Minister for Culture has

never been thinner in his life!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of additional steps to go.

Articles  95 and 96 with special provisions  written

into the Malaysia Act give the P.A.P. Government the

power to conduct elections to the Federal seats  and

delineate  boundaries according to their  own  wish,

avoiding the Federal Elections commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the undemocratic Federal Elections Bill under

Article  95 had been passed last week, I think,  Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, nomination day could have  been

held  on  Saturday, 17th August, 1963, and  after  a

second  sweep - if that is possible; that is, if  the

Internal  Security  Council  which  met  in  Cameron

Highlands  last week was prepared to be a  scapegoat

for  such  a  move - the Opposition Parties  could  be

paralysed for a few weeks from such a move. It would

be  likely  that the U.P.P., whose former symbol  of

three  rings,  and now changed to  that  of  a  key,

anticipating the P.A.P. move that it cannot be used -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Beck's beer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Very good. Beck's beer smashed

the  P.A.P. in  the  Hong Lim  by-election  with  a

majority win of nearly 5,000 -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This time, the wrong lock -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen)</b>: Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Polling Day, in my opinion, would

therefore  be  on  the  2nd  or  3rd  of  September,

immediately after the Malaysia celebrations with all

the  floats  and fanfare, the whole town going  wild

and  the  concerts of foreign artistes from overseas

will be at their zenith - all at public expense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. hopes to win, not by a clean and honest election, but by fraud and by rigging the election as they did in the referendum campaign, so that they can get a good number of seats. If such a situation arises, the general elections for the 51 seats will follow

immediately after the elections for the 15 seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe the electoral registers can be used two or three times. They do not need to revise them. They can use it today for one election, and they can use it tomorrow for another election. But in case the P.A.P. loses the elections for the 15 seats, in spite of all the

rigging,  then  there  is a  second  chance  because

transitional provisions have been built in Part  VII

of  the new Singapore Constitution. Clause 98 of the

Singapore   Constitution  will  allow   the   P.A.P.

Government  to  carry on until June  1964.  But,  of

course, this is now unlikely because we expect  some

P.A.P.  Back-benchers to quit and there will  be  no

meeting this year to approve the 1964 Budget. In the

meantime,  the  P.A.P. Government will  devise  some

scheme  to  retrieve the position.  However,  in  my

opinion, as I have said, the P.A.P. Government  will

not last that long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. hopes that Singapore will therefore

be  a  stepping  stone to getting greater  political

powers  in  Malaysia. All these  provisions  in  the

Malaysia Constitution and in the Malaysia Act and in

the   Singapore  Constitution  were  meant,  in   my

opinion, to fulfil this dream. For instance, Sir, in

Part II of the Fourth Schedule in the Malaysian  Act

enumerating State



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



rights for Singapore, they deliberately provide that

the  Singapore  Government could  have  powers  over

elections  to the State Assembly until August  1968.

So,   Mr   Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the   P.A.P.

Government  can rig the 15-seat election in  August,

they  will  be  able  to rig  and  win  the  51-seat

elections in September or October, thereby  becoming

the  State Government as well as having a number  of

seats  in  the Central Parliament. From there,  Sir,

half  the  battle is won to fulfil the  dream  of  a

P.A.P.  Prime Minister of Malaysia. As I have  said,

this is a false hope and an idle dream. Remember  in

the Hong Lim by-election, they were ready with their

fanfare  of  lion  and dragon dances  for  a  P.A.P.

victory  in Hong Lim. We all know that big money  is

now being used in Hong Lim -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the Member

for  Hong Lim that the Hong Lim by-election  is  not

the subject we are debating now? It is past. Can  we

come to the motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, another

proviso  which the P.A.P. is trying to  get  is  the

last-minute  request  for  the  right  of  detention

without  trial  under  the Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance. It is vital to the fulfilment

of their dream. Sometimes it is very handy to have a

law  which we can use to lock up political opponents

without  trial  and calling them gangsters,  because

the Government do not have to prove it in the courts

of  law.  Get  two  or  three  gangsters,  get  some

officials    from   the   State   Advocate-General's

Department  to  put a chop - the man  goes  in  under

section   55   of   the  Criminal   Law   (Temporary

Provisions)  Ordinance.  We  warn  all  those  civil

servants who play with the P.A.P. in these  acts  of

suppression of political opponents that the  day  of

retribution might not be too far away. Section 55 of

this  Ordinance is useful to nip in the bud aspiring

politicians or effective political opponents of  the

P.A.P. regime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, in Annex K to the Malaysian

Agreement,  concerning the agreement  on  Television

and Radio,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



it is vital when the P.A.P. decides to broadcast so-called  P.A.P. achievements in its  new  short-wave

frequency  radio  across  the  seas  to  the  Borneo

States,  spreading P.A.P. propaganda to  the  Borneo

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 95 of the new Singapore Constitution is

also  vital.  As  in the case of the 1958  Singapore

Constitution,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  should

remain  in  office for only six months after  a  new

government  is formed so that any future  government

will  decide,  subject to the Agong's approval,  who

will  be the next Yang di-Pertuan Negara during that

Party's period of office. We are afraid that section

95  will  want  to  avoid such a democratic  proviso

contained in the 1958 Singapore Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 99 of the Singapore Constitution concerns

the P.S.C. Both sections 95 and 99 are important, in

case  the  P.A.P. Government can win the next  State

Government.  Of course, we know they cannot.  But  I

must say that no future government has an obligation

to recognise every P.A.P. appointment. If the P.A.P.

appointments had been done on the sole criterion  of

merit,  then  I am sure any future Government  would

recognise   these   appointments.   But    if    the

appointments are not done on the basis of merit, but

were  done for some other purposes, then, Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, let it be put on record that no future

Government  has  got  the  necessity  to  meet  this

obligation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are only some of the provisions which the P.A.P. hope to save them from collapse and prop them up for future capture of power. Sir, they are only false hopes. The P.A.P. are finished. They should have resigned last Thursday, when the undemocratic Singapore (Elections

to  the  Federal House of Representatives) Bill  was

defeated, through which the P.A.P. hoped to rig  the

elections.  Sir,  the P.A.P.'s  days  are  numbered.

Today and tomorrow, we will hear the departing  swan

song  of the P.A.P. leaders. It is a pity, Sir, that

the  future Chamber will be a place less interesting

than  now,  without the P.A.P. leaders.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I am very sorry that in  the  future

sittings of this Assembly, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



will  not  have the P.A.P. leaders, and we will  not

have the pleasure to come and debate with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You miss us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we will

see  them at C.P.A. functions where we will meet ex-Assemblymen.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I just wish

to  reply  to certain points made by the Member  for

Farrer  Park relating to the Singapore Constitution.

My  colleague, the Minister for Finance, will answer

all  the  other questions which have been raised  on

matters of finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to make it quite clear that in

the  House  of  Commons, the Malaysia Act  that  was

introduced  and  accepted by the  House  of  Commons

referred  only  to  Article  IV  of  the  Heads   of

Agreement relating to Malaysia. Article IV states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of the United Kingdom will take

such  steps  as may be appropriate and available  to

them to secure the enactment by the Parliament...'



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What page is it? Let us follow

it carefully.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The page here is page 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... providing for the relinquishment, as from

Malaysia Day, of Her Britannic Majesty's sovereignty

and jurisdiction in respect of North Borneo, Sarawak

and Singapore...'.



<br><br>This  acceptance  by the House of  Commons  that  on

Malaysia  day  British jurisdiction  over  Singapore

will  cease is the essence of the Malaysia Act which

was  passed in the House of Commons. The rest of the

Blue  Book  which was mentioned by  the  Member  for

Farrer Park was only a document tabled in the House,

but it was not subject to debate at all. Neither did

it  have to go through three Readings. I have now  a

copy of the Blue Book. It did not say either that it

is a Command Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to Article 69 of the Malaysia Bill and

Article 90 of the Singapore Constitution relating to

amendments to the Singapore Constitution. Article 69

in   the  Malaysia  Bill,  at  page  47,  refers  to

safeguards   for  the  constitutional  position   of

Singapore. Article 69 (1)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No amendment shall be made to the Constitution

without the concurrence of the Governor...'.



<br><br>The   Constitution  here  refers  to   the   Federal

Constitution. In other words, the Federal Parliament

cannot change the Singapore Constitution without the

concurrence of the Singapore Government. The purpose

of  this Article 69 is to protect certain rights  as

embodied in the Singapore Constitution. You will see

that  a  similar clause refers to the constitutional

position  of the Borneo States. This is  in  Article

66, at page 45, of the Malaysia Bill. Article 66 (2)

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No amendment shall be made to the Constitution [in

this   case   again  it  refers   to   the   Federal

Constitution]   without  the  concurrence   of   the

Governor  of the Borneo State or each of the  Borneo

States concerned,...'.



<br><br>In  other words, the Federal Parliament cannot amend

either    the   Singapore   Constitution   or    the

Constitution of Sabah or the Constitution of Sarawak

without  the approval of the Governments  of  Sabah,

Sarawak or Singapore. That is the meaning of Article

69.  Therefore.  Article 69  does  not  in  any  way

conflict   with   Article  90   of   the   Singapore

Constitution  where  it  is  stipulated   that   any

alterations  to  the  Singapore  Constitution  would

require a two-thirds majority of the Legislature.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister was

reading  clause 69, on page 47. Did he  mention  the

"Government" or the "Governor"? I just want  to  get

it  clear. He was saying "Government", but  it  says

here "Governor".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order.

It is a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Member for Queenstown should

really  know  the  constitutional  position  if   he

aspires  to  be  a parliamentarian.  "Governor",  of

course,  in our particular case, will refer  to  the

Yang   di-Pertuan  Negara,  and  the  constitutional

position  indicates that the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

cannot  take  any action without the advice  of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 32 (b) of the Singapore Constitution,

referring to the tenure of office of Members of  the

House,  and  a point on which the Opposition  is  in

some  doubt, says that if a person ceases  to  be  a

Member  of a Party upon whose platform he  has  been

elected  to  this Legislature, he should immediately

cease  to be a Member of the Legislature. Of course,

it  rubs  the  corns  of  certain  Members  in  this

Assembly. Let us take the 14 Members of the  Barisan

Sosialis.  They came into this House on  the  P.A.P.

ticket, and if they have had any decency, they would

have   resigned   and   contested   on   their   own

personalities  and on their own personal  qualities.

They  left  or  they crossed the House after  having

signed  a  document stating that if for  any  reason

they  should cease to be Members of the  Party  they

would  leave  the Assembly. But they  did  not  keep

their  word in that written document. At  least  the

Member for Hong Lim had the courage to seek a  fresh

mandate and he won the by-election. We give him  his

due.  But the 14 Barisan Sosialis Members are  quite

despicable. They are now sitting in this House under

false pretences.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What does he mean by

"despicable"? We object to a word like that.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Member has taken objection

to  the word. Since the hon. Member has objected  to

it,   I  think  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  should

withdraw it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Since he objects to the word

"despicable", can I say contemptible?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Does he mean to insult a Member

of the House?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I do not think the Deputy Prime

Minister  is  insulting  any  hon.  Member  in  this

Assembly.  If that is so, naturally the  Chair  will

call him to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Has he withdrawn it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not

propose  using  unparliamentary  language  in   this

House.  I  do  not believe the Speaker has  ever  in

these    years    ruled   that   "despicable"    and

"contemptible" are unparliamentary words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me continue with Article 32 (b). I am

sorry for the Member for Anson that he finds himself

in  this position. He won the Anson by-election  but

he  has  lost his Party. So the question  is,  where

does he stand? However, the Member for Anson and the 14  Members  from  the  Barisan  Sosialis  need  not

particularly  worry  at time  moment  because  their

seats  in this present Assembly are secured  by  the

temporary and transitional provisions of Article 96.

Article 96 of the transitional provisions - it  is  a

transitional provision - states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) The Legislative Assembly established by the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order  in  Council,  1958,

[meaning  this Assembly] shall remain in  being  and

shall  be  deemed  to  be the  Legislative  Assembly

established by this Constitution, and accordingly -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the persons who immediately before the coming

into  operation of this Constitution hold  the

offices  of  Speaker  and  Deputy  Speaker  or

Members of the Legislative Assembly shall,  on

the    coming   into   operation    of    this

Constitution,  continue to hold those  offices

or  their seats as Members in accordance  with

the provisions of this Constitution;'.



<br><br>So  there is really no contradiction at all  between

Article  32 (b)  and Article 96. Until this  Assembly

is dissolved, everyone who is still a Member of this

Assembly remains a Member. I hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



this  will  meet the objection raised by the  Member

for Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in reference to Article 33 of the

Singapore Constitution which refers to by-elections,

our   intention  is  that  this  should  follow  the

existing  law relating to the Singapore  Legislative

Assembly    Elections.   Whether    the    Singapore

Constitution  will  be adopted  by  this  motion  or

whatever  amendments made to this Constitution  will

be  forwarded to the United Kingdom Government,  and

subsequently   by   an  Order   in   Council,   this

Constitution will be given the force of law. Tonight

we  are debating solely on the merits of this  draft

Constitution. Even if this Assembly should adopt  or

change  this  draft Constitution, by virtue  of  the

fact that it has been through this Assembly, it does

not  give  itself the force of law.  It  has  to  be

submitted,  with  any  amendments,  to  the   United

Kingdom Government which will then make an Order  in

Council  after  which the Constitution  will  become

law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysia Bill itself is not debated here in

this  Chamber.  It will be debated  in  the  Federal

Parliament.  If the Federal Parliament approves  the

Malaysia Bill, then the clauses as contained in  the

Malaysia Bill will become law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said, I hope, will meet the objections

which the Member for Farrer Park has raised. I would

not  want to deal with the other points which  other

Members   have  put  forward,  but  my   colleagues,

particularly the Minister for Finance,  will  handle

all  the  questions which have been  raised  on  the

Common Market, the Borneo loan, and so on.



<br><br>8.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this may

well  be the last sitting of this Assembly. For many

on  the Opposition Benches, this will positively  be

their  last  appearance. From today until  Thursday,

they will be accorded the privilege which I am told,

Sir, is given to every condemned man before he walks

his last mile. He is allowed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



to  have  his last cigarette before he  is  shot  at

dawn.  But  here, Sir, we are a democratic  Assembly

and   we   therefore   allow   Opposition   Members,

especially  the Member for Queenstown, to  make  his

last speech starting from 8.00 or 8.30 last night -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> No. Six-thirty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Six-thirty till late this

afternoon; lest it be said that we have silenced him

forever too soon.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You cannot do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> For the Barisan Sosialis

confrontationists in particular, this  sitting  will

mark the end of their term of political life and the

beginning of a long term of a different kind.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Gaol, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The countdown has already begun

-there  are  only 30 days (yesterday there  were  31

days)  before Malaysia. When the Malaysia sun  rises

on 31st August -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It will be the P.A.P. downfall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - the red star of the Barisan

Sosialis will surely set.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate, Sir, that the last sittings of

this  Assembly should be in the month of July  -that

July should see the culmination and the victory of a

battle  begun in this Assembly. It was  exactly  two

years  ago  this  month, 20th July, 1961,  that  the

battle  for merger and Malaysia was started in  this

Chamber   between  the  pro-Communist  anti-Malaysia

forces   on   the  one  hand  and  the  pro-Malaysia

nationalist forces on the other. It began,  Sir,  if

you will recollect, with the Prime Minister moving a

one-sentence motion which read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House expresses its confidence in the

Government.'.



<br><br>Nine  simple words which set in train a sequence  of

events  which  today  culminates  in  this  200-word

motion  by  the  Prime  Minister,  proclaiming   the

victory of the pro-Malaysia nationalist forces  over

the anti-national confrontationists -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Pro-imperialists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - in the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago when the Prime Minister moved his

motion  of confidence, the Communists in the Barisan

Sosialis  were  besides  themselves  with  joy  that

through their last-minute treachery they had brought

about  the  defeat of their own Party and their  own

colleagues in the by-election at Anson. That was two

years  ago.  The  fruit of their  treachery  was  an

exultant Member for Anson who, if you will remember,

Sir,  reappeared  in  this Chamber  with  shouts  of

"Merdeka". He did not know then that he  was  but  a

political  flea in the Barisan fur. He  was  brought

into   this  Chamber  by  his  hosts,  the   Barisan

Sosialis. Now that his hosts are about to  die,  the

flea  in the Barisan fur must either find a new host

or face slow starvation himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, thanks to the treachery of the

Barisan  Sosialis and their Communist  mentors,  the

Government, it is true, was in a difficult position.

Had  it  been weak, had it lacked moral courage,  it

could  have compromised with the pro-Communist anti-merger  elements, and carried on with a  comfortable

majority. If, as the Barisan Sosialis claim  and  as

the  S.P.A. claim today, the P.A.P. were interested

only  in  clinging  to power, the  easiest  and  the

simplest  thing to do would have been to  play  ball

with the anti-national and anti-merger elements  and

so  assured ourselves of a comfortable majority. But

the price we would have to pay would be betrayal  of

merger  and  the espousal eventually of an  isolated

Singapore.  That  was  a price  which  we  were  not

prepared  to  pay,  even to assure  ourselves  of  a

comfortable  majority. Though  our  ranks  had  been

depleted  by the treachery and betrayal, we  decided

on  20th  July, 1961, to hit back at the  Communists

- not  because  they were Communists but  because  we

believed  that  the Communists were  out  to  betray

merger  and  Malaysia. Instead of  being  cowed  and

demoralised  by our defeat at Anson, we  decided  on

20th July, 1961, to take on the Communists and those

who  had  been  mesmerised by the myth of  Communist

invincibility,  as some of those who  deserted  from

our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



Party  to join the Barisan Sosialis Communist  ranks

were, that the non-Communist, democratic Left is not

a  feeble, stupid and bankrupt political force. That

is what we wanted to prove.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is not a force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have got

photographs  here  which  will  show  who   is   the

political  force. But I will come to that  later.  I

will  keep  the little treat for them later  on.  We

want  to  show  how  enfeebled  and  despicable  the

Barisan Sosialis have become. They were laughed  out

in  every  constituency to which the Prime  Minister

went,  where they tried to heckle him. But  I  shall

come  forward  with evidence of photographs  showing

little girls, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Wayang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - who have not yet cut their milk

teeth -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I am

sorry  I have to interrupt the Minister for Culture.

I  think  so  far  his prelude and preamble  to  his

speech  have met the points which Opposition Members

have  raised. If he can now just concentrate on  the

motion and the amendment, it will be better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> With due respect, this motion deals

with  the  battle for merger, and it  is  necessary,

Sir,  to  show  why  the Member for  Queenstown  has

brought in such an amendment, and to show that  this

is  the culmination of a battle begun two years  ago

in this Assembly - the battle for merger and Malaysia

- and  that this motion by the Prime Minister  is  an

epitaph   which  should  be  put  over  the  Barisan

Sosialis grave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to show the Communists that once they

started opposing merger and Malaysia to which  their

Party  was  committed - merger was  the  platform  on

which they were elected, merger was the platform  on

which every P.A.P. Assemblyman was elected - that once

they  decided to oppose this essential plan  in  the

Government's programme, the fight was  on.  Sir,  we

wanted to show the Communists and their performing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



fleas  that  lived off them that the  non-Communist,

democratic  Left  can compete and  win  against  the

Communists in the battle for the hearts and minds of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Singapore had been chosen by the

Communists  as  their  Yenan for  the  extension  of

Communist   power   throughout  Malaysia.   If   the

Communists   were   contained   and   paralysed   in

Singapore, then their auxiliaries in the rest of the

Malaysian   territories  would  also  be   weakened.

Therefore,  Sir, the Communists on 20th July,  1961,

miscalculated when they thought that we  would  take

their  betrayal lying down. They thought that  after

our  defeat  in Hong Lim and at Anson, we  the  non-Communist  Left  would be too  demoralised  and  too

frightened to fight back, is I have said, Sir,  they

under-estimated the resilience of the  non-Communist

Left.   Far   from  running  away  and  hiding,   we

reconvened  the  Assembly on 20th  July,  1961,  and

brought  in this nine-ward motion of confidence.  It

was the Communists who were taken aback by this show

of  fight. If you will recollect, those who are  now

in  the Barisan Sosialis, especially the Member  for

Nee  Soon, was pleading with the Government  not  to

proceed  with this motion of confidence.  They  were

not  yet  quite ready for a showdown with  the  non-Communist  Left. They were hoping still to  stay  in

the  Government  and in the Party in  an  effort  to

capture them both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, despite their pleas not to

proceed  with the motion of confidence, we  insisted

on  a  vote being taken on the motion of confidence.

What   happened,   Sir?  - the  first   defeat,   the

Communists  abstained! They were forced out  of  the

Party   and  the  Government  to  form  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  That  was how the battle for  merger  was

started in this Assembly two years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From then on, Sir, it was a relentless battle

between  the  Communists  and  the  democratic  non-Communist  Left. The issue was merger and  Malaysia.

Today  looking back, the more intelligent Communists

realise  that  the major blunder they  made  was  in

making merger and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia  the  issue on which to try their  strength

with  the  non-Communist Left. That was their  first

major blunder - first betrayal - and secondly, testing

their  strength with the non-Communist Left  on  the

issue of merger and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had they been more intelligent, had they not

allowed  their thinking to be distorted by infantile

slogans,  they could have slowed down  the  pace  of

merger  and Malaysia not by resisting merger but  by

enthusiastically coming out in support of merger and

Malaysia. We, for our own part, had conic to the conclusion   that   for  a  variety  of   reasons   the

Communists, though theoretically supporting  merger,

in fact, were not in favour of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But many of the Federation leaders had been

inclined  to  view  merger as a  necessary  part  of

Communist  strategy to take over Singapore  and  the

Federation.   That   is   why   Federation   leaders

repeatedly said that there would be no merger within

the  foreseeable future, because they believed  that

merger  was  a  Communist threat to  take  over  the

Federation. Though we believed otherwise,  we  could

not  hope  to  convince the Federation leaders  that

merger  was  not, in fact, in the interests  of  the

Communists, it was not part of their strategy.  They

had  decided on some other strategy. Therefore, Sir,

the  only  people who could convince the  Federation

leaders of the correctness of our analysis were  the

Communists themselves - the Barisan Sosialis. And that

is  what the Communists and the Barisan Sosialis did

for  us.  They  helped  to convince  the  Federation

leaders  that  merger  was not a  Communist  threat.

Remember,  Sir, when the Tunku first  announced  his

proposal  for  merger and Malaysia,  the  Communists

obliged  by  openly  coming  out  in  opposition  to

merger.  They  further obliged us  by  carrying  the

opposition  to merger and Malaysia by betraying  the

P.A.P. candidate in favour of the Member for  Anson

who was opposed to merger and who was a long time an

advocate  of  an  independent  Singapore  under  the

protection  of the United Nations. In  other  words,

Sir,  not  only  were the Barisan Sosialis  able  to

convince the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



leaders, but the Communists also provided proof that

they  were opposed to merger, not only verbally  but

they  were also prepared to go to any extent to halt

merger.  Therefore, Sir, by their  betrayal  of  the

P.A.P. candidate  - it  is  ironical,  Sir,  poetic

justice - the Communists provided convincing proof of

our  thesis  that  they were, in  fact,  opposed  to

merger  and  that  merger  was  not  a  plan  for  a

Communist  take-over. Therefore, the more  violently

the  Communists  fought merger, the more  enthusiasm

was generated in the Federation for merger. The more

they  shouted, "No merger," the more the  Federation

leaders  were convinced that if merger was not  good

for   the  Communists,  it  must  be  good  for  the

Federation. In other words, Sir, without wanting to,

but  by their own stupidity, the Communists and  the

Barisan Sosialis accelerated the pace of merger  and

Malaysia.  They  became the unwitting  catalysts  of

merger and Malaysia. And so, Sir, we have planned to

give Malaysia Medals on 31st August. [Laughter]  And

we  are printing a special Medal out of tin for  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  At  least  without  wanting  to,

without  knowing  it, they also contributed  towards

the realisation of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know when the Communists will come to

write   their  history  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis'

contribution to the Communist cause, but I am  quite

sure, Sir, that the bones of the Barisan will be dug

up and re-buried elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this was only one of the many blunders they

made during the course of the battle for merger  and

Malaysia. They blundered, Sir, not because they  are

intrinsically  stupid  but  because  they  made  the

initial  mistake of opposing what was  "historically

inevitable".  This is a phrase which all  Communists

constantly  use.  Fortunately for  us,  the  Barisan

Sosialis tried very hard to be good Communists,  but

they   are   the   biggest  fumblers  of   Communist

techniques and blunderers on behalf of the Communist

cause  in  Singapore and in Malaya.  They  blundered

because   they   opposed   what   was   historically

inevitable.  We told them so during  the  debate  on

20th  July,  1961.  We warned  them  that  they  had

embarked on a course of action which would land  the

Communists and the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis Assemblymen in disaster. At that time, they

were  confident.  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong  was  still

running  around;  Mr  James Puthucheary  was  still

running  around.  At  that time,  they  laughed  and

cheered.  They  said,  "No," and  that  we  will  be

buried.  Sir,  today this 200-word motion  that  the

Prime  Minister has moved will, as I said,  Sir,  be

the  epitaph that will preface the impending  demise

of  the Barisan Sosialis. Two years ago, many of the

Barisan Sosialis Members opposite, mesmerised by the

myth of Communist invincibility, deserted the P.A.P.

for  the Communist camp, because they never for  one

moment  believed that the non-Communist  Left  would

have the stamina, the courage or the intelligence to

outwit  and circumscribe the Communists,  and  bring

the  battle  for merger and Malaysia to a victorious

conclusion.  They  saw, on the other  hand,  in  the

Malayan Communist Party a movement built and  forged

over  a  period of 30 years or more. They saw behind

it   the   resources,  experience  and  organisation

accumulated  over  many  decades.  As  against   the

M.C.P., therefore, they saw what they believed to be

a  young non-Communist Left-wing movement whose only

virtue  was that their supporters firmly believe  in

their non-Communism, in merger and Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed

to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I was saying

earlier,   the   battle  for  merger  and   Malaysia

commenced in this Chamber when the Barisan  Sosialis

Members  left us in the belief that by joining  with

the Communists in opposing Malaysia and merger, they

were  on  the winning side. They believed  that  the

young non-Communist Left-wing movement could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



not  take on a powerful experienced M.C.P. with  30

years  of  experience,  organisation  and  resources

behind  it.  The  Communists,  by  intimidation,  by

pressure  of  all  kinds, and by  carefully  staging

demonstrations  and  mass  support, convinced   the

Barisan  Sosialis Members opposite  that  they  were

riding on the wave of the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, two years after the commencement of the

battle  for  merger and Malaysia,  we  of  the  non-Communist Left managed to shatter the illusion  that

the  Communists have the masses behind them  in  the

battle for merger and Malaysia. It took a long  time

to  convince  the Barisan Sosialis confrontationists

that,  in  embarking upon this dangerous  course  of

opposing what was historically inevitable, they were

in  grave  peril  of  being disowned  by  their  own

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referendum was the first occasion which exposed

the  Communist lie that they have the masses  behind

them  in the battle against merger and Malaysia.  Of

course,  the  Barisan Sosialis  are  now  trying  to

explain  away  their  defeat at  the  referendum  by

claiming  that the referendum was rigged.  In  fact,

the Member for Queenstown spent the best part of the

evening  trying  to show that the referendum  proved

nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Member for Queenstown, and since the

Member  for Thomson seems to echo the voice  of  his

boss,  or  rather their second-rate script  writers,

why, if the Member for Queenstown believed that  the

referendum  was rigged and he had evidence,  did  he

not  take  steps  to challenge the  verdict  of  the

referendum in the courts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, why, if the referendum was rigged, did Mr

Lim  Ching Siong, just before the counting began  at

the  Badminton Hall, tell the newspapers that he was

pretty  confident  that the  vast  majority  of  the

people  would cast blank votes? If he believed  that

the  referendum  was rigged why  did  he  make  this

prediction that the blank votes would out-number the

votes for merger and Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, if the Communists believed that the

referendum was rigged, why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



then  did  their  cohort of school boys  and  school

girls gather outside the Badminton Hall with banners

and   fire-crackers  to  celebrate  the  anticipated

victory  of the anti-Malaysia forces over  the  pro-Malaysia   forces?   Why,  if  they   believed   the

referendum  was  rigged, did they  go  to  all  this

trouble?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, why, if the referendum was rigged, did they,

just  before the counting began, spend so much  time

examining   the  sealed  ballot  boxes  to   satisfy

themselves  that  there  was  nothing  improper  and

irregular about the referendum procedure?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, why, if the referendum was rigged, did they

spend  hours watching the Count without raising  any

objection that there was anything irregular?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, why, if they believed that the referendum

was  rigged,  did  the  Barisan Sosialis  watchdogs,

together  with  their legal adviser present  at  the

Badminton  Hall, when it became obvious  that  their

cause  had suffered a decisive defeat, quitely  call

it  a  day  and  go to sleep on the  empty  counting

tables?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, Sir, if they believed that the referendum was

rigged,  did they not spend time protesting?  Again,

why,  after  the  results were  announced,  did  the

Member  for  Queenstown and  his  friends  demand  a

recount?   Surely,  if  the  Member  for  Queenstown

believed  that  the referendum had been  rigged,  he

would  not  have  asked for a  recount  of  what  he

claimed to be a rigged referendum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I quote one authority as to the honesty of the

referendum,  which  I  know  the  Barisan   Sosialis

confrontationists dared not contradict? Because even

in Indonesia the referendum results in Singapore had

never  been  questioned. A number of  its  spokesmen

have  conceded, whatever may be the case  elsewhere,

that  the  referendum in Singapore  has  shown  that

there is popular support in Singapore for merger and

Malaysia.  [Interruption] The Barisan Sosialis,  for

obvious  reasons, cannot contradict this  authority.

Recently  while  I was having my dinner,  a  Barisan

Sosialis Member came to me and I said, "I hear  over

the  radio that the talks in Manila have had a happy

outcome." He was most agitated and said, "I must  go

and tell this to my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



colleagues." That is why I say that is one authority

they cannot contradict. No heckling, Sir, no

protest. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know why the Minister

for Culture invites heckling. There should be no

heckling in this Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This is one occasion when lack of

heckling proves something.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Heckling is completely out of order in

this  Chamber. Members have been guilty of  heckling

and they have been completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Perhaps, Sir, the best evidence of

all  is that the referendum accurately reflected the

wishes  of  the  people of Singapore on  merger  and

Malaysia  with  the utter contempt and  dislike  the

people  have  for the Barisan Sosialis today.  Every

time the Communists describe merger and Malaysia  as

a  sell-out, as the Member for Queenstown  did  for

the  best part of one evening and one afternoon, and

the  referendum  as  phoney, they  only  succeed  in

helping to consolidate the 72 per cent of the people

who  voted  for the White Paper. These 72  per  cent

know  that they voted for the White Paper, why  they

voted  for the White Paper, and that they voted  for

it  freely, without compulsion, without any rigging,

because they were satisfied with its terms.  So  the

Member  for Queenstown can keep on saying  that  the

referendum is phoney, the referendum is rigged,  the

referendum  is dishonest, but the 72  per  cent  who

went  to put their crosses on the ballot papers  for

Alternative A know what they did, why they did;  and

every time the Member for Queenstown and the Barisan

Sosialis keep on trying to put forward this  slogan,

they are helping to consolidate the 72 per cent. For

that, we thank them for helping us in the battle for

merger  and  Malaysia. These 72 per cent  knew  that

every   time  the  Communists  talked  about  phoney

merger,   phoney   referendum  they   were   telling

falsehoods.  Seventy-two  per  cent  of  the  people

became   convinced   that   the   Barisan   Sosialis

Communists   are  capable  of  uttering  falsehoods,

because  they  know they voted, why they  voted;  so

when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



Barisan Sosialis leaders talked about falsehoods and

phoney  merger, they said, "These people are capable

of telling falsehoods."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Hong Bee is another authority they dared not question.





<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Who is he?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Lim Hong Bee, who is the

spokesman  of the Malayan Communist Party in  London

was  quite  right  when just before  the  referendum

campaign  began, he castigated the Barisan  Sosialis

leaders  as  feeble  wobblers in his  magazine,  The

Malayan  Monitor. He castigated them  bitterly,  for

which  there  was no reply, no come-back,  from  the

Barisan  Sosialis. He castigated them  bitterly  for

having  fallen into what he called a political  trap

by  the decision to campaign for blank votes with  a

long virulent editorial against the Barisan Sosialis

for  having  fallen into a political trap  by  their

decision  to  campaign for blank votes, because  - he

did  not  say so but it was quite clear, if we  read

between  the lines - by this blunder on the  part  of

the Barisan Sosialis and their advisers, the Malayan

Communist movement, or the Malayan Communists,  were

for  the  first  time  put in a position  where  the

carefully  prefabricated  myth  that  they  had  the

masses  behind them could be effectively  challenged

and  destroyed  in  a straight constitutional  fight

between the democratic non-Communist forces and  the

pro-Communists. The Communists had never, ever,  put

themselves  in  a  position where they  had  to  try

constitutional  strength between the  Communist  and

non-Communist forces. They have either fought for it

on a united front basis or on some basis kept out of

elections  altogether. But this was the first  time,

thanks  to  the  blunder  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis

leaders,  that the Communists were put in a position

of  having  to  try its strength in a constitutional

fight between the non-Communist forces and the  pro-Communists.  The  Communists had been  trapped  into

campaigning  for blank votes because  they  believed

that   the   blank  votes  would  not   be   counted

separately.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think even the Member for Hong Lim - he is a

little   bit  shrewder  than  the  Barisan  Sosialis

leaders   - also  thought  that  they  had  possibly,

including  himself, fallen into a trap, because  the

blank  votes  would  show the  extent  of  Communist

influence, and votes for the White Paper would  show

the extent of non-Communist influence in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blank votes were, in fact, counted separately,

and  less than 25 per cent of the electors - and that

predominantly   in  the  rural   areas   - could   be

influenced  by the Communists as at September  1962.

It   is  very  important,  Sir.  On  that  day,  the

Statistics  showed  the  organised  might   of   the

Communists  and  showed a few opportunist  like  the

Member for Hong Lim and the Member for Anson that at

the  most  they could mobilise or influence  25  per

cent of the electors, and that, again, predominantly

in  the  rural areas where what they call the P.A.P.

radio  and  P.A.P. television could  not  reach  the

masses.  That  is  an  omission which  was  speedily

rectified. But as at September 1962, throughout  the

whole  of  Singapore,  the  Communists  could   only

mislead 25 per cent of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, the myth of Communist mass

influence  has been effectively destroyed.  For  the

first  time  the people of Singapore  realised  with

relief  and  joy  that  the  Communist  movement  in

Singapore,  the so-called citadel of  the  Communist

movement  in  Malaysia, the Yennan of  Malaysia  was

after all a giant with feet of clay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1947, the Communists, with clever

organisational technique, such as carefully arranged

and  disciplined mass meetings of 30,000 and  40,000

people, the manipulation of unions by staging  riots

and  engineering violence between police and  school

children,  the Communists had built up an  image  of

irresistible   strength  and  unchallengeable   mass

influence. This image helped the Communists  to  cow

and  neutralise large numbers of people  who  feared

them,  who  feared  their  strength  and  who   were

therefore  not  prepared to show their  disagreement

with   Communist  policies.  Therefore,   when   the

Communists  began  the  battle  against  merger  and

Malaysia,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



they  hoped  to  capitalise on  this  image  of  the

invincible,  powerful,  and  irresistible  Communist

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the referendum became, thanks to the stupidity

of  the Karl Marxists and Change Alley Lenins in the

Barisan  Sosialis,  a  straight  trial  of  strength

between  the  Communists  and  the  democratic  non-Communists. We broke the spell, for the first  time,

of    Communist   invincibility   and   irresistible

influence in Singapore. We are proud that we of  the

non-Communist  Left who, two years  ago,  when  they

deserted us, were in a difficult situation, who have

been  reviled  by  the Barisan Sosialis  as  feeble,

vacillating  and purposeless social democrats,  have

helped    to   break   the   Communist   spell    of

invincibility.   If  for  no  other   reason,   Sir,

whatever happens to us, we shall be satisfied  that

we  in the P.A.P. have been able for the first  time

in  30 years to break the myth, the humbug that  the

Communists are invincible. This achievement of  ours

is something to contribute to the cause of democracy

in  Singapore. For nothing else, even if our  houses

and  factories are discounted, this one  achievement

of  ours,  that after 30 years we have proved  in  a

straight  constitutional fight  that  the  Communist

myth  of  invincibility is hollow, empty, a lie,  is

something.  And  as a result of the  referendum,  we

have  freed the people of Singapore from their  fear

of  the  Communists. It was fear, intimidation,  the

belief  that if you oppose the Communists they  will

come back to power and settle scores with you. And I

have  some photographs here which I will show  later

on  which will show that for the first time  we  had

the   people  of  Singapore  laughing,  jeering  and

cheering  at the Communists. That is what  happened,

Sir.  But  that  is a thing which I  shall  come  to

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Better have your head examined!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, my head at least will always

be  where it is even if it is examined, but lots  of

gentlemen will be minus their little craniums  after

31st August. [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have helped to instil in the people of Singapore

a  new confidence and a new hope through the success

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



battle   for   merger  and  Malaysia   against   the

opposition of the Communists. We have convinced  the

people  that  if the non-Communist majority  of  the

people  are  united, they can defeat the  Communists

and  their brainless stooges any time, anywhere.  At

least  that is the little contribution we have  made

to  the cause of democracy, to the cause of national

solidarity in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, the Change Alley Lenins in the

Barisan  Sosialis realise today that the  referendum

was  the  beginning of the end for them.  They  know

that  the referendum was their death sentence.  That

is  why  - they cannot explain it away - they have  to

keep  on repeating the falsehood that the referendum

was rigged, that it was not a true indication of the

people's wishes. They are doing this not in order to

win  over  the  72 per cent who have refused  to  be

influenced by them. That is not their purpose.  They

know  that.  They are repeating this falsehood  that

the  referendum was rigged in order to retain  their

wavering hold over the 25 per cent whom they  misled

into  casting blank votes. That is the purpose,  not

because  of winning over the 72 per cent. They  know

they  have  lost. They can never win them over.  But

now  they have to preserve the 25 per cent whom they

have  misled. It is no longer a question, as far  as

the    Barisan   Sosialis   confrontationists    are

concerned,  of  their winning more converts  but  of

holding  on  to the little they have.  That  is  the

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, therefore, Sir, after the referendum, even if

the  Barisan  Sosialis Back-benches do not  know  it

today,  but  the  people who  do  a  little  bit  of

thinking in the Barisan Sosialis knew that after the

September  referendum,  the battle  for  merger  and

Malaysia  took on a new phase. It was now  a  battle

between  the  Communists and the non-Communist  Left

for  the  hearts and minds of the 25 per cent.  That

was  the battle, not for the 72 per cent but for the

25  per cent. So long as the 72 per cent of the non-Communist votes remain united and not split by  non-Communist adventurers in search of loot and prey, we

in the P.A.P. are convinced that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



can detach a substantial part of the 25 per cent the

Communists  deluded,  and we  can  do  this  not  by

bullets, unless, of course, the Communists and their

stooges in the Barisan Sosialis in their desperation

take  to  sticks, stones, broken bottles  and  hand-grenades.  If they do not do that, we can  win  over

- not  by bullets but by ballots - a substantial  part

of  the 25 per cent, detach the 25 per cent from the

Communists     and     the     Barisan      Sosialis

confrontationists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, that the tin-pot Lenins in

the  Barisan Sosialis are not as perky as they  were

two  years ago when, following the betrayal of their

own  Party at Anson, they triumphantly led into this

Chamber  the  Member for Anson. For two years,  they

prophesied  disaster for us if we persisted  in  our

battle for merger and Malaysia. "The day will come,"

they  said,  "when the masses will  be  chasing  the

P.A.P. leaders down the street." Then there came the

day  when  the Member for Nee Soon came clean-shaven

to  this  Chamber, and I knew then  that,  like  the

Biblical  Samson  whose strength lay  in  his  hair,

there  was  no  fight left in the Barisan  Sosialis.

That was purely a symbol of what was going on in the

Barisan Sosialis and the state of their minds.  They

knew then - and they know it now - that it is they who

will  one  day have to run away from the masses  and

possibly   seek  refuge  in  islands   outside   the

territorial  jurisdiction  of  Malaysia  after  31st

August.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Hear, hear!

Quite right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This is no wild prophecy, Sir. One

thing  that the Barisan Sosialis cannot hold against

us  is that our predictions and warnings - purely  to

help them out - have not come true. We have said that

come what may there will be Malaysia, as sure as the

sun  rises.  It is true that when last Thursday  the

opportunist  Right-wing  S.P.A. together  with  the

Members  for Anson, Joo Chiat and the U.P.P. ganged

up  to  defeat  the  Bill for the elections  to  the

Central    Parliament   and   forced   a   premature

resignation of the Government, the Barisan  Sosialis

Members were filled with hope -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> What is wrong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - that Malaysia may not after all

come  about. I was told that during tea-time on that

day  the  Member  for Anson, to the delight  of  the

Barisan Sosialis, was telling everyone that  he  was

waiting   for  the  kill  that  night.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  Members, I was told, were  prancing  about

the  corridors  of  this Chamber besides  themselves

with  joy. That was on Thursday. Today is Wednesday.

There has been no kill. The Government is very  much

alive  and  kicking and more than somewhat cheerful.

But not so the Opposition United Front, and least of

all  the paper matadors who were poised for the kill

on  Thursday.  What  happened  is  that  while  they

flourished  their cloaks and swished  their  swords,

they  got gored from behind. There will be no  kill,

Sir.  There  will  be merger and  Malaysia  by  31st

August,  however much the Opposition  may  gang  up.

Sir, if it is any consolation to the Opposition, and

to  the Barisan Sosialis in particular, I would like

to  tell  them  now  that the Government  is  making

intensive preparations to proclaim Malaysia  not  on

31st  August, as originally scheduled,  but  at  the

stroke  of midnight on 30th August. Sir, if for  two

years the Communists failed to halt progress towards

Malaysia,  this  last-minute - I think  the  term  is

"bundling":  I  am  told  it  is  a  bundling   bed;

everybody  gets  it - bundling of the Right-wing  and

the  Barisan Sosialis in the same bed will not  rock

the Malaysia Boat before 31st August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of merger and Malaysia - one of the

miscalculations  made by both the  Barisan  and  the

Opposition  - will not be decided today  by  mutations

and  permutations in the Opposition  ranks  in  this

Assembly.  Ninety-five per cent of  the  battle  for

merger  and  Malaysia  was fought  not  within  this

Assembly hut outside. That is where the S.P.A.,  the

U.P.P. and  the  Members for Anson  and  Joo  Chiat

miscalculated  when they thought  they  could  panic

this  Government by ganging up against it with cries

of  "Resign". Merger and Malaysia will come about on

31st



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



August, because the battle for Malaysia has been won

outside  this Assembly, and it will not  come  about

because of any fear, one way or the other, from this

Assembly, but because last September, 72 per cent of

the people said that they wanted merger on the basis

of the White Paper, not the complete merger as first

requested by the Barisan Sosialis and the U.P.P. and

then   abandoned  for  merger  on  terms   no   less

favourable   than  those  granted  to   the   Borneo

territories  as  first requested by the  S.P.A. and

then  abandoned  by them, but on the  basis  of  the

White Paper. This, Sir, is the simple fact that  was

overlooked  by  the Member for Queenstown  while  he

groaned  and  groaned his way through  the  sort  of

incoherent prose that is normally heard  only  on  a

psychoanalyst  couch. He talks  of  the  people.  He

always keeps on talking about the people, the people

wanting that, the people being opposed to merger and

Malaysia,  the  people  having  lost  faith  in  the

P.A.P.? But which people is he talking about? Is  he

talking about the S.P.A. Journal which goes  by  the

name  "The People"? Is he talking about the  Barisan

Sosialis  people? I agree that the Barisan  Sosialis

people  who  for the most part consist of bony-kneed

school  boys  and youths and pig-tailed lassies  are

against  merger and Malaysia. True, these  befuddled

and  hysterical juveniles put up black  banners  and

possibly  black  underpants to mourn the  inevitable

advent  of merger and Malaysia. These are the people

you  see  them  running around in pig  tails,  short

pants; I understand, Sir, that new orders have  gone

out  that they should wear long pants, cut off their

pig  tails, have permanent wave - probably  the  bee-hive  - so that the people will say that the  Barisan

has  now  the support of mature people - the  workers.

[Interruption]  I  might be crazy,  Sir,  but  these

Gentlemen,  as far as I can see, are in  a  position

where  they will go crazy slowly. If the Member  for

Queenstown  thinks that the people are  the  72  per

cent  who voted for merger and Malaysia or even  the

growing  numbers in the rural areas  who  since  the

Prime Minister's visits of explanations realise that

they have been misled by the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis  falsehoods,  then I  am  afraid  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis and the Member for Queenstown  are

completely  off  the mark. The  truth  is  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis  and  the Communists  have  become

objects  of  contempt and ridicule among the  people

today,  and the Communists and the Barisan  Sosialis

know  it.  That is why the Barisan Sosialis  Members

opposite  have lost their bounce and confidence.  It

is  an open secret that the more far-sighted Members

in   the   Barisan   Sosialis   are   today   making

preparations to give up politics after 31st  August,

either  to  take  up higher studies abroad,  or  run

prawn farms -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Are you thinking too?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - and one Member of the Barisan

Sosialis  told the Minister for Health and Law  that

she is going to buy and sell second-hand cars. Well,

Sir,  that is a very good sign. I approve of  people

taking  up higher studies. I wish they had  done  it

sooner, but with 30 days more to 31st August, it  is

still  not too late. I approve of people going  into

the  prawn farm business or even selling second-hand

cars  or  even share-broking, because it means  that

many  of  them  secretly believe that Malaysia  will

bring  prosperity in which they too  would  like  to

have  a share. Whether they do so or not will depend

on  whether between now and 31st August they  embark

upon newer, more foolish, still madder misadventures

like  storming  the  City Hall or  possibly  staging

minor confrontations of their own in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, many Barisan Sosialis Members are not

particularly  impressed or convinced by  the  Member

for   Queenstown's  affirmation  and  re-affirmation

yesterday  and today that the Ban-san  Sosialis  and

the  Communists  have  the  people  behind  them.  I

watched  them very closely yesterday and I  got  the

impression that they did not believe a word of  what

their leader was saying [Interruption]. Many of them

drifted  in  and out. In fact, Sir,  you  will  have

noticed that when the Member for Queenstown's  voice

rose  to  an oratorical crescendo about the  Barisan

Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



having  the masses behind them in this fight against

merger  and  Malaysia,  not  once  were  there   any

supporting  noises  from the Barisan  Sosialis  Back

Benches.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, the Minister must realise

that unseemingly noises in this Assembly are out  of

order. They were keeping proper order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> By supporting noises, I meant there

was not even an apologetic "Here, here!" They do not

believe a word of what their leader had been saying,

and  for a good reason. The number of events  during

the  last few weeks in Singapore have made it  clear

to  the  Barisan  Sosialis that  their  Party  is  a

political  dead  duck  and  that  they  have  become

objects  of  open  derision and contempt  among  the

people.  Yes,  Sir, unlike two years  ago  when  the

people  dared  not  laugh at the  Communists  openly

because   they  were  mesmerised  by  the  myth   of

Communist  power, today the people are  prepared  to

laugh and boo at the Communists openly and publicly.

This happened at Hong Lim on the 14th July when  the

Prime Minister held a mass meeting immediately after

his  return  from London after signing the  Malaysia

Agreement.  Not far from the park, Sir,  the  second

branch of the Communist-controlled Singapore General

Employees'  Union displayed black banners  to  mourn

what  they  called `the selling-out of the  people's

rights under the Malaysia Agreement'. It is strange,

Sir,  that thousands and thousands of people  should

have  lined  the streets, fired crackers  and  built

arches  to cheer and congratulate the Prime Minister

for "selling them out." It is very strange that they

should have lined the streets, shaken his hands  and

cheered  him  for selling them out. But  there  were

thousands of people at Hong Lim Park on that  night.

During  the course of his speech, the Prime Minister

drew the attention of the crowd to the black banners

put up by professional mourners of the second branch

of  the  Singapore  General  Employees'  Union.  The

banners  were  lighted  up and  the  Prime  Minister

thought that he would do the professional mourners a

favour  by  giving  them  their  banners  additional

publicity. Since he was on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



the  T.V. and the radio, he wanted to read  out  the

obituary  message  on  the  black  banners  so  that

hundreds  and thousands of radio listeners and  T.V.

viewers could know what the Communists were mourning

for -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

A dead duck!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> But the rest of Singapore, as far

as everyone could see, were joyful that the Malaysia

Agreement  had been concluded. Sir, since the  black

banners  were some distance away, the Prime Minister

had some difficulty reading the words and I expected

the  S.G.E.U. mourners to turn on more lights on the

banners  so that the Prime Minister could read  what

was  written  there and relay the message.  Instead,

the lights went off suddenly to the astonishment  of

the  thousands of people assembled at the  park  and

the  T.V. cameras picked it up all. Not only did the

lights  go off and the black banners were hidden  in

darkness but the crowds were even more astonished to

see  the  youthful mourners of the S.G.E.U. premises

scooting  for their lives. Here are the  people  who

proclaim  that they have the masses behind them,  to

the right of them, to the left of them, running away

like frightened rabbits before the masses. This  was

seen  by  The  crowds and picked by  the  television

camera  and  relayed, I hope, throughout the  length

and  breadth of Singapore. All because of what, Sir?

Because the Prime Minister, whom the Communists have

said is afraid of the masses, had wanted to read out

for  the  benefit of the audience and the radio  and

T.V. listeners  what  the Communist  black  banners

said.  All  he  was trying to do was to  do  them  a

favour,  and  they  scooted. No  wonder  before  the

astonishing spectacle of Communist stooges  doing  a

bunk  before the eyes of the people that the  crowds

at  first laughed and then booed. Then they  cheered -

not  the Barisan, Sir. For the first time in a  long

while,  a  crowd of ordinary people  who  have  been

conditioned to maintain a respectful silence  before

the Communists and their stooges were able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



to  laugh and see the Communist stooges scooting for

their lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the battle that began two years ago, the magic

spell  of  Communist strength and invincibility  has

been irrevocably broken. A figure of fear had, after

two  years  of protracted struggle over  merger  and

Malaysia,  become a popular figure of fun,  just  as

today  the Member for Queenstown and his cohorts  in

this   Assembly  have  become.  Even  his   marathon

speeches  in  this  Assembly, a hitter  and  massive

compendium of all the speeches he has made  in  this

Assembly   during  the  last  few   years,   despite

editorials   from   the  Barisan  Sosialis'   Orient

Express, the impromptu flow of the unconscious,  all

this  too, today, have become a figure of  fun.  The

fact  that  today an ordinary crowd can  openly  and

publicly  dare to laugh at the Barisan Sosialis  and

their   Communist   cohorts  constitutes   a   major

psychological  and political victory  for  the  non-Communist  democratic forces. In  the  eyes  of  the

masses, the Barisan Sosialis is not a Marxist outfit

but  an  outfit  of  Marx Brothers - Groucho,  Harpo,

Chico and Siew Choh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, last Saturday, there occurred an event

at Jalan Besar which proved beyond a shadow of doubt

that  the myth of Communist invincibility, Communist

prestige,   Communist  might,   had   been   utterly

destroyed.  The  people have  been  purged  of  this

dangerous  fear  of Communist power  and  influence.

Jalan Besar is a Communist stronghold. It is one  of

their  major  hunting grounds. There  is  a  lot  of

unions  around  there, Sir. The humiliation  of  the

Communists  being laughed out of their own  premises

by  a  crowd.  The biggest humiliation  is  where  a

person can be laughed out of his own premises.  They

were  high  up,  Sir, so that people  could  not  do

anything. They were about four or five storeys high.

But  they  were still so scared of the  people  that

they  ran out. That was the biggest humiliation,  it

was  bad enough putting out the lights, running  out

of your own house, hut worse still, running out of a

house which was beyond the reach of the masses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, to rectify that humiliation, the Barisan

Sosialis and the Communists wanted to retrieve their

honour  and  self-respect at  Jalan  Besar.  We  had

advanced  information  that  a  number  of   Barisan

Sosialis  unions were making active preparations  to

boo  and  heckle the Prime Minister, to shout  anti-Malaysia and anti-merger slogans during his tours of

Jalan   Besar,   Kampong  Kapor  and   Farrer   Park

constituencies.  They  wanted  to  see   the   Prime

Minister run away from the people this time. Some 70

beardless  youths and hysterical girls had assembled

high   above   the   Communist-controlled   National

Building Construction Workers Union. They had  fixed

loud-speakers  to boo and hurl abuse  at  the  Prime

Minister. Well, Sir, things did not work out the way

the  Communists had hoped for. Far from running away

as  the  Communists  had hoped, the  Prime  Minister

halted  his jeep in the midst of thousands of people

who  had  assembled  there,  while  from  the  Union

building  above  draped  with  black  banners,   the

Communists shouted how the Prime Minister  had  sold

out the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Were you there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, I was there. I am in the

photographs. In fact, I had the pleasure  of  seeing

what  I consider to be the greatest humiliation  the

Communist  confrontationists had ever had  inflicted

on them by the people of Singapore. I was very happy

that  I  was  there on that day, to  see  the  final

humiliation  of the Communists by the  people,  Sir,

not by the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Work Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Well, Sir, I will come to that. The

Barisan Sosialis keep on repeating propaganda  which

only  arouses the anger of the people as it did that

day at Jalan Besar. Well, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is in the photographs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Communists knowing full

well that the Prime Minister was going on a tour  to

mobilise support



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



for  the Malaysia Agreement, were trying to stir  up

public  feeling, work up some kind of demonstration,

use the crowd that would be there and turn it into a

crowd demonstrating against Malaysia. Sir, the Prime

Minister  who,  according  to  the  Communists,   is

supposed  to be afraid of the masses, was  right  in

the  middle  of  the masses. Not  so  the  beardless

youths  and screeching girls of the Barisan Sosialis

unions.  They  were in a balcony,  high  above,  the

youths  with  handkerchiefs tied across their  faces

like  bank robbers, and girls hiding their beautiful

faces every time -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Sir, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Have all these great details of

the P.M.'s tour anything to do with the motion

before us?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it that the Minister has in

mind  asking the Assembly to be mindful of the  long

and  arduous battle for merger. I hope the  Minister

will not make his speech too arduous.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I was going to say the arduous

battle  will  not  be finished  until  the  31st  of

August,  so I was just elaborating. Sir, I  want  to

produce   some  evidence  because  the  Member   for

Queenstown spent one whole evening and the best part

of  an  afternoon  saying that  people  are  against

Malaysia,  and here was a good test. Sir, here  were

the  people - I think something like 6,000 or  7,000

ordinary people - gathered around the Prime Minister.

There  were  on  one  side the  Communists  shouting

slogans,  "Down  with Malaysia!  Sell-out  Malaysia!

Sell-out  merger," and there was the Prime  Minister

- who  is supposed to be disliked by the people,  the

people are waiting to hang him from the nearest lamp-post  - standing  in the midst of the crowd,  whereas

the "people's representatives", the "men who had the

masses behind them" in a fourth-storey building.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Quite easy to jump down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> To be fair, Sir, I must say that

though the boys and the girls were covering up their

faces,  wearing  masks,  handkerchiefs  - one   thing

struck  me, Sir, and I must be fair to the girls.  I

had  a  distinct  recollection that the  girls  were

somewhat  braver than the boys. At least  the  girls

occasionally  revealed their faces.  It  is  an  odd

thing   about  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  that   their

womenfolk  are  not only braver than their  menfolk,

but they are often delegated to undertake more risky

jobs  like  volunteering for West Irian or  storming

the  City Council. The menfolk sit in the Operations

Room and direct operations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> They know how to squeak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Then, Sir, while they were defying

the   Prime   Minister  and  shouting  anti-Malaysia

slogans, the Prime Minister made what I thought  was

a sporting offer. He asked the hysterical youths and

girls to send a representative to come down and talk

to  the  people. He offered them the use of  a  more

efficient  microphone to explain to the  people  why

they thought that the Malaysia Agreement was a sell-out.  The crowd, too, thought that it was a sporting

offer,  and by cheers urged the Communists to accept

the offer. But to the astonishment of the crowd, the

Communists  youths,  the Barisan  Sosialis  stooges,

showed  great reluctance in coming down  from  their

great  heights to talk to the people.  Instead  they

preferred  to  shout abuse from behind masked  faces

from  the top of the building. And I have here, Sir,

photographs [Exhibiting]. This is supposed to be the

premises of the National Construction Workers Union.

This  is  a  very  good  example  of  the  deception

perpetrated  by the Communists. We have  photographs

here  of youths who could not by any stretch of  the

imagination be called construction workers. This  is

a  man, Sir, [indicating] and this shows the bravery

of  the  Barisan Sosialis men. There is a man hiding

his  face, the girl is exposing her face, but he has

got his arm around the girl. By no stretch of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



imagination can they be called construction workers.

What  were they doing in the premises of people  who

are  supposed to be construction workers?  Here  are

further  photographs, Sir. [Exhibiting]  Men  hiding

their faces. You will note in every photograph  here

that the men seemed to be more anxious to hide their

faces  than the women. Young girls, some of them  in

their teens, and men, I am quite sure, who have  not

yet  even  started to shave. These are "construction

workers".  What were they doing in the  premises  of

the National Construction Workers Union?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Looking for girls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This is a deception. When they talk

of "the people", when they talk of "the workers", as

we have always said, bony knees, short pants, school

kids.  These are the ones that "mobilise the crowd".

When  they  talk  of the people, we  know  they  are

telling a complete falsehood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they refused to come down. The Prime Minister

said,  "Please  come down instead of  shouting,  and

explain  to the people. You say that Malaysia  is  a

sell-out."  What they did was over the  loudspeakers

they  said  what the Member for Choa Chu Kang  said,

"Work Brigade."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> The People's Association.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, the exact words, Sir. And the

crowd  got very angry. Here are photographs  of  the

crowd.  You can see, Sir, [exhibiting] they  do  not

look  like  the  Work Brigade. There are  10,000  or

12,000  throughout  the route. And  when  the  crowd

heard  that, and when the Prime Minister  translated

for  them  and  said, "They say that  you  are  Work

Brigade men," the crowd got angry. They cheered  the

Prime  Minister and booed the Barisan chaps. And  we

hake  a  photograph  of that. When  they  heard  the

booing,  they  scooted. Sir, along the balcony  here

[Indicating] they scrammed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Sir, on a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Elucidation, yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Sir, will the Hon. Minister

distribute the photos to Members of the House?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Here, you can have them. [The

Minister made as if he wanted to cross the Floor to

hand over the photographs.]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not propose to have the time of

the House taken up that way. I think the photographs

can certainly be passed around in good time. If they

were tabled -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I will table them, Sir. For the

Barisan  Sosialis' Orient Express, I am prepared  to

give them complimentary copies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> pointed to Members of the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister for Finance must

behave himself in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the "Party of the people, as

the Communists claim themselves to be, preferred to

throw incoherent abuse at the people from the safety

of the building above.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You heard the truth for once at least.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You can watch it on T.V.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This was all photographed by

television  cameras. One thing is that the  pictures

taken by the television cameras failed to show  what

the  crowd was saying, the noises of the crowd,  the

anger of the crowd. When the Prime Minister left, he

said,  "Here, you can see for yourselves. These  are

the  people who want to destroy Malaysia." Then  the

crowd gave three cheers, three merdekas, and by that

time  the  gentlemen,  little boys  and  girls,  had

vanished  from  the National Union  of  Construction

Workers building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is unlike two years ago when they had Lim

Ching  Siong and a few others to put life  into  the

Party.  Today, after two years of struggle with  the

social   democrats,  whom  they  had  contemptuously

dismissed as effete, purposeless elements, it is the

Barisan  Sosialis which is in the process of gradual

decay.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



It  is my belief that even the Communists, who  will

survive the Barisan Socialist for a long time,  have

written  the  Barisan Sosialis off as a vehicle  for

their purpose. They will make use of it as a vehicle

while  it  still survives, because it  is  the  only

vehicle   left  for  them  to  manipulate  in   this

Assembly.  It  is fairly common knowledge  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis, under the nominal  leadership  of

the  Member  for  Queenstown and his advisers,  have

become an embarrassment to the Communist cause.  His

freelancing,  his marathon speeches,  ostensibly  on

behalf   of   the  Communist  cause, is   no   mean

contribution   towards   bringing   Communism   into

disrepute for the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, there was a letter in the

newspapers which described the Member for Queenstown

as   a   political  lightweight,  what  the   writer

described  as a sugar plum to decorate  the  Barisan

cake.  I  would,  I submit, Sir,  to  be  more  apt,

describe  him  as the pickled prune in  the  Barisan

trifle.  His performance last Thursday when  he  and

his  Party lined up with the S.P.A. and the rest  of

the  Opposition  to  bring down the  Government  was

another miscalculation as damaging to the Communists

as the famous tea-party the Barisan Sosialis leaders

had  in Eden Hall. Sir, to be led up the garden path

by   British   colonialists  has   at   least   this

consolation.  At  least  the Barisan  Sosialis  were

outwitted by the British colonialists with  hundreds

of  years of experience of State craft and diplomacy

behind  them.  But last Thursday to be  led  up  the

garden path by the Right-wing Alliance, which is  no

electric computer - the S.P.A., we know, were playing

their  own  game, a game on orders from  above.  For

their own reasons, the S.P.A. did not want elections

to  the  Central Parliament first. So they lined  up

with the Barisan Sosialis who thought that here  was

a chance to bring about the immediate resignation of

the   Government  and  halt  merger  and   Malaysia.

However,  Sir,  if  the Barisan Sosialis  and  their

advisers had made some careful calculations on  that

fateful  Thursday afternoon, they would  have  known

that the Member for Cairnhill is not the kind of man

who is going to do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



anything  to  ensure  the survival  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis in the next election. By opposing elections

to  the  15  seats before 31st August,  the  Barisan

Sosialis  have deprived the Communists of a possible

chance they may have had of winning a few seats even

if  they  are  only  to be Central  Parliament.  But

thanks  to  their being led up the garden path,  now

after  3lst August the chances of the pro-Communists

standing  for  election and  winning  seats  are,  I

should  say,  zero. Toe Barisan Sosialis  have  been

once  again led up the garden path by - and what must

be  most  humiliating is that they should have  been

led up the garden path by - the Alliance Party, whose

powers  of  political calculation are  by  no  means

outstanding.  That is why the Barisan Sosialis,  who

were  jubilant  on Thursday evening,  looked  a  bit

dazed  and  desperate  on the  following  day.  Some

bright  chaps  must have done some calculations  too

and  put  one more black mark against the  political

ineptitude  of  the  Member for Queenstown  and  his

befuddled  advisers.  It is now  not  a  case  of  a

pickled prune in the Barisan trifle, but the Barisan

trifle being in a serious pickle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what then is the immediate future for the

Barisan  Sosialis?  How  can  they  in  these   last

remaining 30 days hope to halt Malaysia and  merger?

I  say immediate future because, as I have said,  it

is only a matter of 30 days before the clock strikes

midnight  to Malaysia and the Barisan Sosialis  find

themselves in serious trouble. They know today  what

happened in Jalan Besar, what the reactions  of  the

people  are to their propaganda, to their effort  to

mount  opposition to Malaysia. They know  that  they

will  not be able to rally at least 72 per  cent  of

the  people in any anti-Malaysia crusade because the

people  are  determined  to have  Malaysia,  as  the

Barisan  Sosialis also know that Malaysia will  come

whatever happens by 31st August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I was slightly amused when I read the

amendment by the Member for Queenstown because, Sir,

if you will read the amendment carefully, you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



will discover that it is a tacit admission that  the

White Paper merger terms have the popular backing of

the   people.  The  amendment  by  the  Member   for

Queenstown  and much of his argument were calculated

to  convey  the  impression that it is  the  Barisan

Sosialis  who are now really interested in defending

the  White  Paper merger terms. The  Government  was

castigated for departing from the terms of the White

Paper, apart from the general sell-out of merger and

Malaysia.  Sir, the propaganda objective  is  clear.

Since the Communists cannot halt Malaysia, they hope

they can at least capitalise on what they know to be

popular support for the White Paper by appearing  as

defenders of the White Paper, that the P.A.P. which

devised  the  White  Paper had  betrayed  the  White

Paper,  and that the Barisan Sosialis, which opposed

the  White  Paper, can be relied on  to  defend  the

terms  of  the White Paper. I do not think all  this

will cut any ice with the people who have now learnt

to  laugh  at them publicly. The people have  become

more  sophisticated  and they  have  not  the  least

desire  tu  place  the running of this  country  and

sonic 5400 million worth that the Government has put

by  the  treasury in the hands of youths and  masked

school  girls.  The  Member for Queenstown  and  his

Party  may  have public rallies of 20,000 or  30,000

bleating  kids. But as the referendum showed,  these

mammoth  rallies  of  dedicated followers  will  not

prevent 72 per cent of the people or more from using

their  intelligence and casting their votes for  the

right type of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, as I have said, that the Barisan

Sosialis know that their number is up. But they have

to  keep  up the pretence that they have the  people

with  them.  There  is nothing  else  they  can  do.

However,  it is perhaps essential, now that  we  are

reaching  the final stages of the battle for  merger

and  Malaysia, to indicate the real danger,  or  the

more  dangerous role, the last and final role,  that

the  Barisan  Sosialis  will play  before  they  are

finally eliminated from the political scene.  It  is

necessary  for  the  people of Singapore  to  become

aware of what potential danger can emanate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



from the Barisan Sosialis. As far as the people  and

the workers of Singapore are concerned, they will get no

support. They can never formalise them and they know

it.  That is why there was one phrase in the  speech

by  the  Member for Queenstown which I  thought  was

significant,  because he himself drew  attention  to

it.  Because in his verbal ramblings, he let the cat

out  of the bag when he said that the essence of the

Malaysia  Agreement  - that is  his  very  word,  the

essence of the Malaysia Agreement - to which he  took

the  strongest objection was Article 6, dealing with

defence  pacts. It immediately struck me  that  this

was also an Article to which the strongest exception

has  been taken by certain confrontationists outside

of  Singapore.  Sir, ths more clearly than  anything

else reveals in whose interests the Barisan Sosialis

are working. The same term "essence" - the others are

all   part   of  the  propaganda  - of  the  Malaysia

Agreement to which they take the strongest objection

is  that  part of the agreement which will safeguard

the security of the lives of the people of Malaysia.

Sir, I can well understand confrontationists outside

of  this  country objecting to Malaysia, maybe  they

have  genuine misunderstandings about Malaysia. That

is   their  business.  If  they  persist  in   their

confrontation,   it   is  our  business   as   loyal

Singaporeans, loyal Malaysian people  and  loyal  to

the  people of this country, to try and explain away

the  misunderstandings foreign  friends  might  have

about  Malaysia.  But not so the  Barisan  Sosialis.

They are helping to magnify the misunderstandings by

creating the impression that there is opposition  to

merger and Malaysia. If they can give the impression

to  outside  forces that they are in real opposition

to  Malaysia,  then  it  is an  open  invitation  to

intervention by forces outside who may misunderstand

the  situation.  They might say, "It  is  worth  our

while  intervening." That is a dangerous  role  that

the  Barisan  Sosialis is playing.  As  far  as  the

Barisan   Sosialis  are  concerned,  they  are   not

interested in defending the interests of the  people

of Singapore. That is why they were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



held  in  contempt by the vast masses of the people.

That  is  why they were jeered and booed and laughed

out  at Hong Lim and Jalan Besar, because the people

of   Singapore  are  not  that  foolish.  They   are

beginning  to see that the Barisan Sosialis  in  the

last  hours  of  their lives are  playing  the  most

despicable of all roles that any political Party can

play   in   any  country  - betraying  their  people,

betraying their country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no accident that when the Barisan Sosialis

first began their opposition to merger and Malaysia,

Mr Lim Ching Siong, amongst many other things, said

that  he  preferred merger with Indonesia to  merger

with  the  Federation. It is no  accident  that  the

Barisan   Sosialis  should  have   tried   to   give

supporting  action  in  Singapore  to  further   the

foreign inspired revolt in Brunei. It is no accident

that  the  Member  for Queenstown  should  pick  out

Article 6 of the Malaysia Agreement as the essential

part of the Agreement to which he is most opposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say after two years of bitter struggle, we do

not  mind losing out even to the S.P.A. Whatever  it

is,  the  S.P.A. is  a Malaysian  Party,  loyal  to

Malaysia,  whatever disagreement we have with  them.

But  when a political Party is prepared to sell  out

their  own people merely to save their own political

skin, then I say that when the time comes the people

will  deal  with  them not as a Malaysian  political

Party  hut  as  Quislings, traitors,  who  in  other

countries,  because of the role  they  are  playing,

will  merit  their being - there are  legal  remedies

- executed. Their's is a traitorous role - a sell-out.

We  do not mind being sold out to the Right-wing. We

do not mind being sold out even to the Tunku, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You are selling out to the British

yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I do not mind being sold out to the

British because the British at least are not part of

our  life.  But  these are people who  suddenly  are

going  any time, especially if the Barisan  Sosialis

encourage and misguide them, who might misunderstand

the situation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



and  then  a  flare occurs. They have denounced  the

British;  they  have  denounced  the  Tunku   as   a

feudalist,   but  they  have  never  denounced   the

confrontationists.  Why? Why?  They  have  denounced

everybody except the confrontationists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Traitors!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They never denounce the

confrontationists. Supposing there is  confrontation

tomorrow. People get shot up. What will the  Barisan

Sosialis do? [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Would they be sending out

volunteers?  Sir, they are therefore  being  laughed

out.  The  history of the Barisan  Sosialis  in  two

years  - 20th  July, 1961, started out with treachery.

Their  beginning to be a political Party  - treachery

- ending  up  with  preparing for a sell-out,  for  a

traitorous  role. I can think of no more  inglorious

end  to  an  inglorious Party. That we  should  have

succeeded after two years, we whom they have  called

feeble,  pro-colonialist stooges, though  we  are  a

Party  - we  have not got all the experience  of  the

M.C.P. of  30  years  - but  that  we  should   have

eventually  succeeded in getting them to admit  that

the  only  hope of their survival does  not  lie  in

getting  support from their own people  but  selling

out  their  own people to outside forces.  That  has

made  our struggle worthwhile, the struggle  of  the

social democrats against the Communists, worth every

minute,  every  hour. Sir, as I have  said  earlier,

this  Government  is  now  preparing  to  inaugurate

Malaysia Day not on 31st August, but on 30th August.

We  shall  send  them an invitation  because  up  to

midnight  of 30th August, we guarantee nothing  will

happen.  And  we hope they will be there  up  to  12

o'clock,  because after 12 o'clock we can  guarantee

nothing.  Any time on 30th August, after 12  o'clock

they  can  come  and  see the  people  of  Singapore

rejoice and cheer over the advent of Malaysia, which

is always certain, as sure as the sun rises, as sure

as the red star of the Barisan Sosialis will set.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis

have  shown a contempt for the wishes of the  people

of Singapore which surpasses all understanding. They

still  wish it to be believed that what is not  good

for  them  must also be not good for the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the break came in the middle of 1961,

they were fighting with their hacks to the wall, not

to  defend the rights of the people of Singapore, as

they profess to do, but to get themselves out of the

noose  which they knew had been slipped  over  their

necks and had begun to tighten when the Tunku made a

public declaration that he was prepared to agree  to

a merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.

Sir,  from  then  on there was no  trickery  and  no

subterfuge they would not have resorted to to try to

save  themselves from their approaching  misfortunes

and  their impending doom. Sir, they who shouted the

slogans of democracy from the roof-tops were seen to

go,  cap  in hand, to the personification of British

imperialism  in  this part of the world  to  implore

that  they  be  given a chance to  assume  power  in

Singapore  by  an  act of perfidy and  treachery  to

their  erstwhile  colleagues and friends,  conceding

the  British  military bases  in  Singapore  to  the

British   Raj   and  accepting  a  perpetuation   of

colonialism   in  Singapore  so  long  as   internal

security was in their hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of all this, how hollow did the Member

for  Queenstown sound yesterday when he charged that

Article  6 of the Malaysia Agreement, which extended

the   agreement  on  external  defence  and   mutual

assistance  to all territories of Malaysia,  exposed

the real intention of the Malaysia Agreement to be a

neo-colonialist  British plot  to  perpetuate  their

rule in these parts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan, who have been exposed in their

own  plots  when  they  are  caught  out,  tried  to

discover  plots elsewhere and seek to  condemn  with

all  the  treachery that they can command a  defence

agreement which, in essence, does nothing more  than

what they themselves have been prepared to acquiesce

in before. Sir, is it surprising that they should be

guilty of such a volte face, as this is exactly what

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



P.K.I., their associates in Indonesia, do not want?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the concept of merger began to take shape and

when they have been exposed in their neo-colonialist

anti-national  scheme, they started a  hue  and  cry

about  second-class  citizenship  and  shouted   for

complete merger with proportional representation  in

the  Central  Legislature. Again they were  thinking

about  their own political survival and not  of  the

interest of the people of Singapore. They were quite

prepared to hand over education and labour  and  all

the  finances  of  the  State of  Singapore  to  the

control  of  the  Central  Government  without   any

constitutional safeguards for the future. The  White

Paper  proposals were put to the people of Singapore

in  the referendum held last year, and because their

sell-out plan was not put to the electorate,  as  it

would  have  been  fraudulent on  the  part  of  the

Government to do so, they campaigned for blank votes

in a big way. Having suffered a resounding defeat at

the  polls,  they  turned round and  said  that  the

people  were  frightened by the loss of  citizenship

into  voting for the White Paper proposals and  that

the  referendum  was  a phoney  referendum.  Through

their  trickery and lies, they were able to  get  25

per  cent  of  the electorate, mostly in  the  rural

areas  where their influence was greatest and  where

the   Government's   means   of   dissemination   of

information had difficulty in penetrating,  to  cast

blank votes. If, in fact, the people were frightened

by   the   loss  of  citizenship  into  voting   for

Alternative A in a big way, how is it that those who

cast  blank votes were not actuated by the same sort

of  fear?  This  is  what  the  Barisan  have  great

difficulty in trying to explain away.



<br><br>10.59 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the contradictions in their own position are

clearly  apparent  to  them.  But  for  those  whose

fortunes are now hanging on a thread, what  do  such

contradictions  matter  so  long  as  they  can,  by

trickery  and  deception, put up a facade  that  the

Malaysia  Agreement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



is a sell-out of the fundamental

rights of the people of Singapore, so that they  can

make one last attempt to confuse the people by their

hypocrisy  and  their evil cunning?  They  who  have

asked  the  people of Singapore to reject the  White

Paper  proposals  in toto and cast blank  votes  now

seek  in  an  amendment to claim that the Government

has cheated the people of Singapore by going back on

just   one  of  the  clauses  of  the  White   Paper

proposals.  It does not matter to them at  all  that

this  House  gave the Government a mandate  on  10th

June,  1963, to reach an early settlement  fair  and

just to both sides on the basis of the terms of  the

White  Paper proposals. It was in pursuance of  this

mandate  that  the  Agreement was  entered  into  in

London  recently. Have they attempted to  show  that

the Agreement was not fair and just to both sides on

the basis of the White Paper proposals? They now say

that  the  loss  of  our free port  status  was  not

included   in   the  White  Paper   proposals   and,

therefore,  there  has been a  sell-out.  They  were

prepared  to  hand over Singapore, lock,  stock  and

barrel,  to  the Central Government;  yet  they  now

complain of the loss of the free port status. It  is

not dissimilar to their protest against Article 6 of

the   Malaysia  Agreement,  extending  the  Malaysia

Agreement to all the Malayan territories,  and  just

as hollow. The negotiations in London were difficult

enough,  each  side trying to get the  best  of  the

bargain. If agreement was to be reached, concessions

had  to be made on both sides. It is only those  who

seek  to mask their real intentions who will be bold

enough to claim that the net result of the agreement

reached in London is that Singapore has been  handed

over  to  the Central Government as a dependency  of

the Federation, substituting British imperialism for

Federation imperialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fair and just apportionment of the revenue to

pay  for  the Central Government responsibility  for

services  in  Singapore, hitherto the responsibility

of  the  Singapore Government, and to meet  the  new

Defence  and External Affairs commitments  following

from the establishment of Malaysia, had to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



accepted  and  had to be worked out in  dollars  and

cents.  Sir, surely a free of interest loan of  $100

million for five years, and for a further five years

if  Singapore's prosperity warrants it,  and  a  $50

million  loan  at  normal interest  rates  are  more

advantageous to Singapore than an outright  gift  of

$50   million  which  was  first  demanded  by   the

Federation  Government. In an outright gift  of  $50

million,  the interest due which amounts to  a  very

large  sum of money every year on the capital  grant

is lost for all time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Singapore is to survive as a viable

economic  entity  after merger, a common  market  is

essential and it was the duty of the Singapore  side

to   ensure   that   this  was  enshrined   in   the

Constitution.  This was done. The Rueff  Report  has

drawn  attention to the fact that the eventual  loss

of  the  free  port status must be accepted  in  the

context of the new constitutional arrangements,  and

the  quid pro quo for this eventuality in the common

market  has been assured to the people of  Singapore

in  safeguards  to be written into the Constitution.

Has the Government sold out the rights of the people

by  doing what a prudent Government would do in  the

interests of the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a lot of loose talk from the Member

for  Queenstown on clauses of the constitution which

he  obviously does not understand and which find  an

honourable   place  in  all  federal  constitutional

arrangements. One such proposal is the  power  given

to  all  Central  Governments to suspend  the  State

Constitution  under conditions of emergency  arising

from political disturbances in a member State. There

is  no reason why such a desirable clause should  be

left out of the Malaysia Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, time is fast running out for the Barisan

Sosialis, and men in a desperate position are  known

to  try  to do desperate things. They have tried  in

this  last  sitting of this Assembly to confuse  the

people.  But the people know them only too  well  by

now. Even the most gullible, except those who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



committed  with them and who can never be convinced,

will  not be taken in by their last blatant  attempt

at palpable fraud.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have complained that the Government has denied

them the right of freedom of association and freedom

of  speech  to go out to campaign once more  against

merger  and  Malaysia before the 31st  August,  even

though  they  know that the people have  already  in

overwhelming majority in a free vote accepted merger

and  Malaysia. The word "freedom" in its  democratic

context  does  not mean a licence to create  trouble

for  the  purpose of frustrating the wishes  of  the

people,  and  it  is not the denial  of  fundamental

democratic  rights for the Government  to  take  all

reasonable  steps to ensure that the wishes  of  the

people  will  be respected and Malaysia  comes  into

being  on  the  31st  of August in  a  peaceful  and

orderly manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that the combined Opposition has decided

that   there  shall  be  general  elections   before

elections   for   the  15  seats  to   the   Central

Parliament,  there will be general elections  before

the  year  is out, but not for the purpose of  fresh

constitutional  talks.  On and  after  31st  August,

1963,  merger will be a reality in law and in  fact,

as  all  sovereign  rights hitherto  vested  in  the

British  Government over Singapore will have  passed

from  the  British  Government to  the  new  Central

Government  of  Malaysia. The  inexorable  logic  of

events  has  taken its full course and a chapter  in

our  history  is soon to be closed.  They  would  be

foolish indeed to believe that they have it in their

power  to turn the hands of the clock back. To those

of  my  former  political  friends  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  who  are now wavering, I say:  accept  the

inexorable  logic of events and the  wishes  of  the

people  and join the ranks of those who are  working

for  the  establishment  of a peaceful,  democratic,

socialist, and non-Communist Malaysia. For those who

are too deeply committed and cannot see the error of

their  ways,  they  must be  prepared  to  take  the

consequences of their own folly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now deal with the points of difficulty

which  have  troubled the Member  for  Farrer  Park.

Clause 69 of the Malaysia Bill deals with amendments

to   the   Federal  Constitution,   and   the   only

Legislature  which  can  be  concerned   with   such

amendments is the Federal Parliament. As the  Leader

of  the  House has already pointed out, this Article

is  parallel  in  terms with  clause  66(2)   of  the

Malaysia Bill which deals with the same position  as

regards  the Borneo States. Clause 69 and clause  66

(2)   of the Malaysia Bill are not at all in conflict

with Article 90 of the Constitution of the State  of

Singapore, which deals only with amendments  to  the

Singapore  Constitution. The broad effect of  clause

69  of  the  Malaysia Bill is that  even  where  the

Federal  Parliament has enacted a law  amending  the

Constitution of the Federation of Malaysia with  the

requisite  majority,  it  will  still  require   the

consent  of  the  Government  of  Singapore  if  the

amendment  affects  the  position  of  Singapore  in

regard  to the matters set out in clause 69. But  as

far   as  the  Singapore  Legislative  Assembly   is

concerned,   it   can  only  amend   the   Singapore

Constitution   provided  that   the   amendment   is

supported by the required majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Members of the House who belong

to   political   Parties  and   who   switch   their

affiliation from the Party for which they stood  for

election,  the accepted constitutional  position  in

the  British parliamentary system is that  they  are

not  legally  bound to vacate their  seats.  But  in

other   countries  which  also  subscribe   to   the

democratic system of parliamentary government, where

there  is  provision for proportional representation

as  in  France, the concept is that it is the  Party

which   is   represented  and  not  the   individual

candidate.  In  that system where a Member  switches

his  Party  affiliation, he is replaced  by  another

Member of the same Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in law and in fact, there are no rigid forms

of parliamentary practice and there is no reason why

we  should  not  draw  on  our  own  experiences  to

improvise a new form of parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



practice  to meet our own local situation.  We  have

therefore introduced a provision which combines  the

British emphasis on the individual candidate and the

French concept of Party representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Article 30 (2) (b) of the Singapore Constitution

is  accepted,  then the resulting  vacancy  must  be

filled  in accordance with the provisions of Article

33.  As I understand it, the Member for Farrer  Park

does  not  object  to Article 33  but  only  to  the

omission of the provision that the vacancy should be

filled  within  three months. However,  the  present

Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council  does  not

prescribe  any period within which the vacancy  must

be   filled,  and  for  that  reason  the  Singapore

delegation  did not agree to the imposition  of  any

time  limit  in  the  new Constitution.  There  are,

therefore,  no  real  points of  difficulty  in  the

amendments introduced by the Member for Farrer Park.

I  would,  therefore, invite him to  reconsider  the

position.



<br><br>11.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, this subject has been accepted by all - by  the

Government,  by  the Opposition,  and  even  by  the

public  - as  one  of  a  grave  national  character.

Therefore,  the  Prime  Minister  was  accorded  due

silence  and respect when he moved a very  intricate

motion  and  spoke for nearly three hours.  In  that

speech  of his, he said - let me just quote from  my

shorthand notes which I have - "I do not want to deal

in   detail  with  the  financial  arrangements.  My

colleague,  the Minister for Finance, who  bore  the

brunt of the detailed work and the argument with his

counterpart in the Federation will do so. If I  know

him,  he  will do so competently.". He said that  in

his  speech.  That  was yesterday.  We  waited.  The

financial  arrangements and the common market  terms

are  matters of grave importance, matters which have

not  been discussed in the Assembly, and matters  on

which  the  Government has received no  mandate.  We

waited, we waited, and we waited. My colleague,  the

Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



Farrer   Park,   in  his  speech  touched   on   the

constitutional points. He did say to the  Government

that  we  were  waiting to hear  the  views  of  the

Minister  for Finance; in fact, his guidance  as  to

how   the  arrangements  reached  between  the   two

Governments are - using the words of the motion - fair

and  just.  We waited. After the Member  for  Farrer

Park  had spoken and invited the Government to carry

out  the  advice  of  the Prime Minister,  to  which

advice  we  listened with great interest  and  great

respect,  we waited for the Minister for Finance  to

inform  this House what are the benefits  that  will

accrue  to  Singapore which are  fair  and  just  to

Malaysia  out of the terms that had been reached  in

London  over  the  financial  arrangements  and  the

Common  Market.  We are the more interested  because

those  were  the two points that the Prime  Minister

and  the  Minister for Finance had been play  acting

all  along before they even went to London, and  had

been play acting in London too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we were to say that we were anxious

to   know,   to  understand  and  to  support   with

understanding the arrangements reached, could we  be

accused if I were to say that I had been let down by

the  Government whose Minister for Finance only  sat

here and interjected and misbehaved himself, instead

of giving the Opposition the guidance that we needed

so much for the interest of the people of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leader of the House - the Deputy Prime Minister - when he jumped up to reply to the points on constitutional law brought up by my colleague, the Member for Farrer Park, said also that the Minister for Finance would speak on the financial arrangements and the Common Market. That was before the dinner break. After that we had two more

Ministers  coming in - the Minister for  Culture  and

the Minister for Law. The Minister for Culture spoke

for nearly two hours.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> All right.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think it should be fair to quote

the  Leader of the House properly. He said that  the

Minister for Finance would answer the points  raised

by the Members of the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if my

ability in writing shorthand has not gone down as  a

result of P.A.P. manoeuvring and doing things  which

makes  it  difficult for even Opposition Members  to

understand,  I  have  it here  as  saying  that  the

Minister  for  Finance  will  tell  us  what   those

arrangements  are.  Surely, how can  the  Opposition

criticise  or  support  the  financial  arrangements

reached  in  London  if  the  Minister  for  Finance

himself did not give the guidance that is necessary?

The Minister for Finance is not the Minister for the

P.A.P. but the Minister for the whole of Singapore,

and  our Minister for Finance too, and therefore  he

has  a  responsibility to guide us  and  to  let  us

understand the things that he thinks are right,  and

we  are anxious, with understanding, to support him.

But no, the Minister for Culture, who just now stood

up  on a point of elucidation, took nearly two hours

-  what  is that? politics! Ding-dong between P.A.P.

and  the Barisan - all on what? - to what effect?  - to

make  Singapore realise the more that there has been

this rivalry that started since the break-up in July

1961.  We  waited.  Nothing from  the  Minister  for

Finance -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Coming, coming! Next instalment

tomorrow!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> As I have said, Sir, the Minister

for   Finance  is  first  class,  to  sit  here  and

interject and misbehave. If he had really taken  the

advice  of the Prime Minister who in his long speech

said  that he would like to leave that work  to  his

Minister  for Finance, he should and he  could  have

immediately   followed  the   Prime   Minister   and

explained the financial details. Oh no, he did  not;

and  now  he says he would, he would. But surely  he

will  know  that after he has spoken I cannot  speak

again  - I  am  prevented  by  Standing  Order   from

speaking on the points raised by him. I cannot speak



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



again  and  I would hesitate to speak on any  points

that the Government itself has not made clear to the

Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture in a two-hour speech

- not  quite  two hours, but nearly - had a  ding-dong

battle with photographs and had a good laugh at  the

expense  of the Barisan. But there was something  in

that speech of his which is repetitious, a sort of a

record  of  His  Master's Voice.  Just  because  his

master  said, "Oh, the S.P.A. is linked up with  the

Barisan to vote against the Federal Elections  Bill"

therefore the S.P.A. and the Barisan are doing this,

that  and  the others, although after a  responsible

Member  of  the  Opposition, the Member  for  Farrer

Park, had stood up and explained the reason for  the

opposition of the Alliance to the Federal  Elections

Bill,  and gave two points. One point was  that  the

Second  Reading  of that Bill could  and  should  be

taken  after the Malaysia debate. The second  point,

which  is  very  important and which  has  not  been

explained  away by the Government, is that according

to  the  Bill, the dice is loaded in favour  of  the

P.A.P. and that if the Government would only make an

honest   attempt  to  show  that  they  too  desired

elections  conducted in an honest way so that  there

could be fair play for all, we could have understood

it.  In  fact, the Member for Farrer Park  has  said

that  the ball is now at their feet. No, they  would

prefer, if possible, to rig the elections as much as

possible. When their evil intentions were found out,

what  did they do? They said they had been receiving

Communist   tutelage   on  propaganda;   first-class

propaganda to confound the public. "Oh, the Alliance

is  afraid  of elections, and therefore  they  voted

against  the  Bill."  [Interruption]  I  thank   the

Minister  for Finance for saying that that is  quite

right.  He  admitted  that  he  received  very  good

Communist  tutelage on the art of distortion.  Quite

right. He learns that. So, therefore, they went  out

talking,   "The  Alliance  is  afraid   of   general

elections,  and  therefore, they voted  against  the

Federal Elections Bill." They repeatedly said  that.

The  Minister  for Culture repeated  it  even  after

having heard what the Member for Farrer Park had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



said  to  the Government, that the ball  is  now  at

their feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not like to waste the time of this

House  by repeating what the Member for Farrer  Park

has  said, but in replying I would like to touch  on

certain points raised by the Leader of the House and

by the Minister for Law. They are in regard to three

legal points raised by the Member for Farrer Park. I

would  like to reply to them in due course,  but  in

the  meantime,  let us tackle the  speeches  of  the

Ministers, in the order of the last Minister  first.

Apart  from the legal point, which I would bring  up

at a later stage, what I am going to speak no now is

more on the points of a political character than  of

a  constitutional character. He says, "The  combined

Opposition has dissented, so there shall be  general

elections  before the year is out," and this  coming

from  the  Minister for Law. He knows that the  1962

Electoral Registers are null and void, because -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Because of what?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - because of the Singapore

Legislative     Assembly    Elections     (Temporary

Provisions) (Amendment) Bill tabled last  Wednesday.

That  Bill had a Second Reading on Wednesday. I will

just  talk  very briefly on this. The  Minister  for

Home  Affairs, in moving the Second Reading  of  the

Bill, unfortunately set the wrong tone, and got  the

tails of the Opposition up. What did he say? "Oh, we

the  Government  say  there  is  no  need  for  this

amending  Bill.  The Government believes  and  still

maintains  that  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections    (Temporary    Provisions)    Ordinance,

introduced  in June and forced through  against  the

whole  united  Opposition objection, was  right  and

legal."  In  June, it was pointed out by the  Member

for  Farrer  Park  and  by me,  that  that  amending

legislation   could   only   legalise    the    late

certification of the Electoral Registers.  It  could

not  legalise  the  acts done  by  the  Registration

Officer  in conducting the registration,  when  such

acts  were done after the end of 1962, that  is,  in

February  1963.  Therefore, it was  urged  upon  the

Government that they should consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



carefully  putting in a provision to make it  beyond

all doubt that the acts of the Registration Officer,

carried   out  in  February  1963,  which  were   in

contravention   of  section  50  of  the   Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, should  be

protected.  I urged upon the Minister then  that  he

should  give serious consideration to this point  of

law.  The  Member  for Farrer Park appealed  to  the

Minister for Law and sought his wisdom. The Minister

for  Law  chose to be silent. The Minister for  Home

Affairs  just  went ahead and said, "This  Bill  was

prepared  and vetted by the State Advocate-General's

Department, and surely it must have been all right."

They  pushed it through against the whole Opposition

vote,   immediately  after  that,  they  tabled   an

amending  Bill at the following sitting, i.e.  July,

on  a  Certificate of Urgency. What did the Minister

say  then?  I  would not like to  waste  time  going

through  the Official Report, but in effect this  is

what  he said, "Oh, you know, I tabled this amending

Bill,  not  because the Government thinks  that  the

Opposition  is right - the Government still  maintains

that  it  is  right - but in order to accommodate  the

Opposition,  so  this amending Bill is  introduced."

Surely,  Sir,  that  is  not  the  way  to   run   a

government.  That  is  not  the  way  to   introduce

legislation.   What  was  the  reaction   from   the

Opposition?  Up  we  jumped. We said  that  what  we

advised the Government to do, the Government  should

have  done.  If the Government had been a democratic

Government,  upholding the practice of parliamentary

democracy,  it  would have given due weight  to  any

Opposition  objection together with legal reasoning,

and  then it could have deferred the Committee Stage

for just one hour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen)</b>: Order. May I

remind the Member for Cairnhill that we debated this

particular  aspect last Wednesday? I  think  he  has

made his point, if he is going into detail, then  he

is inviting a debate from the Government side.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, sometimes I

find is difficult to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



make the Government understand,

and  I  am  just  explaining in greater  detail  the

statement  of the Minister for Law that there  could

be  elections before the end of the year. I tried to

tell him straight to his face that there could be no

elections, and in order to prove my contention  that

there  can  be  no elections because  the  Electoral

Registers  are null and void, I will  have  to  seek

your indulgence -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is what you say.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - to go and explain the course of

events.  The' Minister for Law keeps on  maintaining

that  that Bill passed in June and which has  become

law   already - the  Singapore  Legislative  Assembly

Elections (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance - is good.

Yet  the  Minister for Law, who is a Member  of  the

Cabinet,  did  not  advise  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs that that other amending Bill need not  have

been  introduced  at  all.  The  Minister  for  Home

Affairs introduced it, however.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are now getting difficult for the P.A.P.

Ministers.  It  would appear that one Minister  does

not  know what the other Minister is doing. It would

also appear that what the Prime Minister does is not

even  known  to the Ministers, so much so  that  the

three  Ministers  who  stood up  - the  Deputy  Prime

Minister,  the  Minister  for  Culture,   and   tile

Minister  for Law - did not talk about the documents.

No.  They  talked about the hard and  long  struggle

with  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  the  Communists,  the

Right.  Left,  and Centre. "Everybody is  Communist"

- that is what they talk about. They did not talk  of

the  documents,  and  I must  say  this,  Sir,  they

themselves  do  not know what is in  the  documents,

because  they themselves did not have  the  time  to

study  what  is in them. Therefore, they could  not.

But in order to put up an appearance of' solidarity,

they stood up and said, "The other Ministers are not

here,  so  let me speak." The Minister  for  Culture

spoke' something on the Barisan Sosialis which could

be  taken  to  be  just a repetition  of  the  Prime

Minister's speech - repeat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



His  Master's Voice - the picture of a wonderful  dog

sitting  patiently,  obediently,  listening  to  his

master's voice. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I want to tell the Minister for

Law  -  I hope the Government will consult the State

Advocate-General  that the 1962 Electoral  Registers

are  illegal. Having maintained that stand,  and  as

the  Government has been knocked out and has  agreed

to  resign  after Malaysia, may I ask the  Ministers

who  share collective responsibility of the Minister

for  Home  Affairs  to  see  to  it  that  the  1963

Electoral  Registers are ready in time according  to

law,  i.e.  15th  September? The Minister  for  Home

Affairs has said that steps have already been  taken

to  revise  the Registers for March 1963 - four  months

ago.  The  Minister for Home Affairs has  even  said

that  the  Minister for Finance has now agreed  that

the  Statistics Department could have - I do not know

what   they  call  it   -an  electronic  machine   or

something -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Computing machine.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you for the assistance; a

computing machine, whereby they can compute how best

the PAP, can win against the tide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> How to wind up.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - how best the P.A.P. can win

against   the  tide.  Sir,  I  do  urge   upon   the

Government,  if  there  is sincerity,  if  there  is

honesty  in  their declaration that they  will  have

general  elections before the year is  out,  let  us

have  the 1963 Electoral Registers ready by the 15th

of  September.  The Elections Office  is  under  the

control  of the Executive Government. The  Executive

Government  has already interfered with the  working

of  the  Elections Office under the law. I  do  hope

that  now  that Malaysia is on (30 days  more)  - the

Ministers call upon the Barisan Sosialis to  repent,

it  is not too late - I say to the Ministers and  the

Back  Benches of the P.A.P., "Repent and come clean,

it is still not too late."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You had better go and have a bath.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister asks me to have a

bath,  Sir. May I point out to the Minister that  it

is  because of a wicked P.A.P. Government that there

is  water rationing and I cannot even have a  decent

bath? It is not only I but the members of the public - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> After 8 o'clock you can have a

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister keeps us here. We

are  being kept here right tip to midnight. It  does

not   matter.   Evil   is   he   who   evil   thinks -

[Interruption]  Ah,  you  see  all  this?  The  Back

Benches  are good sycophants of the Prime  Minister.

Come  on, let us play the same record. Ha, ha,  keep

on -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the Member

for Cairnhill that if he faces the Chair it will  be

more convenient to him?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker,

it is when you have to speak in front of Members who

cannot even be cultured in spite of the Ministry  of

Culture  that  one  loses one's  sense  of  balance.

[interruption] But since they have said it,  I  will

look at you, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law is trying to tell us that we can have elections on electoral registers that are illegal. That is his law. A man who is supposed to look after the law, stands up and tries to talk about finance, whereas the Minister for Finance has not even opened his mouth on finance. He tries to tell us that the arrangements are better. I do not

know.  I  will  not  accept his  advice,  but  I  am

prepared  to  accept the advice of the Minister  for

Finance.  So,  may  I say to the Minister  for  Law,

forget finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Why do you listen to me?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Forget finance. Sir, the Minister

for  Law, the Minister for Culture, the Deputy Prime

Minister, the Prime Minister, all in their  speeches

keep on calling S.P.A., whereas we have explained to

them that we are now a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



United Alliance. But why do they say S.P.A., Sir? it

is  very clear. Because the Prime Minister said even

if  the  S.P.A. were to vote against  him  - not  the

U.M.N.O. And why not the U.M.N.O.? Because the Prime

Minister  went  to  see  Tunku  and  said,   "Tunku,

U.M.N.O. sama P.A.P. boleh lah jadi satu perikatan."



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think all these

gestures of the Member for Cairnhill should  be  cut

short and he should come to the subject once more.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> There again, Sir, it is the

lateness  of  the  hour.  We  are  now  nearing  the

bewitching hour, midnight - midnight, 30 days  after,

Malaysia, and according to the Minister for Culture,

oh,  he  says  it  is wonderful. On  the  stroke  of

midnight 30 days after, he says this will positively

be their last appearance. Is that not a threat? This

will positively be their last appearance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> So will it be yours.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, is it a fact or are they

trying  to  say that in the Central Government,  the

new Minister for Internal Security will lock all  of

them  up?  Is  that  the way for the  Government  to

behave  and  put ideas into the heads of the  public

and  their  political opponents that in the  Central

Government, the Minister for Internal Affairs  is  a

vicious  ogre waiting only to pounce on  these  poor

defenceless  Barisan Sosialis who, by the  grace  of

the  charity  of the P.A.P. Ministers, still  remain

here?  Are  they  trying to do  that?  Is  it  good

culture?  Is  it  the  way  to  make  friends?  Yes,

culture, or is he not taught? They know that Article

30,  sub-clause 2 (b), is under attack.  They  could

have  these  people  removed  just  by  having  this

proposed  Constitution  enacted  as  law.  That  is,

because they have crossed the Floor under Article 30

(2)  (b), they are no longer Members of the Assembly.

I  do  not know. It is very hard to assess the  evil

minds of the P.A.P., which way they are shooting? Is

it  Article  30 (2)  (b)  or is it because  they  feel

that the Minister for Internal Security for Malaysia

will make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



short  shrift  of  these  people?  I  do  not  know.

Whichever  way  it is, they seem  to  know.  But  no

matter  whichever  way  that  happens,  we  in   the

Alliance know that the P.A.P. is dead, not by an act

- an  attempt  to cheat at legalising the  deed,  not

act. They are trying to frighten the Opposition that

the  Central  Government will  take  action  against

these  people  under  the  P.P.S.O.  They  are  dead

because  it has been found out that they will  stoop

so  low  as  to  put  into important  Constitutional

documents  things that were not there in the  London

one  and  without even explaining them  to  us.  The

Prime Minister could have explained that Article  30

(2)   (b)   is a new one, and could have said,  "Watch

out,  the implications mean this and we ask  you  to

support us on this because you know the Barisan boys

left us. We want them out, the dirty traitors. Look,

the  other Members of the Workers' Party - the Member

for Anson is no longer in the Workers' Party. Let us

vote  him out." But what is more important  is  that

there  are some Members on the Government  side  who

are  so disgusted - "disgusted" is the word - with the

manner  in which the Prime Minister has handled  the

Government. I am sure that not one Member - even some

Ministers - in the second line, third line - I  do  not

call  them teams because they cannot even  kick  any

ball  now - knows anything about these Constitutional

Documents.  Why  I  say they know  nothing  is  that

before,  when  we had these friendly  exchanges,  up

jumped  a Back bencher and then he sat down; another

Back bencher jumped up followed by another - and they

kept  on  shooting; but now there is  silence.  They

think, in this particular instance, that silence  is

golden. If they speak too much, they might embarrass

the  Prime Minister because they know not what  they

speak about. Therefore, they prefer to keep silent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister, in his speech last Monday,

when  I talked about the Port workers, talked  about

other  things. And what did he say? He said that  he

did  not even have time to read the documents. I can

quote  the  right words, but it does not matter.  He

did say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



that   he  did  not  have  the  time  to  read   the

Constitutional  Documents. He said that  I  did  not

have  the  time to read the Constitutional Documents

on  Wednesday and on Thursday and that if I had read

them,  my stand on the Federal Elections Bill  might

have been different. He himself knew that by his own

act  he  had  prevented the Opposition from  knowing

what the papers were until Sunday afternoon. And yet

be  charged that I on Wednesday and Thursday did not

have  the time to read the Documents and that I  was

busy  making  money. How could I have read  anything

when  all  these Documents were still  kept  by  him

secret  until Sunday afternoon? Sir, this is typical

of P.A.P. propaganda! He said, "There is this Member

for  Cairnhill, busy making money, and he  does  not

even have the time to read the Documents," when,  in

actual  fact, he was even afraid to let us have  the

Documents  in  time.  This is  the  kind  of  P.A.P.

culture,  P.A.P. crookedness, and P.A.P. attempt  to

try  to "fix the Opposition." Yes, Sir, "to fix  the

Opposition." The Prime Minister has said, "I can fix

you, but you cannot fix me." Never mind, although we

cannot  fix  him,  we will see  him  buried  at  the

general  elections and I do not think  I  will  even

send him a wreath.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is interesting. He said that I was in

Kuala  Lumpur sitting and waiting. He said  that  he

saw  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  waiting  patiently

outside the Cabinet, and that it afforded them  some

amusement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Great amusement.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That day, the Prime Minister and

the Minister for Finance went up. I went up too. The

night  before,  I  knew what the  trouble  was.  The

trouble was this $50 million grant. The P.A.P. said,

"No  loan.  The common market in terms  have  to  be

spelt out. We are going to be firm." I must say that

I  had  talks with the P.A.P. because I was just  as

anxious  as they were. You must not forget, Sir,  on

10th  June it was my motion demanding fair and  just

terms.  It  was  my  motion,  not  the  Government's

motion,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



demanding   fair  and  just  terms  for   a   merger

agreement.  So I went up, Because I am a friend  and

still  am  proud to be a friend of the Ministers  of

the  Federation, I went to the Minister for  Finance

and said, "This is very difficult, you know. I think

you  had better change your stand. Do not spoil  the

chances  of Malaysia. Accept the loan and  think  of

something   else.  Let  it  be  written   into   the

Constitution." I was for it in an honest attempt  to

meet  the  P.A.P. At the time they were having  that

meeting, I was anxious, because I knew the temper of

the  Ministers in the Federation. Their  temper  was

not  that  they wanted to extract as  much  as  they

could   out  of  Singapore  but  because  the  Prime

Minister was playing party politics the whole  time.

The  Minister  for Finance an ogre - whereas  in  the

Federation  Cabinet, I can say this, Sir.  There  is

real collective responsibility. There every Minister

knows  what  the  other Ministers are  doing.  There

every  decision is taken by the Cabinet. But  it  is

not  so here with the P.A.P. Everything is the Prime

Minister.  He  went  to  negotiate.  "Minister   for

Finance?  Ah, get out! When he comes, get out."  And

he kept on talking about finance -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Prime Minister talking about

finance,  and yet he accused the Federation Minister

of'  Finance  as  being the big  bad  wolf.  Whereas

whatever  points presented  by  the  Minister

for Finance  in  the Federation were the points

decided upon  by  the  Federation Government.

It  serves  the P.A.P. to twist and to distort - M.C.A., M.C.A.

Why? Because they really feel afraid that the Chinese  in

Singapore  are  going to throw the P.A.P. down  the drain.

So  they say, "The M.C.A. jahat, very,  very evil  men."

Here  it is the same  thing.  They  are trying to twist

the U.M.N.O. and the M.C.A. They are calling  the S.P.A. very

evil men and U.M.N.O. baik punya  orang-lah, banyak baik.

What are they  trying to do?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I was anxious. I was more anxious than the Prime

Minister.  Why, Sir? Because I say the interests  of

the people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  should come first and not party politics.

I  was anxious. I thought the meeting would be  over

in  an hour. Unfortunately, Brunei was included  and

they  met  right up to ten past one. I  met  a  very

charming civil servant who said, "Tun, come into the

room  and sit down. It is air-conditioned." I  said,

"What for the air-conditioned room? I prefer to sit

outside." Because when you sit outside -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is cooler.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> You mix up with the syces and you

talk  and get some ideas, about life, about all  the

things -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Bicycles.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, to the Minister for Couture

it  would seem that the bicycle is a low-down  thing

because  he rides in motor-cars. So a bicycle  is  a

Low-down  thing.  But  I  say  the  bicycle  is   an

honourable  means  of  conveyance  of  the  ordinary

worker -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why mix up with bicycles?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Why mix up with bicycles? I do

not  know  why the Prime Minister goes and mixes  up

with  all sorts of people in his constituency tours.

What the P.A.P. do is all right, what the Opposition

do is -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> All

wrong.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - all wrong. [Laughter] That is

the  Minister for Education. If this is the kind  of

education   that  the  children  of  Singapore   are

receiving,  I  will  say  "Alama,  ampun  tuan!" - [Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen)</b>:Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So they sit there and ridicule.

But  I  say I prefer to sit outside, talk  with  the

ordinary man, the syces, the clerks, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The towkays.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - the tambies. So they say, "What

is  this'? What is he doing?" I was more anxious.  I

would  not  call and embarrass any Minister  of  the

P.A.P. Government, especially the Prime Minister who

is very dictatorial and very vindictive. I would not

like  to name any Minister. Yet at lunch time I  was

there,  so  was the Minister for Finance. The  Prime

Minister  could  not go and I felt  sorry  for  him,

because Mrs Lee Kuan Yew had to go to London for an

operation. So the Prime Minister was at the airport.

But what I want to point out is this. At that lunch:

I did shake my head and say, "Oh, why come to such a

decision." The decision was taken. Yet it would seem

that  the interests of the people of Singapore  were

only  entrusted to the P.A.P. and the  P.A.P. only.

Nobody  else. Anybody else who wants to do  it, and

because we are on this side of the House: we  happen

to  sit  in front of the Barisan; very soon Lim  Yew

Hock  may  become a Communist too. I  do  not  know.

Could be. By their way of reasoning, it could be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk of the referendum. Of course, the

referendum was again attacked by the Opposition. Not

me.  The Barisan, the good ex-comrades of the P.A.P.

But  what did the Prime Minister in his speech  say?

The  Prime  Minister,  a very  responsible  man!  He

admitted this unashamedly in his speech. "You  know,

we  worked in such a way that we rigged the counting

of  the  votes.  51 tables for 51 divisions.  Nobody

knew  where  they  were." But we knew.  The  Barisan

Sosialis are clever boys. They put in suns of  paper

to  show  that this is from Anson; or  that  man  is

living  in  Cairnhill Road, so it must be Cairnhill;

or that woman is living in Toa Payoh, so that is Toa

Payoh. There was a game going on between the Barisan

and the P.A.P. They say we are little innocents.  We

are  innocent? We are clean. We do not stoop to such

dirty  practice. We knew what was going on. Did  the

Member  for  Farrer  Park  not  say  in  very  sober

language  that  we gave the P.A.P. our  support  on

Malaysia?  We gave the P.A.P. our support for  Paper

Cmd.  33.  We gave the Prime Minister all the  elbow

room he wanted, the whole stage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



to  play  with  and  to  perform  on.  This  is  not

cheating,  Sir.  This  does mean  to  say  that  the

referendum  is rigged. No. It s the way  the  P.A.P.

wanted  to  find  out for their own  P.A.P. selfish

ends.  "Here in Hong Lim, how many blank votes.  The

Member  for  Hong Lim cannot know. But I know."  The

P.A.P.  Prime  Minister knows. "Ah, it  is  nothing.

Only  18  per cent. Forget the Member for Hong  Lim.

Tanjong  Pagar? Ah, it does not matter. 12 per  cent

and  still  nothing. We could still win.  The  rural

areas? Jurong? Oh my God, Jurong is 49 per cent." So

they  knew  there was 49 per cent in  Jurong.  Tidak

Apah.  They know how to work. So you see  that  they

are  playing  the party game the whole  time  - party

politics  -  instead  of getting  to  work  for  the

interest of the people of Singapore. The Barisan was

trying  to  shoot  down the P.A.P. and  the  P.A.P.

wanted  to  choke  the Barisan.  "Got  them  by  the

throat" - I think that was the expression used.  That

is  not  the way. We do not mind letting the  P.A.P.

know in a crooked way how the voting went. We do not

worry  about  that  because  as  sure  as  there  is

retribution,  that  retribution  will  come  to  the

P.A.P. on polling day - the general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> When?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is left to the Government.

Maybe  they have to consult the stars whether it  is

to be 31st December or 2nd March. I do not know. But

they might have to consult the stars



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



now. They are becoming a bit superstitious. They

might have to consult the stars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Consult a psychoanalyst. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, "gangsters" is the Prime

Minister's pet subject. "You know, we have  now  got

the  Federation Government to delegate to us  powers

to  control gangsters. You watch out." But, Sir,  we

do  not play that kind of game. All I would like  to

say, and I would ask the P.A.P. to laugh it off, was

that   Tan   Gak  Eng  -  the  Assistant  Organising

Secretary,  assistant  to  the  Minister  for   Home

Affairs,  who was organising the P.A.P. - was  nabbed

by  the  P.A.P.  Gangster! Five  expelled  Committee

members  of  the  Jurong Branch of the  P.A.P. were

nabbed. Gangsters! So what. They nabbed them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who says they are gangsters?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So who used the gangsters -
