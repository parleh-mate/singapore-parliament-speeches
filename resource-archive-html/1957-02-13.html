<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>SOLICITOR-GENERAL'S POST</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Malayanisation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether  it is the intention of the Government  to

Malayanise the post of Solicitor-General which has

become vacant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): The post

of Solicitor-General is not one of those posts set

out  in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 55 of 1956 to  be

malayanised  immediately. It is a  post  to  which

local  officers  and expatriate officers  who  are

asked  to remain in service can aspire during  the

next  five years. The Member for Tanjong Pagar  is

referred  to  the heading "Legal Service"  in  the

Schedule of the Sessional Paper referred  to,  and

also  to  the  conditions under  which  expatriate

officers  are asked to remain in service,  as  set

out in paragraph 11 of the same paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Chief Minister not

agree  that  if we are to malayanise  the  job  of

Attorney-General in the not too distant future, it

should  be  desirable to have a Malayan Solicitor-General now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the position of the

Attorney-General is dependent on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



the constitutional talks in London early in March.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is the Chief Minister aware

that  the  question  is not the  position  of  the

Attorney-General, in the new constitution, but the

colour of the skin of the holder of the post?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>TRADE UNIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Legislation to remove disabilities)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  and Welfare whether the Government intends

to  introduce  legislation to remove the  existing

disabilities  of  Trade Unions to  participate  in

political activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, legislation to permit

trade  unions to set up political funds  is  being

drafted, and the Government intends to introduce a

Bill  at  an  early  date.  With  regard  to   the

affiliation   of   trade  unions  with   political

parties,  trade  union  organisations  are   being

consulted as to their views and as soon  as  these

are  received, the Government will give  immediate

consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CRACKER FIRING INCIDENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Police precautionary measures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether he will state the number and nature of the

incidents  caused by the indiscriminate firing  of

crackers  during the Chinese New Year period,  and

whether  he is satisfied that adequate precautions

have been taken by the police in this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Sir, incidents caused by

cracker  firing  as  reported by  the  departments

concerned  are  as  follows. The  police  received

reports  of  only nine incidents.  Three  were  of

public brawls over cracker firing, two of burns to

children, three of crackers causing damage  inside

buildings  and  one of nuisance to  women  in  the

streets.  Thirty-six cases of injury from crackers

were  treated  as  out-patients at  the  hospital.

There  were two ambulance calls but one  of  these

was probably not due to cracker injury. There were

eight  fire calls. In four of these, serious fires

could have developed, and in the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



four  there was no risk. I am satisfied, Sir, that

the  police took such precautions as were possible

to  deal promptly with incidents involving  danger

to person or property.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

widespread public concern in this matter, will the

Chief  Secretary give an assurance that Government

will   take  very  careful  steps  to   see   that

hooliganism  does  not  take  place   during   the

traditional firing of crackers in future?



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Sir, we shall certainly do

all  that we can to prevent the traditional firing

of  crackers  on this festival being  used  as  an

occasion  for violence and disorder by  hooligans,

but  I am sure the hon. Member will agree with  me

when  I say that the question of limiting nuisance

over  this festival must depend very largely on  a

sense of responsibility by members of the public,

particularly  parents, and on the  cooperation  of

the  public  in  seeing that the  proprieties  are

observed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DAILY DIGEST OF NON-ENGLISH PRESS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Chief

Secretary whether he will make available to the

English-reading public of Singapore by public

subscription the Information Services' Daily

Digest of  Non-English Press.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, the request to make the Daily

Digest generally available to the public raises  a

number  of problems which I have not yet  had  the

time  to resolve, and I regret, therefore, that  I

am  not  yet in a position to give the hon. Member

an answer to his question. I will, however, inform

him as soon as a decision has been reached.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Will the Chief Secretary give some

indication as to the probable period when  he  may

be in a position to inform me of what his decision

is?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I am sorry, Sir, that the Member for

Cairnhill  should imply that I  am  not  making  a

serious attempt to give an answer. I hope to  give

him an answer within a fortnight.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Thanks.

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL SPECIALIST FEES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief

Secretary:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to state the total amount of professional

fees  earned  by  each  of the  following  medical

specialists:    surgeons,   ophthalmic    surgeon,

orthopaedic surgeon, radiologists, ear,  nose  and

throat   surgeon,  pathologists,  physicians   and

gynaecologists and obstetricians, whether employed

by  Government or by the University, for  each  of

the years 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) what amount of the fees earned in each case

is  retained  by the medical specialist  mentioned

above,  and  what amount is paid to the Government

or  to the University; and the basis of allocation

of those fees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, this information is regarded as

confidential since it is supplied by the  officers

concerned on the strict understanding that  it  is

kept confidential. The amount of fees earned to be

retained  by the officer concerned is governed  by

Regulation  27  of  the  Fees  (Public   Officers)

Regulations, 1951 which were published as  Council

Paper No. 26 of 1954.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is the Chief Secretary aware

that  there  is great public concern at  the  fact

that it is reputed that some of these specialists

earn,   with   the   use  of   public   equipment,

specialists'  fees  in  the  region  of   $70,000,

$80.000 and $90,000 a year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I am not aware of such public

concern.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If the Chief Secretary knows

that  these  figures are true, would  he  not  be

concerned that such fees are being earned with the

use of public equipment and public funds?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> No, Sir. I cannot accept the

implication   that  the  specialist  officers   in

Government employment earn fees which are  out  of

proportion  to  their  specialist  knowledge   and

skill, or out of proportion to the earnings of the

medical profession in private practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is the Chief Secretary aware

that, in the case of a large



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



number of local men who are specialists, they  were

trained  to  be  specialists  at  enormous   public

expense?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are getting into a debate. That is

not   allowed.  The  hon.  Member  will   have   an

opportunity,  perhaps on the  Adjournment  or  some

other occasion, to raise the point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CHEST PHYSICIANS AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>RADIOLOGISTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief

Secretary  whether  the chest  physicians  and  the

radiologists  of  Tan Tock Seng Hospital  and  T.B.

Clinic,  the  Medical Superintendent  of  Trafalgar

Home,   and   the   Medical   Superintendent    and

Physiologist  of Woodbridge Hospital,  are  Medical

Specialists,  and  what  is  the  total  amount  of

professional  fees earned by each of these  Medical

Specialists for each of the years 1955 and 1956.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, the chest physicians and

radiologists of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and the

Medical  Superintendents of the Trafalgar Home  and

Woodbridge  Hospital are specialists. There  is  no

physiologist at the Woodbridge Hospital. The amount

of  fees  earned by each officer is again based  on

the confidential returns made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Chief Secretary agree

to  a  special committee to investigate this matter

and make a report to this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, perhaps I should tell the hon.

Member that we are already engaged in reviewing the

present  regulations governing  the  retention  and

earning of fees by these specialists. I do not want

to  imply,  when  I  say that, that  there  is  any

question or any suggestion that these officers - many

of  whom  are very distinguished members  of  their

profession - are  earning  fees  which  are  out   of

proportion.   But   there   are   a    number    of

unsatisfactory   features   about    the    present

regulations.  One, for example, is the  discrepancy

between  the fees earned by officers of  comparable

distinction   in   different   branches   of    the

profession, and we are now, and have been for some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



time, engaged in a review of these regulations with

a view to revising them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is the committee that the Chief

Secretary  has referred to aware that the Municipal

Analyst  was earning $5,000 a month in  fees  until

the  City  Council decided to abolish the right  to

collect fees?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I am afraid I cannot tell the hon.

Member whether the committee is aware of that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LAND TITLES IN BEDOK SETTLEMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands and Housing when titles  to  the

land   now  occupied  by  persons  under  Temporary

Occupation  Licence  in the Bedok  Settlement  will

begin to be issued.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Survey Department is already

surveying  the  Bedok region according  to  present

occupation  and,  on completion of  this  work  and

agreement  on  occupation boundaries,  title  plans

will be prepared for the issue of leases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Is the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing aware of  the  urgent

demand of the occupiers of the land? If so, can  he

give an early date when the titles will be issued?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> We will give every

consideration to hasten the work in progress now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ELECTRICITY AND WATER FOR SEMBAWANG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Minister for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing what steps  is

the  Government  taking  to  supply  the  following

facilities  to  the  residents of  Sembawang  Rural

District:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) street lighting and electricity for private

houses   between  the  11th  milestone   and   15th

milestone Sembawang Road;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) more public water standpipes for the

District.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the City Council is about to lay a cable and

establish a sub-station at the 13th mile, Sembawang

Road,  which  will make it possible for  the  Rural

Board  to consider the provision of street lighting

where  it is needed and for houses in that vicinity

to  apply for domestic supplies. The answer to  the

second part of the question is that the Rural Board

is  already considering the installation of two new

standpipes  and  the re-siting  of  three  existing

standpipes,  and  also  the  installation  of   two

others, one at the 13th milestone and the other  at

the 15th milestone Sembawang Road.

<div align="center"><b>MORE HOUSES FOR WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Minister for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing what steps  is

the  Government  taking to  ensure  that  more  and

cheaper  houses will be built for ordinary working-class people.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would refer

the  hon. Member to paragraph 4 of the White  Paper

on  housing subsidy policy which was tabled at  the

last sitting of the Assemb1y.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>GRANT-IN-AID REGULATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether  he  is  aware  of  the   public

opinions expressed on the Grant-in-Aid Regulations,

1957, and whether he proposes to make amendments to

the Regulations to meet them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to

the  question  is yes. I am aware of criticisms  of

grant-in-aid regulations from certain quarters, but

so  far  I  have  received  very  few  constructive

proposals. These, for the most part, have  involved

only  minor  changes to remove possible  causes  of

misunderstanding, and I have already promised  that

these  changes  will be made at an  early  date.  I

would   add  that  the  regulations  are   designed

primarily  to protect the interests of  pupils  and

their parents, and to ensure that public funds  are

wisely and properly accounted for.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> The target date set by the

Minister to permit Chinese schools to apply for the

full grant-in-aid is April 1. In view, however,  of

the   important  amendments  promised  now  by  the

Minister,  can he give an indication  of  when  the

final target date will be?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I have already indicated, Sir,

that  I  will  make the changes to the  regulations

which   might  cause  misunderstanding,  and  these

changes will certainly be made before April 1.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>POSTING OF CHILDREN TO SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether  he is aware  that  parents  who

registered and expected their children to be  in  a

certain  English-language school found  that  their

children  had to go to other schools far away  from

their  homes;  and  if he will  state  the  reasons

therefor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I am not sure what school

the Member for Bukit Panjang is referring to. There

are, however, certain areas where the  demand  for

places  in  schools greatly exceeds the  number  of

places  available. It has therefore been  necessary

to  direct some of the children to schools  further

from their homes than I should like. I have already

made  a  public statement expressing my regret  for

any  inconvenience caused, and my readiness  to  do

what I could to remove any avoidable difficulty  or

to  alleviate  the worst hardships. But  the  basic

trouble  is that in areas like Pearl's Hill,  there

are not nearly enough schools for all the children,

and few sites on which more schools can be built. I

am doing what I can to improve the situation but no

quick solution is possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DIFFICULTIES IN ATTENDING SCHOOL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Education to state the number of children  of  both

sexes who now cannot go to school at all on account

of the difficulties of transport



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



and of expense involved in having to go to schools

far away from their homes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I am sorry I cannot

give  the  Member  for Bukit Panjang  an  accurate

answer  to  this question. However,  children  who

could  not  be  accommodated  in  schools  in  the

densely populated urban districts were directed to

suburban schools, and it is known that some  1,600

places  which were there made available  have  not

been taken up. There are several reasons for this.

First,  the  distance is too great  for  the  very

young  children  concerned.  Second, the  parents

could  not  afford  the cost of transport.  Third,

they had applied for places in other schools aided

or  private which they had subsequently  accepted,

without  informing the Government or the Ministry.

And, fourth,  they  had already  been  posted  to

schools nearer their homes.

<div align="center"><b>OVER-AGE PUPILS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether he is aware  that  there  is  a

large number of over-age pupils of both sexes  who

were  not  allowed to sit for the Common  Entrance

Examination  for Secondary Schools last  year  and

who  are  now unable, although eager, to  continue

their academic study; and what does he propose  to

do about them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Yes, last year the Ministry

organised special evening classes for pupils  from

announce, Sir, that the Indonesian Government  has

now agreed to free trade channels to Indonesia for

30   per  cent  counter-exports  originating  from

Singapore in part payment for produce imports from

barter areas. Hitherto, such exports had to revert

solely  to  the barter areas. Now, local merchants

may  supply  up  to two-thirds of  their  counter-export   commitments  direct  to   the   following

Indonesian  main  ports  in  the  form  of   rice,

building  materials,  tools, machinery,  transport

items  and  so on. The ports are Belawan,  Padang,

Palembang,  Tanjong  Priok,  Semarang,   Surabaya,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the

recommendation of His Excellency the  Governor  to

proceed  with this Bill, and I beg to move,  "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, proposes the introduction of

light  dues to be paid by shipping using the  port

of  Singapore, and the establishment  of  a  Light

Dues  Fund which will be administered by  a  Light

Dues Board. In Singapore at present, no light dues

are  charged  and, as a result, the Colony  budget

has  to  bear  the  cost  of  the  maintenance  of

lighthouses, flashing beacons and light buoys.  It

has also to meet the salaries, allowances, cost of

uniforms  and  rations  for lighthouse  personnel,

together with other similar items attributable  to

shipping  lights.  However, in the  Federation  of

Malaya,  Hong Kong and the British territories  in

Borneo, as well as in all other major ports of the

world,  shipping is made to pay for these services

by the payment of light dues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Allen Report on the Major Ports of Malaya

which  was  published in 1950 advocated  that  the

cost  of providing these navigational aids  should

be  charged to shipping in the form of light dues.

The  shipowners have indicated - though reluctantly,

I  must confess - that they have no objections.  The

scale  of  fees proposed in the Schedule  to  this

Bill  has  been carefully assessed in relation  to

the  services provided and the cost, so  that  the

fees are kept down to as low a figure as possible.

For  the  sake of comparison, Sir, I  may  mention

that  whereas in the Federation the fees  are  ten

cents  per net registered ton, our scale  is  only

two cents per net registered ton for ships working

cargo,  and  one  cent for ships  calling  in  for

bunkers, etc. Also, in order that the dues may not

throw an undue burden on ships calling very often,

the  collection of dues has been restricted  to  a

maximum  of ten times per year per ship. Provision

has  also  been made for the exemption of  fishing

boats, small craft, Singapore Government ships and

ships  of  war, and an annual rate has been  fixed

for Singapore registered ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that if light dues are

introduced on the scale proposed in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



Schedule  to  this Bill, the money to be  collected

and  paid  into the Light Dues Fund will amount  to

$414,000 per annum. The Fund will be devoted solely

to  the  maintenance and improvement of  light  and

navigational aids.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Light Dues Board will consist of the Master

Attendant  as  Chairman, and  six  members  to  be

appointed  by  me, and I propose to  give  adequate

representation to shipping interests. Sir, I beg to

move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 1, line 6, after the full stop, to insert

the figure "-(1) ";



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out lines 13 to 17; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 2, after

line 6, to insert the following new sub-clause (2) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) The tonnage in this Ordinance referred to

means the net tonnage:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that in the case of a ship whose net

registered tonnage has not been ascertained, the

gross tonnage shall be deemed to be the net

registered tonnage."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason, Sir, for this amendment is that the

word  "tonnage"  is not referred to  in  the  other

clauses  of  the Bill. The suggested  amendment  is

based  on  Section  3 (d) of the Merchant  Shipping

Ordinance.

new sub-clause (2) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) The tonnage in this Ordinance referred to

means the net tonnage:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that in the case of a ship whose net

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of

insert the word "light".

should  be only to tons as in the Schedule to  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.42 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the

recommendation of His Excellency the  Governor  to

proceed  with  this Bill. Sir, I  therefore  move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the lot of the seamen in this region is a

hard one. Not only has a seaman to work hard for a

living  but  also,  by  the  very  nature  of  his

occupation,   he   has  to   face   stretches   of

unemployment on shore when he has finished serving

articles  on a ship, not knowing when he  will  be

offered employment on another. In addition to this

occupational uncertainty, he has in the past  been

the victim of unscrupulous ghaut serangs,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



who  have  fattened themselves on this unfortunate

type  of workers. These ghaut serangs were  agents

who  were  licensed  to  supply  seamen,  and  who

charged fees from seamen for this service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order, Sir, to eliminate the ghaut serangs,

the  Government of this Colony set up  a  Seamen's

Registration  Bureau entirely  under  governmental

control in 1948. Legislation was passed setting up

a  Bureau  for  the  registration  of  seamen  and

apprentices to the sea, at which they  could  make

application   for   employment,   and   to   which

notifications  of  vacancies could  be  sent.  The

legislation  also  made it an  offence  to  engage

seamen, except in an emergency, other than through

the   Bureau,   This  amending  legislation   also

constituted a Seafarers' Administration Board with

an  independent Chairman, three members  nominated

by the shipowners and three by the Seamen's Union.

The  Board was to act purely as an advisory board,

to  give  advice  to the Master Attendant  on  the

procedure of registration and the working  of  the

Board,  and  to  advise the  Governor  on  matters

arising out of the working of the Bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Board never functioned smoothly or

effectively   from   its  inception   and   became

hamstrung from March 1950, when vacancies  in  its

membership  were not replaced. From  then  on, it

became  moribund  and shipowners and  unions  have

never  been able to offer their services or  their

advice  on  the working of the Bureau  in  matters

which  affect  them vitally. The Bureau  therefore

continued  to function entirely under  the  Master

Attendant,  with the result that it came  under  a

great  deal  of  criticism,  especially  from  the

unions,  on  the score that though a  Register  of

Seamen was maintained, it was rendered ineffective

because   unemployed  seamen  were   not   offered

employment  according  to  the  dates   of   their

applications  for employment, and because  of  the

practice  of  pre-selection by  masters  of  ships

through  their own agents. There has  been  bitter

criticism  of  partiality and favouritism  in  the

selection  of crews by masters or agents.  It  has

been said that though



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



the ghaut serang system has been abolished certain

individuals were able to set themselves  up  in  a

favourable  position  to the  detriment  of  those

seamen   who   did  not  co-operate   with   those

individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An enquiry commission was appointed in January

1950  to  look  into the working of  the  Seamen's

Registration  Bureau, the method of engagement  of

seamen,  the  constitution  and  duties   of   the

Seafarers'  Administration Board, the practice  of

pre-selection and the legality of the division  of

the  roster  of unemployed seamen into two  parts,

one  for  deep-sea seamen and the other for  local

ships.  This  commission reported in January  1951

but  no  major  changes were  recommended  and  no

action  was  taken  by  the  authorities  on  this

report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, into this confusion stepped in the

newly   appointed   Minister  for   Commerce   and

Industry, my predecessor, Mr David Marshall, and,

as a result of his intervention-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Hon. Minister has

probably forgotten himself. He cannot refer  to  a

Member by name.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir. Into this

confusion  stepped  the Member for  Cairnhill,  my

predecessor, and, as a result of his intervention,

an   ad   hoc  committee  was  appointed  by   the

Government in April 1955 to examine the working of

the  Seamen's Registration Bureau in the light  of

its experience since the commission's report. This

Bill  that  is  now  before  hon.  Members  mainly

follows the recommendation made by this committee,

except for a portion of the procedure set out  for

the  engagement  of seamen. The intention  of  the

Bill is to incorporate a Seamen's Registry Board -

on  which  will  be represented in equal  numbers,

representatives  of  Government, shipowners   and

seafarers,  under  an independent  chairman.  This

Board  will  in  future  be  responsible  to   the

Minister  for  Commerce  and  Industry   for   the

registration of seamen at the Registry Board,  and

for  their  selection for employment according  to

the  procedure laid down in the Bill. As it is the

intention  of  Government  that  the  Board   will

eventually be independent of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



Government, it is thought fit to set it up  under

a  separate Ordinance rather than by an  amendment

of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main duty of the Board will be to establish

and  maintain one or more registers of seamen and,

in  its discretion, to limit its or their size  by

various qualifying requirements, so as to create a

balanced  labour market which will serve not  only

the  needs of the shipping industry, but also,  at

the   same  time,  ensure  that  there   will   be

reasonable  continuity  of  employment   for   all

registered seamen in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure for engagement, Sir, set out in

the  Bill will guarantee to ship-owners reasonable

freedom  of  choice  of crew, and  to  the  seamen

concerned  reasonable freedom of choice  of  ship.

This  will  not  only  overcome  the  grounds   of

criticism  that the present Bill is subjected  to,

but  will  also  fully accord with the  resolution

adopted at the international Labour Organisation's

Asian Maritime Conference in Nuwara Eliya, Ceylon,

in  October 1953, at which the Government of  this

Colony  was  represented. For the  information  of

hon.  Members, I may add that this conference  was

gravely  concerned with the malpractices prevalent

in  the recruitment of seamen in a number of Asian

countries,  and  recommended a solution  on  lines

similar to what the present Bill proposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable freedom of choice of crew by the

shipowner means that his choice of crew should not

be  unlimited.  To  this end, it  is  provided  in

clause  5  (2) (b) that, if a shipowner  fails  to

select any registered seaman, or selects less than

the   number  he  requires  from  the   names   of

registered   seamen  put  forward  for   selection

according  to  the priority on the  Register,  the

shipowner   will   be  given  only   one   further

opportunity to make or complete his selection from

a  second list of names of registered seamen  next

in  order of priority on the Register. Clause 5 of

the  Bill  introduces the principle  of  a  strict

roster  for  the selection of seamen by shipowners

with  a  view to their employment. This  provision

is, likely  to  be  very  strongly  resisted   by

shipowners  for  reasons which  hon.  Members  may

guess themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it is a provision on which

the   unions   will  not  compromise   under   any

circumstances. I therefore repeat again, Sir, that

the  advantage  of the strict roster  system  laid

down  in  the  Bill is that it will do  away  with

favouritism by shipowners' selectors and lay at

rest   for   ever  the  charge  by  unionists   of

favouritism by the Registration Bureau  officials.

It  will  also give all registered seamen  a  fair

chance of finding employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill requires all selection of seamen with a

view  to  employment  to be  made  by  responsible

employees  of the shipowner or agent, or  by  the

Secretary  of  the  Board, and,  in  the  case  of

foreign vessels, by consular officials approved by

the  Board  to act as selectors. These  selections

have to be made at the Board's office. Seamen  who

are  re-engaged within a period of seven days  for

service  on the same ship will not be required  to

present  themselves  for  selection  through   the

Seamen's   Registry  Board,  but  with  one   very

important proviso, and that is provided that these

re-engagements are limited to a maximum period  of

four  years  on the same ship. This limitation  of

the period of service of a seaman on the same ship

to  a maximum of four years is necessary to enable

the  other  seamen  on  the  Register  to  have  a

reasonable chance of finding employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seamen who come from territories other than the

Federation  of Malaya intending to join  ships  in

Singapore   will  not  be  required   to   present

themselves  for  selection at the Registry  Board,

provided  that before their arrival in the  Colony

they  have  signed  articles.  This  provision  is

necessary  to ensure that foreign seamen  are  not

given  opportunities  of  seeking  employment   in

Singapore  without being required to  comply  with

the  procedure  laid  down in  the  Bill,  and  to

protect   local  registered  seamen  from   unfair

competition  by foreign seamen in  the  matter  of

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seamen who are left behind in the Colony and who

have  applied for engagement with a view to  their

being  sent out of the Colony are not required  to

be selected in accordance with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



procedure  laid down in this Bill. The reason  for

this is obvious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, the Bill gives the Minister

the  power to make rules for the carrying  out  of

the  objects of the Ordinance, and also gives  the

Board  power to make regulations after  consulting

the  Minister to enable the Board to carry out its

functions under the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that this legislation will be

welcomed  not  only  by all the  Members  of  this

House, but also by the ship-owners and the unions.

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we support this Bill. The

Minister for Commerce and Industry has recited  in

his  speech  the  fact that the unions  have  made

charges  of  malpractices in the old  Registration

Bureau. The tone in which he recited them in  this

House  implied that they were baseless and without

foundation,  that  these  charges  were  in   fact

untrue. But I think the number of seamen that have

sought help from their unions and are left without

redress because of the completely arbitrary way in

which  the  Master  Attendant  could  operate  the

roster, has led to a great deal of dissatisfaction

in  the past. We therefore welcome, and the unions

welcome,  the  fact that the method  of  selection

will now be laid down in the Ordinance itself,  in

other  words, the margin of discretion to  whoever

operates  the  roster  is reduced  to  the  barest

minimum, and  the reasonable choice  offered  the

employer will be one which will mean that,  whilst

he  is still given the freedom of choice, he  will

not  be  in  a  position to select those  whom  he

desires but who are well down the roster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that when the Registration Bureau was

first  instituted, it got rid of the evil  of  the

ghaut serangs, and I was glad to hear the Minister

speak of them in derogatory terms. People like Mr

Abdul  Majid,  founder-member of the Labour  Party

and one-time President of the Labour Party, he was

a  ghaut  serang, and quite rightly they have  now

been assigned to oblivion. We hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>



that  with this new Registration Bureau the seamen

will get a fairer deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the Minister is aware that there is

one  very thorny problem to which the unions  have

not   found  an  answer;  that  is  the   declared

intention of the Government to reduce the  roster.

As  I understand it, there are no less than 20,000

on this roster, and it is proposed to reduce it to

some  10,000. I do not say that, on principle,  it

is bad to reduce the roster if, in fact, there are

innumerable  persons  on the  roster  who  are  no

longer   seamen,  who  either  through   sickness,

infirmity  or  old  age, or personal  inclination,

have  given up the sea as an occupation. But  what

are  these  tests, what are the yardsticks, which

will  decide whether or not a man remains  on  the

roster, is entitled to get a job, or whether he is

struck off the roster and is forever debarred from

going   to   sea   to  earn  his  living?   Unless

consultation   takes   place   with   the   unions

beforehand,  and methods of selection or  criteria

of selection are agreed upon, there is bound to be

a  great deal of dissatisfaction and a great  deal

of  trouble  even  before the roster  is  settled.

That, of course, does not in any way detract  from

the  merits of the Bill, but I do ask the Minister

to  bear  in mind the fact that unless he can  get

the  unions  to  feel  that the  roster  has  been

properly settled, there will be no end of  trouble

over the roster itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I take

pleasure in supporting this measure which  is  yet

another to the credit of the Government in seeking

to  protect  the seamen of Singapore, who  in  the

past  have  been  in a completely hopeless  state,

bludgeoned   by   a   powerful   organisation   of

shipowners wholly responsible for the malpractices

of which we have heard in the selection of seamen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see some further measure of

protection  for this group. The Bill is  a  fairly

well thought out one, and I am happy to learn that

the  Opposition is supporting it. But I would like

to  draw the attention of the Minister responsible

to the need for investigating the possibilities of

applying  sanctions  to  shipping  which  seek  at

present  to  avoid engaging our seamen - which  they

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



been  doing  traditionally - and  going  abroad,  to

Karachi or Calcutta, for their needs. I know  that

the  issues raised by that problem are  of  a  far

wider  character, but they must be tackled, and  I

hope  that this Assembly will, in the not  distant

future, hear more from the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meanwhile, Sir, I would like, as a

citizen,  to express my appreciation of a  measure

in the right direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose-

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir, the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  stated that  I  recited  the

allegations  hurled at the Seamen's  Registration

Bureau in tones which implied that I thought  the

allegations    were    baseless    and    without

foundation.  Sir,  in  the  absence  of  definite

proof  of  favouritism and partiality,  I  cannot

definitely  state that it did exist, but  I  must

say  clearly here, Sir, that I have been  unhappy

with  the  working of the Bureau - and so has  been

my  predecessor - and that is why the whole purpose

of  appointing this ad hoc committee to  go  into

the  working of the Bureau shows that both of  us

have  been  unhappy over the way the  Bureau  has

been   functioning.  As  an   outcome   of   that

unhappiness, this Bill is the result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I must warn this House that the

principle   proposed  in   the   Bill   has   wide

implications. The shipowners have told me that  if

the roster system is insisted upon, they will feel

free to recruit seamen elsewhere, for example,  in

Hong Kong, which is one of our competitors for the

supply of seamen. Therefore, I am proposing,  Sir,

that this Bill should go to a Select Committee.  I

do hope that this Committee will consider the Bill

quickly and report back before the next sitting of

the  Assembly, so  that we can have  the  measure

passed as quickly as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that was raised by the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar was the reduction of the roster

from  20,000 to 10,000, and his query  about  what

tests  are to be applied in the selection of names

to  be put on the roster. The tests to be applied,

Sir,  I  leave  entirely to the Board.  Clause  4,

paragraph (b) of the Bill, on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



page  3, states: "The duties of the Board  shall

be . . ."; then paragraph (b) "...

upon  application  by  a  person  desiring  to  be

registered as a seaman and upon his satisfying the

prescribed qualifications to enter his name in the

appropriate  register  and  issue   him   with   a

registration  card;".  These  qualifications  will

therefore  have to be worked out by the Board,  on

which  the unions' representatives will be present

in   equal   number  to  the  representatives   of

shipowners and the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly, Sir, I can say that the present roster

contains  more  than 20,000 names - in  fact,  about

25,000, if I am not mistaken - and possibly if a new

register  is  opened, we may  find  that  probably

10,000 of these may not register because they have

found other employment, or some of them have died,

shifted  and so on. Many of them are not traceable

at  the  moment.  This  fact  alone  may  mean   a

reduction  of  about  10,000 names  when  the  new

register  is  being compiled. Further,  the  Board

will  conduct a medical test, and it may find that

a  few  thousand more seamen may not be  medically

fit  to  be registered. This is a matter  for  the

Board to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question raised by the Member for Cairnhill,

Sir,  about sanctions to be applied to ships which

avoid recruiting seamen here and going to Calcutta

or Karachi to do so - the main competitor against us

for the supply of seamen is Hong Kong, not so much

Calcutta  or Karachi. This is a question which  is

very  difficult to answer because you cannot force

a  foreign-registered ship - say, one registered  in

Britain  or the Netherlands or Panama - to  take  on

seamen here. Singapore is just one of the ports of

call of such a ship and if we insist that any ship

calling here must take on seamen here, India  will

insist on the same thing, and so will Indonesia. I

do not think we can do anything about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

Shipping  Ordinance in order to ensure  X-ray  and

medical  examination of registered  seamen  before

each   of   them   is   engaged.   These   medical

examinations  are distinct from the X-ray  medical

examination provided for in the Seamen's  Registry

Board  Bill which I moved just now and under which

persons   must  successfully  undergo  a   medical

examination  before  they  are  qualified  to   be

registered  as  seamen.  The  medical  examination

prescribed in this Bill will be required prior  to

each engagement of a seaman, to ensure that he  is

in  a  good state of health and free from  disease

when he signs on a ship. There is provision in the

Bill  for the establishment of a panel of  medical

practitioners approved by the Minister for  Health

to examine seamen before engagement. Power is also

given to the Minister for Health to prescribe  the

fees to be charged for the examination. Sir, I beg

to move.

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is common knowledge to Members of

this  House that we are making arrangements to hold

a census in June. During the course of making those

arrangements and completing the plans to  take  the

census,  a number of points have come to notice  on

which  it  is  considered desirable  to  amend  the

Census  Ordinance. As a result, Sir, this  Bill  is

now before the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the amendments is set out in some

detail in the Explanatory Note and I shall not take

up  the time of the House in going through them  in

detail.  Very briefly, they first of all bring  the

Ordinance  up  to  date by providing  that  reports

should come to this Assembly and by transferring to

the   appropriate  Minister  certain   powers   now

exercised by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a new provision to enable

further abstracts to be taken from the census

reports for use in welfare and other research

projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lastly, there is a new provision which is

contained in the Schedule which specifies the

particulars which may be sought from the population

during the census. At the present moment, our

Ordinance gives full power to the Governor in

Council to lay down such particulars as they think

fit. We shall now, in this Schedule, limit the

field within which questions may be asked. Sir, I

beg to move.

set out in the Order Paper, that is

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 2, line 36, to leave out the words

"require the Superintendent of Census to".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of that amendment, Sir, is to delete

the reference to the Superintendent of Census

because it is possible that the post of

Superintendent of Census will not be filled after a

census has been taken, and it is better, therefore.

to leave it to the Minister to obtain the extracts

from the Statistics Department.

stand part of the Bill."

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Is the Hon. the Chief Secretary

aware that Section 17 of the Census Ordinance now

requires amendment in view of the amendments he has

now made to clause 16? This comes from making

hurried amendments. Section 17 says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any census officer and any person employed by

the Superintendent of Census in the preparation

of the abstracts to be made by him under the last

preceding section-".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this can no longer apply because we are not

referring to the person employed by the

Superintendent of Census



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



in the preparation of abstracts to be made by him.

I  may  be  wrong, Sir. I have looked through  the

Ordinance  very quickly - I have had  no  notice  of

this - and it may well be, Sir, that the Minister in

charge   of   the   Bill  would  like   to   defer

consideration of the Committee stage  to  a  later

date,  in  view  of the amendments,  and  to  seek

assistance  from the Attorney-General's Department

as  to whether any consequential amendments may be

required to other sections of the Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The matter certainly does not arise

under  the  present Bill, except  incidentally.  I

take  it  that  the Hon. the Chief Secretary  will

take note of it, unless he wishes to say anything?

that this Bill has been hurriedly drafted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On the Schedule, Sir,

it  seems to me that under item 6, being as it is,

the  citizen  may be compelled to give information

of   an   extremely   personal  and   confidential

character. The words are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any other information with respect to which it

is  desirable  to  obtain statistical  information

with  a  view to ascertaining the social or  civil

condition of the population."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I know what is intended but I was

wondering,  Sir,  whether  the  Hon. the   Chief

Secretary would consider eliminating the extremely

wide  wording  of  this  particular  part  of  the

Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member moving an amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> No, Sir. I am just drawing the

wide character of this particular aspect of the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, if the Hon. the Chief

Secretary will assure the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Cairnhill that he is not proposing  to

carry out a Kinsey Report, a copy of which I  once

saw  at the Member for Cairnhill's bungalow by the

sea,  I  am sure the Member for Cairnhill will  be

quite happy, and so will we.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, unlike the Member for Cairnhill

and  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar,  I  am  not

familiar with the Kinsey Report, but I can explain

that  the  drafting of this item 6 in the Schedule

has been based on the following consideration. The

present  position, as I said in moving the motion,

is  that the law imposes no restriction whatsoever

on  the type of particulars which may be asked  in

the  census. We gave thought to specifying in this

Schedule  some  limits within which the  questions

might  be  asked. We do not, of course, intend - nor

is  it  practical - to hold a census  of  the  whole

population of Singapore, to ask questions  of  too

intimate  detail. But the census,  inevitably,  of

course,   does  ask  questions  which   could   be

described  as  of  a personal and  a  confidential

character.  For  example,  one  of  the  kind   of

questions  is to ask a person whether  he  is  now

widowed  or  divorced, and he might well  maintain

that  that  was his private business. But  to  get

back to the wording of clause 6, which I think  is

the one which causes some concern, we took a look,

Sir, at legislation in other places, and we took a

look  at  the corresponding legislation in Ceylon.

There, the limit is referred to as relating to the

social,  civil  and  economic  conditions  of  the

population.  We thought, Sir, that that  went  too

far,   that   the   primary  purpose   of   census

information  was much more concerned with  welfare

conditions than with economic. We then  turned  to

the United Kingdom Act, and the words which appear

in this Schedule are taken from the United Kingdom

Act. It is truly wide but I do not think there  is

any  reason to expect that it will be abused  here

in  Singapore, and I would again remind the  House

that there is a very severe limit on the type  and

the  detail of questions which can be asked  in  a

whole population census. Inevitably, the questions

have to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



limited to very simple questions which can  almost

be  answered with a "yes" or "no", and there is  a

limit,  a  practical  limit,  to  the  number   of

questions  which we can ask. I feel, Sir,  that  I

can, with confidence, commend to the House the use

of  this phrase which has been used in the  United

Kingdom for some years.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL LAW (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>11.22 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Civil Law Ordinance which this Bill is

designed to amend provides, generally, in  section

12,  that a claim for damages may be made for  the

benefit  of the family of a deceased person  where

his  death  has  been caused by the wrongful  act,

neglect  or  fault of another. And  that  section,

Sir,  goes on to provide that a claim of that kind

must  be  brought within 12 months of the date  of

death.

Sir, the Ordinance also provides that where  the

deceased has an executor or administrator, and  no

action  for  damages  has  been  brought  by   the

executor or the administrator for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



benefit  of the family of the deceased within  six

months of the date of death, such an action can be

brought by any of the members of the family of the

deceased,   on  whose  behalf  the   executor   or

administrator might have sued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the period of 12 months to which I have

referred is considered to be too short, and it  is

proposed by this Bill to extend that period of  12

months  to  one  of  three  years.  Sir,  if  that

amendment  is made, the result would be that  this

provision  of  our law will be brought  into  line

with  the corresponding legislation of the  United

Kingdom  on which this particular part of our  law

is  based. In the United Kingdom, Sir, I think  it

was  in  1954  that the period of  12  months  was

extended to one of three years by an amendment  to

the United Kingdom law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another effect, Sir, of extending this period

from  one of 12 months to one of three years  will

be  to  make the period of limitation in cases  of

this  kind the same as that which applies  in  the

case of actions for damages for personal injury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the period of six months to which

I referred a moment ago, that is the period within

which  the members of a family cannot sue if there

is  an  executor or administrator of the deceased,

with   regard  to  that  period,  this   also   is

considered  to  be  somewhat too  short.  This  is

because it not infrequently happens that more than

six months elapse before letters of administration

are  issued,  and  until  then  the  administrator

cannot bring any action. As I have said, Sir,  the

amendment proposed by the Bill is to increase that

period  from one of six months to a period of  one

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, Sir, that there is anything

which I can usefully add to what I have said about

this  Bill. It is a very short measure but I think

Members would like to know that it has the support

of the legal profession in Singapore. I would also

like  to say that I am indebted to the Member  for

Cairnhill who, a little while ago, suggested to me

that  it was time that our law was amended on  the

lines I have indicated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that this measure will be

acceptable to hon. Members on both sides  of  this

House, and I beg to move that the Bill be now read

a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.26 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I heartily support this Bill. It

will  be  a very dreadful thing if the person  who

suffered a loss in his family through accident  is

unable to claim compensation because of one year's

limitation   and  the  fault  was  due   to   some

negligence  of  his executor or ignorance  of  the

members  of his family. I say that this  amendment

is  long  overdue, and we on this side  offer  our

strongest support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as you are no

doubt  aware, this is an amendment I had hoped  to

introduce  and I am very happy the Government  has

adopted  it  and improved it. It arises  from  the

realisation that in this colony there are many who

are  not literate in the English language and  who

are  not conscious of their rights, and it is only

many  months  after the death of  a  member  of  a

family  due to the negligence of some other person

that  members  of the family of the  deceased  are

made conscious of their right to claim damages. It

is  then often found, Sir, that, due also  to  the

delays  in  obtaining letters  of  administration,

they  are estopped by the provisions of the  Civil

Law Ordinance from pursuing their claims - quite unnecessarily estopped. There is no magic in the  12

months and in the six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say in fairness to insurance companies that

quite often they have settled claims although made

out  of  time,  but,  Sir,  the  position  is   an

unsatisfactory one where you have to depend on the

indulgence  of commercial concerns like  insurance

companies.  The  amendments  here  sought   merely

increase the time so as to give a reasonable  time

to the dependants of victims of traffic accidents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the learned Attorney-General did mention it, but I think I should add

that these amendments have in fact taken place  in

the English law about three years ago.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to support this Bill.



<br><br>11.29 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, it used to be a game among

solicitors who appeared for insurance companies to

dilly-dally  with the inexperienced solicitor  who

appeared  for the poor dependants of the deceased,

keep  him hoping and waiting until the six  months

is  up  and  the axe has fallen, and then  smartly

suggest to the inexperienced solicitor that he had

better  watch  out  for  a suit  for  damages  for

negligence   for  having  allowed  the  limitation

period to elapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support this amendment because the man-made

law which says that after a year the estate of the

person   should   either  sue  or   not   sue   is

unnecessary.  But I am concerned that  legislation

of   this   nature  has  to  await  the   personal

initiative, the personal flair of individuals. Our

legislation   is   mainly   based    on    English

legislation. Our legislation is usually introduced

several  years after that legislation on which  it

is  modelled  has  been  working  successfully  in

England. But it seems that that is the end of  the

matter,    In   innumerable   instances,    social

conditions  change  and  the  law  in  England  is

changed to meet changed conditions. But the law in

Singapore goes on without any change. Is there  no

committee, is there no machinery, that  keeps  the

law  of  Singapore up to date? Take, for instance,

the  question of contributory negligence  and  the

doctrine  of  common  employment.  They  were  two

principles  of law which obtained in  England  and

obtained in this Colony. They were iniquitous. The

doctrine of common employment said that if you are

killed or injured as a result of the negligence of

your  fellow-worker, who is in  common  employment

with  you,  then you have no remedy  against  your

employer because you are deemed to have undertaken

the  risk  of  injury by that fellow-worker.  That

doctrine  was  abolished when the  British  Labour

Party  assumed office after the end of the  Second

World War. But it was not till some seven or eight

years  later that some enterprising lawyer lobbied

the  bar and the Attorney-General, and finally got

it  through  in  Singapore. But  the  enterprising

lawyer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



had this interest because he represented many such

clients  who  were often debarred from  recovering

damages because of this doctrine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have cited two instances to show that the

position  is  unsatisfactory, that amendments  and

the  bringing  of  our law up to date  should  not

depend     upon     spasmodic    and     haphazard

amendments - that there should be some machinery  to

keep  the law all the time up to date. I think  it

should   not   be  beyond  the  Attorney-General's

Department,   in   conjunction  with   the   Legal

Department  of  the  Colonial  Office,  to  supply

Singapore  with  information on  the  progress  of

Bills,  Acts of Parliament, that have taken  place

since those Acts were adopted by the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Attorney-General, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

propose  to follow in reply the points  raised  by

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar on general questions

relating  to bringing our legislation up to  date,

but  I  would like to say this, that I  will  give

full  consideration to what he has said.  I  would

like also to add this, that of course so far as  I

am   concerned,   I  shall  always   welcome   any

suggestions which the profession may wish to  make

through   the  Bar  Committee.  I  shall   welcome

suggestions of that kind, and of course they  will

be  of  the  greatest assistance  to  me.  It  can

frequently  happen, of course, Sir, that  the  Bar

Committee which represents the profession here  is

frequently  in  touch  with perhaps  a  number  of

aspects  of legislation which do not come my  way,

so to speak, and of course in that sort of matter,

matters  affecting members of the  profession, it

would be helpful if they would make suggestions to

me.  But  of course this is a little wide  of  the

matter with which we are here concerned, and I  do

not  think that there is any other point  which  I

wish to deal with today.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Remuneration of Members)</b></div>



<br><br>11.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1)

of section 10 of the Public Service Commission

Ordinance (No. 41 of 1956), resolves that the

remuneration of the Chairman and Members of the

Public Service Commission shall be as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) for the Chairman, an inclusive salary of

$2,300 per  month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for the Deputy Chairman a retainer of $750

per  month and, in addition, $50 per day on which

he attends a meeting of the Commission with a

maximum of 20 days in any one month; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) for other Members, a retainer of $500 per

month and, in addition, $50 per day on which they

attend a meeting of the Commission with a maximum

of 20 days in any one month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that this motion will not require

any advocacy from me.  It seeks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>



the  approval of this Assembly, in accordance with

the  law,  to the rates of remuneration  which  we

consider to be appropriate for the members of  the

newly  reconstituted Public Service Commission,  a

body  charged with a task that is not only onerous

and  responsible,  but  is  undoubtedly  of  vital

importance  to  the  future  good  government   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remuneration proposed for the Chairman has

been  fixed  both in relation to the  remuneration

paid  to  the  Chairman  of  the  previous  Public

Service Commission, which was $1,890 a month,  and

also  in relation to the salary of a Judge of  the

Supreme  Court,  which, as  the  Assembly  may  be

aware,   is  $1,950,  with  the  usual  allowances

payable to Government officers. In the case  of  a

salary  of  $1,950 the variable  allowance  for  a

married  man  would  be $280, making  a  total  of

$2,230.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the statutory provision of subsection

(2)  of  section  10  of the Ordinance,  that  the

remuneration  of  the Members  of  the  Commission

shall  not  be  diminished during  their  term  of

office, we have thought it better not to link that

remuneration   in  any  way  with   the   variable

allowance   paid  to  Government   officers.   The

variable  allowance,  as  the  name  implies,   is

subject to variation and to reduction, and we have

accordingly  put  the  Chairman  on  an  inclusive

salary of $2,300 a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate for the Members of the Commission

remains  the same as that paid to the  Members  of

the  previous  Commission, and their  appointments

are, of course, on the understanding that they may

continue  their other occupations. But the  Deputy

Chairman will have greater responsibility, and  to

mark  that  we have fixed his retainer at  $750  a

month  as  compared  with $500  a  month  for  the

ordinary Member of the Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said just now, Sir, that the Chairman and

Members  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  are

undertaking  a  most onerous and important  public

duty, and I ask all Members of this House to  join

me  in  wishing them well in their task. The  time

for  criticism  and  recrimination  is  past.  The

public service is being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



rapidly  malayanised and, in a matter  of  months,

the  full  burden of work and responsibility  will

fall  on the shoulders of local officers.  At  the

same  time, we have transferred to the new  Public

Service  Commission  the full  responsibility  for

appointments, for promotions and for discipline in

the public service. These are not easy matters - and

I  speak  with  some experience in handling  them.

They  involve  mastery of the code  of  Government

regulations and administrative procedure, and they

involve  many  very  difficult and  very  worrying

personal decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman and Members of the Public Service Commission will need, Sir, the wholehearted and

unwavering support of this Assembly if they are to

discharge  their duties in the best  interests  of

Singapore, and if they are to command the prestige

and  respect both of the public and of the  public

service which are essential to their success. So I

do  hope, Sir, that they may start their  term  of

office with the unanimous good wishes of all of us

in this Assembly. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A supplement of $13,210 is required to pay

arrears  of  expatriation pay to an  officer  who,

owing  to  a misinterpretation of the regulations,

was not considered to be eligible for expatriation

pay when it was introduced in August 1947."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a most curious little item. We in

the  Assembly should want to know more of it.  How

far    does   it   go   back?   What    is    this

misinterpretation, and how is it that this man  is

going to get a bounty of $13,210?



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> As will appear from the Sessional

Paper,  the  story goes back a considerable  time.

The officer concerned was born in Portuguese India

and  was  serving  in Burma in 1923  when  he  was

offered  appointment, through  the  Government  of

India,  in  the Gardens Department of  the  Colony

Government  as a Field Assistant. He accepted  the

appointment and served in Singapore until the date

of his retirement, I think,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



in  1952.  When  the expatriation pay  rules  were

introduced,   it   was  considered - mistakenly - that

because  he  was appointed originally as  a  Field

Assistant,  which had subsequently been classified

as  a  Grade  III  post, he was not  eligible  for

expatriation pay. He petitioned the Government but

his  application was rejected on the grounds which

I have stated. Again he returned to the charge and

I  am  glad  to  say that the matter was  examined

carefully   and   it   was   clear,   on   further

examination,  that  he  was  entitled,  without  a

shadow  of  doubt, to expatriation  pay,  and  the

object  of  this vote, Sir, is merely to  right  a

wrong  which  was done in 1947. I feel  sure  that

every  Member  in this Assembly will support  this

application for the vote on these grounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> And regret the delay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Could we ask whether this man

is  now  re-engaged as a Government pensioner,  or

whether he has retired and, if so, whether he  has

retired in Malaya?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am happy to say, Sir, that the

officer  made  his  services available  as  a  re-employed pensioner to the Gardens Department after

his  retirement.  He  is still  serving  with  the

Gardens  Department and we are very glad  to  have

his  services.  He  is at the moment  residing  in

Singapore.   Whether  or  not,  on  his   ultimate

retirement  from  Government, he  will  return  to

Portuguese India or not I cannot say.

pensioner?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> This difference, which seems rather

an  absurdity, Sir, is explained by the fact that

in  certain cases the officers are put on what we

call  a  long scale which starts at a low  salary

and  works right through a whole period of 15  or

20  years; others are on a short scale which only

provides for a limited range.



<br><br>11.52 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, there is

considerable addition to the expenditure  of  the

Information Services and I think some explanation

is called for. I know we are all conscious of the

deficiencies  of that organisation in  the  past,

and if it is a question of re-organisation, well,

let us hear a little about it, and not merely  be

presented with this paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that in the past, Sir, the

most  useful aspect of that organisation  that  I

found  was  the  Daily Digest in English  of  the

vernacular  Press - the  only  opportunity   the

English-speaking citizens of this country have of

knowing what the rest, and the majority, of  the

population do and what they think, and  the  only

opportunity,  more often than not, of  refreshing

themselves  with  ideas  that  are  not   steeped

through  with  colonialism. Sir, if  we  have  to

depend upon the garbage that is dished out in the

English Press for inspiration, there would be  no

men in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask - I insist, Sir - that an undertaking be given

by  the  Hon. the Chief Secretary that, in return

for this additional payment, the Daily Digest  of

the  vernacular  Press  in the  English  language

issued by the Information Services - the only thing

so  far which they can be proud of - should be made

available  to  members  of  the  public  who  are

prepared to pay the cost thereof.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The Member for Cairnhill asked for an

explanation   of   the  reorganisation   of   the

Information  Services.  I  regret,  Sir,  that  I

cannot  add anything to the very full explanation

which  is  already given in the Sessional  Paper.

Anything  which  I  could  add  would  merely  be

padding-padding  of something which  has  already

been said.



<br><br>11.54 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, the experience of the

past  years  in the Public Relations  Office  has

shown that there is much room for improvement  in

the  organisation  for making  Government  policy

known  and for keeping the various Ministries  of

the  Government informed of the trends of  public

feeling. An organisation for the effective public

presentation  of its policies and actions  is  an

essential  requirement of a modern  parliamentary

government. The basis for such an organisation in

Singapore, Sir, already existed  in  the  Public

Relations  Officer  and his staff  working  as  a

department  within  the portfolio  of  the  Chief

Secretary. This instrument, Sir, has not been  as

effective as desired, mainly for the reason  that

the title "Public Relations Office" suggested  an

organisation  mainly of a press  liaison  agency.

The  duties of the Public Relations Officer  have

never  been defined in detail and there has never

been  any  prescribed contact between the  Public

Relations  Officer and the other  Ministries  and

Departments of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good public relations organisation, Sir, is

much  more than a press liaison unit. The  public

presentation of the Government's policy, if it is

to   be  effective,  cannot  depend  on  sporadic

campaigns  and statements arranged  according  to

the  particular needs and events, but requires  a

continuous  effort  to obtain an  atmosphere, an

audience receptive to Government policy.  To  get

this  effect, the instrument responsible must  be

accorded  the necessary degree of importance  and

authority, and be given a corresponding  position

of  trust, and facilities in carrying  out  that

trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the re-entitlement of the Public Relations

Office to Information Services itself has gone so

far to indicate the part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



it  is  to play in the Government structure, and

would  serve to lift the organisation above  what

is  commonly  but  erroneously thought  to  be  a

simple  function  of the press  liaison  officer.

Sir,  the  Government  has considered  all  these

aspects and recognises the important role  to  be

played by information services in this democratic

system  of  government in Singapore.  It  regards

that there should be adequate funds and staff  to

meet  the needs of this service. The tendency  to

neglect  the information services, Sir,  until  a

moment of crisis, is bad. It is not possible  for

information   services   to   be   an   effective

instrument overnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered all these subjects, Sir, the

Information  Services  is  now  equipped  with  a

Central  Translation Bureau, and it  is  intended

that,  from  now  on,  the  non-English  speaking

population  will  be served better  than  in  the

past. I can assure the Member for Cairnhill, Sir,

that every effort is being made to reorganise and

improve  even  the daily and weekly  digests  and

make them more effective and useful in future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am a bit

confused  by  all this because before,  when  the

Member  for Cairnhill was the Chief Minister,  we

were  so often told that the Information Services

were  excellent,  and they were  complimented  on

many   occasions.  I  remember   one   particular

occasion  most distinctly, when I  took  them  to

task for doing a lot of things irregularly with a

bias    in   favour   of   people   like    Chief

Ministers - distributing   their    speeches    and

blacking out the Opposition. As I understood  it,

everything was well and everybody was happy.  But

it  now  seems everything was not all  well,  and

even  the former Chief Minister was not happy.  I

am  therefore a little bit disturbed by all  this

uncertainty and doubt. I hope in future  we  will

not be regaled with Ministers who, having stepped

down  from  office,  thereupon  dispel  all   the

beautiful  compliments they  had  paid  while  in

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $78,180 for Head 15 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 16-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $39,600 for Head 16 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 18-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $133,180 for Head 18 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 25-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,127,143 for Head 25 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 28-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $10 for Head 28 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 50-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $49,155 for Head 50 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, on the first item which

reads, "New Subhead-item

(1)  Director of Legal Aid, Grade F ($1,620)".  I

would  like the Hon. the Chief Secretary to  tell

us, as I did not have the opportunity to question

him during the Budget debate, why this particular

post  has  been graded as F in the Civil  Service

hierarchy.



<br><br>12.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In the original report which we had on

this  question of legal aid, Sir, it  was  indeed

recommended that the post of Director should  be,

if I recall rightly, Grade D. This recommendation

was  considered  by  a  committee  consisting  of

representatives of the Ministry  of  Labour,  the

Chief  Secretary's Office and my own office,  and

it  came to the conclusion that it would be  more

appropriate,  having regard to the  duties  which

will  be  discharged by the officer holding  this

appointment, and having regard to the grading  of

posts in the Legal Service of Singapore, that  it

would be more appropriate, for the time being, if

this post were graded F.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the post has been graded F does

not  exclude the possibility that, in future,  as

the  duties attached to the appointment grow, and

perhaps  when  a  deputy has to be  appointed  to

assist  the Director, the post will be  upgraded.

For the moment, I feel that it would be desirable

for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



post  to be graded F, and hope Members will accept

that  recommendation, which has  been  made  after

most careful consideration.



<br><br>12.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am extremely

unhappy  at this grading. I would like  to  remind

the Minister responsible, and I would also like to

remind  the Front Bench, that this Legal  Aid  and

Advice Ordinance received the unanimous support of

the  House, that it was intended that the concepts

of  justice and the machinery for justice in  this

country should be made available to all the people

in  the  country. As I see it now,  Sir,  we  have

nothing  but a head peon with a sub-peon. That  is

the Department we have created to bring justice to

the people of the country and to bring the law  to

all the villagers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a suggestion that we must depend

upon the Bar for the working of the Legal Aid  and

Advice Ordinance. This Ordinance is not a lawyers'

aid  Ordinance. It is not intended  to  put  money

into  the pockets of lawyers, although as a lawyer

I have no objection to having money being put into

my  pocket! At the same time let us make it  clear

that  this  Ordinance was not intended  to  assist

members   of  this  trade  union - who   are   doing

extremely  well,  thank you! It  was  intended  to

bring  the  law to the people, and they  need  it.

Therefore, to begin with, Sir, unless this country

is going to spend fantastic sums of money which it

has  not  got,  it  has  to  create  a  large  and

efficient department, a public defence department,

and it was the intention as I understand it (and I

am  proud  that I was mainly responsible for  this

Ordinance), it was the intention that the officer-in-charge  should  have  equal  status  with   the

Attorney-General.   He  should   have   a   large,

qualified  staff. He should have branches  in  the

various  parts of the country so that he can  give

aid and advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of those ambitions and ideals we have nothing

but  a mouse! I would ask, Sir, how come that this

Ordinance,  after having gone through the  various

Civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>



Service departments, has been whittled down  to  a

farce?  We had been promised in November  1956  by

the  Chief  Minister that additional appropriation

would  be  asked for from this House  in  December

1956  to bring into effect the first part  of  the

Ordinance.  These provisions are two  months  late

already.  I take it that before they are  even  in

force there will not be a Department of Legal  Aid

at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I view with considerable concern the

approach  and attitude to this problem. Either  we

have  a  Legal Aid Department, or - if that  is  the

intention of the Government let us have it frankly

- the whole thing is going to be shelved. But I  am

quite certain that the present Chief Minister, who

as  Labour Minister at the relevant time so warmly

proposed  and carried through the Bill, would  not

and does not intend to bring about what seem to be

the  present  consequences. It may  also  be  that

representations  of the Bar Committee  are  having

their  effect,  not  upon the  Ministers  who  are

sitting  on  the  Front  Bench,  but  upon   other

organisations which are responsible for seeking to

minimise the stature of the person responsible for

this Legal Aid Department and the whole working of

the Department, and seeking to nullify it.



<br><br>12.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, may I clarify just one

point?  When I supported the Legal Aid and  Advice

Bill,   we  did  not  envisage  branches  of   the

Department  all  over  the  country,  nor  did  we

envisage  a competitor to the Attorney-General!  I

would like to clarify this point because I did not

have that in my mind when we passed the Bill.  But

I do agree with the Member for Cairnhill - even if I

cannot say so as vehemently as he has done - that  a

very  serious attempt should be made by the  Legal

Department to get this machinery going. It  is  no

use  telling the people that you have a  wonderful

democratic  machine if you do not offer  them  the

mechanics  to operate that machinery for  them  as

and when required.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that we should not call it a

Public Defence Department because if we do so  the

public  will soon lose confidence in  it.  It  has

been  said at the Bar, of course, that if you have

one  department of the Government prosecuting  and

can  nip around to the other Government department

to defend you, the public may think that it is not

likely   that  the  Government  should   want   to

contradict   itself,  that  it  should   want   to

prosecute  a man and then get the man whom  it  is

prosecuting off. Therefore the Bar would, in spite

of  all the effort of this legal aid scheme, still

be  stuffing their money with pockets - I mean their

pockets with money - I get confused when I think  of

the stories that have been floating around! If you

go  to see a government lawyer to get you off from

a  government prosecutor, how would you think  you

are  going  to  get off? Therefore,  I  would  not

dismiss so lightly the representations of the  Bar

Committee.  After  all,  they  do  represent   125

members at the Bar who, in spite of the fact  that

they  have  financial interests in this Legal  Aid

and  Advice  Ordinance, have also  considered  the

matter  carefully  and  have made  representations

based  on the principles upon which the legal  aid

scheme has been working in England. Sir, I am  not

speaking  on  behalf of the Bar  Committee  but  I

think the Member for Cairnhill was somewhat unfair

when,  in  the  heat of argument,  he  sloshed  at

everybody. I do not think the Bar Committee really

deserve to be sloshed at in that way.



<br><br>12.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Bar

Committee has been obstructing free legal  aid  to

my personal knowledge since 1939. I should imagine

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar was still  knee-high

to  a  grasshopper! Sir, if we are to depend  upon

the  Bar  for  the working of this  Ordinance,  it

would cost us far too much and, consequently,  the

Ordinance would not work. If we approach  it  from

the  practical point of view, Sir, and appoint our

own men - and we have some very fine men coming out

and  practising  at the Bar today, youngsters  who

would do credit to any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



task  assigned  to  them for the  purpose  of  the

practice  of the law - I say, Sir, that  it  can  be

worked and it can be worked at a moderate fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the public fears that one government

employee  would  not be able to defend  you  where

another  government  employee prosecutes,  let  us

remember  that in New South Wales, where  I  first

learnt  about this system, the Public  Solicitor's

Office is a flourishing one which is consulted  by

very considerable numbers who cannot afford to  go

to  a  lawyer.  The point is not  that  we  should

compel people to go and seek advice - if they do not

want it they do not have to. The point is that  we

should  try to make available to those who  cannot

afford  to  pay for legal consultation. We  should

make  available  to them at such cost  or  without

cost, as they may be able to afford, the machinery

for   enforcing  their  just  rights,   and   make

available  to them advice which they may  need  to

understand their rights. By the creation, Sir,  of

just one individual at $1,620 and an assistant, we

do  not  do so. That is my argument, and  I  would

like to ask now, Sir, for a full explanation as to

what is intended under this Legal Aid Ordinance.



<br><br>12.12 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Sir, the

meeting has been quiet so far, but now we come  to

a  position where a back-bencher of the Government

attacks  the  Government,  and  a  Member  of  the

Opposition tries to defend the Government!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I

object to being misrepresented in that way. I  was

defending myself. I do not wish to be misconstrued

by  any Member in this House, let alone the Member

for Cairnhill. I was saying something on behalf of

the  Bar  Committee because it has  been  unjustly

attacked. But let me not carry any of the  burdens

the Chief Minister has on his shoulders!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar called it a point of order.  It  is

not a point of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



order  but  appears to be a point of  elucidation.

The Chief Minister did give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I gave way, Sir, because I

am   in  a  very  friendly  mood,  even  with  the

Opposition. Sir, when the Opposition said  it  was

trying   to  say  something  to  defend  the   Bar

Committee it said something that I would have said

myself.  Sir, the purpose of putting in a  request

for  a vote for the sum in question is to set Part

I of the Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance in motion.

As  to  the other parts of the Ordinance,  I  have

pointed  out  at  previous  sittings  that  it  is

because of representations from the Bar Committee,

and  mainly because of their assurance  that  they

wish  to cooperate with this Government in  making

the  Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance work,  that  I

feel  we should hold more consultations with them.

In  moving the Second Reading of the Bill, Sir,  I

said  that  it  could only work  if  we  had, the

cooperation  of  the  Bar Committee.  However, if

after  discussions with the Bar Committee  we  are

unable  to  come to a satisfactory  solution,  the

Government  will of course have to go  ahead  with

what  the Government think is right for the people

of  Singapore. The Government have  not  given  up

hope  that  the  Bar Committee,  after  expressing

their  desire  to co-operate with the  Government,

will  not  come,  shall we  say,  to  an  amicable

solution on the opposition which they have raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the operation of Part I of the Ordinance,

Sir,  it  is felt that the posts now to be created

under  this  vote are sufficient.  The  Department

will be set going to have discussions, to work out

with  the Bar Committee the putting into operation

of  the  other parts of the Ordinance as  soon  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have remarked on the grading of the

Director of Legal Aid. In this matter, I gave  the

assurance that their views on the grading of  this

post  will be duly considered and reviewed by  the

Government, but I would emphasise that the purpose

of  this vote is to enable the Government  to  set

the Department going.



<br><br>12.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, surely the Hon.

the Chief Minister is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



conscious of the delay, as I have tried repeatedly

to  explain. For 16 years and more - for 20  years - I

have  been  trying  to get the  Bar  Committee  to

support  some kind of free legal aid. Since  1939,

Sir,I  have been trying. I had, by the grace  of

God,  to become Chief Minister before I could  get

anything  done. And now, Sir, if we are  going  to

depend  upon negotiations with the Bar  Committee,

are  we going to put any time limit to it, or  are

we  going to take another 20 years until they  can

get a government in power which they would support

in order to throw this Ordinance out? How long are

we  going to wait for the Bar Committee? How  long

are  we going to accept its obstruction or alleged

obstruction  to  the  application  of  a   measure

necessary for the welfare of the people? Just  how

long, Sir?



<br><br>12.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I have all along consistently supported  the

Member for Cairnhill in his demand for free  legal

aid,  and  I still do so. However, I do not  today

agree  with his approach to this matter.  I  think

that,  for this free legal aid scheme to  succeed,

we  will have to depend a great deal on the  legal

profession. I have been given assurances  by  some

members  of the profession that they will  support

the  scheme and I do not think there is any  point

in antagonising them now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that they have not shown much

interest  in past years, but this is  not  to  say

that they will not do so now. Practice at the  Bar

has  been very lucrative, and I am quite sure that

some  members of the Bar who have already come  to

the  age of retirement will give their best effort

to make this free legal aid scheme work.



<br><br>12.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I want to clear certain

further doubts that have been raised by the Member

for Cairnhill in his tirade against the Bar.

I  was  a  grasshopper in 1939 and I did not  then

know   who  were  the  people  who  so  resolutely

prevented   the   previous  Chief  Minister   from

carrying out his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>



ambitions with regard to free legal aid.  I  would

remind  him,  however, that the character  of  the

whole  profession is rapidly going through a great

change.  Whilst in 1939 it was an exclusive  white

man's  preserve, it is now very rapidly, parallel

with  political developments in the country  as  a

whole,  undergoing a change. The Bar is  going  to

be - and we should make it - a local man's Bar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore no point in going around

shaking  one's fist, or rattling one's  sabre,  or

brandishing  a  pen-knife  and  antagonising   120

members of the profession (and perhaps another  20

more who are awaiting entry) with whom we want  to

co-operate. We need their assistance to  make  the

machinery work. We must not go around making  what

I  know  are unfair accusations. The Bar Committee

have  not  said they will not co-operate with  the

Government. All they have said is that  there  are

certain aspects of the Ordinance which they do not

like,  and  the  Government have  said  they  will

listen to the Bar Committee's representations.  If

in  the end, however, the Government wish to  push

the  scheme through, the best the Bar  can  do  is

just  to  let  it  be. The Bar cannot  oppose  the

Government  and they know that. In  such  a  case,

however, the Bar could sit back and say: "You work

it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be another matter and the scheme would

then  depend  on  the men you can  get  into  this

public  legal aid and advice bureau and  also  the

attitude of the Bar. If the general opinion of the

Bar  is  that  the  bureau is  staffed  by  feeble

lawyers who cannot make a living at the Bar,  then

the  whole  scheme is stymied from the  beginning.

There is no point working up all this feeling just

because I happened to ask why the post was  graded

F.  I was genuinely curious to know why some Civil

Service expert had down-graded this job. I am  not

usually prone to making pleas for moderation,  but

we  must  not be unreasonable if we want  to  make

this  legal  aid  scheme work, as  I  believe  the

Member for Cairnhill does want to make it work.  I

do  not  have to be convinced as to his sincerity.

In fact, he will remember that on one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>



occasion, I think it was in 1952 or 1953, when  he

was  struggling with the then Bar Committee  which

was governed by expatriates, they appointed him  a

one-man committee and thereby shelved the problem.

But  I  would remind him that, at the moment,  the

Bar  Committee consist of six local  men  and  one

expatriate, who got in only on a re-count. It is a

local  man's Bar. Every year there are  20  or  30

students returning, and there is no point rattling

the  sabre at them. Let us make sure, first,  that

they  are really a nasty and selfish lot of people

before one rattles the sabre. Let us first try  to

make them understand that it is in their interests

to  make  the  scheme work, that it  is  in  their

interests  to make the whole legal machinery  work

efficiently, so that the democratic system can  be

preserved and they can continue to be lawyers  and

not garbage collectors.



<br><br>12.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is a

surprise to me to see the Member for Tanjong Pagar

suddenly becoming an unofficial representative  of

the Bar Committee in this House. My sympathies and

feelings go out in support of the statement by the

Member for Cairnhill. It is time for Government to

set  up free legal aid offices all over Singapore.

We  see  the P.A.P. has established Party branches

all  over  the island, promising their  supporters

free  legal  aid  and advice. Why then  cannot  we

support   the   suggestion  of  the   Member   for

Cairnhill?  It is time the Government pay  serious

attention to the Legal Aid Department. We need not

only  one  Grade  F man to run the  Department - we

want  many  more lawyers to help the people  solve

their difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to quote one example of such difficulties.

After  the  trouble  in October  last  year, many

people  were arrested and detained. The family  of

one  of them, who had been ordered to be banished,

approached  me  for  help. I  brought  them  to  a

respectable   lawyer, one  whom  I  thought   was

interested in politics and in helping the  people.

He  demanded  $2,000 to appeal on  behalf  of  the

detainee. I think it was a shame. I told  him  the

man  was  very poor but he was firm - "No money,  no

services."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, there was the poor hawker arrested

sometime ago for a minor offence who also

approached me for help. The lawyer I saw demanded

$150, so the hawker told me, "It is better to

plead guilty because then the fine will be only

$50."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of the difficulties and

hardships  facing the lower income group  and  the

poor  classes,  and I think it is high  time  that

Government   seriously,  and  with  determination,

implement  the free legal aid scheme  and  appoint

more lawyers to help the poor.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE INDUSTRIAL PROMOTION BOARD</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Advances to defray expenditure)</b></div>



<br><br>12.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's

consent to move, and do move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves under the provisions

of section 6 of the Singapore Industrial Promotion

Board  Ordinance, 1957, the allocation of advances

to  the Singapore Industrial Promotion Board up to

but  not  exceeding the sum of one million dollars

for  the  purpose of enabling the Board to  defray

expenditure   properly   chargeable   to   capital

account, including defraying initial expenses, and

for the provision of working capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the Singapore Industrial

Promotion  Board Ordinance which I moved  at  last

month's  sitting  came  into  operation  on   25th

January,  and that the Ordinance was  enacted  for

the  purpose of establishing a Board to facilitate

the  industrial  and economic development  of  the

Colony,  and to finance by loans industries  which

need  such  finances.  As stated  by  me  at  last

month's  sitting of the Assembly,  the  Government

intends that the Industrial Promotion Board should

have  at  its disposal a revolving fund to  enable

loans  to  be  granted to local industrialists  to

assist  them in their schemes to promote or expand

local industries. The sum of $1,000,000 should  be

adequate for the immediate needs of the Board  but

if  further  advances should be warranted  by  the

scope of the Board's activities, I shall bring  up

further requests to Members in the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, doubts have been expressed as to how the

Board is going to judge applications for loans. As

mentioned by me last month, section 4 (2)  of  the

Ordinance  lays  down  a  general  guide  for  the

members of the Board. I shall read section 4  (2) ,

Sir. It says,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to the provisions of section 7 of this

Ordinance,  in  carrying out the objects  provided

for  in  subsection (I) of this section the  Board

shall   have  due  regard  to  the  economic   and

commercial merits of any undertaking it  promotes,

assists,  finances or manages and shall also  take

into  consideration in considering  such  economic

and  commercial merits, the economic merits of any

other undertaking in which it has an interest  and

the  economic  requirements of  the  Colony  as  a

whole."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5 (2) , Sir, is also relevant, and it

reads,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever the Board shall lend money to or

assist  financially any undertaking, it  shall  so

far  as possible ensure that its loan or financial

assistance is not unduly in excess of any loan  or

capital  investment by any other person interested

in such undertaking."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond this guidance which is laid down in the

Ordinance, the members of the Board will  have  to

exercise their own judgment. I am sure they should

be  good  judges because section 9 (1)  lays  down

that  besides  the  Financial Secretary's  and  my

representatives on the Board, the Chairman and two

other members should be persons appearing to me to

have  had experience of, and having shown capacity

in, matters relating to banking, finance, industry

or  trade administration. They will, therefore, be

persons of mature experience capable of exercising

good judgment in such matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration, Sir, is now being given to

membership  of the Board and it is hoped  to  make

the  appointments  shortly. The  Board  will  then

select  its own Manager, who will arrange for  the

formal commencement of its activities. Sir, I  beg

to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I second it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>12.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we approved

this: in fact we passed the Ordinance creating the

Industrial Promotion Board. But I would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



touch upon a matter on which the Minister has shed

some   light,  namely,  the  appointment  of   the

Chairman.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  did  not   say

anything  against  the Public Service  Commission,

nor  did  we  withhold our felicitations  to  them

because certain persons whom it was rumoured  were

going  to  be appointed for distinguished services

to sport and other activities, were not appointed.

I would like to tell the Minister for Commerce and

Industry  that  it  is  rumoured  that  a  certain

industrialist,   who  has  retired   from   active

industrial  practice and is now making a  practice

of  going  on  commissions in  administrative  and

advisory capacities, is being considered for  this

job.  He  has not got the confidence of my  Party,

and  he  has not got the confidence of  a  lot  of

other people, who -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is it

proper  for the Member for Tanjong Pagar, on  this

particular  motion,  to indulge  in  personalities

which  are not sufficiently veiled for the  person

not to be known, and to suggest, first, that there

is  such an appointment in mind, and, second, that

he is unsuitable? Sir, the question of appointment

is  not  being raised here; the motion is entirely

for the supply of the money.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the point of whether or not it is

proper  for  Members to make derogatory references

to members of the public outside this Assembly,  I

have  already commented on another occasion - it  is

not, in fact, a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point, as to whether the remarks

are  relevant,  I find that, under the  Ordinance,

the  members of the Board are to be paid fees, and

I  take it that these fees would be coming out  of

this $1,000,000, so that perhaps, indirectly,  the

Member  is  correct in touching on the appointment

but not on how the appointment should be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The point I would make and I

will continue to make it - despite the protestations

of  the Member for Cairnhill - is this: that if they

appoint  somebody in whom we have  no  confidence,

and  in  whom  a  lot  of  other  people  have  no

confidence - I am not saying anything derogatory, I

am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>



just   stating   that  we  have  no   confidence   - the

appointment will be the subject of constant attack  and

criticism. It would mean, in effect, the gradual  loss

of  public  confidence  in  this  Industrial  Promotion

Board.  Sir, I ask the Minister to bear that  in  mind

when the appointment is being made. It is important, if

we  are  not  to  start  something  on  the  Indonesian

pattern,  that the person who is appointed to this  job

is a man of integrity, someone who has never had public

criticism levied at him before, particularly  from  the

public  service  itself. He must  be  someone  who  can

command  that confidence, so as to leave  no  doubt  in

anybody's mind that public funds are not being  fiddled

with.



<br><br>12.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we have supported  this  Industrial

Promotion  Board in the hope that more industries  will

be  saved  and  encouraged. On the  motion  asking  for

money,  we  would  like the Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry to bear in mind that members who are appointed

to  this Board should be impartial ones, because I have

a  fear  that if the people who sit on the Board should

come  from one type of business that fears competition,

they  will definitely not want to encourage other types

of  business that will compete with theirs. It will  be

best  therefore that people who are appointed  to  this

Board should be impartial people, who have no financial

interest in the matter of manufacture.



<br><br>12.40 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply, Mr Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I think the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  has misunderstood the contents  of  the

Ordinance. The Chairman is not going to be a  full-time

Chairman,  like that of the Public Service  Commission.

The Chairman and members will just come to meetings and

conduct  the business of the Board at meetings.  It  is

not  the intention to have a full-time Chairman. As  to

fees,  it depends on how much time they have to  devote

to the work of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>



the Board before I consider whether Government will  be

willing  to  pay them any fee or not. I  take  it  that

members of the Board will be persons who are well-to-do

because  they  must  be  connected,  according  to  the

Ordinance,  with  either  industry,  banking  or  trade

administration, and therefore I am sure  that  if  they

are  public-spirited they will give their services  and

experience free to the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably what the Member is referring to is the

appointment  of  the Manager, who will be  a  full-time

man,  and  who will carry out investigations  into  the

applicants'  business, industry, and so  on,  and  then

give the results of these investigations to the meeting

of the Board for them to make a decision. I do not know

which  person he has in mind, but I can assure him  and

the  Member for Serangoon that all appointments to  the

Board will be made from persons who, after a great deal

of thought, I consider to be impartial. Of course, I am

restricted  by the section in the Ordinance which  says

that  for these appointments I shall have to take  into

account that the person selected should be someone  who

has  had  experience  in  industry,  finance  or  trade

administration. This stipulation was purposely  put  in

because this type of board should be run by persons who

are experienced in the businesses concerned. If you put

anybody on the Board - a doctor or a lawyer, say - you  may

find  that  they  will not be able  to  understand  the

problems of the industries concerned which are applying

for loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point I wish to make, and that is

that the members will be appointed by me with the prior

approval  of  the  Governor in Council.  Therefore,  if

there  should be any misjudgment by one member  of  the

Council  of  Ministers, that is  by  the  Minister  for

Commerce  and Industry, there will be other Members  of

the  Council of Ministers who will have to approve that

misjudgment before the appointment can be made. This is

another safety device provided for in the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves under the provisions of

section  6 of the Singapore Industrial Promotion  Board

Ordinance,  1957,  the allocation of  advances  to  the

Singapore  Industrial Promotion Board  up  to  but  not

exceeding  the  sum  of  one million  dollars  for  the

26  of  the  1957  Estimates for  Ecclesiastical

Grants and to whom are such grants payable;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Why provision has not been made for payments to

priests of Islam, Buddhism and other religions.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Provision is made under Head 26:



Contributions  and  Charitable Allowances:  subhead  2:

Ecclesiastical Grants, in the Estimates  for  1957  for

the  purpose  of  a  grant to the  authorities  of  St.

Andrew's  Cathedral. This grant is  of  long  standing.

From  the  earliest days of the Settlement, a  Colonial

Chaplain  was  held on the establishment of  Government

and  provision for his stipend and other  expenses  was

made  under  a  Head  in  the  Colonial  Estimates.  In

addition,  a  contribution was made  to  the  Bishopric

Endowment  Fund. Latterly, the duties of  the  Colonial

Chaplain   were   discharged  by  the   Archdeacon   of

Singapore. In 1930, it was decided to abolish the  post

of  Colonial  Chaplain and to pay an  annual  grant  of

$12,700  to the Cathedral authorities. This  grant  has

remained the same since that date. $3,400 is devoted to

the  Bishopric Endowment Fund and the remainder towards

the stipend of the Archdeacon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It is not the practice to make grants to the

priests  of  other religions. Government has,  however,

made  a  contribution towards the capital cost  of  the

Muslim  College at Klang and supports five scholars  at

the  College. In addition, per capita grants  are  made

from  Head 26: Contributions and Charitable Allowances,

subhead 29: Voluntary Institutions for Children,  to  a

number of institutions run by religious organisations.
